A description of the methods of collecting and synthesizing evidence and formulating and rating recommendations appears in the Background and Recommendations Rating Scheme section. Major section revisions within the last 12 months are as follows: 1. Human Herpesvirus 8 : A new graded recommendation has been added recommending that chemotherapy, along with continuation of ART, be provided to children with Kaposi sarcoma-related immune reconstitution syndrome. This recommendation is based on studies in HIV-infected adults with Kaposi sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution syndrome that found that addition of chemotherapy to ART was associated with reduced mortality compared with ART alone. 2. Microsporidiosis : A graded recommendation has been added recommending use of systemic fumagillin (where available) in addition to ART for microsporidiosis caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Vittaforma corneae . The recommendation for use of oral albendazole in addition to topical fumagillin for keratoconjunctivitis has been limited to infections caused by microsporidia other than Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Vittaforma corneae , because of lack of activity of albendazole against these species.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildreniTable of ContentsSummary.......................................................................................................................................................A-1Background and Recommendations Members.....................................................................................................................CC-1Appendix 3.

The guidelines discuss opportunistic infections that occur in the United States and ones that might be acquired during international travel, such as malaria. A separate document providing recommendations for prevention and treatment of OIs among adults and post-pubertal adolescents living with HIV (Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents ) was prepared by a panel of adult HIV and infectious disease specialists (see http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines ). HIV-related immunodeficiency is a major risk factor for most of the infections that are discussed in this document, and the prevention or reversal of HIV-related immunodeficiency with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a key part of prevention and management of OIs in general. Recommendations for ART in children in the United States are developed and regularly updated by a separate panel of pediatric HIV experts (see Ped ARV Guidelines). In the United States, it has become standard practice for all children with HIV infection to be treated with ART (see What to Start in the Ped ARV Guidelines). Therefore, the Panel has framed its OI prevention and treatment recommendations on the expectation that children are already receiving or preparing to start ART. These guidelines are developed by a panel of specialists in pediatric HIV infection and infectious diseases (the Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children ) from the U.S. government and academic institutions. For each OI, 1 or more pediatric specialists with subject-matter expertise reviews the literature for new information since the last guidelines were published, and then proposes revised recommendations for review by the full Panel. After these reviews and discussions, the guidelines undergo further revision, with review and approval by the Panel, and final review and endorsement by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). After the 2013 full guidelines release, the Panel modified its process so that individual sections would be published as they were updated, allowing for more timely appearance of new recommendations. Each section will be marked with the date of its last update. The Panel's goal is to review each section for updates approximately every 2 years, with shorter intervals in response to availability of new treatments or relevant research findings. So that readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments, each recommendation is rated for the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence supporting that recommendation. After the 2013 guidelines release, the evidence review and recommendation rating system underwent major changes and this new approach is incorporated into sections as they are individually updated. As a result, topics not yet updated since the 2013 release reflect the former rating system, and sections updated since 2013 use a newer, modified GRADE system. A description of the methods of collecting and synthesizing evidence and formulating and rating recommendations appears in the Background and Recommendations Rating Scheme section. Other guideline considerations appearing in Appendix 1 (Important Guidelines Considerations) include a description of the make-up and organizational structure of the Panel, definition and management of conflicts of interest, funding sources for the guidelines, public commentary , and plans for updating the guidelines. The names and financial disclosures for each of the Panel members are listed in Appendices 2 and 3, respectively . An important mode of childhood acquisition of OIs and HIV infection is from infected mothers. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) may be more likely to have coinfections with opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children A-2hepatitis C), and more likely than women who are not HIV-infected to transmit these infections to their infants. In addition, women or other family members living with HIV coinfected with certain opportunistic pathogens, may be more likely to transmit these infections horizontally to their children, resulting in increased likelihood of primary acquisition of such infections in young children. Furthermore, transplacental transfer of antibodies that protect infants against serious infections may be lower in WLHIV than in women who are HIV-uninfected. Therefore, infections with opportunistic pathogens may affect not just infants living with HIV but also infants who were exposed to but not infected by HIV . These guidelines for treating OIs in children, therefore, consider treatment of infections in all children\u2014those living with HIV and those who do not have HIV\u2014born to WLHIV . In addition, HIV infection is increasingly common in adolescents who are long-time survivors of perinatal infection, or who acquired HIV infection as teens. Guidelines for post-pubertal adolescents can be found in the adult OI guidelines, but drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and response to treatment may dif fer in younger adolescents who are prepubertal or in an early stage of puberty. Therefore, these guidelines also apply to treatment of youth living with HIV who have not yet completed pubertal development. The most important recommendations are highlighted in boxed major recommendations preceding each section, and a table of dosing recommendations appears at the end of each section. The guidelines conclude with summary tables that display dosing recommendations for all of the conditions, drug toxicities, and drug interactions, and figures summarizing immunization recommendations. CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and CD4 percentage are well-established measures of immune status in HIV infection. HIV disease stage\u2014and risk of OI\u2014is categorized based on age-specific CD4 counts and CD4 percentages. 2 Note that CD4 thresholds for young children (5 years old) are different from those for older children (6 years old), adolescents and adults (see Table 1). Historically, CD4 percentage was more commonly used in studies of children with HIV infection because CD4 percentages have less age-related variation while CD4 counts normally decline with increasing age; furthermore, studies which characterized OI risk, and evaluated prevention and treatment interventions, were not consistent in the CD4 values they used. As a result, the evidence supporting OI recommendations is presented according to the CD4 values used in the relevant studies, but, in many cases, the recommendations will be adjusted to reflect the current thresholds for CD4-defined HIV disease stage. 2 In addition, if the recommendation is expressed in terms of CD4 count, then a footnote may be used to indicate the corresponding CD4 percentages, and vice-versa. StageAge on date of CD4 test <1 year 1-5 years 6 years Cells/uL % Cells/uL % Cells/uL % 1 1,500 34% primarily on the CD4 count; the CD4 count takes precedence over the CD4 percentage, and the percentage is considered only if the count is missing. If a stage-3-defining opportunistic illness has been diagnosed (see MMWR 2014 Appendix ), then the stage is 3 regardless of CD4 test results. Modified from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 1994 revised classification system for human immunodeficiency virus infection in children less than 13 years of age MMWR 1994;43(No. RR-12); and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Revised Surveillance Case Definition for HIV Infection\u2014United States, 2014. MMWR 2014;63(No. RR-3):1-10. The terminology for describing use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for treatment of HIV infection has been standardized to ensure consistency within the sections of these guidelines. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and its older synonym, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), historically refer to the use of Table 1: HIV infection stage* based on age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count or CD4 percentage of total lymphocytesGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children A-3multiple (generally 3 or more) ARV drugs from different classes as part of an HIV treatment regimen that is designed to achieve virologic suppression. The term ART has been used when referring to use of ARV drugs for HIV treatment more generally, including cART and (mostly historical) use of 1- or 2-agent ARV regimens that do not meet criteria for cART. In these guidelines, we will use ART as the preferred term and only use cART or HAART when necessary for historical purposes. Because treatment of OIs is an evolving science, and availability of new agents or clinical data on existing agents may change therapeutic options and preferences, these recommendations will be periodically updated and will be available at http://AIDSinfo.nih.gov .

OIs continue to be the presenting symptom of HIV infection among children whose HIV-exposure status is unknown, usually because of lack of maternal antenatal HIV testing or unrecognized acquisition of HIV infection during adolescence. For infants and children with known HIV infection, barriers such as inadequate medical care, lack of availability of suppressive ART regimens in the face of extensive prior treatment and drug resistance, caregiver substance abuse or mental illness, and multifactorial adherence difficulties may hinder effective HIV treatment and put them at risk of OIs, even in the ART era. These same barriers may then impede provision of primary or secondary OI prophylaxis to children for whom such prophylaxis is indicated. In addition, concomitant OI prophylactic drugs may only exacerbate the existing difficulties in adhering to ART. Multiple drug-drug interactions between OI, ARV , and other compounds that result in increased frequency of adverse events and decreased treatment efficacy may limit the choice and continuation of both ART and prophylactic regimens. Finally, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), initially described in adults living with HIV but also seen in CLHIV , can complicate treatment of OIs when ART is started or when optimization of a failing regimen is attempted in patients with acute OIs. Thus, prevention and treatment of OIs in CLHIV remain important even in the ART era. History of the Guidelines In 1995, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and IDSA developed guidelines for preventing OIs in adults, adolescents, and children infected with HIV . 6 These guidelines, developed for health-care providers and their patients living with HIV , were revised in 1997, 1999, and 2002.7-9 In 2001, NIH, IDSA, and CDC convened a working group to develop guidelines for treating HIV-associated OIs, with a goal of providing evidence-based guidelines on treatment and prophylaxis. In recognition of unique considerations for infants, children, and adolescents living with HIV\u2014including differences between adults and children in mode of acquisition, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV-related OIs\u2014a separate pediatric OI guidelines writing group was established. The pediatric OI treatment guidelines were initially published in December 2004. 10 In 2009, recommendations for preventing and treating OIs in CLHIV and children exposed to but not infected by HIV were updated and combined into one document; a similar document on preventing and treating OIs among adults living with HIV , prepared by a separate group of adult HIV and infectious disease specialists, was developed at the same time. Both sets of guidelines were prepared by the Opportunistic Infections Working Group under the auspices of the Office of AIDS Research (OAR) of NIH. For the 2013 document and updates since 2013, the Opportunistic Infections Working Group, again under the auspices of OAR, convened a panel of pediatric specialists with expertise in specific OIs. For each section, members of the Panel review the literature since the last publication of that section of prevention and treatment guidelines, confer over several months, and produce draft guidelines. These draft guidelines are revised based on review by the full Panel and review and approval by the core writing group members. The final version is further reviewed by OAR, experts at CDC, the HIVMA of IDSA, the PIDS, and AAP before final approval and publication. These guidelines are a companion to the Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents .11 Clinicians providing care for adolescents are advised to use the Adult and Adolescent guidelines for guidance on the care of post-pubertal adolescents (sexual maturity rating [SMR] IV and V) and to use the Pediatric guidelines for guidance on the care of adolescents at SMR III or lower.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children B-2Treatment of OIs is an evolving science, and availability of new agents or clinical data on existing agents may change therapeutic options and preferences. As a result, these recommendations will need to be periodically updated. Because these guidelines target CLHIV and children exposed to but not infected by HIV in the United States, the opportunistic pathogens discussed are those common to the United States and do not include certain pathogens such as Penicillium marneffei that may be seen almost exclusively outside the United States, that are common but seldom cause chronic infection (e.g., chronic parvovirus B19 infection), or that have the same risk, disease course, and approach to prevention and treatment in all children regardless of HIV status (e.g., streptococcal pharyngitis). The document is organized to provide information about the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of each pathogen. The tables at the end of this document summarize recommendations for dosing of medications used for treatment and prevention of OIs in children ( Tables 1-3), drug preparation and toxicity information for children ( Table 4 ), and drug-drug interactions ( Table 5 ). Vaccination recommendations for HIV-infected children and adolescents are presented in Figures 1 and 2 at the end of the document.Sexual Maturity Rating GIRLS Breast Development Stage Pubic Hair Growth Prepubertal; nipple elevation only 1 Prepubertal; no pubic hair Small, raised breast bud 2 Sparse growth of hair along labia General enlargement of raising of breast and areola 3 Pigmentation, coarsening and curling, with an increase in amount Further enlargement with projection of areola and nipple as secondary mound 4 Hair resembles adult type, but not spread to medial thighs Mature, adult contour, with areola in same contour as breast, and only nipple projecting 5 Adult type and quantity, spread to medial thighs BOYSGenital Development Stage Pubic Hair Growth Prepubertal; no change in size or proportion of testes, scrotum and penis from early childhood 1 Prepubertal; no pubic hair Enlargement of scrotum and testes; reddening and change in texture in skin of scrotum; little or no penis enlargement 2 Sparse growth of hair at base of penis Increase first in length then width of penis; growth of testes and scrotum 3 Darkening, coarsening and curling, increase in amount Enlargement of penis with growth in breadth and development of glans; further growth of testes and scrotum, darkening of scrotal skin 4 Hair resembles adult type, but not spread to medial thighs Adult size and shape genitalia 5 Adult type and quantity, spread to medial thighs Source: Tanner JM.

Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1962Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children B-32013 Rating Scheme for Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Recommendations (Used for all sections last updated in 2013) In 2013, recommendations were rated using the rating system noted in the 2013 Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Recommendations Rating Scheme below. This rating scheme includes explanatory text that reviews the evidence and the panel's assessment. The letters A, B, and C represent the strength of the recommendation for or against a preventive or therapeutic measure and are based on assessing the balance of benefits and risks of adhering compared to not adhering to the recommendation. Roman numerals I, I*, II, II*, and III indicate the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation and are based on study design. Roman numerals with asterisks describe types of evidence where a higher quality of evidence exists for adults compared to children. Strength of Recommendation Rating A\u2014Strong. The benefit associated with adhering to the recommendation nearly always outweighs the risk of not adhering to the recommendation. The recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances and should be adhered to by clinicians unless there exists a compelling rationale for an alternative approach. Strength of Recommendation Rating B\u2014Moderate. The benefit associated with adhering to the recommendation outweighs the risks of not adhering to the recommendation more often than not but not as frequently as a recommendation with an A Rating. The recommendation applies to many patients in some circumstances. Strength of Recommendation Rating C\u2014Optional. It is unclear whether the benefits associated with adhering to the recommendation outweigh the risks of not adhering to the recommendation; other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Quality of Evidence Rating I\u2014Randomized Clinical Trial Data. Quality of Evidence Rating I will be used if there are data from large randomized trials in children with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints. Quality of Evidence Rating I* will be used if there are high-quality randomized clinical trial data in adults with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints and substantial pediatric data from well-designed, non-randomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes that are consistent with the adult studies. A rating of I* may be used for quality of evidence if, for example, a randomized Phase III clinical trial in adults demonstrates a drug is ef fective in AR V-naive patients and data from a non-randomized pediatric trial demonstrate adequate and consistent safety and PK data in the pediatric population. Quality of Evidence Rating II\u2014Non-Randomized Clinical Trials or Observational Cohort Data. In the absence of large, well-designed, pediatric, non-randomized trials or observational data, adult data from high-quality non-randomized clinical trials or observational cohort studies may be used if there are sufficient pediatric data consistent with the adult studies. Quality of Evidence Rating II will be used if there are data from well-designed, non-randomized trials or observational cohorts in children. Quality of Evidence Rating II* will be used if there are well-designed, non-randomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with supporting and consistent information from smaller non-randomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data in children. A rating of II* may be used for quality of evidence if, for example, a large observational study in adults demonstrates clinical benefit to initiating treatment at a certain CD4 cell count and data from smaller observational studies in children indicate that a similar CD4 count is associated with clinical benefit. Quality of Evidence Rating III\u2014Expert Opinion. Where neither clinical trial nor observational data exist, we rely on expert opinion.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children B-4Modified GRADE Process for Evidence Review and Recommendation Formulation and Rating Beginning in 2015, the Pediatric OI Guidelines adopted a \"modified GRADE\" approach for the evidence review and formulation of recommendations to make the process more systematic and transparent and to be responsive to requests from our endorsing organizations to have a more systematic, standardized approach. For more background about guidelines development from IDSA, see the IDSA Handbook on Clinical Practice Guideline Development . (A) Modified Grade Process for Evidence Review for Pediatric OI Guideline Recommendations 1. Expert authors make a list of recommendations/topics to consider for recommendations in the revision. 2. Each potential recommendation is turned into a \"PICO\" question. PICO questions specify Population of interest, Intervention being considered, Comparison intervention or condition, and Outcomes of interest. For example: Would treatment of [population] children with HIV infection with [intervention] intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), [comparison] compared to no IVIG, prevent [outcomes] serious bacterial infections or death? 3. A systematic literature review is conducted to assemble the available evidence that pertains to the PICO question. In collaboration with an NIH librarian, a literature search is conducted using a standardized \"search strategy.\" The initial literature search in 2015 extended back to January 2013 and has been updated thereafter with new publications from the search strategy about every 6 months. Peer - reviewed literature is preferred for evidence but meeting abstracts can be used on a case-by-case basis.Strength of Recommendation Quality of Evidence for Recommendation A: Strong recommendation for the statement B: Moderate recommendation for the statementC: Optional recommendation for the statementI: One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints I*: One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes II: One or more well-designed, non-randomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long-term clinical outcomes II*: One or more well-designed, non-randomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more smaller nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data III: Expert opin ionPediatric Opportunistic Infections Recommendations Rating Scheme Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies lim ited to post-pubertal adolescents Note: In circumstances where there is level I or level II evidence from studies in adults with accompanying data in children that come only from small, non-randomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcomes, experts assigned a rating of I* or II*, respectively , if they judged the evidence from children sufficient to support findings from adult studies. In circumstances where there is level I or level II evidence from studies in adults with no or almost no accompanying data in children, experts assigned a rating of III.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children B-54. For each PICO question, the evidence is reviewed and the quality of the evidence rated in a TABLE. The template for these Tables is provided below. These tables will be posted on the Guidelines website, with links from the corresponding OI section, but will not be integrated into the OI section document. These tables will make it easier for readers to understand the sources and quality of underlying evidence that supports the recommendations. Note: If there is high-quality evidence from clinical trials that informs a recommendation, observational and smaller studies can be omitted from the summary table. Note: If an evidence-based guideline (e.g., by CDC or IDSA) has already made a rated recommendation that applies to children with HIV infection, then that existing guideline can be referenced without repeating the evidence review and summary. a. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which the confidence in findings is adequate to support a particular recommendation. GRADE offers 4 levels for the quality of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. b. The quality of evidence is determined by the following process: i. Basic study design: randomized, controlled trials generally start as high quality; observational studies start as low quality (moderate, if large and well-designed). ii. Quality is downgraded for risk of bias, imprecise estimates, inconsistency , and indirectness (including evidence from adult studies applied to children). iii. Quality is upgraded for large ef fect size and dose-response gradient, or if likely biases would reduce apparent effect. 5. The text of the recommendation is composed. Each PICO question should have at least 1 recommendation (unless the conclusion following evidence review is that a recommendation was not warranted). Recommendations are written with unambiguous language and clearly defined terms. Information that contains areas of uncertainty or controversy is documented within the recommendation. Specific sub-population variability and exceptions are noted in the recommendations. Note: For strong recommendations, appropriate wording is \"recommend\" or \"should\" and for weak recommendations, \"suggest\" or \"consider.\" 6. The recommendation is assigned a strength: strong or weak. The strength of recommendation reflects the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable consequences of an intervention outweigh the undesirable ones. 7. An overall rating of quality of evidence is assigned: high, moderate, low, and very low. This rating is based on the evidence reviewed in the Table, which may contain studies of varying quality. Note: If an evidence-based guideline (e.g., by CDC or IDSA) has already made a rated recommendation that applies to children with HIV infection, then the recommendation and its same/analogous rating are taken from the other guideline. 8. A brief overall narrative is written that synthesizes how the available evidence supports the recommendation. This narrative is based on the evidence Table with an effort to avoid repeating detailed descriptions of each study. When multiple trials have yielded similar, non-controversial results, a single sentence with appropriate references may suffice. Long, descriptive paragraphs of the methodology and findings of individual trials are discouraged. This narrative will appear in the body of the document, immediately after the recommendation. Note: If an evidence-based guideline (e.g., by CDC or IDSA) has already made a rated recommendation that applies to children with HIV infection, there will be one sentence that indicates that the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children B-6recommendation is based on the review and assessment of the guideline used. 9.

Vaccination schedules forchildren aged 0 to 18 years are published annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (seehttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/child-adolescent.html). These schedules are compiled fromapproved, vaccine-specific policy recommendations and are standardized among the major vaccine policy-setting and vaccine-delivery organizations (i.e., the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP],American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians).HIV-infected children should be protected from vaccine-preventable diseases. Most vaccines recommendedfor routine use can be administered safely to HIV-exposed or HIV-infected children. The recommendedvaccination schedules for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children aged 0 to 18 years correspond to theACIP-approved schedule with ACIP-approved additions specific to HIV-infected children incorporated (seeFigures 1and 2). These schedules will be updated periodically to reflect additional ACIP-approved vaccinerecommendations that pertain to HIV-exposed or orpolysaccharide protein-conjugate\u2014can be administered safely to individuals with alteredimmunocompetence. In addition, because of the risks of increased vaccine-preventable disease severity inHIV-infected children, specific vaccines like pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are also recommended orencouraged for children beyond the routinely recommended ages for healthy children (if not previouslyadministered at routinely recommended ages in early childhood); additional vaccines are also recommended,such as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for children aged 2 years following receipt of pneumococcalconjugate vaccine. Similarly, before influenza vaccination was routinely recommended for children aged 6months, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) was routinely recommended for HIV-infected children because oftheir increased risk of severe disease. TIV continues to be recommended for HIV-infected children as part ofroutine prevention for influenza.1If inactivated vaccines are indicated for individuals with alteredimmunocompetence, the usual doses and schedules are often recommended. However, the effectiveness ofsuch vaccinations may be suboptimal.2Patients with severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency should not receive live-attenuated vaccines. However,HIV-infected children are at higher risk than immunocompetent children for complications of varicella,herpes zoster, and measles\u2014diseases for which only live vaccines are available. On the basis of limitedsafety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data in HIV-infected children, varicella vaccine can be considered forHIV-infected children who are not severely immunosuppressed (i.e., children with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4)cell percentages >15% and those aged >5 years with counts 200 cells/\u00b5L).2-4Two doses of measles,mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are recommended for all HIV-infected individuals aged 12 monthswho do not have evidence of current severe immunosuppression (i.e., individuals aged 5 years must haveCD4 percentages 15% for 6 months and those aged >5 years must have CD4 percentages 15% and CD4cell counts 200 lymphocytes/mm3for 6 months) or other current evidence of MMR immunity.5Limited data are available from clinical trials on the safety of rotavirus vaccines in infants known to be HIV-infected; these infants were clinically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic when vaccinated.6The limiteddata available do not indicate that rotavirus vaccines have a substantially different safety profile in HIV-infected infants who are clinically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic than in infants who areHIV-uninfected. Two other considerations support rotavirus vaccination of HIV-exposed or HIV-infectedinfants: first, the HIV diagnosis may not be established in infants born to HIV-infected mothers before theage of the first rotavirus vaccine dose (only about 2% of HIV-exposed infants in the United States will bedetermined to be HIV-infected);7and second, vaccine strains of rotavirus are considerably attenuated.Consultation with an immunologist or infectious disease specialist is advised for infants with known orGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenC-2suspected altered immunocompetence, such as HIV-infected infants low CD4 percentage or number,before rotavirus vaccine is administered.For certain vaccines (such as Hepatitis A) the response to vaccination may be higher following combinationantiretroviral therapy (cART)8or there may be variation in immunogenicity on the basis of viral load(improved immune response with lower HIV viral load), such as with yellow fever vaccine.9For othervaccines, patients with higher CD4 cell counts have improved immune response, which also means thatresponse (e.g., to vaccination for influenza, MMR, yellow fever) likely would be improved after cART.1,3,9,10For children vaccinated before taking cART, there is concern about lack of protection from pre-cARTvaccines and debate about need for routine re-immunization once on effective cART.10,11On the basis of lowrates of measles seroprotection in children who received MMR before cART and the safety and high rates ofmeasles seroprotection associated with MMR re-immunization once children were receiving cART,12theACIP made specific recommendations for routine MMR re-immunization after cART. Individuals withperinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated prior to establishment of effective cART should receive twoappropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective cART has been established (individuals aged 5years must have CD4 percentages 15% for 6 months and those aged >5 years must have CD4 percentages15% and CD4 cell count 200 lymphocytes/mm3for 6 months) unless they have other acceptable currentevidence of MMR immunity.5For some vaccines, such as for hepatitis B, ACIP recommends performingpost-vaccination serology to ensure immune response.

Other serious bacterial infections,including osteomyelitis, meningitis, abscess, and septic arthritis, occurred at rates <0.2 per 100 child-years.Less serious bacterial infections such as otitis media and sinusitis were particularly common (17-85 per 100child-years) in untreated HIV-infected children.2Since the advent of cART, bacterial infections in HIV-infected children have decreased substantially,3,4andpredominate in children who have not had a sustained response to cART.3The rate of pneumonia has decreasedto 2 to 3 per 100 child-years,4-7similar to the rate of 3 to 5 per 100 child-years in HIV-uninfected children.8,9The rate of bacteremia/sepsis during the cART era also has decreased dramatically to 0.35 to 0.37 per 100child-years,5,6,10but it remains substantially higher than that of invasive pneumococcal disease in U.S. children(0.018 and 0.0022 per 100 child years for those aged <5 and 5-17-year-olds, respectively).11Rates of sinusitisand otitis in cART-treated children are substantially lower than in the pre-cART era (2.9-3.5 per 100 child-years), but remain higher than those in HIV-uninfected children.6Panel's RecommendationsStatus of vaccination should be reviewed at every clinical encounter and indicated vaccinations provided, according to theestablished recommendations for immunization of HIV-infected children (AIII).Routine use of antibiotics solely for primary prevention of serious bacterial infections is not recommended (BIII).Discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for HIV-infected children receiving antibiotics for the purpose ofprimary or secondary prophylaxis of serious bacterial infections once they have achieved sustained (3 months) immunereconstitution: (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] and CD4 count >350cells/mm3if 6 years old) (BII).Intravenous immune globulin is recommended to prevent serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children who havehypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <400 mg/dL) (AI).HIV-infected children whose immune systems are not seriously compromised (CDC Immunologic Category I) and who are notneutropenic can be expected to respond the same as HIV-uninfected children and should be treated with the usual antimicrobialagents recommended for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII).Severely immunocompromised HIV-infected children with invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiricantimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms (AIII).Initial empiric therapy for HIV-infected children with suspected intravascular catheter sepsis should target both gram-positiveand enteric gram-negative organisms, with combinations that have activity against and methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) (AIII).

In a study inSouth African children who had not received Hib conjugate vaccine, the estimated relative annual rate ofoverall invasive Hib disease in children aged <1 year was 5.9 times greater in those who were HIV-infectedthan those who were uninfected, and HIV-infected children were at greater risk for bacteremic pneumonia.28Hib infection is rare in HIV-infected children in the United States because routine Hib immunization confersdirect protection to immunized HIV-infected children and herd immunity confers indirect protection.29Neisseria meningitidis (Meningococcus) HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease.30,31In a population-based studyof invasive meningococcal disease in Atlanta, Georgia,31as expected, the annual rate of disease was higher in18- to 24-year-olds (1.17 per 100,000) than for all adults (0.5 per 100,000), but the estimated annual rate inHIV-infected adults was substantially higher (11.2 per 100,000). There are no studies of meningococcaldisease risk in HIV-infected children in the United States. However, in a population-based surveillance studyin South Africa, HIV infection significantly increased the risk of meningococcal bacteremia, which wasassociated with increased risk of death in all ages, but especially in children. Very few HIV-infected patientswere receiving cART at the time of this study.30Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) HIV infection appears to be a risk factor for MRSA infections in adults, but findings are conflicting about therelative contribution of immunosuppression vs. concomitant psychosocial risk factors to this increased risk.32-34Limited data suggest that HIV-infected children, like their uninfected counterparts, experience predominantlynon-invasive, skin, and soft tissue infections as a result of community-associated MRSA strains and that greaterimmunosuppression may not confer greater risk of MRSA.35Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In and HIV-Infected ChildrenD-3Other PathogensOther HIV-infectedchildren, especially those who have indwelling vascular catheters or advanced immunosuppression or are not oncART.19,29,36,37The most commonly isolated pathogens in catheter-associated bacteremia in HIV-infectedchildren are similar to those in HIV-negative children with indwelling catheters, including of 680 HIV-infected children in Miami, Florida, 10.6% had 95 episodes of gram-negativebacteremia between 1980 and 1997, of which only 6 were associated with an indwelling vascular catheter. Thepredominant organisms than70% and the overall case-fatality rate was 43%. In Kenyan children withbacteremia, HIV infection increased the risk of non-typhoidal Salmonellaand E. coliinfections.36HIV-Exposed (but Uninfected) ChildrenData are conflicting about whether infectious morbidity increases in children who have been exposed to but notinfected with HIV . In studies in developing countries, HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) infants had highermortality (primarily because of bacterial pneumonia and sepsis) than did those born to uninfected mothers.38,39Advanced maternal HIV infection was associated with increased risk of infant death.38,39In a study in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, 60% of 462 HEU infants experienced infectious disease morbidity during the first6 months of life, with the rate of neonatal infections (particularly sepsis) and respiratory infections higher thanrates in comparable community-based studies.40However, in a study from the United States, the rate of lowerrespiratory tract infections in HEU children was within the range reported for healthy children during the firstyear of life.41There is increasing evidence for insufficient maternally derived antibody levels in HEU infantsthat put those infants at increased risk of pneumococcal and other vaccine-preventable infections.42Clinical Manifestations Clinical presentation depends on the particular type of bacterial infection (e.g., bacteremia/sepsis,osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis/otitis media);43HIV-infected children withinvasive bacterial infections typically have a clinical presentation similar to HIV-uninfected children.21,44,45The classical signs, symptoms, and laboratory test abnormalities that usually indicate invasive bacterialinfection (e.g., fever, elevated white blood cell count) are usually present but may be lacking in HIV-infectedchildren who have reduced immune competence.21,43One-third of HIV-infected children not receiving cARTwho have acute pneumonia have recurrent episodes.12Bronchiectasis and other chronic lung damage thatoccurs before initiation of cART can predispose to recurrent pulmonary infections, even in the presence ofeffective cART.14Lower respiratory bacterial infections in children with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis(LIP) most often are a result of the same bacterial pathogens that cause lower respiratory infection in HIV-infected children without LIP and manifests as fever, increased sputum production, and respiratory difficultysuperimposed on chronic pulmonary symptoms and radiologic abnormalities.46In studies in Malawi and South Africa before the availability of cART, the clinical presentations of acutebacterial meningitis in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children were similar.47,48However, in a study fromMalawi, HIV-infected children were 6.4-fold more likely to have repeated episodes of meningitis than wereHIV-uninfected children, although the study did not differentiate relapses from new infections.47In bothstudies, HIV-infected children were more likely to die from meningitis than were HIV-uninfected children. Diagnosis Attempted isolation of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid,pleural fluid) is strongly recommended, as identification and antimicrobial resistance testing will guideeffective treatment. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenD-4Because of difficulties obtaining appropriate specimens, such as sputum, from young children, bacterialpneumonia most often isa presumptive diagnosis in children with fever, pulmonary symptoms, and anabnormal chest radiograph, unless an accompanying bacteremia exists. In the absence of a laboratory isolate,differentiating viral from bacterial pneumonia using clinical criteria can be difficult.8Mycobacteriumtuberculosis(TB) and Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP) must always be considered in HIV-infectedchildren with pneumonia. Presence of wheezing makes acute bacterial pneumonia less likely than othercauses (e.g., viral pathogens, asthma exacerbation), atypical bacterial pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasmapneumoniae), or aspiration. Children with LIP often have episodes of bacterial respiratory infectionsuperimposed on chronic wheezing. Sputum induction obtained by nebulization with hypertonic (5%) salinewas evaluated for diagnosis of pneumonia in 210 South African infants and children (median age: 6 months),66% of whom were HIV-infected.49The procedure was well-tolerated, and identified an etiology in 63% ofchildren with pneumonia (identification of bacteria in 101, TB in 19, and PCP in 12 children). Blood andfluid from pleural effusion (if present) should be cultured.In children with bacteremia, a source should be sought. In addition to routine chest radiographs, otherdiagnostic radiologic evaluations may be necessary in HIV-infected children with compromised immunesystems to identify less apparent foci of infection (e.g., bronchiectasis, internal organ abscesses).50-52Inchildren with suspected bacteremia and central venous catheters, blood culture should be obtained throughthe catheter and (if possible) peripherally; if the catheter is removed because of suspected infection, thecatheter tip should be sent for culture.53Assays for detection of bacterial antigens or evidence by molecularbiology techniques are important for diagnostic evaluation of HIV-infected children in whom unusualpathogens may be involved or difficult to identify or culture with standard techniques. For example,detection of Bordetella pertussisand Chlamydophila (formerly Chlamydia)pneumoniaewith polymerasechain reaction assays of nasopharyngeal secretions aid in the diagnosis of these infections.8,54,55Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureBecause S. pneumoniaeand H. influenzae(other than type b) are common in the community, no effectiveway exists to eliminate exposure to these bacteria. However, routine use of conjugated pneumococcal(initially 7-valent and, more recently 13-valent) and Hib vaccines in the United States has dramaticallyreduced vaccine-type nasopharyngeal colonization in healthy children, thus limiting the exposure of HIV-infected children to these pathogens (herd immunity). Food To reduce the risk of exposure to potential GI bacterial pathogens, health-care providers should advise thatHIV-infected children avoid eating the following raw or undercooked foods (including other foods that containthem): eggs, poultry, meat, seafood (especially raw shellfish), and raw seed sprouts (BIII). Unpasteurized dairyproducts and unpasteurized fruit juices also should be avoided (BIII). Of particular concern to HIV-infectedinfants and children is the potential for caretakers to handle these raw foods (e.g., during meal preparation) andthen unknowingly transfer bacteria from their hands to children's food, milk or formula, or directly to thechildren. Hands, cutting boards, counters, and knives and other utensils should be washed thoroughly aftercontact with uncooked foods (BIII). Produce should be washed thoroughly before being eaten (BIII). Theseprecautions are especially important for children who are not receiving effective cART.PetsWhen obtaining a new pet, caregivers should avoid dogs or cats aged <6 months or stray animals (BIII).HIV-infected children and adults should avoid contact with any animals that have diarrhea and should alwayswash their hands after handling pets, especially before eating, and avoid contact with pets' feces (BIII). HIV-infected children should avoid contact with reptiles (e.g., snakes, lizards, iguanas, turtles) and with chicksGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenD-5and ducklings (as well as their uncooked eggs) because of the risk of salmonellosis (BIII). These precautionsare especially important for children who are not receiving effective cART.Travel The risk of foodborne and waterborne infections in immunosuppressed, HIV-infected persons is magnifiedduring travel to resource-limited settings. All children who travel to such settings should avoid foods andbeverages that might be contaminated, including raw fruits and vegetables, raw or undercooked seafood ormeat, tap water, ice made with tap water, unpasteurized milk and dairy products, and items sold by streetvendors (AIII). Foods and beverages that are usually safe include steaming hot foods, fruits that are peeledby the traveler, bottled (including carbonated) beverages, and water brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute.Treatment of water with iodine or chlorine may not be as effective as boiling and will not eliminateCryptosporidiabut can be used when boiling is not practical. These precautions are especially important forchildren who are not receiving effective cART.Preventing DiseaseImmunizationIn addition to cART, one of the most important interventions to prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infectedchildren is to ensure that they are immunized according to the HIV-specific recommended schedule (Figures1 and 2) (AII). Vaccines that protect against bacterial pathogens directly (e.g., pneumococcal, Hib,meningococcal, pertussis) and indirectly (e.g., influenza) have been demonstrated safe and immunogenic inHIV-infected children.56-60HIV-infected children are at increased risk of under-immunization.61Status ofvaccination against Hib, pneumococcus, meningococcus, pertussis, influenza, and all recommended vaccinesshould be reviewed at every clinical encounter and indicated vaccinations provided, according to theestablished recommendations for immunization of HIV-infected children (AIII). Effective cART institutedbefore immunization offers the best means to optimize response to immunization.62Lack of effective cARTmay reduce the magnitude, quality or duration of immunologic response and likely impairs memoryresponse. Greater number or strength of vaccine doses are recommended in some circumstances to overcomesuboptimal response. Evidence is mounting that protective immunity to vaccine-preventable disease islacking in a high proportion of perinatally HIV-infected children who received many of their immunizationsbefore the availability of effective cART.63These data suggest that HIV-infected children may benefit fromassessment of seroprotection and/or re-immunization for certain vaccines. Hib VaccineHEU and HIV-infected infants and children aged 5 years should receive Hib vaccine on the same scheduleas that recommended for healthy infants, including for catch-up immunization (AII). (Figure 1). Hib vaccineis recommended for routine administration to infants aged 2, 4, and 6 months (6-month dose not needed ifPRP-OMP Hib conjugate vaccine used for 2- and 4-month doses), and 12 to 15 months; 1 to 3 doses arerecommended for previously unvaccinated infants and children aged 7 to 23 months depending on age at firstvaccination. Health-care providers should consider use of Hib vaccine for HIV-infected children aged 5years who have not previously received Hib vaccine (AIII). For these older children, a single dose of anyHib conjugate vaccine is recommended.64Pneumococcal VaccinesHEU and HIV-infected infants and children aged 2 to 59 months should receive the 13-valent pneumococcalvaccine (PCV13) on the same schedule as that recommended for healthy infants and children, includingseries completion for those who initiated immunization with PCV7 (AII).23,65,66A 4-dose series of PCV13 isrecommended for routine administration to infants aged 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months; 2 or 3 doses arerecommended for previously unvaccinated infants and children aged 7 to 23 months depending on age at firstvaccination.64Incompletely vaccinated children aged 24 to 71 months should receive 1 dose of PCV13 if 3doses of PCV (7 or 13) were received previously, or 2 doses of PCV13 8 weeks apart if <3 doses of PCV (7Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenD-6or 13) were received previously. Children who have received a complete series of PCV7 should receive asupplemental dose of PCV13 if they are aged 14 through 71 months. In addition, HIV-infected children aged2 years should receive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) (2 months after their lastPCV dose), with a single revaccination with PPSV 5 years later (AII).57,64Data are limited regarding efficacyof PCV7 or PCV13 for children aged 6 years who are at high risk of pneumococcal infection. However, theU.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved expanded use of PCV13 for children aged 6 to 17years.67In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices (ACIP) recently recommended that a single dose of PCV13 be routinelyadministered to children aged 6 years through 18 years with immunocompromising conditions who have notpreviously received PCV13.68Therefore, a single dose of PCV13 should be routinely administered to HIV-infected children aged 6 through 18 years who did not receive PCV13 before age 6 years64(Figures 1 and 2).A multicenter study of pneumococcal vaccination in a group of HIV-infected children not administered PCVduring infancy demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of 2 doses of PCV7 followed by one dose ofPPSV for cART-treated HIV-infected children aged 2 to 19 years (including some who had previouslyreceived pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination [PPSV]).57Based on this study, some experts recommendgiving 2 doses of PCV13 to HIV-infected children aged 6 years who never received PCV7 or PCV13 (BII).PPSV may be offered 8 weeks after PCV13 in children aged 6 to 18 years who received a PCV13 dose afterhaving received PPSV (CII).57The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was substantially lower inHIV-infected vaccine recipients in a placebo-controlled trial of a nine-valent PCV in South African children(most whom were not receiving antiretroviral therapy), but vaccine efficacy was somewhat lower in HIV-infected (65%) than HIV-uninfected children (85%).66Meningococcal VaccineLike should routinely receive meningococcal conjugate vaccine(MCV) at age 11 to 12 years and again at age 16 (AII). In contrast to the 1-dose primary series for healthychildren, the primary series of MCV for all HIV-infected children aged 9 months is 2 MCV doses at least 2months apart for children aged 2 to 10 years, and 2 to 3 months apart for children aged 9 to 23 months inorder to improve rates of seroprotection (AII).64,69-71HIV-infected children aged 9 months to 10 years whohave evidence of splenic dysfunction or complement deficiency or who plan to travel to high-incidence areasshould receive the primary MCV series (AIII). While ACIP does not list HIV infection as a specificindication for MCV , some experts give MCV to all HIV-infected children aged 9 months to 10 years becauseof the potentially increased risk of meningococcal disease (CIII). HIV-infected children who receive theirprimary MCV series at ages 9 months to 10 years and who are at ongoing increased risk of meningococcalexposure should receive another MCV dose 3 years later (if primary MCV immunization was at ages 9months to 6 years) or 5 years later (if primary MCV immunization was at 7 years) (AIII).64MCV should berepeated every 5 years in children with splenic dysfunction or complement deficiency for as long as theirsplenic dysfunction persists (AIII). Influenza VaccineBecause influenza increases the risk of secondary bacterial respiratory infections,72annual influenzavaccination for influenza prevention can be expected to reduce the risk of serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children (BIII)(Figures 1 and 2).73HIV-infected children should receive annual influenzavaccination according to the HIV-specific recommended immunization schedule (AII).60,64ChemoprophylaxisTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) administered daily for PCP prophylaxis may decrease the rateof serious bacterial infections (predominantly respiratory) in HIV-infected children unable to take cART(BII).16,74Atovaquone combined with azithromycin, which provides prophylaxis for Mycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC) as well as PCP, is well tolerated and as effective as TMP-SMX in preventing seriousbacterial infections in HIV-infected children.75However, routine use of antibiotics solely for primaryGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenD-7prevention of serious bacterial infections (i.e., when not indicated for PCP or MAC prophylaxis or otherspecific reasons) promotes development of drug-resistant organisms and is not routinely recommended(BIII). Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is recommended to prevent serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children who have hypogammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G <400 mg/dL) (AI).15Discontinuation Primary ProphylaxisThe Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) 1008 demonstrated that discontinuation of MAC and/orPCP antibiotic prophylaxis in HIV-infected children who achieved sustained (16 weeks) immunereconstitution (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell percentage >20% to 25%) while receiving ART did not resultin excessive rates of serious bacterial infections.6HIV-infected children who are receiving an antibiotic forthe purpose of primary prevention of serious bacterial infections should discontinue antibiotic prophylaxisonce they have achieved sustained (i.e., 3 months) immune reconstitution (CD4 percentage 25% years) (BII).Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseThe principles for treating serious bacterial infections are the same in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfectedchildren. Specimens for microbiologic studies should be collected before initiation of antibiotic treatment.However, in patients with suspected serious bacterial infections, therapy should be administered empiricallyand promptly without waiting for results of such studies; therapy can be adjusted once results becomeavailable. The local prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (e.g., penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae,MRSA) and the recent use of prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics should be considered when initiatingempiric therapy. When the organism is identified, antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed, andsubsequent therapy based on the results of susceptibility testing (AIII).HIV-infected children whose immune systems are not seriously compromised (CDC Immunologic CategoryI)76and who are not neutropenic can be expected to respond similarly to HIV-uninfected children and shouldbe treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild to moderatecommunity-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected children with only mild or no immunosuppression who arefully immunized (especially against S. pneumoniaeand Hib) and who are receiving effective cART can betreated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin), according to the same guidelines as for healthychildren (BIII).76However, many experts have a lower threshold for hospitalizing these children to initiatetreatment. In addition, broader-spectrum antimicrobial agents for initial empiric therapy are sometimeschosen because of the potentially higher risk of non-susceptible pneumococcal infections in HIV-infectedchildren.17,22,24,25Thus, options for empiric therapy for HIV-infected children outside of the neonatal periodwho are hospitalized for suspected community-acquired bacteremia or ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) (AIII).8,77,78The addition ofvancomycin or other antibiotic for suspected bacterial meningitis should follow the same guidelines as forHIV-uninfected children.79The addition of azithromycin or other macrolide can be considered forhospitalized patients with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M.pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., >10%) in thecommunity, aged >8 years) orvancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns).80-82Neutropenic children alsoshould be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug with consideration for adding anaminoglycoside if infection with Pseudomonasspp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised HIV-infectedchildren with invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatmentcovering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pendingresults of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).Initial empiric therapy for HIV-infected children with suspected intravascular catheter sepsis should targetGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenD-8both gram-positive and enteric gram-negative organisms, with combinations that include agents with anti-Pseudomonasactivity and vancomycin, which is active against MRSA (AIII). Factors such as response totherapy, clinical status, identification of pathogen, and need for ongoing vascular access will determine theneed for and timing of catheter removal.Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)The response to appropriate antibiotic therapy should be similar in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfectedchildren, with a clinical response usually observed within 2 to 3 days after initiation of appropriateantibiotics, recognizing that radiologic improvement in patients with pneumonia may lag behind clinicalresponse. Whereas HIV-infected adults experience high rates of adverse and even treatment-limitingreactions to TMP-SMX, in HIV-infected children, serious adverse reactions to TMP-SMX appear to bemuch less of a problem.84Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has not clearly been described in association withtreatment of bacterial infections in children. Reports of pneumonia, abscess and other bacterial infection inchildren during the first several weeks of effective cART have been attributed to IRIS85,86but are more likelyrelated to persistent immune suppression. Suspicion of IRIS in a child being treated for a bacterial infectionshould raise concern for the presence of a different or additional infection or for inadequately treatedinfection mimicking IRIS. Preventing Recurrence Status of vaccination against Hib, pneumococcus, meningococcus, and influenza should be reviewed andupdated, according to the recommendations outlined in the section Preventing First Episode of Disease anddepicted in the immunization recommendation schedules (Figures 1 and 2) (AIII).TMP-SMX (administered daily for PCP prophylaxis) and azithromycin or atovaquone-azithromycin(administered for MAC prophylaxis) also may reduce the incidence of serious bacterial infections in childrenwith recurrent serious bacterial infections. Administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to HIV-infectedchildren who have frequent recurrences of serious bacterial infections despite cART (e.g., >2 seriousbacterial infections in a 1-year period despite cART) can be considered (CIII); however, caution is requiredwhen using antibiotics solely to prevent recurrence of serious bacterial infections because of the potential fordevelopment of drug-resistant microorganisms and drug toxicity. In rare situations in which cART andantibiotic prophylaxis are not effective in preventing frequent recurrent serious bacterial infections, IVIGprophylaxis can be considered for secondary prophylaxis (CI).15Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisPACTG 1008 demonstrated that discontinuing MAC and/or PCP antibiotic prophylaxis in HIV-infectedchildren who achieved sustained (i.e., 16 weeks) immune reconstitution (CD4 percentage >20% to 25%)while receiving cART did not result in excessive rates of serious bacterial infections.6Antibiotics forsecondary prophylaxis of serious bacterial infections should be discontinued in HIV-infected children whohave achieved sustained (i.e., 3 months) immune reconstitution (CD4 percentage 25% if 6 years Lindsey JC, Levin MJ, Pediatric ACTGPT.

Examples of localizedcandidiasis include oropharyngeal and esophageal disease, vulvovaginitis, and diaper dermatitis. Once theorganism penetrates the mucosal surface and widespread hematogenous ensues. This andhepatosplenic 85% of HIV-infected children. Oropharyngeal candidiasis(OPC) continues to be one of the most frequent opportunistic infections in HIV-infected children during thePanel's Recommendations Uncomplicated oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) infection can be effectively treated with topical therapy using clotrimazoletroches or nystatin suspension (AII). Oral fluconazole is recommended for moderate or severe OPC disease (AI*). For fluconazole-refractory OPC, itraconazole oral solution is recommended, although it is less well tolerated than fluconazole (AI). If OPC initially is treated topically, failure or relapse should be treated with oral fluconazole or itraconazole oral solution (AI*). Systemic therapy is essential for esophageal disease (AI*). Oral or intravenous fluconazole, micafungin, anidulafungin), administered for14 to 21 days, is effective for treatment of Candida esophagitis (AI*). For fluconazole-refractory esophageal disease, oral therapy can include itraconazole solution or voriconazole (AIII). Central venous catheters should always be removed when feasible in HIV-infected children with candidemia (AII). In severely ill children with candidemia, an echinocandin is recommended. In less severely ill children who have not had previousazole therapy, fluconazole is an alternative therapy (AI*). For patients infected with Candida glabrataor Candida krusei, an Candida parapsilosis, fluconazole or amphotericin B is recommended (AII*). Alternatively, an initial course of amphotericin B therapy can be administered for invasive candidiasis and then carefully followedby completion of a course of fluconazole therapy (BIII). Data are insufficient to support routine use of combination antifungal therapy in children with invasive candidiasis (BIII). The potential for drug interactions, particularly with antiretroviral drugs such as protease inhibitors, should be carefully evaluatedbefore initiation of antifungal therapy (AIII). Amphotericin B lipid formulations have a role in children who are intolerant of conventional amphotericin B (deoxycholate) or areat high risk of nephrotoxicity because of preexisting renal disease or use of other nephrotoxic drugs (BII). Children with candidemia should be treated for at least 14 days after documented clearance of Candida from the last positiveblood culture and resolution of neutropenia and of clinical signs and symptoms of candidemia (AII*).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-2combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era (28% of children), with an incidence rate of 0.93 per 100child-years.1The incidence of esophageal or tracheobronchial candidiasis has decreased from 1.2 per 100child-years before the pre-cART era to 0.08 per 100 child-years during the cART era (2001-2004).2However, Candidaesophagitis continues to be seen in children who are not responding to antiretroviraltherapy.3,4Children who develop esophageal candidiasis despite cART may be less likely to have typicalsymptoms (e.g., odynophagia, retrosternal pain) or have concomitant OPC5; during the pre-cART era,concomitant OPC occurred in 94% of children with for esophagealcandidiasis include low CD4 T lymphocyte candidiasis in HIV-infected children, theesophagus particularly 12% of HIV-infected children with chronically indwelling centralvenous catheters for total parental nutrition or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.4,7Candidaalbicansis the mostcommon cause of mucosal, esophageal, and invasive candidiasis, but approximately 50% of reported cases ofCandidabloodstream infections in HIV-infected children because several areresistant to fluconazole and other antifungals. In one study of Cambodian HIV-infected children on cARTwho had candidiasis, seven (75%) of nine isolated C. glabratawere resistant to fluconazole, and three (40%)of seven C. parapsilosisisolated were resistant to more than three azole agents.8Species-specificepidemiology also varies widely by geographic location and hospital. Many children who developcandidemia have received systemically absorbed oral antifungal azole compounds (e.g., ketoconazole,fluconazole) for control of oral and esophageal candidiasis, which may predispose to resistant isolates.4Clinical ManifestationsClinical manifestations of OPC vary and include erythematous (atrophic),hyperplastic (hypertrophic), and angular cheilitis. creamy white, curd-like patches withinflamed underlying mucosa that is exposed after removal of the exudate. It can be found on theoropharyngeal mucosa, palate, and tonsils. Erythematous OPC lesionson the mucosal surface. Hyperplastic candidiasis comprises raised white plaques on the lower surface of thetongue, palate, and buccal mucosa and cannot be removed. Angular cheilitis occurs as red fissured lesions inthe corners of the mouth.Esophageal candidiasis often presents with odynophagia, dysphagia, or retrosternal pain, and unlike adults,many children experience nausea and vomiting. Therefore, children with esophageal candidiasis may presentwith dehydration and weight loss. Evidence of OPC can be absent in children with esophageal candidiasis,particularly those receiving cART.New-onset fever in an HIV-infected child with advanced disease and a central venous catheter is the mostcommon clinical manifestation of candidemia. Renal candidiasis presents with candiduria andultrasonographically demonstrated renal parenchymal lesions, often without symptoms related to renal disease.4Diagnosis Oral candidiasis can be diagnosed with a potassium hydroxide preparation and culture with microscopicdemonstration of budding yeast cells in wet mounts or biopsy specimens. Esophageal candidiasis has a classiccobblestoning appearance on barium swallow. Findings on endoscopy may range from few, small, white, raisedplaques to elevated confluent plaques with hyperemia and extensive ulceration. Endoscopy is also helpful forruling out CMV , and blood cultures using lysis-centrifugation techniques4or automated broth-Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-3based systems.9When candidemia is abdominal computed tomography or ultrasound for hepatic or renalinvolvement, and bone scans for osteomyelitis (if suspected by symptoms) should be considered.New diagnostic techniques such as the urine D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol ratio,10,11serum D-arabinitol/creatinineratio,12,13Candidaantigen mannan,14,15(1,3)-beta-D-gulcan assay,16,17and real-time polymerase chainreaction18,19are promising diagnostic alternatives under development for early diagnosis of invasivecandidiasis. Although several of these assays are helpful in diagnosing adult patients, none of them have beenvalidated for use in children.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureCandidaorganisms are common commensals on mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals, and no measuresare available to reduce exposure to these fungi except reducing exposure to unneeded antibiotic exposure thatmay predispose to Candidacolonization.Preventing First Episode of DiseaseRoutine primary prophylaxis of candidiasis in HIV-infected infants and children is not indicated, given thelow prevalence of serious Candidainfections (e.g., esophageal, tracheobronchial, disseminated) during thecART era and the availability of effective treatment. Concerns exist about the potential for resistant Candidastrains, drug interactions between antifungal and antiretroviral (ARV) agents, and lack of randomizedcontrolled trials in children.20Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNot applicable.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseOropharyngeal CandidiasisEarly, uncomplicated infection can with topical therapy using clotrimazole troches ororal nystatin suspension for 7 to 14 days (BII).21-24Debridement can be considered as adjunctive therapy inOPC. Resistance to clotrimazole can develop as a consequence of previous exposure to clotrimazole itself orto other azole drugs; resistance correlates with refractory mucosal candidiasis.25Systemic with 1 of the oral azoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole) for 7 to 14 days is recommendedfor moderate to severe OPC.21-23Oral fluconazole is more effective than nystatin suspension for initialtreatment of OPC in infants, easier to administer to children than the topical therapies, and the recommendedtreatment if systemic therapy is used (AI*).22,26For fluconazole-refractory OPC, itraconazole oral solution should be used. Itraconazole solution has efficacycomparable to fluconazole and can be used to treat OPC, although it is less well tolerated than fluconazole(AI).27Gastric acid enhances absorption of itraconazole solution; itraconazole solution should be takenwithout food when possible. Itraconazole capsules and oral solution should not be used interchangeablybecause, at the same dose, drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with capsules and absorptionof the capsule formulation varies. Ketoconazole absorption also varies, and therefore neither itraconazolecapsules nor ketoconazole are recommended for treating OPC if fluconazole itraconazole areavailable if therapy is usually unnecessary for HIV-infected patients (AI*).Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-4Esophageal DiseaseSystemic therapy is essential for esophageal disease (AI*)and should be initiated empirically in HIV-infected children who have OPC and esophageal symptoms. In most patients, symptoms should resolvewithin days after the start of effective therapy. Oral fluconazole for 14 to 21 days is recommended highlyeffective for treatment of Candidaesophagitis (AI*).21,28IV fluconazole, amphotericin B, or an echinocandinshould be used for patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy. For fluconazole-refractory disease, itraconazolesolution, voriconazole, amphotericin B, or an echinocandin are alternatives. Suppressive therapy withfluconazole three times weekly is recommended for recurrent infections.Invasive DiseaseCentral venous catheters should always be removed when feasible in HIV-infected children with candidemia(AI).4,29Among children with persistent candidemia despite appropriate therapy, investigation for a deeptissue focus of infection, such as with echocardiogram, renal or abdominal ultrasound, should be conducted.The treatment of choice for invasive disease in HIV-infected children depends on severity of disease,previous azole exposure, and Candidaisolate obtained (if known). An echinocandin is recommended formost severely ill children with candidiasis because of the fungicidal nature of these agents as well as the lackof adverse events (AI*). Fluconazole is a reasonable alternative for patients who are less critically ill andwho have no recent fluconazole exposure. V oriconazole can be used in situations in which mold coverage isalso warranted. For infections with C. glabrata, an echinocandin is recommended because of the increasingresistance seen against fluconazole for this species (AII). However, for patients already receivingfluconazole or voriconazole who are clinically improving despite C. glabratainfection, continuing use of theazole is reasonable. In addition, infection with C. kruseishould be treated with an echinocandin because ofthe inherent resistance to fluconazole. Amphotericin B is an effective but less attractive alternative (BII).Amphotericin B lipid formulations have a role in children who are intolerant of conventional amphotericin B(deoxycholate), have disseminated candidal infection that is refractory to conventional amphotericin B, orare at high risk of nephrotoxicity because of preexisting renal disease or use of other nephrotoxic drugs(BII). For infection with C. parapsilosis, fluconazole or amphotericin B is recommended (AII)because ofdata showing a decreased response from this species to the echinocandins.30However, if a patient isreceiving empiric therapy with an echinocandin and showing clinical improvement when culture of C.parapsilosisreturns, continuing with this therapy is reasonable. Recommended duration of therapy forcandidemia is 14 days after documented clearance from the blood and resolution of neutropenia and ofclinical signs and symptoms of candidemia. Conventional amphotericin B (sodium deoxycholate complex) pharmacokinetics (PK) in children are verysimilar to adults. In children who have azotemia or hyperkalemia or who are receiving high doses (1mg/kg), a longer infusion time of 3 to 6 hours is recommended (BIII).31In children with life-threateningdisease, the target daily dose of amphotericin B should be administered from the beginning of therapy (BIII).Flucytosine has been used in combination with amphotericin B in some children with severe invasivecandidiasis, particularly in those with central nervous system disease (CIII), but it has a narrow therapeuticindex and should no longer be used for this purpose.Fluconazole PK vary significantly with age, and fluconazole is rapidly cleared in children. Daily fluconazoledose needs to be 6 to 12 mg/kg daily for children, and treatment of invasive candidiasis requires higher dosesof fluconazole than are used for mucocutaneous disease. Alternatively, an initial course of amphotericin Bcan be administered and then carefully followed by completion of a course of fluconazole therapy (BIII).Species identification is necessary when using fluconazole because of intrinsic drug resistance among certainCandidaspp. (e.g., C. krusei, C. glabrata). Because of more rapid clearance in children, fluconazoleadministered to children at 12 mg/kg/day provides exposure similar to standard 400-mg daily dosing inadults. Dosing of fluconazole for invasive candidiasis in children and adolescents should generally notexceed 600 mg/day.32Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-5Itraconazole oral solution provides levels lower than those seen in adults; therefore, dosing should be 2.5 mg/kg per dose twice daily. (BII*). Experience with voriconazole in children is growing, both in dosing and efficacy, including esophagealcandidiasis or candidemia.3,21,33,34Usually children are started on voriconazole IV and then switched to oraladministration to complete therapy after stabilization. The optimal pediatric dose of voriconazole is higherthan used in adults due to differing PK. V oriconazole has been shown to be tolerated to a similar degreeregardless of dosage and age; a dosage approaching 8 mg/kg in children aged 2 to 11 years was needed toattain voriconazole plasma levels achieved in adults with a 4-mg/kg IV dosage. Also, the oral bioavailabilityof voriconazole in children compared to adults is lower, therefore there is a need for higher weight-adjustedoral dosages than dosages used for IV therapy.33,34The recommended voriconazole dosage for children is 9mg/kg every 12 hours IV loading on day 1, followed by 8 mg/kg IV every 12 hours. Conversion to oralvoriconazole should be at 9 mg/kg orally every 12 hours (BII).35In addition, therapeutic voriconazole druglevels should be monitored because of significant interpatient variation in PK of voriconazole in childrenwith depends allelic ofCYP2C19, resulting in poor and extensive metabolizers of voriconazole.37,38For example, it is estimated that15% to 20% of Asian compared with 3% to 5% of Caucasian and African populations are poor metabolizers,further underscoring the importance of monitoring voriconazole levels to ensure proper dosing.37Data from studies using echinocandins including caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin are nowsufficient to recommend these agents as alternatives to fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis and as first-line therapy for disseminated candidiasis (AII).39-53Caspofungin was effective in treating candidemia, renalcandidiasis, and endocardial infection in 10 infants, including 1 term and 9 premature infant(s) who wereunresponsive to or intolerant study of caspofungin inimmunocompromised HIV-uninfected children 2 to 17 years demonstrated that 50 mg/m2body surfacearea/day (70 mg/day maximum) provides comparable exposure to that obtained in adults receiving a standard50-mg daily regimen.41A retrospective report in which caspofungin was administered to 20 children aged16 years who had invasive fungal infections (seven had invasive candidiasis) but not HIV infection, foundthe drug to be efficacious and well tolerated.42In a prospective open-label study of children aged 6 months to17 years, primary or salvage treatment with caspofungin was well tolerated and successful in 81% ofCandidainfections, including 30 of 37 patients with invasive candidiasis, and 1 of 1 patient with esophagealcandidiasis.43The first pediatric randomized controlled liposomal amphotericin B with caspofungin in children aged 2 to 12 years with cancer,neutropenia, and persistent fever, found comparable efficacy between the 2 treatment arms.44Micafungin has been studied in children treated with 2 to 4 mg/kg daily, but neonates require doses as highas 10 to 12 mg/kg daily (AII).45-49Micafungin demonstrates dose-proportional PK and an inverserelationship between age and clearance, suggesting a need for increased dosage in young children.50Clearance of the drug in neonates was more than double that in older children and adults.51Dosages of 10 to15 mg/kg/day have been studied in premature neonates, resulting in area-under-the-curve values consistentwith an adult dosage of 100 to 150 mg/day. In a clinical trial comparing micafungin versus liposomalamphotericin B(L-AmB) using an intent-to-treat analysis of children and adults with candidiasis/candidemiaand with or without cancer, 42 children with or without neutropenia (13 with malignancies/29 withoutmalignancies) received 2 mg/kg/day of Micafungin was as effectiveas L-AmB in treating candidiasis/candidemia and well tolerated in these patients.49One PK study of anidulafungin in 25 HIV-uninfected neutropenic children aged 2 to 17 years, including 12aged 2 to 11 years and 13 aged 12 to 17 years, showed drug concentrations at 0.75 mg/kg per dose and 1.5mg/kg per dose were similar to drug concentrations in adults with 50 mg per dose and 100 mg per dose,respectively.52In a case report of a term 11-day infant with peritoneal candidiasis and failure of L-AmBtherapy, an IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day of anidulafungin was successful in treating the infection.53Data in adults are limited on use of combination antifungal therapy for invasive candidal infections;Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-6combination amphotericin B and fluconazole resulted in more rapid clearance of Candidafrom thebloodstream but no difference in mortality.21Data are insufficient to support routine use of combinationtherapy in children with invasive candidiasis (BIII).54Monitoring and Adverse Events, Including IRISNo adverse effects have been reported with use of oral nystatin for treatment of oral candidiasis, but bittertaste may contribute to poor adherence.The azole drugs have relatively low rates of toxicity, but because of their ability to inhibit the cytochromeP450 (CYP450)-dependent hepatic enzymes (ketoconazole has the strongest inhibitory effect) and theirmetabolism by these enzymes, they can interact substantially with other drugs undergoing hepaticmetabolism. These interactions can result in decreased plasma concentration of the azole because ofincreased metabolism induced by the co-administered drug or development of unexpected toxicity from theco-administered drug because of increased plasma concentrations secondary to azole-induced alterations inhepatic metabolism. The potential for drug interactions, particularly with ARV drugs such as proteaseinhibitors, should be carefully evaluated before initiation of therapy (AIII).The most frequent adverse effects of the azole drugs are gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting(10%-40% of patients). Skin rash and pruritus can occur with all azoles; rare cases of Stevens-Johnsonsyndrome and alopecia have been reported with fluconazole therapy. All drugs are associated withasymptomatic increases in transaminases (1%-13% of patients). Hematologic abnormalities have and leukopenia. Of the azoles, ketoconazole isassociated with the highest frequency of side effects. Its use has been associated with endocrinologicabnormalities related to steroid metabolism, including adrenal insufficiency and gynecomastia, hemolyticanemia, and transaminitis. Dose-related, reversible visual changes such as photophobia and blurry visionhave been reported in approximately 30% of patients receiving voriconazole.55Cardiac arrhythmias and renalabnormalities including nephritis and acute tubular necrosis also have been reported with voriconazole use.Amphotericin B deoxycholate undergoes renal excretion as inactive drug. Adverse effects of amphotericin Bare primarily nephrotoxicity, defined by substantial azotemia from glomerular damage, and can beaccompanied by hypokalemia from tubular damage. Nephrotoxicity is exacerbated by use of concomitantnephrotoxic drugs. Permanent nephrotoxicity is related to cumulative dose. Nephrotoxicity can beameliorated by hydration before amphotericin B infusion. Infusion-related fevers, chills, nausea, andvomiting occur less frequently in children than in adults. Onset occurs usually within 1 to 3 hours after theinfusion is started, typical duration is <1 hour, and the febrile reactions tend to decrease in frequency overtime. Pre-treatment with acetaminophen or diphenhydramine may alleviate febrile reactions. Idiosyncraticreactions, such as arrhythmias, allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, occur lessfrequently. Hepatic toxicity, thrombophlebitis, anemia, and rarely neurotoxicity (manifested as confusion ordelirium, hearing loss, blurred vision, or seizures) also can occur.Lipid formulations of amphotericin B have less acute and chronic toxicity than amphotericin B deoxycholate.In approximately 20% of children, lipid formulations of amphotericin B can cause acute, infusion-relatedreactions, including chest pain; dyspnea; hypoxia; severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or leg; or flushing andurticaria. Compared with infusion reactions with conventional amphotericin B, most (85%) of the reactionsto the lipid formulations occur within the first 5 minutes after infusion and rapidly resolve with temporaryinterruption of the amphotericin B infusion and administration of IV diphenhydramine. Premedication withdiphenhydramine can reduce the incidence of these reactions.The echinocandins have an excellent safety profile. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 immunocompromisedchildren who received caspofungin, the drug was well tolerated, although 3 patients had adverse eventspotentially related to the drug (hypokalemia in all 3 children, elevated bilirubin in 2, and decreasedhemoglobin and elevated alanine aminotransferase in 1).41In this study, children weighing <50 kg received0.8 to 1.6 mg/kg body weight daily, and those weighing >50 kg received the adult dosage. In the PK study ofGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-739 children who received caspofungin at 50 surface area/day, 5 (13%) patients experienced oneor more drug-related clinical adverse events, including 1 patient each with fever, diarrhea, phlebitis,proteinuria, and transient extremity rash. Two patients reported one or more drug-related laboratory adverseevents, including one patient each with hypokalemia and increased serum aspartate transaminase. None ofthe drug-related adverse events in this study were considered serious or led to discontinuation ofcaspofungin.41In a prospective multicenter trial for primary or salvage treatment of Candidaand Aspergillusinfections in 48 children aged 6 months to 17 years, a caspofungin dose of 50 mg/m2per day (maximum: 70mg/day; after 70 mg/m2on day 1) was generally well tolerated with drug-related clinical and laboratoryadverse events occurring in 26.5% and 34.7% of patients, respectively, similar to rates seen in adults. Drug-related clinical adverse events were typically mild and did not lead to therapy discontinuation. An increasedlevel of hepatic transaminase, often occurring in the context of other medical conditions or concomitanttherapies that may have contributed to elevations in hepatic enzymes, represented the most common drug-related laboratory adverse event. None of the drug-related laboratory adverse events led to therapyinterruption or discontinuation.43In a randomized (L-amB) in 48children aged <16 years with clinical signs of systemic Candidainfection or culture confirmation of Candidainfection, a micafungin daily dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight for patients who weighed 40 kg and 100 mgfor patients who weighed >40 kg was well tolerated. Adverse events were similar for both treatment armsand reflected those experienced by patients with comorbid conditions. These included sepsis, fever,vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia. Patients in the micafungin groupexperienced significantly fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than those in theamphotericin B group (2/25 [3.8%] versus 9/54 [16.7%], respectively), suggesting a safety advantage formicafungin in this population. Two patients receiving micafungin experienced serious adverse events,including a worsening of renal failure, a preexisting condition, and a moderate increase in serum creatineresulting in discontinuation of therapy. Patients rarely experienced clinically meaningful changes increatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or bilirubin during treatment. Children aged 2years in the micafungin treatment arm experienced a smaller mean peak decrease in the estimated glomerularfiltration rate than those in the L-amB arm.46A multicenter, ascending-dosage study of anidulafungin in children aged 2 to17 years showed anidulafungin to be well tolerated and observed no drug-related serious adverse events.Fever was observed in one patient with a National Cancer Institute toxicity grade of 3 and facial erythemawas observed in another patient, which resolved after slowing the infusion rate.52Immune reconstitution inflammatory response syndrome associated with Candidainfection has not beendescribed in HIV-infected children. However, evidence suggests that candidiasis (other than Candidaesophagitis) occurs with increased frequency in adults during the first 2 months after initiation of cART.56Managing Treatment FailureOropharyngeal and Esophageal CandidiasisIf OPC initially is treated topically, failure or relapse should be treated with oral fluconazole or itraconazoleoral solution (AI*).27,57Approximately 50% to 60% of patients fluconazole-refractory OPC and 80% of patients withfluconazole-refractory esophageal candidiasis itraconazole solution (AII*).58,59Posaconazoleis a second-generation orally bioavailable triazole that has been effective in HIV-infected adults with azole-refractory OPC or esophageal candidiasis.60However, experience in children is limited, and an appropriatepediatric dosage has not been defined; thus data in children are insufficient to recommend its use in HIV-infected children (CIII).61,62Amphotericin B (oral suspension at 1 mL four times daily of a 100-mg/mL suspension) sometimes has beenGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenE-8effective in patients with OPC who do not respond to itraconazole solution; however, this product is notavailable in the United States (CIII).59Low-dose IV amphotericin B (0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day) has refractory OPC or esophageal candidiasis (BII).21,59,63,64Experience is limited with use of echinocandins in treatment of azole-refractory OPC or esophagealcandidiasis in children (HIV-infected or -uninfected); however, given their excellent safety profile, theechinocandins61could be considered for treatment of azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis (BIII).Invasive DiseaseAlthough lipid formulations appear to be at least as effective as conventional amphotericin B for treatingserious fungal infections,65,66the drugs are considerably more expensive than conventional amphotericin B.However, the lipid formulations have less acute and chronic toxicity. Two lipid formulations are used:amphotericin B lipid complex and liposomal amphotericin B lipid complex. Experience with thesepreparations in children is limited.67-69For invasive candidiasis, amphotericin B lipid complex is administered as 5 mg/kg body weight IV oncedaily over 2 hours.67,68,70Liposomal amphotericin B is administered IV as 3 to 5 mg/kg body weight oncedaily over 1 to 2 hours. The role of the echinocandins in invasive candidiasis has not been well studied inHIV-infected children. However, invasive candidiasis associated with neutropenia in patients undergoingbone marrow transplantation has been treated successfully with this class of antifungals. These agents shouldbe considered in treatment of invasive candidiasis but reserved as alternative, second-line therapy tocurrently available treatment modalities (CIII).Preventing RecurrenceSecondary prophylaxis of recurrent OPC usually is not recommended because treatment of recurrence istypically effective, potential exists for development of resistance and drug interactions, and additional roundsof prophylaxis are costly (BIII).Immune reconstitution with cART in immunocompromised children shouldbe a priority (AIII). However, if recurrences are severe, data from studies of HIV-infected adults withadvanced disease on cART suggest that suppressive therapy with systemic azoles, either with oralfluconazole (BII*)or voriconazole or itraconazole solution (BII), can be considered.27,71-73Potential azoleresistance should be considered when long-term prophylaxis with azoles is used.Experience with HIV-infected adults suggests that, in children with fluconazole-refractory OPC oresophageal candidiasis who responded to voriconazole or posaconazole therapy or to echinocandins,continuing the effective drug as secondary prophylaxis can be considered because of the high relapse rateuntil cART produces immune reconstitution (BIII).Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisIn situations when secondary prophylaxis is instituted, no data exist on which to base a recommendationregarding discontinuation. On the basis of experience with HIV-infected adults with other opportunisticinfections, discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis can be considered when a patient's CD4 count orpercentage has risen to CDC Immunologic Category 2 or 1 (CIII).74References1.Gona P, Van Dyke RB, Williams PL, et al.

C. immitisappears to be confined mainly to California; C. posadasiiis more widely distributedthrough the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and Central and South America. Clinical illnessescaused by each are indistinguishable. Infection usually results from inhalation of spores (arthroconidia)produced by the mycelial form which grows in arid, windy environments with hot summers preceded by rainyseasons.3,4,5,6Infection that occurs in non-endemic regions usually results from either re-activation of a previousinfection or from acquisition during travel to an endemic region.7Contaminated fomites, such as dusty clothingor agricultural products,8also have been implicated as infrequent sources of infection.9Most illnesses are primary infections with rates governed by both environmental conditions that are conduciveto fungal growth and to activities/conditions that predispose to inhalation of spores. Increased infection rateshave been attributed to population shifts to endemic regions, climatic conditions, and better recognition.10-12Areview of hospitalizations for coccidioidomycosis at children's hospitals from 2002 to 2006 found an increasedincidence in 2005 to 2006, especially among patients with comorbid conditions.13Panel's Recommendations Routine use of antifungal medications for primary prophylaxis of coccidioidal infections in children is not recommended (BIII). Diffuse pulmonary or disseminated infection (not involving the central nervous system) should be treated initially withamphotericin B (AII*). After completion of amphotericin B, treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole should begin (BIII).Alternatively, some experts initiate therapy with amphotericin B combined with a triazole, such as fluconazole, in patients withdisseminated disease and continue the triazole after amphotericin B is stopped (BIII). There is no evidence that lipid preparations of amphotericin are more effective than amphotericin B deoxycholate for thetreatment of coccidioidomycosis. Lipid preparations are often preferred because they are better tolerated and associated withless nephrotoxicity than amphotericin B deoxycholate (AII*). For patients with mild disease (e.g., focal pneumonia), monotherapy with fluconazole or itraconazole is appropriate (BII*). Itraconazole is preferred for treatment of skeletal infections (AII*). Because absorption of itraconazole varies from patient to patient, serum concentrations should be measured to ensure effective,non-toxic levels of drug, monitor drug levels following changes in dosage, and assess compliance (BIII). Amphotericin B preparations are not the drugs of choice for treating coccidioidal meningitis; fluconazole is the preferred suppression (secondary prophylaxis) fluconazole or itraconazole is recommended for treating HIV-infected children after disseminated, diffuse pulmonary, and/or meningeal coccidioidomycosis (AII*), even if immunereconstitution is achieved with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Lifelong secondary prophylaxis should be consideredfor children with mild disease and CD4 T lymphocyte cell count <250 cells/mm3or <15%, Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenF-2Impairment of cellular immunity is a major risk factor for severe primary coccidioidomycosis or relapse ofpast infection. In HIV-infected adults, both localized pneumonia and disseminated infection usually areobserved in individuals with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <250 cells/mm3.14,15The threshold forincreased in HIV-infected children has not been established; systemic fungal infection has occurredwhen CD4 counts were 100 cells/mm3and with CD4 percentages <15%, both indicative of severeimmunosuppression.16,17Although no cases of coccidioidomycosis were reported in HIV-infected childrenenrolled in the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study, the study sites under-representedgeographic regions in which coccidioidomycosis is endemic.18Women who acquire coccidioidomycosis latein pregnancy are at risk of dissemination, but infection in their infants is infrequent.19Infections in infantsusually result from inhalation of spores in the environment. In adults, combination antiretroviral therapy(cART) appears to be responsible for the declining incidence and severity of coccidioidomycosis.20,21Dataare limited in children.Clinical ManifestationsCoccidioidal infection can range from a mild, self-limited, flu-like illness to more severe, focal ordisseminated illness, including pneumonia, bone and joint infection and meningitis. Immunocompromisedindividuals and previously healthy blacks, Hispanics, and Filipinos with coccidioidomycosis are at increasedrisk of dissemination, as are pregnant women who acquire coccidioidal infection during the second or thirdtrimester22or the postpartum period.23,24The severity of clinical manifestations in HIV-infected adults variesin direct proportion to the degree of immunocompromise. Diffuse pulmonary infection and extrathoracicdissemination have been associated with decreased CD4 counts, increased HIV RNA levels, and lowerlikelihood of having received potent antiretroviral therapy (ART).21Focal pneumonitis can occur in mild tomoderately immunocompromised patients.15,24Pleural coccidioidal antibody-seropositive, HIV-infected individual is at risk ofserious disease, with the degree of severity inversely proportional to absolute CD4 counts <250/mm3. Boneand joint involvement is rare in HIV-infected patients.20,26Children with primary pulmonary infection may present with fever, malaise, and chest pain. The presence ofcough varies, and hemoptysis is rare. Persistent fever may be a symptom of extrathoracic dissemination.Children with meningitis may present with headaches, altered sensorium, vomiting, and/or focal neurologicdeficits.27-29Fever is sometimes absent, and meningismus occurs in only 50% of patients. Hydrocephaluscomplicating basilar inflammation27,30occurs most (83%-100%) nodules, plaques or ulcers,24,32peritonitis, and liver abnormalities alsomay accompany disseminated disease.DiagnosisBecause signs and symptoms are non-specific, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis should be among thoseconsidered in patients who reside in or have visited endemic areas.25,33Culture, microscopy, and serologyhave been the methods used for diagnosis, but newer tests, including coccidioidal galactomannan antigendetection in urine,1,34are especially useful for diagnosis in hosts. Polymerase chainreaction (PCR) assays that target specific coccidioidal genes have been developed but are not yetcommercially available.35,36In patients with meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows moderate elevated proteinconcentration, and pleocytosis with a predominance of mononuclear cells. CSF eosinophilia may also bepresent. The of distinctive spherules containing endospores in histopathologic tissue37or otherclinical specimens is diagnostic. Stains of CSF in patients with meningitis usually are negative.Pyogranulomatous inflammation with endosporulating spherules is seen in affected tissue specimens withhaematoxylin and eosin. Spherules can also be observed methenamine silvernitrate, and periodic acid-Schiff stains. Cytologic stains are less reliable for diagnosing pulmonaryGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenF-3coccidioidomycosis, and a negative cytologic stain on a clinical respiratory specimen may not exclude activepulmonary coccidioidomycosis.26Potassium hydroxide stains are less sensitive and should not be used.26Growth of Coccidioidesspp. is supported by many conventional laboratory media used for fungal isolation;growth may occur within 5 days at 30\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C.26Blood cultures are positive in <15% of cases; CSFcultures are positive in <50% of children with meningitis.24,26,38Cultures of respiratory specimens are oftenpositive in adults with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. The laboratory should be alerted to clinical suspicionof coccidioidal infection so that specimens can be handled in secure and contained fashion to minimizehazards to laboratory personnel. Serologic assays, performed by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA), immunodiffusion, or classical tubeprecipitin or complement fixation methodology that measure coccidioidal Immunoglobulin M (IgM) andImmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody are valuable aids in diagnosis39but may be falsely negative inimmunocompromised hosts. Presence of IgM-specific coccidioidal antibody suggests active or recentinfection although, in instances in which IgG-specific antibody is absent, data are conflicting about potentialfalse positives.40,41IgG-specific antibody appears later and persists for 6 to 8 months. A commercial EIAappears more sensitive than the older tube precipitin and complement fixation tests and the immunodiffusionassays, although concern remains about specificity.42The EIA, however, is not quantitative.24Assays forcoccidioidal antibody in serum or body fluids such as CSF provide diagnostic and prognostic information.Cross-reactivity can occur with other endemic mycoses. IgG-specific antibody titers often becomeundetectable in several months if the infection resolves. The diagnosis of meningitis is established with eithera positive CSF culture or detection of IgG-specific antibody in CSF. Serial testing36following at least a 2-week interval may be needed to demonstrate this. Antibody titers decline during effective therapy. ACoccidiodesEIA has been developed that detects and quantifies coccidioidal galactomannan concentrationsin urine samples34,43,44and is especially useful in serious infections and/or instances in which antibody isundetectable. Dissociation of immune complexes has increased the sensitivity of detection of coccidioidalantigen in serum.44Meningitis has been diagnosed using real-time PCR analysis of CSF.36Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureHIV-infected patients who reside in or visit regions in which coccidioidomycosis is endemic cannotcompletely avoid exposure to Coccidioidesspp., but risk can be reduced by avoiding activities and/orexposure to sites that may predispose to inhalation of spores. These include disturbing contaminated soil,archaeological excavation, and being outdoors during dust storms. If such activities are unavoidable, use ofhigh-efficiency respiratory filtration devices should be considered.36Preventing First Episode of DiseaseNo prospective studies have been published that examine the role of prophylaxis to prevent development ofactive coccidioidomycosis in patients without previous (recognized) episodes of coccidioidomycosis.Although some experts would provide prophylaxis with an azole (fluconazole) to coccidioidal antibody-positive HIV-infected patients living in regions with endemic coccidioidomycosis, others would not.26Chemoprophylaxis is used for coccidioidal antibody-positive HIV-infected living in endemic areas andwith CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3.45,46However, given the low incidence of coccidioidomycosis in HIV-infected children, the potential for drug interactions, potential for development of antifungal drug resistance,and the cost, the routine use of antifungal medications for primary prophylaxis of coccidioidal infections inchildren is not recommended (BIII). Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNot applicable.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenF-4Treatment Recommendations Treating DiseaseIn patients with HIV infection, effective cART, if not being administered at the time of diagnosis ofcoccidioidomycosis, should be started in concert with initiation of antifungal agents. Treatment protocols that arerecommended for HIV-infected children are based on experience in nonrandomized, open-label studies in adults.Physicians who infrequently treat children with coccidioidomycosis should consider consulting with experts.Antifungal therapy had been a recommendation for all HIV-infected adults with clinically active, mildcoccidioidomycosis.47More recently, treatment protocols appropriate for patients who are HIV-uninfected havebeen suggested47for HIV-infected adults reliably receiving potent ART and who have CD4 counts >250 cells/mm3.46That would include patients with mild infections that are not accompanied by signs suggestive ofdissemination, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, or meningitis. In this setting, patients should be closely monitoredto ensure compliance with ART, effective HIV suppression, and maintenance of CD4 counts >250 cells/mm3.Management should also include education directed at reducing the probability of re-exposure to coccidioidalspores. In children, absent comparable published experience in this setting, expert consultation should be soughtand, if treatment is elected, recommendations should be based upon assurance of continued compliance withART, confirmation of continued HIV suppression, CD4 counts >250/mm3, education directed at decreasing thelikelihood of exposure to coccidioidal spores, and close medical follow up.For patients with mild, non-meningitic disease (e.g., focal pneumonitis), monotherapy with fluconazole oritraconazole is appropriate given their twice the first 3 days, followed thereafter by 2-5 mg/kg per dose twice daily) are alternatives to amphotericin B for childrenwho have mild, non-meningitic disease (BIII). In a randomized, double-blind trial in equivalent for treating non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis. Itraconazole (5 mg/kg bodyweight dose twice daily) appeared to be more effective than fluconazole for treating skeletal infections (AII*).48Severely ill patients with diffuse pneumonia and/or other signs of probable disseminated infection (notinvolving the CNS) are initially treated with an amphotericin B preparation because these appear to evoke afaster therapeutic response than do the azoles.49,50Although there is no evidence that the lipid preparationsare more effective than amphotericin B deoxycholate, lipid formulations often are used because they arebetter tolerated (AIII). The length of amphotericin B therapy is governed by both the severity of initialsymptoms and the pace of the clinical improvement. Thereafter, amphotericin B is stopped and treatmentwith fluconazole or itraconazole begun (BIII). Some experts initiate therapy with both amphotericin B and atriazole, such as fluconazole, in patients with severe disseminated disease and continue the triazole afteramphotericin B is stopped (BIII).26,48The total duration of therapy should be 1 year.26Meningitis is a life-threatening manifestation of coccidioidomycosis and consultation with experts should beconsidered (BIII). Successful treatment requires an antifungal agent that achieves effective concentrations inCSF. Intravenous amphotericin B achieves poor CSF concentrations and is therefore not recommended fortreating coccidioidal meningitis (AIII). The relative safety and comparatively superior ability of fluconazole topenetrate the blood-brain barrier have made it the treatment of choice for coccidioidal meningitis (AII*). Aneffective dose of fluconazole in adults is 400 mg/day, but some experts begin therapy with 800 to 1000mg/day.47Children usually receive 12 mg/kg/dose once daily (800 mg/day maximum) (AII*).51,52The 12 mg/kgdosage may be required to attain serum concentrations equivalent to those in adults receiving 400 mg/day.53Some experts would begin at a dose of 15 to 23 mg/kg/day.24Successful therapy with posaconazole54andvoriconazole has been described in adults but there is no published experience in children.55Some experts useamphotericin B administered intrathecally50,56in addition to an azole. Intrathecal amphotericin administrationadds additional toxicity and is not used as part of initial therapy (CIII). Despite the benefits afforded by theazoles for treating meningitis, a retrospective analysis of outcomes in adults treated for coccidioidal meningitisin the pre-azole (earlier than 1980) compared with outcomes in the azole era found that a similar percentageGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenF-5developed serious complications, including stroke and hydrocephalus; risk factors for acquiring coccidioidalmeningitis in the azole era included immunocompromised state, with one-third of patients in this group havingHIV/AIDS.28Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) In addition to monitoring patients for clinical improvement, some experts26have recommended monitoringcoccidioidal IgG antibody titers to assess response to therapy. Titers should be obtained every 12 weeks (AIII).If therapy is succeeding, titers should decrease progressively; a rise in titers suggests recurrence of clinicaldisease. However, if serologic tests initially were negative, titers during effective therapy may increase brieflyand then decrease.26This lag in response during the first 2 months of therapy should not necessarily beconstrued as treatment failure.Adverse effects of amphotericin B are primarily those associated with nephrotoxicity. Infusion-related fevers,chills, nausea, and vomiting also can occur, although they are less frequent in children than in adults. Lipidformulations of amphotericin B have lower rates of nephrotoxicity. Hepatic toxicity, thrombophlebitis,anemia, and rarely neurotoxicity (manifested as confusion or delirium, hearing loss, blurred vision, orseizures) also can occur (see discussion on monitoring and adverse events in Candidainfection). Intrathecalinjection of amphotericin B may result in arachnoiditis.57,58Triazoles can interact with other drugs metabolized by CYP450-dependent hepatic enzymes,59,60and thepotential for drug interactions should be assessed before initiation of therapy (AIII). Use of fluconazole oritraconazole appears to be safe in combination with ART. V oriconazole should be avoided in patientsreceiving protease inhibitors transcriptase inhibitors.15The most frequentadverse effects of fluconazole are nausea and vomiting. Skin rash and pruritus may be observed, and cases ofStevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Asymptomatic increases in transaminases occur in 1% to13% of patients receiving azole drugs. In HIV-infected patients, fluconazole at high doses can cause adrenalinsufficiency.62Because absorption of itraconazole varies from patient to patient, serum concentrations should be measuredto ensure effective, non-toxic levels of drug, monitor changes in dosage, and assess compliance (BIII).Coccidioidomycosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome following the initiation ofART has not been reported in children and is rarely reported in adults.63Managing Treatment FailureThe treatment of coccidioidomycosis unresponsive to standard therapy has been reviewed; the majority ofexperience has been in adults.55Posaconazole was effective in 6 adults with disease refractory to treatmentwith other azoles and to amphotericin B64and has been used successfully in 73% of 15 adults whoseinfections were refractory to previous therapy.65Posaconazole has also been effective for chronic refractorymeningitis unresponsive to fluconazole.54V oriconazole was effective in treating coccidioidal meningitis andnon-meningeal disseminated disease in adults who did not respond to fluconazole or were intolerant ofamphotericin B.66,67,68Monotherapy with caspofungin successfully treated disseminated coccidioidomycosisin a renal transplant patient intolerant of fluconazole and other adults in whom conventional therapyfailed.69,70Others have used caspofungin in combination with fluconazole.71Adjunctive interferon-gamma (IFN-)72was successfully used in a critically ill adult with respiratory failurewho did not respond to amphotericin B preparations and fluconazole.73However, no controlled clinical studiesor data exist for children; thus, adjunctive IFN- is not recommended for use in HIV-infected children (BIII).In instances in which patients with coccidioidal meningitis fail to respond to treatment with azoles, bothsystemic amphotericin B and direct instillation of amphotericin B into the intrathecal, ventricular, orintracisternal spaces, with or without concomitant azole treatment, have been used successfully. Theseregimens are recommended in such instances (AIII).48,52The basilar inflammation that characteristicallyGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenF-6accompanies coccidioidal meningitis often results in obstructive hydrocephalus requiring placement of a CSFshunt. Thus, development of hydrocephalus in coccidioidal meningitis does not necessarily indicatetreatment failure. Response rates with the azoles can be excellent, but cures are infrequent. Relapse aftercessation of therapy is common, occurring in as many as 80% of patients.74Thus, indefinite continuation offluconazole therapy is recommended for patients who have coccidioidal meningitis (AII*).Preventing RecurrenceLifelong suppression (secondary prophylaxis) is recommended for patients following successful treatment ofmeningitis. Relapse after successful treatment of disseminated coccidioidomycosis can occur and lifelongantifungal suppression with either fluconazole or itraconazole should be used (AII*). Secondary prophylaxisshould be considered for children with mild disease and ongoing CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3or CD4percentages <15% (secondary prophylaxis) with fluconazole oritraconazole is recommended after completion of initial therapy. Patients with diffuse pulmonary disease,disseminated disease, or meningeal infection should remain on lifelong prophylaxis\u2014even if immunereconstitution is achieved with ART26\u2014because of high risk of relapse (AII*). In HIV-infected adults withfocal coccidioidal pneumonia who have clinically responded to antifungal therapy and have sustained CD4counts >250 cells/mm3on ART, some experts would discontinue secondary prophylaxis after 12 months ofantifungal therapy with careful monitoring for recurrence with chest radiographs and coccidioidal serology.However, only a small number of patients have been evaluated, and the safety of discontinuing secondaryprophylaxis after immune reconstitution with ART in children has not been studied. Therefore, in HIV-infected children, once secondary prophylaxis is initiated for an acute episode of milder, non-meningealcoccidioidomycosis, lifelong suppressive therapy should be considered, regardless of ART and immunereconstitution (BIII).References1.Hage CA, Knox KS, Wheat LJ.

Dosing Recommendations for Prevention and Treatment of Coccidioidomycosis Key to Abbreviations:CD4 = CD4 T lymphocyte; IV = intravenousGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-1Cryptococcosis (Last updated November 6, 2013; last reviewed November 6, 2013) Given the low incidence of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected children, even during the era before combinationantiretroviral therapy (cART), management of this disease in this age group has not been prospectivelystudied. Treatment recommendations largely reflect information extrapolated from many well-designedstudies involving HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis.1EpidemiologyMost cases of neoformans;Cryptococcus neoformans gattii) infection occurs primarily in tropicaland subtropical areas. Cryptococcal infections occur much less frequently in HIV-infected children than inadults.2-5During the pre-cART era, most cases of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected children (overall incidence,1%) occurred in those aged 6 through 12 years and in those with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell countsPanel's Recommendations Routine use of antifungal medications is not recommended for primary prophylaxis of cryptococcal infections in children (BIII).Combination therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate (or liposomal amphotericin B) and flucytosine for 2 weeks (inductiontherapy) followed by fluconazole for a minimum of 8 weeks (consolidation therapy) is recommended for central nervous systemdisease (AI*). Amphotericin B lipid complex is another alternative to amphotericin B deoxycholate (BII*)Liposomal amphotericin B is preferred over amphotericin B deoxycholate for patients with or at risk of renal insufficiency (AI*);amphotericin B lipid complex is an alternative (BII*).In patients who cannot tolerate flucytosine or if flucytosine is unavailable, amphotericin B deoxycholate (or liposomalamphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex) with or without high-dose fluconazole can be used for initial therapy (BI*).Fluconazole plus flucytosine is superior to fluconazole alone and an option in patients who cannot tolerate any form ofamphotericin (BII*). Echinocandins are not active against cryptococcal infections and should not be used (AIII). After a minimum of 2 weeks of induction therapy, if there is clinical improvement and a negative cerebrospinal fluid culture afterrepeat lumbar puncture, amphotericin B and flucytosine can be discontinued and consolidation therapy with fluconazoleadministered for a minimum of 8 weeks (AI*); itraconazole is a less preferable alternative to with fluconazole (AI*)or itraconazole (less preferable) (BI*)is recommended for a minimum of 1 year. Discontinuing secondary prophylaxis (after receiving secondary prophylaxis for 1 year) can be considered for asymptomaticchildren aged 6 years with CD4 counts 100 cells/mm3and an undetectable viral load on 3 months of combinationantiretroviral therapy (CIII). Secondary prophylaxis should be reinitiated if the CD4 count decreases to <100 cells/mm3(AIII).Most experts would not discontinue secondary prophylaxis for patients younger than age 6 years (CIII).Patients with severe pulmonary disease or disseminated cryptococcosis should be treated with amphotericin B with or withoutthe addition of flucytosine, as for CNS disease (AIII). Those with mild-to-moderate pulmonary illness or other localized diseasecan be managed with fluconazole monotherapy (AIII).In antiretroviral-naive patients newly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis or disseminated disease, delay in initiation ofpotent antiretroviral therapy may be prudent until the end of the first 2 weeks of induction therapy (CIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-2indicating severe immunosuppression.4Access to cART has further decreased the overall incidence ofcryptococcal infection6,7in HIV-infected children. Data from Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group studiesbefore and after the advent of cART indicate that the rate of invasive fungal infection, includingcryptococcosis, has remained <0.1 per 100 child-years.8,9Clinical ManifestationsCryptococcosis often presents with subtle and non-specific findings, such as fever and headache. Earlydiagnosis requires consideration of this infection in symptomatic patients whose CD4 counts indicate severeimmunosuppression. In both HIV-infected adults and children, meningoencephalitis is the most commoninitial manifestation of cryptococcosis. The disease typically evolves over days to weeks with fever andheadache. Less frequent findings include nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and focal neurologic signs, as wereseen among 30 HIV-infected children with cryptococcosis reported from the United States.4In contrast tothis indolent presentation, children in Zimbabwe presented with an acute form of neurologic cryptococcosis(69% with nuchal rigidity, 38% with seizure activity, and 23% with focal neurologic signs).10C. gattiiinfections occur mostly in people who are not HIV-infected (or do not have other immunocompromsingconditions), and neurologic disease due to C. gattiiin such apparently normal hosts responds more slowly totreatment and results in high risk of neurologic complications.11C. gattiiinfections in HIV-infected patients,however, are uncommon and are in presentation to C. neoformansinfections in HIV-infected hosts.12Disseminated cryptococcosis can be associated with papules (indistinguishable from ulcers, and infiltratedplaques cellulitis. Pulmonary cryptococcosis without dissemination is unusual in children.Presenting findings include unexplained recurrent fever, cough with scant sputum, intrathoraciclymphadenopathy, and focal or diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. The infection also can be asymptomatic, withpulmonary nodules revealed on routine chest radiograph.3DiagnosisDetection of cryptococcal antigen in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other body fluids is highly effectivefor rapid and accurate diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. A lumbar puncture should be done in any patient with suspected cryptococcal meningitis. CSF cell count,glucose, and protein can be virtually normal with central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis, but theopening pressure usually is elevated. Microscopic examination of CSF on India ink-stained wet mounts canbe performed to diagnose suspected CNS disease but is largely replaced with the use of the cryptococcalantigen test. In more than 90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis, cryptococcal antigen can be detectedin CSF or serum by latex agglutination test (available from several manufacturers). Fungal cultures from CSF, sputum, and blood can identify the organism. In some cases (meaning refractoryor relapsed disease), susceptibility testing of the C. neoformansisolate can be beneficial. Overall, in vitroresistance to antifungal agents remains uncommon.13Diffuse pulmonary disease can be diagnosed through bronchoalveolar lavage and direct examination of Indiaink-stained specimens, culture, and antigen detection. Focal pulmonary and skin lesions may require biopsywith culture and staining. Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureNo strategies have been proven to prevent exposure. C. neoformansinfection is believed to be acquired throughinhalation of aerosolized particles from the environment. Serologic studies of immunocompetent children in anurban setting indicate that most children have been infected by C. neoformansby the third year of life.14Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-3Preventing the First Episode of DiseaseBecause the incidence of cryptococcal disease is so low in HIV-infected children,2-4,15routine testing ofasymptomatic children for serum cryptococcal antigen is not recommended (CIII). A review of randomized controlled trials using antifungal interventions for the primary prevention ofcryptococcal diseases indicates that fluconazole and itraconazole can reduce cryptococcal disease in adultswho have advanced HIV disease and severe immunosuppression (CD4 count <50 cells/mm3).16However,neither of these interventions clearly affected mortality.In addition, routine use of antifungal medications is not recommended for primary prophylaxis ofcryptococcal infections in children because of the low incidence of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected children,lack of survival benefits in primary prevention studies of adults,16possibility of drug interaction, potentialresistance to antifungal drugs, and cost (BIII). Early diagnosis of HIV infection and treatment with cART(following current HIV treatment guidelines) to prevent or reverse immune suppression should furtherreduce risk of cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected children. Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNot applicable.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseNote:These recommendations are largely based on high-quality evidence from studies in adults.CNS DiseaseThe most common and well-studied presentation of cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients is CNSdisease. In light of studies in adults,17-19combination therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate (orliposomal amphotericin B) and flucytosine for 2 weeks (induction therapy) followed by fluconazole for aminimum of 8 weeks (consolidation therapy) is recommended for children (AI*). Amphotericin B lipidcomplex is an alternative to amphotericin B deoxycholate (BII*).20CSF was sterilized significantly morerapidly in adults with CNS cryptococcal disease who received initial therapy with amphotericin Bdeoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/day) and flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) than received 4 mg/kg/day resulted in significantlyearlier CSF culture conversion than did amphotericin B deoxycholate at 0.7 mg/kg/day.23However, arandomized, double-blind clinical trial before the routine availability of cART that compared amphotericin B(0.7 mg/kg/day), liposomal B (6 mg/kg/day)showed no difference in efficacy among the three arms, but significantly fewer adverse events withliposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg body weight/day).24Cost considerations issignificantly more expensive than amphotericin B deoxycholate), based on the reported experience in adults,liposomal amphotericin B would be preferable to amphotericin B deoxycholate in patients with cryptococcalmeningitis who have or are at risk of renal failure (AI*). Amphotericin B lipid complex is another option(BII*).20Monitoring for and managing increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is crucial to optimalmanagement of CNS cryptococcosis (see below).In patients who cannot tolerate flucytosine (or flucytosine is not available), amphotericin B deoxycholate (orits liposomal preparation) with or without fluconazole can be used for initial therapy (BI*). In a randomizedPhase II trial in HIV-infected adolescents and adults, amphotericin B deoxycholate plus high-dose fluconazole(800 mg daily) was found to be well tolerated and with a trend toward better outcome at days 42 and 70,compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate alone.25Studies are needed to further validate the use of thiscombination. In another study 80 HIV-seropositive, antiretroviral (ARV)-naive adults presenting withGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-4cryptococcal meningitis were randomized to 1, B(0.7-1 mg/kg) and group 4,amphotericin B (0.7-1 mg/kg) and voriconazole (300 mg twice daily). The primary end point was the rate ofclearance of infection from CSF or early fungicidal activity, as determined by results of serial, quantitative CSFcryptococcal cultures. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of clearance of cryptococcalcolony-forming units (CFU) in CSF samples among the 4 treatment groups.26Fluconazole plus flucytosine issuperior to fluconazole alone27,28and provides an alternative amphotericin B deoxycholate for acute therapyof invasive disease (BII*)that should be used only if amphotericin B-based therapy is not tolerated. Althoughfluconazole monotherapy was an effective alternative to amphotericin B in adults with AIDS-associatedcryptococcal meningitis,29concerns in this study about differences in early death, delayed CSF sterilization, anddrug resistance30,31make fluconazole monotherapy less favorable for initial therapy of CNS disease. Because ofrapidly developing resistance, flucytosine alone should never be used to treat cryptococcosis. Echinocandins arenot active against cryptococcal infections and should not be used (AIII).After a minimum of 2 weeks of induction therapy with evidence of clinical improvement and a negative CSFculture after repeat lumbar puncture, amphotericin B deoxycholate (or its liposomal preparation) andflucytosine can be discontinued and consolidation therapy for a minimum of 8 weeks initiated withfluconazole (AI*).32Itraconazole is a less preferable alternative to fluconazole for the consolidation phase ofCNS therapy (BI*). Fluconazole is preferred because studies comparing the two agents demonstrate higherrates of CSF sterilization during consolidation therapy18and less frequent relapse32during maintenancetherapy in fluconazole recipients. After completion of consolidation therapy, secondary prophylaxis(maintenance therapy or suppressive therapy) should be initiated (see below). Pulmonary and Extra Pulmonary Cryptococcosis (CNS Disease Ruled Out)No controlled clinical studies describe the outcome of non-CNS cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients.CNS disease should be ruled out in all patients, after which the choice of antifungal medication and length ofinitial therapy can be decided in light of the clinical severity of illness. Patients with severe pulmonarydisease or disseminated cryptococcosis should be treated with a form of amphotericin B with or without theaddition of flucytosine, as for CNS disease (AIII). Usually combination therapy should be provided untilsymptoms resolve. Those with mild-to-moderate pulmonary illness or other localized disease can bemanaged with fluconazole monotherapy (AIII). Regardless of secondary prophylaxis with fluconazole or itraconazole should be provided as for CNS disease(AIII) (see notes below on secondary prophylaxis).Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Monitoring for Raised Intracranial PressureAt the time of diagnosis and on subsequent lumbar punctures, all patients with cryptococcal meningitisshould have their lumbar opening pressure measured. Studies in adults clearly show the role of increased ICPin deaths associated with CNS cryptococcosis.18,33Patients with severe headache, confusion, blurred vision,papilledema, or other neurologic signs or symptoms of increased ICP should be managed using measures todecrease ICP. One approach recommended for adults is to measure pressure continually or repeatedly duringthe lumbar puncture procedure and to remove CSF until the pressure is approximately half the openingpressure but still no lower than normal.34This may be repeated as often as every day until symptoms andsigns consistently improve. Similar data describing experience with therapeutic lumbar punctures in childrenwith cryptococcal meningitis are not available. Not specific to cryptococcal meningitis, a cutoff openingpressure of 28 cm of water has been proposed in children, above which the pressure should be consideredelevated.35CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy can be considered for patients whocontinue to have symptomatic increased ICP despite multiple lumbar taps (BIII). Corticosteroids andmannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP in adults with cryptococcal meningitis and mostGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-5experts would not recommend their use in children (CIII). Acetazolamide is hazardous as therapy forincreased ICP management in adults without signs of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)and has not been evaluated in children with cryptococcal meningitis; acetazolamide is notrecommended foradults and most experts would similarly not use it in children (BIII). Monitoring Treatment ResponseIn addition to monitoring clinical response, mycological response in patients with CNS cryptococcosistypically is assessed by a repeat lumbar puncture and CSF examination at 2 weeks of treatment, withcontinuation of induction therapy until CSF culture is negative.Monitoring serial serum cryptococcal antigen titers is not useful for following treatment efficacy becausechanges in serum cryptococcal antigen titers do not correlate well with outcome during treatment for acutemeningitis or during suppressive therapy.36,37Serial measurement of CSF cryptococcal antigen is moreuseful; in one study, an unchanged or increased titer of antigen in CSF correlated with clinical andmicrobiologic treatment failure, and a rise in CSF antigen titer during suppressive therapy was associatedwith relapse of cryptococcal antigen levels requiresrepeated lumbar punctures and is not routinely recommended for monitoring response.Monitoring for Adverse EventsAdverse effects of amphotericin B (Table 5) are primarily nephrotoxicity; permanent nephrotoxicity isrelated to cumulative dose. Infusion-related fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting can occur, but they are lessfrequent in children than in adults. Close monitoring for drug toxicities is needed especially whenamphotericin B is used with flucytosine.Flucytosine has the potential for marked toxicity, especially affecting the bone marrow (meaning anemia,leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia), liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidney, and skin. In patients receivingflucytosine, flucytosine blood levels should be monitored to prevent bone marrow suppression and GItoxicity; after 3-5 days of therapy, the target 2-hour post-dose serum level of flucytosine is 40-60 \u00b5g/mL.Flucytosine should be avoided in children with severe renal impairment.Fluconazole and the other azoles have relatively low rates of toxicity, but their potential drug interactions canlimit their use. Because of their ability to inhibit the CYP450-dependent hepatic enzymes, the potential fordrug interactions, particularly with ARV drugs, should be carefully evaluated before initiation of therapy.Liver function tests should be monitored during treatment.Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Response Syndrome (IRIS)While cases of IRIS in HIV-infected children have been described,38most of the available information comesfrom adult literature. IRIS related to cryptococcosis can present within weeks (such as meningitis) or months (such aslymphadenitis) after start of cART. Symptoms of meningitis are similar to those described for meningitispresenting as the initial manifestation of cryptococcosis. In one study, about 30% of all HIV-infected adultshospitalized for infection with C. neoformanswho received cART were re-admitted with symptomsattributed to an inflammatory response.39Of the 18 patients with C. neoformans-related IRIS in the citedstudy, 17 had culture-negative meningitis, and most cases occurred during the first 30 days after initiation ofcART. The most common presentation of late cryptococcal IRIS is lymphadenitis, particularly mediastinallymphadenitis.40,41IRIS is a clinical diagnosis. While there are no specific laboratory tests to diagnose IRIS, presence ofnegative cultures in a patient with clinical signs suggestive of tissue inflammation in the face of rapidlyimproving cellular immunity would be suggestive of IRIS over treatment failure. The optimal managementof cryptococcal IRIS has not been defined. Antifungal therapy should be initiated in patients not alreadyGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-6receiving it, raised intracranial pressure managed if present and antiretroviral therapy (ART) should becontinued. Although many cases resolve spontaneously, some experts also have used anti-inflammatorytherapy (e.g., short-course corticosteroids) in patients with severely symptomatic IRIS (CIII).40,42Adult HIV-infected treatment-naive patients with cryptococcal meningitis who go on to develop IRIS afterstarting cART are more likely to have higher HIV RNA levels at baseline43and exhibit less initial CSFinflammation at the time of cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis, compared with those who do not developIRIS.44In patients with advanced immunosuppression and non-tuberculous opportunistic infections (OIs), thepresence of a fungal infection, lower CD4 counts and higher HIV RNA levels at baseline, and higher CD4counts and lower HIV RNA levels on treatment were found associated with IRIS.43For patients not on cART atthe time of diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, the timing of cART in relation to antifungal treatment remainscontroversial. One randomized trial of adult HIV-infected patients with OIs (excluding tuberculosis) primarilyfrom the United States that included 35 patients with cryptococcal meningitis suggested that early cARTtreatment (within the first 14 days of diagnosis) was safe and resulted in less AIDS progression/death comparedto deferred cART.45However a randomized clinical trial in Zimbabwe was reported to show higher mortality inpatients receiving cART starting within 72 hours of diagnosis compared to those waiting at least 10 weeks toinitiate ART.46Patients in this study were treated with high dose fluconazole. Differences in management ofcryptococcal meningitis, raised ICP, and cART treatment options may account for some of the differencesbetween these two studies. In ARV-naive patients newly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis ordisseminated disease, delay in potent ART may be prudent until the end of the first 2 weeks of inductiontherapy (CIII); further delays in initiating cART, especially in resource-poor settings, should be individualized. Managing Treatment FailureTreatment failure is defined as worsening or lack of improvement in signs and symptoms after 2 weeks ofappropriate therapy, including management of ICP; or relapse after an initial clinical response. DifferentiatingIRIS from treatment failure is important because treatment approaches and outcomes differ; persistent positivecultures indicate treatment failure. Optimal management of patients with treatment failure is unknown. If culturesremain positive, evaluation of antifungal susceptibilities can be considered, although C. neoformansresistance tofluconazole is rare in the United States. Patients in whom initial azole-based therapy fails should be switched toamphotericin B-based therapy,30ideally in combination with flucytosine; the possibility of drug interactionsresulting in sub-therapeutic azole levels (meaning concurrent rifampin use or other drugs metabolized by theliver) should be explored.30Use of liposomal amphotericin B should be considered, because one study suggestsimproved efficacy in CSF sterilization with liposomal preparations than with standard amphotericin B.23Somedata from HIV-infected adults indicate higher dosages (meaning 400-800 mg/day) of fluconazole in combinationwith flucytosine also can be considered for salvage therapy.19,47Clinical experience with new antifungal agents inmanaging cryptococcosis is limited. A few patients with cryptococcal infections refractory or intolerant tostandard antifungal therapy have been treated with posaconazole or voriconazole with variable success.48,49Preventing Recurrence (Secondary Prophylaxis)Patients who have completed initial therapy for cryptococcosis should receive secondary prophylaxis(maintenance therapy or suppressive therapy) Suppressive Therapy)Until recently, lifelong secondary prophylaxis typically was recommended. The safety of discontinuingsecondary prophylaxis for cryptococcosis after immune reconstitution with cART has not been studied inchildren, and decisions in that regard should be made on a case-by-case basis. Adults who have successfullycompleted a course of initial therapy (including 12 months of secondary prophylaxis), remain asymptomaticwith regard to signs and symptoms of cryptococcosis, and have a sustained (6 months) increase in theirCD4 counts to 100 cells/mm3with an undetectable viral load on ART for >3 months after cART are atapparent low risk of recurrence of cryptococcosis.52-54In light of these observations and inference from dataGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenG-7regarding discontinuing secondary prophylaxis for other OIs in adults with advanced HIV infection,discontinuing secondary prophylaxis for cryptococcosis (after receiving secondary prophylaxis for at least 1year) can be considered for asymptomatic children aged 6 years, with increase in their CD4 counts to 100 cells/mm3and an undetectable viral load on cART for 3 months (CIII). Secondary prophylaxis shouldbe re-initiated if the CD4 count <100 cells/mm3(AIII). Most experts would not discontinuesecondary prophylaxis for patients younger than age 6 years (CIII).References1.Perfect JR, Dismukes WE, Dromer F, et al.

They have worldwide distribution and lack host specificity. The two species that infect humansmost frequently are Cryptosporidium Among HIV-infected adults, risk of morbidity associated with Cryptosporidiuminfection is greatest in those with advanced immunosuppression, typically CD4 T-lymphocyte cell (CD4)counts <100/mm3.1-3Cryptosporidiumprimarily infects the but in immunocompromisedhosts, extra-intestinal involvement has been documented.Infection occurs after ingestion of infectious oocysts that were excreted in the feces of infected animals andhumans. The parasite is highly infectious, with an ID50(median dose that will infect 50% of those exposed tothe parasite) ranging from 9 to 1042 oocysts, depending on the C. parvumisolate,4and 10 to 83 forC. hominis.5Infection occurs when the ingested oocyst releases sporozoites, which attach to and invade theintestinal epithelial cells. The parasite preferentially infects the jejunum and ileum. Contact with infected individuals (particularly diapered children or in the child care setting) or infectedanimals (particularly pre-weaned calves) is an important cryptosporidiosis risk factor.6,7Cryptosporidiumoocysts can contaminate recreational water sources (such as swimming pools and lakes) and drinking watersupplies and cause infection when contaminated water is ingested. Oocysts are environmentally hardy andextremely chlorine tolerant. They can persist for days in swimming pools despite standard chlorination, andtypical pool filtration systems are only partially effective in removing oocysts. Multi-step treatmentprocesses are often used to remove (i.e., filter) and inactivate (i.e., ultraviolet treatment) oocysts to protectpublic drinking water supplies. Foodborne transmission, particularly involving unpasteurized apple cider andill food handlers, has been documented and individuals traveling internationally also may be at risk if theydrink water in countries where water processing is not as strict as in the United States.Panel's RecommendationsReduce risk of Cryptosporidiuminfection by avoiding drinking water from public swimming pools and other bodies ofrecreational water (AIII), touching farm animals (BIII), and having contact with known Cryptosporidium-infected individuals(AIII). Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to prevent or reverse severe immune deficiency is the primary modality for preventingchronic Cryptosporidiuminfection in HIV-infected children (AII*).Effective cART is the primary initial treatment for Cryptosporidiuminfections in HIV-infected children and adults (AII*). Nitazoxanide can be considered in immunocompromised HIV-infected children in conjunction with cART for treatment ofCryptosporidiuminfection (BII*). Supportive care with hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional supplementation should be provided(AIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenH-2In a serosurvey of multiple U.S. cities, 21.3% of children aged <10 years and 21.5% of those aged 11 to 20years had detectable response to Cryptosporidiumantigen.8Among immunocompetent pediatric patients withdiarrhea, 38% of those aged 5 to 13 years and 58% of those aged 14 to 21 years were seropositive forCryptosporidiumantibodies, compared with >80% of children aged 6 months to 13 years who resided near theU.S.-Mexican border and were seeking well-child care.9,10The incidence of reported cryptosporidiosis in theUnited States has dramatically increased since 2004, peaking at 4 cases per 100,000 people in 2007.11Cases aremost frequently reported in children aged 1 to 4 years, followed by those aged 5 to 9 years. However,cryptosporidiosis is a highly underdiagnosed and underreported diarrheal illness. Infected patients can beasymptomatic, those with symptoms may not seek healthcare, healthcare providers may not request laboratorydiagnostics when evaluating non-bloody diarrhea, requested ova and parasite testing may not includeCryptosporidiumtesting, and positive laboratory results are not always reported to public health officials.12Before effective antiretroviral therapy became available, most HIV-infected patients diagnosed withcryptosporidiosis had advanced disease or AIDS. The incidence of cryptosporidiosis in HIV-infected patientshas declined dramatically since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).13-15During thepre-cART era, the rate of cryptosporidiosis was 0.6 cases per 100 patient-years in children with a median ageof 5.9 years and median CD4 count of 51/mm3who were followed on 13 Pediatric AIDS Clinical TrialGroup (PACTG) protocols.16Data from the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study indicate thatthe rate of chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis decreased from 0.2 cases per 100 person-years in the pre-cART era to 0.0 cases per 100 person-years in the post-cART era.17The PACTG estimates that the mortalityrate in HIV-infected children significantly decreased from 7.2 to 0.8 per 100 person-years between 1994 and2000 and subsequently stabilized through 2006.18The proportion of deaths due to all opportunistic infectionsdecreased between 1994 and 2006, with declines most notable in deaths caused by CryptosporidiumandMycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC). Clinical ManifestationsSymptoms of cryptosporidiosis develop after an incubation period of approximately 1 week (range, 2-14days). Diarrhea\u2014which can be profuse, usually non-bloody, and watery\u2014and weight loss, abdominal pain,anorexia, fatigue, joint pain, headache, fever, and vomiting have been reported in immunocompetent childrenand adults infected with Cryptosporidium.19In immunocompetent hosts, illness is self-limiting, andsymptoms most often completely resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Recurrence of symptoms after seemingresolution often has been reported. Clinical presentation of cryptosporidiosis in HIV-infected patients varieswith level of immunosuppression, ranging from no symptoms or transient disease to relapsing/chronicdiarrhea or cholera-like diarrhea, which can lead to life-threatening wasting and malabsorption.20Inimmunocompromised children, chronic severe diarrhea can result in malnutrition, failure to thrive, andsubstantial intestinal fluid losses, resulting in severe dehydration and even death. Different Cryptosporidiumspp. and genotypes are associated with different clinical manifestations inchildren and HIV-infected adults; vomiting is associated with C. hominisinfection in children and C. parvuminfection in adults.21,22Neither clinical history nor physical examination allows differentiation ofcryptosporidial disease from that caused by other pathogens. Biliary tract disease is associated with CD4 counts 50/mm3.23Symptoms and signs include fever, right upperabdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Diagnostic studies show dilatation of thecommon bile duct, thickening of the gall bladder wall, and pericholecystic fluid collection. Pancreatitis is rare.Although infection usually is limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, respiratory cryptosporidiosis has beenreported with no pathogen other than Cryptosporidiumbeing detected in sputum.24,25DiagnosisHealthcare providers should specifically request Cryptosporidiumtesting, because standard ova and parasitetesting is unlikely to include Cryptosporidiumspp. Performance of diagnostic tests has not been extensivelyGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenH-3evaluated in HIV-infected children but is expected to be similar to that in HIV-uninfected children.Monoclonal antibody-based direct fluorescent antibody assay is the current test of choice for diagnosis ofcryptosporidiosis because of enhanced sensitivity and specificity.26,27Antigen-detection assays that havegood sensitivity and specificity are available commercially (such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay[EIA] and immunochromatography).28,29Oocyst excretion can be intermittent; therefore, the parasite may not be detected in every stool, and stoolspecimens collected on 3 consecutive days should be examined before considering test results to benegative.30With EIA and rapid test methods, false-positive and false-negative results can occur, andconfirmation by microscopy should be considered. If oocysts are not detected in stool specimens and ifsuspicion is high for cryptosporidiosis or limited oocyst excretion, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-baseddetection is recommended because of its increased sensitivity.31PCR for Cryptosporidiumis notcommercially available; healthcare providers should contact the state health department or Centers forDisease Control and Prevention if PCR-based detection is needed. Genotyping and subtyping tools are beingincreasingly used to differentiate Cryptosporidiumspecies in outbreak investigations andinfection/contamination source tracking. Cryptosporidiumisolates cannot be reliably genotyped/subtyped ifstool is preserved in formalin.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureCaregivers and HIV-infected children should be educated and counseled about the different waysCryptosporidiumcan be transmitted (AIII). Modes of transmission include having direct contact with fecalmaterial from infected individuals (particularly children who wear diapers and infected animals), ingestingcontaminated water during recreational activities, drinking contaminated water; and eating contaminated food.Hand washing is probably the most important step to reduce the risk of Cryptosporidiuminfection (AIII).HIV-infected children should always wash their hands before preparing or eating food; after contact withchildren in diapers; after contact with clothing, bedding, toilets, or diapers soiled by someone who hasdiarrhea; after touching pets or other animals; and after touching anything that may have had contact witheven the smallest amounts of human or animal feces (such as sand in a sandbox). HIV-infected children should avoid contact with pre-weaned calves, ill animals, young animals (particularlydogs and cats aged <6 months and lambs), stray animals and stool from any animals or surfaces known to becontaminated with human or animal feces (AIII). HIV-infected children should avoid petting zoos andanimal areas at farms and camps (BIII). After visiting an area with animals, an immunocompetent caregivershould clean the children's shoes and other surfaces that can become contaminated (such as clothes andstroller wheels).HIV-infected children should avoid drinking water directly from ponds, streams, springs, lakes, or rivers, orswallowing water they swim or play in regardless of whether it is chlorinated (AIII). Caregivers and HIV-infected children should be aware that recreational water, including lakes, rivers, salt-water beaches, swimmingpools, water parks, hot tubs, and interactive and ornamental water fountains may be contaminated with humanor animal feces that contain Cryptosporidium. Note that children aged <6 years should not use a hot tub. Some outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been linked to ingestion of water from contaminated municipalwater supplies; the incidence of these outbreaks has dramatically decreased since the mid-1990s because ofimproved water treatment targeting the inactivation and removal of Cryptosporidium. To eliminate risk ofcryptosporidiosis during outbreaks or in other situations in which a community advisory to boil water isissued, heat water used for preparing infant formula, drinking, and making ice at a rolling boil for 1 minute(AIII). After the boiled water cools, put it in a clean bottle or pitcher with a lid and store it in the refrigerator.Water bottles and ice trays should be cleaned with soap and water before each use. Do not touch the inside ofthese containers after cleaning.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenH-4Nationally distributed brands of bottled or canned carbonated soft drinks are safe to drink. Commerciallypackaged, non-carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices that do not require refrigeration until after they areopened (i.e., those which can be stored unrefrigerated on grocery shelves) also are safe. Nationallydistributed brands of frozen fruit juice concentrate are safe if they are reconstituted by the user with waterfrom a safe water source. Fruit juices that must be kept refrigerated from the time they are processed to thetime of consumption may be either fresh (i.e., unpasteurized) or heat-treated (i.e., pasteurized); only juiceslabeled as pasteurized should be considered free of risk from Cryptosporidium. Other pasteurized beverages,such as milk, also are considered safe to drink (BIII).Cryptosporidium-infected patients should not work as food handlers, especially if the handled food isintended to be eaten without cooking (AIII).When traveling internationally, particularly in low-resource settings, HIV-infected patients should be warnedto avoid drinking tap water and not to use it to brush teeth. Ingesting ice that may be made from tap waterand raw fruits and vegetables should also be avoided (BIII). Steaming-hot foods, self-peeled fruits, bottledand canned processed drinks, and hot coffee or hot tea are probably safe.In a hospital, standard precautions (such as the use of gloves and hand-washing after removal of gloves) shouldbe sufficient to prevent transmission of cryptosporidiosis from an infected patient to a susceptible HIV-infectedindividual (AIII). However, because of the potential for fomite transmission, some experts recommend thatseverely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients should not share a room with a patient withcryptosporidiosis (CIII). A recent report suggests that there may be potential for respiratory transmission ofCryptosporidium.25However, no specific modifications of current prevention efforts have been suggested. HIV-infected adolescents who are sexually active should be counseled about avoiding sexual practices thatcould result in oral exposure to feces (such as oral-anal contact). To reduce the risk of exposure to feces,adolescents should use dental dams or similar barrier methods for oral-anal and oral-genital contact, wearlatex gloves during digital-anal contact, and change condoms after anal intercourse. Frequent washing ofhands and genitals with warm, soapy water during and after activities that could bring these body parts incontact with feces may further reduce the risk of Cryptosporidiuminfection.Preventing DiseaseBecause chronic Cryptosporidiuminfection occurs most often in HIV-infected patients with advancedimmunodeficiency, cART for HIV-infected children to prevent or reverse severe immune deficiency is aprimary modality for prevention (AII).Observational studies from the pre-cART era suggested that rifabutin or clarithromycin prophylaxis for MACmight be associated with decreased rates or risk of cryptosporidiosis.32-34However, data are conflicting andinsufficient to recommend using these drugs solely for prophylaxis of cryptosporidiosis. Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNot applicable.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseImmune reconstitution resulting from cART often results in clearance of Cryptosporidiuminfection.Effective cART is the primary initial treatment for these infections in HIV-infected children and adults(AII*).14,35In vitroand observational studies, some of which are case series, suggest that cART containing aprotease inhibitor (PI) may be preferable because of a direct effect of the PI on the parasite.35-44PIs increaseproduction of interferon-gamma, which in turn inhibits Cryptosporidiuminfection. Supportive care withhydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional supplementation should be provided (AIII).Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenH-5Antimotility agents to combat malabsorption of nutrients and drugs should be used with caution (CIII).No consistently effective therapy is available for cryptosporidiosis, and duration of treatment in HIV-infectedpatients is uncertain.45,46Multiple agents have been investigated in small randomized controlled clinical HIV-infected investigated in smallopen-label studies.47No pharmacologic or immunologic therapy directed specifically against C. parvumhas yetbeen shown consistently effective and durable when used alone without concomitant cART.45,46A review of clinical trials of treatment for Cryptosporidia in immunocompromised patients, including thosewith HIV infection, found that no agent has proven efficacy for treating cryptosporidiosis inimmunocompromised patients; however, in immunocompetent individuals, nitazoxanide reduces the load ofparasites. Given the seriousness of this infection in immunocompromised individuals, use of nitazoxanidecan be considered in immunocompromised HIV-infected children in conjunction with cART for immunerestoration (BII*).45,46Given that cART may directly inhibit the parasite, it is possible that the combinationof cART and parasitic therapy may be synergistic.Nitazoxanide is approved in the United States to treat diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidiumand Giardialambliain children and is available in liquid and tablet formulations (BIfor HIV-uninfected children andBII*for HIV-infected children). An Egyptian clinical trial in 100 HIV-uninfected adults and childrenrandomized patients to a 3-day course of nitazoxanide or placebo.48Nitazoxanide therapy reduced theduration of both diarrhea and oocyst shedding; in children, clinical response was 88% with nitazoxanide and38% with placebo. No severe adverse events were reported, and adverse events that were reported weresimilar in the treatment and placebo groups in this study. A study in Zambia in 100 malnourished children(half of whom were HIV-infected) aged 12 to 35 months reported a clinical response in 56% of HIV-uninfected children treated with nitazoxanide, compared with 23% receiving placebo.49However, in theHIV-infected children, no benefit was observed from nitazoxanide (clinical response in 8% treated withnitazoxanide, compared with 25% receiving placebo). In a subsequent study of 60 HIV-infected childrenwith cryptosporidiosis, the same investigators reported no significant benefit using twice the recommendeddose administered for 28 days.50It should be noted that the children in the Zambian studies were notreceiving cART. In a study in HIV-infected adults not receiving cART who had CD4 counts >50 cells/mm3,14 days of nitazoxanide resulted in 71% (10 of 14) response using 500 mg twice daily and 90% (9 of 10)using 1000 mg twice daily, compared with 25% with placebo.51The recommended dose for children is 100mg orally twice daily for children aged 1 to 3 years and 200 mg twice daily for children aged 4 to 11 years. Atablet preparation (500 mg twice daily) is available for children aged 12 years. All medications should beadministered with food.Paromomycin, a non-absorbable aminoglycoside indicated for the treatment of intestinal amoebiasis, is notapproved for treatment of cryptosporidiosis. Two small, randomized trials evaluating the efficacy ofparomomycin for treatment of HIV-infected patients found clinical improvement or reduced oocyst excretionin those treated with paromomycin.52,53A review of reports of paromomycin treatment in HIV-infectedpatients found repeated failure to cure.54Therefore, data do not support a recommendation for use ofparomomycin for cryptosporidiosis (BII*). Clinical or parasitological cure has been documented with use ofparomomycin and azithromycin in combination in case series of HIV-infected patients with cryptosporidialdiarrhea and case reports of HIV-infected patients with pulmonary cryptosporidiosis.55-57Monitoring and Adverse Events, Including IRIS Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, electrolyte imbalance,malnutrition, and weight loss. In severely ill patients, total parenteral nutrition may be indicated (CIII). Onecase report describes immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, specifically terminal ileitis, inassociation with treatment of cryptosporidiosis.58In general, nitazoxanide is well tolerated and side effects are mild, transient, and limited to the GI tract. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenH-6Managing Treatment FailureThe most important steps for managing treatment failure are optimizing cART to increase CD4 counts andproviding supportive treatment (AIII).Preventing RecurrenceNo pharmacologic interventions are known to be effective in preventing recurrence of cryptosporidiosis.

Key to Acronyms:ARV = antiretroviral; cART = combination antiretroviral therapyDosing Recommendations for Prevention and Treatment of CryptosporidiosisGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-1Cytomegalovirus (Last updated November 6, 2013; last reviewed November 6, 2013)Panel's RecommendationsCytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody testing is recommended at age 1 year and then annually for CMV-seronegative, HIV-infected infantsand children who and immunosuppressed (i.e., CD4 cell count <50 cells/mm3orCD4 percentage <5%) should have a dilated retinal examination performed by an ophthalmologist every 6 months (AIII). CMV end-organ disease is best prevented by antiretroviral therapy (ART) to maintain the CD4 cell count >100 cells/mm3in childrenaged 6 years, <6 years (BIII). Prophylaxis with valganciclovir can be considered for HIV-infected children aged 6 years who are CMV-seropositive and have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm3and for HIV-infected <6 a percentage <5% (CIII). Cessation of primary prophylaxis can beconsidered when the CD4 cell count is >100 cells/mm3for children 6 years of age, or >10% in children <6 years (CIII).Intravenous (IV) ganciclovir therapy (6 mg/kg/dose administered every 12 hours) for 6 weeks can be considered for HIV-exposedor HIV-infected infants who have symptomatic congenital CMV disease involving the central nervous system (CNS) (BI). For HIV-infected infants and children, IV ganciclovir is the drug of choice for initial treatment for acquired CMV disease, includingretinitis and other end-organ disseminated CMV disease esophagitis, disease) (AI*). notbeen evaluated in HIV-infected children with CMV retinitis, but is an option primarily for older children who weigh enough to receivethe adult dose and formulation of valganciclovir (CIII). Transition from IV ganciclovir to valganciclovir oral solution can beconsidered for younger patients who improve on IV therapy (CIII).Foscarnet is an alternative drug for treating CMV disease or for use in ganciclovir-resistant CMV infections in HIV-infected children (AI*).Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet delays progression of retinitis in certain patients in whom monotherapy failsand can be used as initial therapy in children with sight-threatening disease (BIII).Combination treatment with IV ganciclovir and foscarnet may be preferable as initial therapy to stabilize CMV neurologic diseaseand maximize response (BII*).Many experts would initially treat early first relapse of retinitis with reinduction using the same drug, followed by reinstitution ofmaintenance therapy (AII*). If drug resistance is suspected, change to an alternative drug is reasonable (AIII). Combination IVganciclovir and foscarnet can be considered.After induction therapy, secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) is given for most forms of CMV disease untilimmune reconstitution or, in absence of immune reconstitution, for the remainder of a patient's life (AI*). Regimens recommendedfor chronic suppression include IV IV ganciclovir and foscarnet, andparenteral cidofovir (AI*). Chronic maintenance therapy is not routinely recommended for gastrointestinal disease but should be considered if relapses occur(BII*). A role for maintenance therapy for CMV pneumonitis has not been established (CIII). Discontinuing secondary prophylaxis may be considered for children who are receiving ART and have a sustained (such as >6months) increase in CD4 cell count, defined as an increase in CD4 percentage to >15% for children aged <6 years, or an increase inCD4 cell count to >100 cells/mm3for children aged 6 years (CIII).All patients with CMV ophthalmic disease in whom anti-CMV maintenance therapy has been discontinued should continue toundergo regular ophthalmologic monitoring at 3- to 6-month intervals for early detection of CMV relapse and uveitis (AII*).Secondary prophylaxis should be reinstituted in HIV-infected children in whom it was discontinued because of immunereconstitution when the CD4 percentage decreases to <15% in those aged <6 years and when the CD4 cell count decreases to <100cells/mm3in those aged 6 years (BIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or morewell-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data inchildrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-2EpidemiologyInfection with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is common and usually not apparent; CMV can be acquired inutero, or during infancy, early childhood, or adolescence. Transmission can occur vertically from an infectedwoman to her offspring; horizontally by contact with virus-containing breast milk, saliva, urine, or sexual fluid;through transfusion of infected blood; or transplantation of infected organs. During infancy and earlychildhood, infection usually occurs secondary to ingestion of virions in breast milk of CMV-infected mothersor from exposure to virus shed in saliva or urine. Infection occurs at younger ages in locations where sanitationis less than optimal. Among adolescents, sexual transmission is the major mode of CMV acquisition.Age-related prevalence of infection varies widely depending on living circumstances and social customs.Breastfeeding, child-rearing practices, crowding, sanitation, and sexual behavior most likely influence age-related variations in CMV prevalence. Where rates of maternal seropositivity are high and breastfeeding iscommon, more than half of infants acquire CMV during the first year of life.1Group care of childrenfacilitates spread of CMV , especially in toddlers, and leads to higher prevalence of infection in children whoattend child care centers and in their caregivers.2,3In Africa, Asia, and Latin America, most children areinfected with CMV before adolescence. In the United States and western Europe, the prevalence of antibodyto CMV in adults from middle and upper socioeconomic strata is 40% to 60%, whereas the prevalence inlow-income adults is 80%.4Overall, among U.S. women of childbearing age, the prevalence of CMVinfection is 50% to 80%, with the highest prevalence in women in lower socioeconomic strata.5,6Theprevalence of CMV infection among HIV-infected pregnant women is higher than in the general population,with approximately 90% of HIV-infected pregnant women coinfected with CMV .7,8CMV is the most common congenitally transmitted infection, with incidence estimates in live-born infants inthe United States ranging from 0.5% to 1.2%.9Congenital (in utero) CMV infection occurs most commonlyamong infants born to women who have primary CMV infection during pregnancy. Following primaryinfection during pregnancy, the rate of transmission to the fetus is approximately 30% to 40%.5,10Incomparison, the rate of congenital infection after non-primary maternal CMV infection is believed to besignificantly lower (range: 0.15%-1.0%).11-13More recent studies demonstrate that in uterotransmission ofnon-primary maternal infection can occur because of reactivation of infection in women infected beforepregnancy or reinfection with a different CMV strain in CMV-seropositive women.14,15CMV also can be transmitted from mother to infant during the intrapartum or postpartum periods. Up to 57%of infants whose mothers shed CMV at or around delivery become infected with CMV , and up to 53% ofchildren who are breastfed milk containing infectious virus can become CMV-infected. Symptomatic CMVdisease in the infant is much less common when CMV is acquired intrapartum or through breastfeeding thanwhen acquired antenatally and occurs primarily in premature neonates. Long-term sequelae are rare inpremature infants who acquire CMV perinatally or postnatally.16-20HIV-infected women with CMV infection have a higher rate of CMV shedding from the cervix than dowomen who are HIV-uninfected (52%-59% and 14%-35%, respectively).21The risk for mother-to-infanttransmission of CMV may be higher among infants born to women dually infected with CMV and HIV . Inone study of 440 infants born to HIV-infected U.S. women, the overall rate of in uteroinfection was 4.5%,22higher than the <2% rate of in uteroinfection in the general U.S. population. In a more recent study of 367U.S. infants born to HIV-infected mothers, a 3% prevalence of congenital CMV infection was reportedamong HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers, suggesting that the rate of congenital CMVinfection is similar to or slightly higher than the prevalence of congenital CMV infection among HIV-uninfected mothers.23In a study in France, the prevalence of congenital CMV infection among HIV-infectedinfants was 10.3%, compared with 2.2% in HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-positive mothers, and therate of in uteroHIV transmission was higher among infants with congenital CMV infection compared withinfants without congenital CMV infection.24HIV-infected children appear to be at higher risk of CMV infection during early childhood than are HIV-Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-3uninfected children.22The rate of CMV acquisition in HIV-infected children appears to be particularly highduring the first 12 months of life but remains higher among HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected childrenthrough age 4 years.CMV disease occurs less frequently among HIV-infected children than HIV-infected adults, but stillcontributed substantially to morbidity and mortality in the era before combination antiretroviral therapy(cART). In the pre-antiretroviral era, CMV caused 8% to 10% pediatric inHIV-infected adults have shown a 75% to 80% decrease in the incidence of new cases of CMV end-organdisease with the advent of cART, with an incidence now estimated to be <6 cases per 100 person-years.26In astudy of opportunistic infections in approximately 3,000 children followed in Pediatric AIDS Clinical TrialsGroup studies during the pre-cART era, the frequency of CMV retinitis was 0.5 cases per 100 child-yearsand, of other CMV disease, 0.2 cases per 100 child-years.27The rate varied significantly by CD4 T-lymphocyte (CD4) cell percentage; the incidence of CMV cases per 100 child-years inchildren with CD4 percentage <15%, compared with 0.1 case per 100 child-years in children with CD4percentage >25%. In the same cohort during the cART era, the overall rate of CMV retinitis was <0.5 per100 child-years.28In the Study, the incidence of nonocular CMVbefore and after January 1997 (pre- and post-cART eras) was 1.4 per 100 child-years and 0.1 per 100 child-years, respectively.29Similarly, CMV retinitis declined from 0.7 to 0.0 per 100 child-years.Symptomatic HIV-infected children coinfected with CMV have a CMV viruria than doasymptomatic HIV-infected or HIV-exposed children. Overall, up to 60% of children with AIDS shed CMV .This compares with one third of all HIV .30Clinical ManifestationsApproximately 10% of infants with in uteroCMV infection are symptomatic at birth with congenital CMVsyndrome (i.e., CMV inclusion disease). The rate of symptomatic CMV infection among infants infectedwith CMV in uterois higher in infants HIV-uninfected children (6.7%) even inthe cART era.24In studies of cohorts of neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease, conditionscommonly observed included size that was gestational age, petechiae, jaundice,hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and hearing impairment.31,32Mortality of children with symptomatic disease is as high as 30%. Approximately 40% to 58% (and inspecific cohorts, as many as 90%) of infants with symptomatic disease at birth who survive have latecomplications, including substantial hearing loss, mental retardation, chorioretinitis, optic atrophy, seizures,or learning disabilities.5,9Although most children with in uteroCMV infection do not have symptoms atbirth, 10% to 15% are at risk of later developmental abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss, chorioretinitis,or neurologic defects. Premature neonates who acquire CMV postnatally can be asymptomatic or can haveevidence of disease such as hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, or pneumonitis. HIV disease seems to progress more quickly in HIV-infected children coinfected with CMV than in thosewithout CMV infection.22,25,33In study from the pre-cART era, 53% of infants coinfected with HIV andCMV had progression to AIDS or had died by age 18 months, compared with 22% of HIV-infected childrenwithout CMV infection; those with HIV/CMV to have central nervoussystem (CNS) manifestations (36% versus 9%). The relative risk of HIV disease progression in childrencoinfected with CMV compared with children without CMV was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.1-6.0).22CMV retinitis isthe most frequent accounting forapproximately children isfrequently asymptomatic and discovered on routine examination. Older children with CMV retinitis presentsimilarly to adults, with floaters, loss of peripheral vision, or reduction in central vision. Diagnosis of CMVretinitis is based on clinical appearance with white and yellow retinal infiltrates and associated retinalhemorrhages. A more indolent, granular retinitis also can occur. HIV-infected children with CD4 cell countsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-4<100 cells/mm3are more likely than those with higher CD4 cell counts to develop CMV retinitis; however,CD4 cell count is less predictive of risk of CMV disease in young infants, and systemic and localized CMVdisease can occur in HIV-infected infants with higher, age-adjusted CD4 cell counts.30,34End-organ CMV disease has been reported in the lung, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas, kidney,sinuses, and CNS of HIV-infected children but is rare in the era of cART.34-37In children with extraocularCMV disease, predominantly nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fever, poor weight gain, loss of developmentalmilestones with laboratory abnormalities of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactic dehydrogenase)are initially observed, although the extent to which CMV or HIV infection themselves contribute to thesefindings is unclear.30GI manifestations among HIV-infected children include CMV colitis (the most commonGI manifestation), oral and esophageal ulcers, hepatitis, ascending cholangiopathy, or gastritis. Odynophagiais a common presentation of CMV esophagitis, abdominal and hematochezia frequently occurwith CMV colitis. Sigmoidoscopy in CMV colitis demonstrating hemorrhage, diffuse ulcerations. Esophageal causeperforation or hemorrhage.The role of CMV in pulmonary disease among HIV-infected children is difficult to assess because it often isisolated with other organisms (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii). Histologic evidence of CMV disease is neededto determine whether active disease is present. CMV pneumonia is an interstitial process with gradual onsetof shortness of breath and dry, nonproductive cough; auscultatory findings be minimal.CNS encephalopathy, myelitis, and polyradiculopathy (primarilyobserved in adults but rarely reported in children). The subacute or chronic encephalopathy of CMV can bedifficult to differentiate clinically from HIV dementia, with symptoms of confusion and disorientationattributable to cortical involvement. Focal signs can be attributed to lesions in the brainstem. Cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) findings are nonspecific and may include leukocytosis with polymorphonuclear predominance(>50% of patients), elevated protein (75%), and low glucose (30%). However, up to 20% of children withCMV CNS involvement have completely normal CSF indices. CMV also can cause a rapidly progressive,often fatal, CNS disease with cranial nerve deficits, nystagmus, and increasing ventricular size.38DiagnosisIt can be difficult to distinguish CMV infection from CMV disease in HIV-infected children. Because oftransplacental transfer of antibody, a positive CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody assay in an infantaged <12 months can indicate infection in the mother but not necessarily in the infant. In an infant aged >12months, a positive CMV IgG antibody assay indicates CMV infection of the child but not necessarily activedisease. In children of any age, a positive CMV culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay indicatesinfection but not necessarily disease. CMV can be isolated in cell culture from peripheral blood leukocytes, body fluids (e.g., urine, saliva), ortissues. Using centrifugation-assisted shell vial culture amplification techniques, CMV can be detected within16 to 40 hours of culture inoculation. A positive blood buffy-coat culture establishes CMV infection andincreases the likelihood that disease or symptoms were caused by CMV because children with positive bloodcultures are at higher risk of end-organ disease. Recovery of virus from tissues (e.g., with endoscopicallyguided biopsies of GI or pulmonary tissue) provides evidence of disease causation in symptomatic patients.The limitation of this method is that detection of visible cytopathic effects in cell culture takes 1 to 6 weeks.Staining of shell vial culture with CMV monoclonal antibodies or tissue immunostaining for CMV antigens with monoclonal antibodies for CMVantigens also can be done on cells obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage.Different methods have been used to detect viral antigen or DNA directly and to identify patients at risk ofCMV disease; these include detection of pp65 antigenemia, qualitative and quantitative PCR, and DNAGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-5hybridization. The DNA assays are more sensitive than buffy coat or urine cultures for detecting CMV andcan be used to identify patients at higher risk of clinically recognizable disease. CMV DNA detection in CSFby DNA PCR is highly sensitive for CMV CNS disease. Quantitative DNA PCR can be used as a marker forrisk of disease and to monitor response to therapy.39Anticipated international standardization of PCR assaysfor CMV DNA may allow for the establishment of quantitative PCR breakpoints that correlate with CMVdisease and facilitate monitoring response to therapy. The National Institute of Standards and Technologyand the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Biological Standardization recently developedreference standards for assays for CMV DNA.40,41To diagnose congenital CMV infection, the gold standard remains a positive viral culture from saliva or urinewithin the first 21 days of life. Beyond this age, positive cultures can be due to postnatally acquired CMVinfection. Other methodologies to diagnose congenital CMV infection (blood or saliva PCR) have beeninvestigated but do not yet replace culture as a recommended diagnostic standard.42,43To diagnose acquired CMVdisease, culture, antigenemia, and PCR can be used to provide supportive laboratory evidence for clinicallysuspected CMV disease. However, these tests may be positive in the absence of clinical disease, due toasymptomatic reactivations, and therefore do not themselves constitute a diagnosis of CMV disease in theabsence of clinical findings. Alternatively, localized CMV disease (e.g., GI disease) may not manifest withpositive blood tests and laboratory diagnosis may require direct sampling of the involved organ for CMV testing.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureHIV-exposed infants and HIV-infected children, adolescents, and adults who are seronegative for CMV andrequire blood transfusion should be administered only antibody-negative or leukocyte-reduced cellularblood products in nonemergency situations (BIII).HIV-infected adults and adolescents who are child care providers or parents of children in child care facilitiesshould be informed that they are at increased risk of CMV infection (BII*). Risk of CMV infection can bediminished by optimal hygienic practices (e.g., hand-washing) (AIII). Sexually active adolescents are at riskof CMV acquisition through oral-oral contact (kissing) and genital-genital contact; the latter risk may bedecreased with condom use.Preventing First Episode of DiseaseThe primary methods of preventing severe CMV disease are prevention of severe immunosuppression bytreating with cART and recognition of the early manifestations of disease. CMV antibody testing isrecommended at age 1 year and then annually thereafter for CMV-seronegative HIV-infected infants andchildren who are a retinal examination performed by anophthalmologist every 6 months (AIII). Older children should be counseled to report floaters in the eye andvisual changes, similar to the recommendation for adults (BIII). Since the advent of cART, CMV end-organdisease has diminished to such an extent that primary prophylaxis with antiviral agents in CMV- and HIV-coinfected people usually is not recommended (BIII). CMV end-organ disease is best prevented by ART tomaintain the CD4 cell count >100 cells/mm3(CD4 percentage >10% in <6 years). If this is notpossible, prophylaxis with valganciclovir can be considered for HIV-infected children aged 6 years andadolescents who are CMV-seropositive and have CD4 cell counts of <50 cells/mm3, and for young HIV-infected children aged <6 years who are CMV-seropositive and have a CD4 percentage <5% (CIII). Datasupporting the efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis CMV in pediatric HIV-infected patients are lacking,however, and CMV disease has been observed in children with higher CD4 cell counts than those suggestedfor primary prophylaxis.27A randomized study of ganciclovir prophylaxis in adult patients with AIDS andlow CD4 counts did not show efficacy, and ganciclovir is associated with hematologic toxicity.44Therefore,Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-6ART remains the preferred approach to prevent CMV disease in HIV-infected children.Valganciclovir dosing in neonates and young has been defined in non-HIV-infected patients withsymptomatic congenital CMV disease, with a 16 mg/kg body weight dose of oral valganciclovir producingsimilar systemic exposure to a 6 mg/kg body weight dose of intravenous (IV) ganciclovir.45In children aged 4months to 16 years, the dose should be based upon body surface area (BSA) and creatinine clearance (CrCl),with the dose in milligrams = 7 x BSA x CrCl (calculated using a modified Schwartz formula); if the calculatedSchwartz CrCl exceeds 150 mL/min/1.73m2, then a maximum value of 150 mL/min/1.73m2should be used inthe equation.46All calculated doses should be rounded to the nearest 25-mg increment for the actual deliverabledose. If the calculated dose exceeds 900 mg, a maximum dose of 900 mg should be administered.Valganciclovir oral solution is the preferred formulation for children aged 4 months to 16 years because itprovides the ability to administer a dose calculated according to the formula above; however, valganciclovirtablets can be used if the calculated doses are within 10% of available tablet strength (450 mg).Asymptomatic congenital CMV infection is associated with late-onset hearing loss in HIV-uninfectedchildren.32Therefore, infants of mothers who were infected with CMV during pregnancy or those in whom inuteroHIV transmission has been documented should be evaluated for the presence of congenital,asymptomatic CMV infection by urine shell vial testing (CIII). Some experts recommend testing all infantsborn to HIV-infected mothers for congenital CMV infection, because HIV transmission to infants may not beclearly defined within the 21-day window for congenital CMV testing. Infants with congenital CMVinfection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) should be evaluated for hearing loss at 6-month intervals for atleast the first 3 years of life (AII).47Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisBecause primary prophylaxis with antiviral agents in individuals coinfected with CMV and HIV usually isnot recommended (as discussed above), consideration of discontinuing primary prophylaxis usually isunnecessary. When valganciclovir primary prophylaxis is provided, cessation of prophylactic treatment canbe considered when the CD4 cell count is >100 cells/mm3for children aged 6 years, or CD4 percentage>10% in children aged <6 years (CIII).Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseTreatment of newborns who have symptomatic congenital CMV disease involving the CNS with IVganciclovir for 6 weeks has been evaluated in a series of clinical trials conducted by the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group;48,49all infants in these studies wereHIV-uninfected. Infants receiving therapy cleared their urine of CMV by culture by the end of the 6-weektreatment period, but they all experienced a rebound in their viruria after the drug was discontinued.48In aPhase III, randomized, controlled trial, infants with CNS disease who received IV ganciclovir for 6 weekswere less likely to have hearing deterioration over the first 2 years of life than were infants receiving noantiviral therapy.49Treated infants also had more rapid resolution of liver enzyme abnormalities and a greaterdegree of growth during the course of therapy. They also experienced fewer neurodevelopmental delays at 1year of life than did untreated infants.50However, approximately two-thirds of the infants developedsubstantial neutropenia during therapy.49Among patients developing neutropenia, 48% required dosemodification, but most were able to complete the 6 weeks of therapy. On the basis of these results, IV ganciclovir therapy (6 mg/kg body weight/dose administered every 12hours) for 6 weeks can be considered for HIV-exposed or HIV-infected infants who have symptomaticcongenital CMV disease involving the CNS (BI). If during the 6 weeks of therapy an infant is confirmed asHIV infected, some experts might recommend treatment for a longer period (>6 weeks), but the benefit ofextended therapy is unproven (CIII). A controlled trial conducted by the Collaborative Antiviral StudyGroup of 6 weeks versus 6 months of oral valganciclovir in HIV-uninfected infants with symptomaticGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-7congenital CMV disease is nearing completion. Neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease can bereferred to a pediatric infectious diseases specialist for consideration of ganciclovir or valganciclovir therapyand long-term monitoring for sequelae (AI).45,49CMV retinitis should be managed in collaboration with an experienced ophthalmologist and CMV treatmentshould be instituted in addition to cART. IV ganciclovir, oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, and IV cidofovir,and the ganciclovir intraocular implant coupled with valganciclovir are all effective treatments for CMVretinitis in HIV-infected adults (AI*).51-55Ganciclovir intraocular implant, however, is no longer availablefrom the manufacturer for treatment with CMV retinitis. For HIV-infected infants and children, IVganciclovir is the drug of choice for initial treatment (induction therapy) for acquired CMV disease,including CMV retinitis (AI*). Oral a prodrug of ganciclovir, is first-line treatments for HIV-infected adults with CMV retinitis (AI*)53and is an option in older children who weigh enough to receive theadult dose and tablet formulation of valganciclovir (CIII). The drug is well absorbed from the GI tract andrapidly metabolized to ganciclovir in the intestine and liver. Valganciclovir oral solution has not been studiedin pediatric patients for treatment of CMV retinitis, but consideration can be given to its use for transitioningfrom IV ganciclovir to oral valganciclovir to complete treatment and/or for secondary prophylaxis onceimprovement in retinitis is noted (CIII).An alternative drug for treating CMV disease or for use in ganciclovir-resistant CMV infections in HIV-infected children is foscarnet (AI*). Foscarnet used as suppressive therapy has been associated withincreased length of survival relative to ganciclovir in HIV-infected adults. Doses should be modified inpatients with renal insufficiency. Cidofovir is effective in treating CMV retinitis in adults who are intolerantof other therapies. Cidofovir has not been studied in children with CMV disease, but can be considered whenother options cannot be used (CIII).Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet delays progression of retinitis in certain patients inwhom monotherapy fails34,53,56,57and can be used as initial therapy in children with sight-threatening disease(BIII). Combination therapy also has been used for adults with retinitis that has relapsed on single-agenttherapy. However, substantial rates of adverse effects are associated with combination therapy.Intravitreous injections of ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir have been used to control retinitis, butbiweekly intraocular injections are required. Data are limited in children, and biweekly injection isimpractical for use in most children (BIII). Implantation of an intravitreous ganciclovir medication-releasedevice in the posterior chamber of the eye also has been used in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. Inadults, the combination of oral valganciclovir with a ganciclovir sustained-release intraocular implant,replaced every 6 to 9 months, was superior to daily IV ganciclovir in preventing relapse of retinitis, andintraocular ganciclovir implant plus IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir was preferred by some adult HIVspecialists for initial treatment of patients who have sight-threatening CMV lesions adjacent to the opticnerve or fovea (AI).51-55Use of systemic therapy in addition to the ocular implant may reduce developmentof retinitis in the contralateral eye. Because the ganciclovir implant is no longer available from themanufacturer, this route of administration is currently not available for treatment and chronic suppression ofCMV retinitis in older children large enough to receive the intraocular implant and oral valganciclovir.Small peripheral lesions can be treated with systemic therapy without local treatment (BII*). Intraocularimplants have not been studied in patients younger than age 9 years and were not recommended in childrenaged <3 years because of the small size of their eyes (AIII). Intraocular cidofovir is not recommended inchildren because of lack of data and the risk of hypotony in adults (AIII).For acquired CMV neurologic disease, prompt initiation of therapy is critical for an optimal clinicalresponse, as well as ART to enable immune reconstitution. Levels of ganciclovir in the CSF are 24% to 70%of plasma levels, and levels in the brain are approximately 38% of plasma levels.58Foscarnet concentrationsin the CSF are about two-thirds of those in serum.59Hence, combination treatment with ganciclovir andGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-8foscarnet may be preferable as initial therapy to stabilize disease and maximize response (BII*).60However,this approach is associated with substantial rates of adverse effects, and optimal treatment for neurologicdisease in children receiving optimized cART is unknown.Patients with AIDS and recipients of solid organ transplants who have GI disease attributed to CMV appearto benefit from ganciclovir therapy (AI*).61,62Limited and uncontrolled data suggest that ganciclovir therapyis useful in patients with AIDS and CMV pneumonia (BII*).63As with other CMV disease, antiviralmanagement for CMV disease should also include cART.Monitoring Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)CMV retinitis should be managed in concert with an experienced ophthalmologist. Recommendations forHIV-infected adults include indirect ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil performed at diagnosis of CMVretinitis, after completion of induction therapy, 1 month after initiation of therapy, and monthly thereafterwhile patients are on anti-CMV treatment; recommendations should HIV-infected childrenwith CMV retinitis (AIII). Monthly fundus photographs using a standardized photographic technique thatdocuments the appearance of the retina provide the optimum method for following patients and detectingearly relapse (AIII). For patients who have experienced immune recovery, the frequency of ophthalmologicfollow-up can be decreased to every 3 months. However, because relapse of retinitis can occur in patientswith immune recovery, regular ophthalmologic follow-up still is needed.The major side effects of ganciclovir and valganciclovir are myelosuppression (i.e., anemia, neutropenia, andthrombocytopenia) and renal toxicity. Dose reduction or interruption because of hematologic toxicity may benecessary in up to 40% of patients receiving IV ganciclovir; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor usedto ameliorate neutropenia. The toxicities of foscarnet are decreased renal function and metabolicderangements. Renal toxicity and foscarnet binding to divalent metal ions, such as calcium, lead to metabolicabnormalities in approximately one-third of patients, and serious electrolyte imbalances (including abnormalitiesin calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium levels) and secondary seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias,abnormal liver transaminases, and CNS symptoms can occur. Metabolic disturbances can be minimized iffoscarnet is administered by slow infusion, with rates not exceeding 1 mg/kg/minute. Concomitant use of othernephrotoxic drugs increases the likelihood of renal dysfunction associated with foscarnet therapy. For patientsreceiving ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet, complete blood counts and serum electrolytes and renalfunction should be monitored twice weekly during induction therapy and once weekly thereafter (AIII).The major side effect of cidofovir is potentially irreversible nephrotoxicity; the drug produces proximaltubular dysfunction including proteinuria, syndrome, and acute renal failure. Tominimize nephrotoxicity, probenecid should be administered before each infusion, and IV hydration withnormal saline should be administered before and after each cidofovir infusion. For patients receiving IVcidofovir, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinalysis should be performed before each infusion;administration of the drug is contraindicated if renal dysfunction or proteinuria is detected. Other reportedadverse events include anterior uveitis and ocular hypotony; serial ophthalmologic monitoring for anteriorsegment inflammation and intraocular pressure is needed while receiving the drug systemically. Cidofovirshould not be administered concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents. Cidofovir therapy must bediscontinued if serum creatinine increases 0.5 mg/dL above baseline.Immune recovery uveitis after initiation of effective cART is an immunologic reaction to CMV associatedwith inflammation in the anterior chamber and/or the vitreous and therefore is a form of immunereconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).64Ocular complications of uveitis include macular edema anddevelopment of epiretinal membranes, which can cause loss of vision. Patients with low CD4 cell countswho are starting cART are at risk of IRIS. Frequent surveillance ophthalmologic examination is warrantedduring the period of immune reconstitution in children who are unable to report symptoms, andophthalmologic examination is indicated for children able to report vision changes who develop symptoms.Immune recovery uveitis may respond to periocular corticosteroids or a short course of systemic steroids.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-9Oral valganciclovir was beneficial in one small uncontrolled study.65Managing Treatment FailureResistant strains of CMV should be suspected when progressive disease and continued recovery of virus occursdespite ganciclovir therapy. Foscarnet is the drug of choice when ganciclovir resistance is suspected (AI*).In patients with CMV retinitis, although drug resistance occurs in patients receiving long-term therapy, earlyrelapse may be caused by the limited intraocular penetration of systemically administered drugs. In HIV-infectedadults whose retinitis has relapsed during systemic treatment, placement of a ganciclovir implant wasrecommended because it achieved higher drug levels in the eye and often would control the retinitis for 6 to 8months until the implant required replacement; however, the ganciclovir implant is no longer available from themanufacturer. Early first relapse of retinitis should be treated with reinduction with the same drug, followed byreinstitution of maintenance therapy (AII*). However, if drug resistance is suspected or if side effects ortoxicities interfere with optimal courses of the initial agent, change to an alternative drug is reasonable (AIII).Combination ganciclovir and foscarnet can be considered but is accompanied by greater toxicity.Preventing RecurrenceCourses of antiviral agents (e.g., ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, not cure CMVinfection. After induction therapy, secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) is given for mostforms of CMV disease until immune reconstitution, or in the absence of immune reconstitution, for theremainder of patients' lives (AI*). Regimens that can be considered for chronic suppression in adults and adolescents include IV ganciclovir,oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, combined IV ganciclovir and foscarnet, theseregimens are children (AI*).66-73Repetitive intravitreous injections of ganciclovir,foscarnet, and cidofovir reportedly are effective for secondary prophylaxis of CMV retinitis,74,75althoughintraocular therapy alone does not protect the contralateral eye or other organ systems and therefore typicallyis combined with systemic treatment.66Frequent intravitreous injections also are impractical for use in mostchildren (AIII).A chronic maintenance regimen for patients treated for CMV disease should be chosen in consultation with aspecialist. Chronic maintenance therapy is not routinely recommended for GI disease but should beconsidered if relapses occur (BII*). A role for maintenance therapy for CMV pneumonitis has not beenestablished (CIII). For patients with retinitis, decisions should be made in consultation with anophthalmologist, taking into consideration the anatomic location of the retinal lesion, vision in thecontralateral eye, and patients' immunologic and virologic status (BIII).Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisMultiple case series have reported that maintenance therapy can be discontinued safely in adults andadolescents with CMV retinitis whose CD4 cell counts have increased substantially in response to cART.76-81These patients have remained disease free for >30 and up to 95 weeks of follow up, whereas during the pre-cART era, retinitis typically reactivated in <6 to 8 weeks after stopping CMV therapy. Plasma HIV RNAlevels varied among these patients, supporting the hypothesis that the CD4 cell count is the primarydeterminant of immune recovery to CMV . However, CMV CD4 cell counts,82suggesting that CMV-specific cellular be important in controllingCMV in immune-reconstituted HIV-infected adults83,84and reinforcing the importance of ongoingmonitoring. HIV-infected with CMV retinitis, discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis can beconsidered for patients with a sustained increase in CD4 cell count to >100 cells/mm3in response to ART.The safety of discontinuing secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution with ART in HIV-infectedchildren has not been as well studied. Low or undetectable HIV replication in children is the strongestcorrelate with CMV immune reconstitution and a higher frequency of CMV-specific CD4 cells.85EarlyGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenI-10institution of cART may help control CMV infection by maintaining normal CD4 cell count and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in HIV-infected children.86In deciding whether to discontinue secondary prophylaxis,consideration must be given to the significant toxicities associated with antiviral drugs active against CMV ,including those in in vitroand animal models.Recognizing the limitations of the data in children but drawing on the growing experience in adults,discontinuing prophylaxis can be considered in children who are receiving ART and have a sustained (i.e., >6months) increase in CD4 percentage to >15% in children aged <6 years, or for children aged 6 years (as foradults), an increase in CD4 cell count to >100 cells/mm3(CIII). When the manifestation of CMV disease isocular, such decisions should be made in close consultation with an ophthalmologist and should account forfactors such as magnitude and duration of CD4 cell count increase, anatomic location of the retinal lesion,vision in the contralateral eye, and the feasibility of regular ophthalmologic monitoring (CIII).All patients with CMV ophthalmic disease in whom anti-CMV maintenance therapy has been discontinuedshould continue to undergo regular ophthalmologic monitoring at 3- to 6-month intervals for early detectionof CMV relapse and for immune uveitis (AII*). For patients with any CMV disease, CMVviral load or other markers of CMV infection (such as antigenemia or viral DNA tests) are not wellstandardized; their role in predicting relapse remains to be defined, and they are not recommended forroutine monitoring (BIII).87,88Reinitiating Secondary ProphylaxisRelapse of CMV retinitis occurs in adults whose anti-CMV maintenance therapies have been discontinuedand whose CD4 cell counts have decreased to <50 cells/mm3.74Reinstitution of secondary prophylaxis isrecommended for HIV-infected adults when CD4 cell counts fall to <100 cells/mm3. For HIV-infectedchildren in whom secondary prophylaxis has been discontinued because of immune reconstitution, secondaryprophylaxis should be reinstituted in those aged <6 years when the CD4 percentage decreases to <15%, andin those aged 6 years when the CD4 cell count decreases to <100 cells/mm3(BIII).References1.Stagno S, Reynolds DW, Pass RF, Alford CA.

In the United States, most cases are reported between early summer and early fall and areassociated with recreational water activities and camping.1Humans are the principal reservoir of G. intestinalis(also known as Giardia lambliaor Giardia duodenalis)infection. The parasite is found in many animals species, although the role of zoonotic transmission is still beingunraveled.2It is a flagellated protozoan with two forms: trophozoites and cysts. The infectious andenvironmentally resistant form is the cyst. After ingestion, each Giardiacyst produces two trophozoites in theproximal portion of the small intestine. Detached trophozoites pass through the intestinal tract, and form smooth,oval-shaped, thin-walled infectious cysts that are passed in feces. Duration of cyst excretion is usually self-limited but can vary and excretion may last for months. Studies in adults have shown that ingestion of as few as10 to 100 fecally derived cysts is sufficient to initiate infection.3Giardiacysts are infectious immediately uponbeing excreted in feces and remain viable for at least 3 months in water at 4\u00b0C.4Freezing does not eliminateinfectivity completely, whereas heating, drying, or submersing in seawater are likely to do so.4,5G. intestinalisis more common in certain high-risk groups, including children, employees of childcare centers,patients and staff of institutions for people with developmental disabilities, men who have sex with men,people who ingest contaminated drinking water or recreational water, travelers to disease-endemic areas of theworld, close contacts of infected people, and people exposed to infected domestic and wild animals (i.e., dogs,cats, cattle, deer, and beavers).6There is a paucity of information on giardiasis in HIV-infected children,although Giardiahas been associated with diarrhea in children with AIDS.7,8Infection with Giardiacan occur directly by the fecal-oral route or indirectly via ingestion of contaminatedPanel's RecommendationsGiardiasis can be prevented by practicing good hygiene, avoiding drinking or swimming in water that may be contaminated, and noteating food that may be contaminated (AIII).Antiretroviral treatment of HIV-infected children to reverse or prevent severe immunodeficiency is the primary mode of prevention ofsevere enteric giardiasis (AII*). Combination antiretroviral therapy should be part of primary initial treatment for giardiasis in HIV-infected children (AII*).Dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected (AIII). Patients with chronic diarrhea should be monitored for malabsorption leading to malnutrition (AIII). Tinidazole (AII)and nitazoxanide (AI)are giardiasis inchildren.Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or morewell-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data inchildrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJ-2water or food, but water contaminated with cysts appears to be the major reservoir and vehicle for spread of theparasite.1Most waterborne outbreaks have been related to ingestion of surface water treated by inadequatepurification systems.9Drinking untreated mountain stream water is a risk for hikers. Person-to-person spreadoccurs frequently in childcare centers and in families of children with diarrhea.10,6Antigiardial host defensesare B-cell dependent, with secretory immunoglobulin A playing a major role in immunity. Humoralimmunodeficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, predispose tochronic symptomatic disease.11Symptoms of giardiasis in HIV-infected individuals appear to be no more severe than those in HIV-negativeindividuals, and giardiasis is not typically considered a major cause of enteritis in HIV-infected patients.12However, with progressive immunosuppression and reduced lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts, the risk ofsymptomatic Giardiainfections increases. Studies in adults have demonstrated that enteritis due to G.intestinalisis a frequent event among AIDS patients, especially in the most advanced stage of disease.13Research in HIV-infected adults from countries where giardiasis is endemic demonstrate that risk of Giardiainfections and severity of disease increased with increasing immunosuppression and lower CD4 cell counts.14,15In a study of 75 HIV-infected adults in India, G. intestinaliswas the most commonly isolated parasite, andpatients with lower CD4 cell counts presented with significantly more enteric disease and chronic diarrhea.16Inanother study of 43 adults naive to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), G. intestinaliswas detected inone-third of patients and was significantly associated with lower CD4 cell counts (OR = 3.0 for CD4 counts100 cells/mm3).17A case-control study comparing giardiasis in HIV-infected adults in Brazil before and afterthe era of cART demonstrates that the incidence of enteric diseases caused by Giardiadecreased after initiationof such treatment.14Given the evidence, it is reasonable to recommend initiation of cART and immunereconstitution as a primary mode of prevention (AII*).Clinical ManifestationsThe incubation period usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days.6Symptomatic infection with G.intestinaliscan cause a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Children usually present with short-lasting,acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Others have amore protracted intermittent course, characterized by foul-smelling stools associated with flatulence,abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss,failure to thrive, and anemia in children. Stools can be profuse and watery initially and later become greasy andfoul smelling. Blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes are absent. Varying degrees of malabsorption can occur, andabnormal stool patterns can alternate with periods of constipation and normal bowel movements. Post-Giardiainfection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients.18This syndrome may take several weeks toresolve and can contribute to malnutrition in children.Asymptomatic infection is common.19Extraintestinal invasion is unusual, but trophozoites occasionallymigrate into bile or pancreatic ducts. Reactive arthritis has been associated with giardiasis.20DiagnosisAlthough performance of diagnostic tests has not been evaluated in HIV-infected children, it is expected to besimilar to other populations. A definitive diagnosis is established by detection of Giardiatrophozoites or cystsin stool specimens, duodenal fluid or small-bowel tissue by microscopic examination using staining methodssuch as trichrome; fluorescent stool antigens using enzymeimmunoassays (EIA); or, by using molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction.21,22Identificationof both trophozoites and cysts can be made on direct smears of concentrated specimens of stool. Appropriatelyconducted direct examination of stool establishes the diagnosis in up to 70% of patients with a singleexamination and in 85% with a second examination. Identification of Giardiacan be difficult because ofintermittent excretion of cysts. Stool specimens should be examined within 1 hour after being passed.Trophozoites are more likely to be present in unformed stools as a result of rapid bowel transit time. Cysts, butnot trophozoites, are stable outside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJ-3When giardiasis is suspected and stool specimens are negative, aspiration, biopsy, or both, of the duodenum orupper part of the jejunum should be performed. In a fresh specimen, trophozoites usually can be visualized ondirect wet mount. The commercially available Entero-Test is an alternative method for obtaining duodenal fluiddirectly.23Duodenal biopsy is the optimal method for diagnosis in patients with clinical characteristics butnegative stool and duodenal fluid samples.Use of polyclonal antibodies against Giardia-specific antigens has improved diagnostictesting. Studies comparing EIA kits for detecting Giardiaantigen in stool showed a sensitivity of 87% to 100%and specificity of 100%. All fluorescent antibody tests had 100% sensitivity and specificity.24These rapiddiagnostic tests can be positive before and after detection of organisms by microscopic examination. DFA andEIA were equally sensitive, and both were more sensitive than microscopy of permanently stained smears afterconcentration in formalin ethyl acetate.25Most recommend testing and microscopy instead ofmicroscopy alone (AIII). Specific antibodies to Giardiahave been detected and quantified by immunodiffusion,hemagglutination, immunofluorescence, and EIA, but a serologic test is not available commercially.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureBecause Giardiaorganisms are most likely transferred from contaminated water, food, or contact with aninfected person or animal, avoidance of untreated water sources is recommended (AIII). This recommendationis especially important in individuals with severe immunosuppression. Hand washing with soap and water afterexposure to potentially fecally contaminated material or contact with an infected person or animal is alsorecommended (AIII). Alcohol-based gels are ineffective against the cysts of Giardiaand should not besubstituted for hand washing when exposure to Giardiais a concern.In a hospital, standard precautions (i.e., use of gloves and hand washing after removal of gloves) should besufficient to prevent transmission from an infected patient to a susceptible HIV-infected person.When traveling where water may be contaminated or where the safety of drinking water is in doubt, travelers,hikers, and campers should be advised of methods to make water safe for drinking. These measures includeusing bottled water, disinfecting water by heating it to a rolling boil for 1 minute, or using a filter that has beentested and rated by National Safety Foundation Standard 53 or Standard 58 for cyst and oocyst reduction.Waterborne outbreaks can be prevented with a combination of adequate filtration of water sources,chlorination, and maintenance of water distribution systems.1,9Travelers should also be advised of the potentialfor transmission of giardiasis during use of contaminated recreational water (e.g., lakes, rivers, inadequatelytreated swimming pools).Preventing First Episode of DiseaseNo chemoprophylactic regimens are known to be effective in preventing giardiasis. However, because the riskof acquisition of giardiasis and the severity of infection increase with the severity of immunosuppression,cART is a primary modality for prevention in HIV-infected children to prevent or reverse (AII*).Discontinuing Primary RecommendationsTreating DiseaseSupportive nutritional supplementation shouldbe provided (AIII). Effective cART and anti-parasitic therapy are the primary initial treatments for theseinfections in HIV-infected children and adults (AII*).14Antimotility agents should be used with caution inGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJ-4young children (CIII).Tinidazole (AII). The therapeutic efficacy against Giardiaof metronidazole led to development of othernitroimidazole derivatives, such as tinidazole and secnidazole. These agents have the advantage of longer half-lives, making them suitable for single-daily-dose therapies. A single, 2-g dose (or the equivalent pediatric dosingof 50 mg/kg in a single dose) of tinidazole has demonstrated cure rates ranging from 80% to 100%, and is alsoassociated with improved compliance.26-28Tinidazole is approved for use in children aged 3 years and older. Thedrug is available in tablets, which can be crushed in flavored syrup for patients unable to swallow tablets. Nitazoxanide (AI)is approved in the United States for treatment of infections due to G. intestinalisin patientsaged 1 year or older. Two randomized, controlled clinical trials in HIV-uninfected children demonstratednitazoxanide's efficacy against placebo and its comparability with metronidazole and mebendazole in treatinggiardiasis in children, with eradication rates G. intestinalisof 71% to 94% with nitazoxanide treatment.29Metronidazole (AI)was determined to against giardiasis in 1962. Since then, metronidazole andother nitroimidazoles have been used by clinicians as the mainstay of therapy of giardiasis. Metronidazole is thedrug most often used for treatment worldwide. Children have been included in many of the clinical trials, withoutcomes similar to those in adults (median efficacy, 94%) for the 5- to 10-day regimens.30Metronidazole is notavailable in a standard liquid form, but a suspension can be prepared by thoroughly crushing metronidazoletablets, using glycerin as a lubricant, and suspending the mixture in cherry syrup.31In spite of its widespread andaccepted use against Giardia, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has never approved it for this indication.Quinacrine is usually used in combination therapy for cases in which treatment failure is suspected.32Theseverity of side effects has prevented clinicians from using it as an initial therapeutic choice or first-linealternative, particularly in children. A bitter taste and vomiting have led to lower efficacy in children, probablydue to low compliance. Yellow/orange discoloration of the skin, sclerae, and urine affects 4% to 5% of thosetaking quinacrine, beginning about 1 week after starting treatment, and can last up to 4 months afterdiscontinuation of therapy. Other common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness.Quinacrine can precipitate hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)-deficient individuals.33Quinacrine is no longer available in the United States and has been discontinued by the manufacturer.34Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Patients with chronic diarrhea should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of volume depletion,electrolyte and weight loss, and malnutrition. In severely ill patients, total parenteral nutrition may be indicated(BIII). Adverse effects reported with tinidazole are not as common as with metronidazole but do include bitter taste,vertigo, and GI upset.30Nitazoxanide is generally well tolerated, and no significant adverse events have been noted in human trials.Adverse events have been mild and transient and principally related to the GI tract, such as abdominal pain,diarrhea, and nausea. Nitazoxanide has been well tolerated up to the maximum dose of 4 g when taken with orwithout food, but the frequency of GI side effects increases significantly with the dose level.29The most common side effects of metronidazole treatment include headache, vertigo, nausea, and a metallictaste in the mouth. Nausea occurs in 5% to 15% of patients given standard multiday courses. In addition,pancreatitis, central nervous system toxicity at high doses, and transient, reversible neutropenia have beenattributed to metronidazole.30Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has not been associated with giardiasis or its treatment.Managing Treatment FailureThe most important steps for management of treatment failure are supportive treatment, optimization of cART toachieve full virologic suppression, and modification of antiparasitic therapy (AII*). Treatment failures have beenGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJ-5reported with all of the common anti-Giardiaagents. It is important for clinicians to differentiate betweenresistance to treatment and reinfection, which is common in endemic regions and situations of poor fecal-oralhygiene. Resistance to most anti-Giardiaagents has been documented but there is no consistent correlationbetween in vitroresistance and clinical failure.30Clinically resistant strains have been treated with longer repeatedcourses or higher doses of the original agent or a drug from a different class to avoid potential cross-resistance.Combination regimens using metronidazole-albendazole, metronidazole-quinacrine, or other active drugs orgiving a nitroimidazole plus quinacrine for at least 2 weeks have proven successful against refractory infection. InAIDS patients with severe giardiasis, prolonged or combination therapy may be necessary (BII*).32,35Preventing RecurrenceNo pharmacologic interventions are known to be effective in preventing recurrence of giardiasis (CIII).Reinfection is frequent in endemic areas, in situations of poor hygiene, or inadequate treatment ofcontaminated water (e.g., private wells). This can be prevented by practicing good hand hygiene everywhere,but particularly after toilet use and handling of soiled diapers. Hand hygiene should also be practiced beforefood preparation and ingestion. To reduce risk of disease transmission, children with diarrhea should beexcluded from child care settings until the diarrhea has stopped. Children with giardiasis should not userecreational water venues for 2 weeks after symptoms resolve.

Testing should be repeatedin late pregnancy for HBsAg-negative women at high risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (e.g., injection-drug users, women withintercurrent sexually transmitted diseases, women with multiple sex partners) (BIII).All infants born to HBsAg-positive women, including HIV-co-infected women, should receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immuneglobulin within 12 hours after birth, a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine at age 1 to 2 months, and a third dose at age 6 months (AI). HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (AII).HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents should be tested for quantitative anti-HBs and HBsAg 1 to 2 months after completing thevaccination series. If anti-HBs levels are <10 mIU/mL and the HBsAg result is negative, they should be revaccinated with a second, 3-doseseries of HBV vaccine followed in 1 to 2 months by repeat testing for anti-HBs (AIII).Antiviral therapy is not warranted in children without necroinflammatory liver disease (BIII). Treatment is not recommended for childrenwith immunotolerant chronic HBV infection (i.e, HBeAg positive, normal serum levels despite detectable HBV DNA) orinactive carriers (i.e. HBeAg negative, normal serum transaminase levels despite detectable HBV DNA) (BII). Indications for treatment of chronic HBV infection in HIV-co-infected children are the same as in HBV-infected and HIV-uninfected children: Evidence of ongoing HBV viral replication, as indicated by serum HBV DNA (>10,000-100,000 units/ml for >6 months) andpersistent elevation of serum transaminase levels (at least twice the upper limit of normal for >6 months), or Evidence of chronic hepatitis on liver biopsy (BII). Standard interferon-alfa (IFN-), IFN-2a or IFN-2b, is recommended for treating chronic HBV infection with compensated liver disease inHIV-uninfected children aged 2 years to <12 years who warrant treatment (AI). IFN-therapy or oral antiviral therapy with adefovir ortenofovir is recommended for treating chronic HBV infection with compensated liver disease in HIV-uninfected children aged 12 years(AI). IFN-therapy in combination with oral antiviral therapy cannot be recommended for pediatric HBV infection in HIV-uninfectedchildren until more data are available (BII). In HIV/HBV coinfected children who do not require combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for their HIV infection, IFN-therapy is thepreferred agent to treat chronic hepatitis B (BIII), whereas adefovir can be considered in children age 12 years or older (BIII).Treatment options for HIV/HBV co-infected children who meet criteria for HBV therapy and who are already receiving lamivudine- oremtricitabine-containing, HIV-suppressive cART include standard IFN- therapy (BIII), or adefovir if the child can receive adult dosing(BIII), or use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) (with continued lamivudine or emtricitabine) cART regimen in children aged2 years (BIII). HIV/HBV-coinfected children should not be given lamivudine or emtricitabine for treatment of chronic HBV unless accompanied byadditional anti-HIV drugs in a cART regimen (CIII).For HIV/HBV-coinfected children who require treatment of both infections, a cART regimen that includes lamivudine (or emtricitabine) isrecommended (BIII). For HIV/HBV-coinfected children aged 2 years who require treatment for HIV but not HBV infection or treatment for both infections, acART regimen that includes tenofovir and an anti-HBV nucleoside (either lamivudine or emtricitabine) can be considered (BIII).The dose of lamivudine required to treat HIV infection is higher than that used to treat pediatric chronic hepatitis B infection; therefore, thehigher dose of lamivudine should be used in HIV/HBV-coinfected children to avoid development of lamivudine-resistant HIV (AIII).Lamivudine and emtricitabine should be considered interchangeable for treatment of chronic hepatitis B and not additive (BIII). For hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients who are HIV-uninfected, treatment with anti-HBV drugs should be continued until HBeAgseroconversion has been achieved and >6 months of additional treatment has been completed after the appearance of anti-HBeAg (BI*).However, treatment with lamivudine or other anti-HBV drugs with anti-HIV activity should be continued indefinitely in children with HIV/HBVco-infection, even if HBeAg seroconversion occurs (CIII).If discontinuation of therapy for chronic HBV results in hepatic flare, therapy for chronic HBV infection should be reinstituted (BIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or morerandomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed,nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom oneor more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-2EpidemiologyChronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is defined as persistence of serum hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg) for >6 months. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection after acute infection correlatesinversely with age and immune competence at HBV infection. In HBV-infected patients, chronic HBVinfection develops in about 90% of infants, 25% to 50% of children aged 1 to 5 years, and 6% to 10% ofolder children and adolescents; individuals with immunocompromising conditions (e.g., renal failure) arealso at increased risk of developing chronic HBV infection.1-4Infant and childhood HBV infection can be acquired perinatally, parenterally, or postnatally throughhousehold contact. It can also be acquired parentally or through sexual transmission. HIV/HBV-coinfectedpregnant women can transmit HIV , HBV , or both to their infants; it is not known if maternal HIV coinfectionmodifies the risk of HBV perinatal transmission. Horizontal transmission of HBV can occur throughinterpersonal contact with non-intact skin or mucous membranes with blood or body fluids that contain HBV(e.g., injuries, wounds) or from sharing household objects (e.g., toothbrushes, razors). Universal hepatitis Bvaccination of newborns has dramatically lowered chronic HBV infection in children and reduced the ratesof HBV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. The risk from blood transfusions in countrieswith blood bank screening is estimated to be very low (1.37 per million donations).5Maternal HBV infectionis not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Adolescents are at risk of HBV infection through sexual activity or injection-drug use. In a study of HIV-infected adolescents infected through sexual activity or injection-drug use at 43 Pediatric AIDS Clinical TrialGroup centers, 19% had evidence of current or resolved HBV infection; the rate of current or resolved HBVinfection in HIV-infected adolescent girls was twice the U.S. population-based rates for HIV-uninfectedadolescent girls and, for adolescent boys, nearly seven times higher.6Substance abuse and sexual activityincrease the risk of HIV/HBV coinfection in adolescents, particularly in men who have sex with men (MSM).7Most children who acquire HBV perinatally are initially immunotolerant to HBV and may remainimmunotolerant for a decade or more. Although these children have high HBV DNA levels, serumtransaminase levels are usually normal, and necroinflammatory liver disease is minimal. Childhood-acquiredHBV infection, in contrast, is characterized by lower HBV DNA levels, greater serum transaminaseelevation, and higher necroinflammatory liver disease than in perinatally acquired HBV infection.8Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004, indicate that 0.51% (95% CI:0.3%-0.9%) of children aged 6 to 19 years had ever been infected with HBV .9Only 1 small case series existson the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in HIV-infected children at an inner city hospital in the UnitedStates, finding 2.6% prevalence in 228 HIV-infected children.10Clinical ManifestationsMost acute HBV infections in children are asymptomatic.11Prodromal symptoms of lethargy, malaise,fatigue, nausea, and anorexia can occur. Jaundice and right-upper-quadrant pain can follow (papular acrodermatitis), urticaria,macular be seen in acute HBV infection. Extrahepatic manifestationsassociated with circulating immune complexes that have been reported in HBV-infected children includearthralgias, arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, thrombocytopenia, and glomerulonephritis. cases have occurred during perinatal and childhood HBV infection.12,13Most children with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic. One quarter of infants and children withchronic HBV eventually will develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).14,15However, thesesequelae usually develop over 2 to 3 decades and rarely occur during childhood.16,17Development of HCCcorrelates with HBV DNA levels and duration of HBV infection, with the highest risk in people infected inearly life.18HIV/HBV-coinfected adults are at increased risk of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and liver-related mortality.19Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-3DiagnosisTesting for HBV infection should be performed in any child whose mother is known to be infected with HBVas well as children from groups at high risk of HBV infection, including those who are HIV-infected and whoare foreign-born in regions of high and intermediate HBV endemicity (HBsAg-positive prevalence 2%).Adolescents and young adults with HIV infection, histories of injection-drug use, high-risk sexual contact, orMSM, should also undergo testing for HBV infection. Based on high prevalence of HBV infection in HIV-infected children and adolescents, HIV-infected children and adolescents and HIV-uninfected infants born toHBsAg-positive women should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (AII).6,7,20HBsAg is the first marker detectable in serum, appearing 30 days after infection; it precedes the elevation ofserum aminotransferase levels and the onset of symptoms. Necroinflammatory liver disease then can occur,during which serum transaminase levels increase, along with high HBV DNA levels and HBeAg positivity.HBeAg correlates with viral replication, DNA polymerase activity, infectivity, and increased severity of liverdisease. Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-hepatitis B core antigen [HBc] immunoglobulin M [IgM])appears 2 weeks after HBsAg and the anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (IgG) persists for life, but should not beconfused with passively transferred maternal anti-HBc IgG that can be detectable in the infant up to ages 12to 18 months or later. In self-limited infections, HBsAg is usually eliminated in 1 to 2 months, and hepatitisB surface antibody (anti-HBs) develops during convalescence. Anti-HBs indicates immunity from HBVinfection. Despite immunity, HBV is incorporated into the human genome, where it can reactivate years laterif a person becomes immunocompromised.21After recovery from natural infection, both anti-HBs and anti-HBc usually are present. In patients who become chronically infected (i.e., persistently positive for HBsAgbeyond 6 months), anti-HBs is undetectable. Patients who have been vaccinated may have detectable anti-HBs but not anti-HBc or HBsAg. Patients who may have been inadvertently vaccinated after recovery fromHBV infection should have detectable anti-HBs and anti-HBc upon post-vaccination testing (see Table 1,located at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm#tab1, for review of interpretation ofserologic test results for HBV infection).HBeAg seroconversion, defined as loss of HBeAg, followed by the production of antibodies to HBeAg (e.g.,anti-HBe), usually heralds transition of the HBV-infected person to the inactive carrier state (HBsAg remainspositive); however, some patients may develop HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis. Variable rates of HBeAgseroconversion have been reported in children infected perinatally with HBV ranging from 10% to 75% in thefirst 2 to 4 decades but it is very infrequent in children aged <3 years.22,23In contrast, higher rates of HBeAgseroconversion occur in childhood-acquired HBV infection, with 70% to 80% children acquiring anti-HBe bythe second decade of life.16HBeAg seroconversion usually is followed by reduction in serum HBV DNA levels,an initial increase and then subsequent normalization of serum transaminase levels, followed by resolution ofnecroinflammatory liver disease.16Development of cirrhosis and HCC is more common in patients with delayedHBeAg seroconversion.24HBeAg-negative infection (pre-core mutant) is uncommon in children.3HBV DNA is a marker for HBV replication. In the active phase of chronic hepatitis B, high HBV DNAlevels have been associated with necroinflammatory liver disease. Children infected perinatally, however,may remain in an immunotolerant phase with high levels of HBV DNA without evidence of liver damageand normal serum aminotransferase levels. Quantitative DNA assays may help determine the need fortreatment and for evaluating treatment response. Although not necessary for diagnostic purposes, liver biopsymay be useful to assess the degree of liver damage and determine the need for treatment.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureAll pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg during the first prenatal visit (AI). Testing should berepeated in late pregnancy for HBsAg-negative women at high risk of HBV infection (e.g., injection-drugusers, women with intercurrent sexually transmitted diseases, women with multiple sex partners) (BIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-4Pregnancy is not a contraindication or precaution to hepatitis B vaccination for women who have notpreviously been vaccinated; current hepatitis B vaccines contain noninfectious HBsAg and should cause norisk to the fetus. Pregnant women who are identified as being at risk of HBV infection during pregnancyshould be vaccinated.25Preventing DiseaseAll infants born to HBV-infected women, including HIV co-infected women, should receive hepatitis Bvaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours after birth, a second dose of hepatitis Bvaccine at age 1 to 2 months, and a third dose at age 6 months, but not before age 24 weeks (AI)(Figures 1and 2).26For preterm infants weighing <2000 g, the initial vaccine dose (birth dose) should not be counted aspart of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in theseinfants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when theinfant reaches 1 month of age (AI).26In addition, term and preterm (birth weight <2000 g) infants born towomen whose HBsAg status is unknown at delivery should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccinewithin 12 hours of birth. Infants weighing <2000 g should also receive HBIG within 12 hours of birth.Women with unknown HBsAg status should be tested as soon as possible. HBIG should be administered toterm infants born to women whose HBsAg-test is found to be positive, or within 7 days of life when amother's test results remain unknown.26A 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine regimen is 70% to 95% effective in preventing HBV infection in HBV-exposedinfants and combined with HBIG, is 85% to 95% effective. Postvaccination testing for anti-HBs and HBsAgshould be performed at age 9 to 18 months in infants born to HBsAg-positive women (BIII). The level ofanti-HBs that is considered protective is 10 mIU/mL. Infants who are HBsAg-negative and have anti-HBslevels <10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a second 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine and retested 1to 2 months after the final vaccine dose (BIII).26The 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine also is recommended for allchildren and adolescents aged <19 yearswho were not previously vaccinated. However, antibody responses to hepatitis B vaccination may bediminished in HIV-infected children, especially in older children or those with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell)counts <200 cells/mm3.27,28For this reason, HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents should be tested for quantitative anti-HBs 1to 2 months after completing the vaccination series and, if anti-HBs levels are <10 mIU/mL, revaccinatedwith a second 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine (AIII). Limited data suggest modified hepatitis B vaccine dosing regimens, including a doubling of the standardantigen dose and use of combined hepatitis A and B (HA V/HBV) vaccine, can increase response rates inHIV-uninfected non-responders29and in HIV-infected adults and adolescents.30-32Therefore, use of double-dose HBV vaccine or combination HA V/HBV vaccine may be considered for HBV vaccination inHIV-infected adolescents (BI).Waning of HBsAb levels after HBV re-immunization in HIV-infected children iscommon, but the need for booster doses of hepatitis B vaccine in HIV-infected individuals has not beendetermined.33The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Disease recommends annualanti-HBs testing and booster doses when the anti-HBs levels decline to <10 mIU/mL for hemodialysispatients and other immunocompromised people at continued risk of hepatitis B infection (CIII).34HBV-infected children should be advised not to share toothbrushes or other personal-care articles that might becontaminated with blood (e.g., razors, tweezers, nail clippers) and to cover open or draining wounds.Although efficiency of sexual transmission of HBV is relatively low, safe-sex practices should be encouragedfor all sexually active HIV-infected adolescents and young adults; barrier precautions (e.g., latex condoms)are recommended to reduce the risk of exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens, including HBV .Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-5Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseGeneral IssuesAll children should receive HA V vaccination at age 12 to 23 months with the 2 doses in the seriesadministered at least6 months apart.35Children who are not fully vaccinated by age 2 years can bevaccinated at subsequent visits. The hepatitis A vaccine is also recommended for children aged 24 monthswho were not previously vaccinated and who have chronic liver disease (including chronic HBV infection)and other chronic diseases (Figures 1 and 2).Treatment of pediatric HBV infection should be based on multiple factors, including a child's age, age atacquisition of infection, HBV DNA levels, and serum transaminase levels. Antiviral therapy regimens forchronic HBV are approved only for children aged >2 years who have compensated liver disease.HIV-infected children who are not receiving anti-HBV therapy should be closely monitored with determinationof serum aminotransferase levels every 6 months. If serum transaminase levels are persistently elevated (morethan twofold the upper limit of normal for 6 months), HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA levels should beobtained before the initiation of anti-HBV therapy. Assessment of serum transaminases and HBV DNA levelsover time can identify patients who may be in the process of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and whowould thus not require treatment. Liver biopsy is not required before treatment but may help to determine theseverity of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and to exclude other causes of liver disease.36,37No clear recommendations exist for treating chronic childhood HBV infection. HBV-infected children often havemilder disease than adults and may show spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion. Few large randomized controlledtrials exist of antiviral therapies for chronic HBV infection in childhood. Moreover, the long-term safety of manyof the agents used to treat chronic HBV infection in adults is unknown in children. However, pediatric liverexperts at a 2010 consensus meeting recommended that anti-HBV treatment be considered in children aged >2years with chronic HBV infection and a duration of necroinflammatory liver disease >6 months.36Indications for treatment of chronic HBV infection in HIV-coinfected children are the same as in HBV-infected, HIV-uninfected children: Evidence of ongoing HBV viral replication, HBV DNA (>10,000-100,000 IU/mL),irrespective of HBeAg persistent elevation of serum transaminase levels (atleast twice the upper limit of normal for >6 months), orEvidence of chronic hepatitis on liver biopsy (BII).3,38Children without necroinflammatory liver disease do not warrant anti-HBV therapy (BIII). Anti-HBVtreatment is not recommended for children with immunotolerant chronic HBV infection (i.e., HBeAgpositive, normal serum transaminase levels despite detectable DNA) or inactive carriers (i.e. HBeAgnegative, normal serum transaminase levels despite detectable HBV DNA) (BII). The goals of treatment for children with chronic HBV infection are identical to those for adults: suppressionof HBV replication, normalization of serum HBeAg seroconversion (inthose who are HBeAg positive), preservation of liver architecture, and prevention of long-term sequelae,such as cirrhosis and HCC.Treatment of chronic HBV infection is evolving; consultation with providers with expertise in treatingchronic HBV infection in children is recommended.Treating Chronic Hepatitis B Infection in Adults and AdolescentsSeven medications have been approved to treat chronic HBV infection in adults: interferons and the nucleotide analogues,Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-6adefovir and medicationemtricitabine also has significant activity against HBV , although it is not approved for this indication. Preferredinitial therapies for adults who have chronic HBV without HIV infection include pegylated interferon-alfa(PEG-IFN-), entecavir, or In HIV-infected adults who have chronic HBV infection,treatment for hepatitis B should be considered for those who are HBeAg-positive with HBV DNA 20,000IU/mL (>105copies/mL), serum transaminase elevation, and those with evidence of cirrhosis or fibrosis.19Treatment of HBVinfection is now recommended for all adults with concomitant HIV infection (Adult Opportunistic InfectionandAntiretroviral Guidelines). This has not been recommended for children, however, and given the lack of data onthis issue, a similar recommendation cannot be made at this point.Treatment options for HBV in HIV-infected patients must account for the goals of therapy and the impacttreatment may have on both HIV and HBV replication. In coinfected patients who require treatment forchronic HBV , HIV , or both, many experts would initiate a fully suppressive combined antiretroviral therapy(cART) regimen that includes two drugs active against HBV (tenofovir and either lamivudine oremtricitabine). This approach may reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS),particularly in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. The combination of tenofovir with lamivudine wasdemonstrated to be more effective in suppressing HBV in coinfected adults than either drug alone andprevents development of lamivudine resistance.39In instances in which HIV treatment cannot be given buttreatment of HBV infection is needed, PEG-IFN- can be used alone because it does not lead to developmentof drug-resistant HIV or HBV mutants. Anti-HBV drugs with anti-HIV activity should not be given in theabsence of a fully suppressive ARV regimen, because anti-HBV drugs such as tenofovir, entecavir,emtricitabine, lamivudine, and likely telbivudine given without additional ARV drugs in an HIV-suppressiveregimen likely would produce resistant HIV in the recipient (see Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment ofOpportunistic Infection in Adolescents and Adults with HIV Infection).Treating Chronic Hepatitis B Infection in HIV-Uninfected ChildrenOnly young children (1-11 years old) (AI).40,41Four other drugs are approved for treatment ofchronic HBV in older children: adefovir and tenofovir (children aged 12 years) and entecavir and telbivudine(children aged 16 years) (AI).42-45While tenofovir is approved for treatment of HIV infection in childrenaged 2 years, it is not approved for treatment of HBV in children under 12 years old.The limited pediatric trials of these agents show that although they are well-tolerated by children, responserates are similar to adults (~25% HBeAg seroconversion), and treatment generally does not eliminate HBVinfection.46,47There is some evidence for enhanced loss of HBsAg in children treated with IFN in comparisonto those treated with lamivudine.40,48In HIV-uninfected children, HBeAg seroconversion rates after 1 year oftreatment are similar.3IFN- treatment is administered for only 6 months but requires subcutaneousadministration and has more frequent side effects, including growth impairment. Although lamivudine isadministered orally and has a lower rate of side effects, it requires a longer duration of therapy and has a highrate of resistance if taken for an extended time.3Although various combination regimens involving sequential or concurrent lamivudine and standard or PEG-IFN- have been studied in children or adults with chronic HBV , superior treatment response withcombination therapy over monotherapy with standard or PEG-IFN- or lamivudine has not beendemonstrated; however, lamivudine resistance rates may be lower with combination therapy.49-58A recentstudy of children with immunotolerant HBV infection suggested possible benefit from sequential lamivudineand IFN- therapy, with 78% of patients clearing HBV DNA by the end of treatment.57However, IFN- (standard or pegylated) therapy in combination with oral antiviral therapy cannot berecommended for HBV infection in HIV-uninfected children until more data are available (BII).Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-7Treating HBV/HIV-Coinfected ChildrenNone of the clinical studies of treatment of chronic HBV infection have specifically studied children withHIV/HBV coinfection. Choice of antiviral therapy for the HIV/HBV coinfected child involves consideration ofwhether HBV treatment, HIV treatment or treatment for both infections is warranted. Further study is needed toinform recommendations for antiviral therapy of children and adolecents with HIV/HBV coinfection.If treatment of chronic HBV but not HIV infection is indicated, standard IFN- is the preferred agent (BIII).Adefovir also can be considered in children aged 12 years or older (BIII). Antiviral drugs with activity againstHIV (e.g., lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir, entecavir, and likely telbivudine) should be avoided in theabsence of a fully suppressive cART regimen to prevent development of drug-resistant HIV mutations. Despitein vitroevidence of anti-HIV activity of adefovir, there is no clinical evidence that adefovir monotherapyinduces HIV drug resistance.59If treatment of HIV infection but not chronic HBV is indicated, avoiding use of a cART regimen that containsonly one ARV drug with activity against HBV (e.g., lamivudine, emtricitabine, or tenofovir) can preventdevelopment of HBV drug resistance. Thus, in coinfected children who can receive tenofovir, use of a cARTregimen that contains two drugs effective against HBV (tenofovir plus lamivudine or emtricitabine) can beconsidered (BIII). However, for coinfected children aged < 2 years who need HIV but not HBV treatment,many experts would use a standard cART regimen that includes lamivudine (or emtricitabine). The optimaltreatment approach needs further study. If treatment for both HIV and chronic HBV is indicated and the child is lamivudine-naive, a cART regimen thatincludes lamivudine (or emtricitabine) is recommended (BIII). A regimen containing tenofovir and lamivudine(or emtricitabine) should be considered for use in HIV-infected children aged 2 years, based on extrapolationfrom evidence in adults with HIV/HBV coinfection and adolescents with HBV monoinfection42but limited byabsence of data evaluating use of tenofovir for treatment of HBV infection in HBV-monoinfected or HIV/HBV-coinfected children or HIV/HBV-coinfected adolescents (BIII). If treatment for HIV and chronic HBV is indicated, a child is already receiving HIV-suppressive cARTincluding lamivudine (or emtricitabine), and plasma HBV DNA lamivudine resistance canbe assumed. However, because HBV drug-resistant isolates may have lower replicative capacity, some expertsrecommend no change in therapy, although this recommendation is controversial (CIII). Treatment options forsuch children who require HBV therapy include adding standard IFN-(BIII), or adefovir in children who canreceive adult dosing (BIII), or use of tenofovir (with continued lamivudine or emtricitabine) in the cARTregimen in children aged 2 years (BIII). Data are insufficient on other anti-HBV drugs in children to make recommendations.InterferonsStandard IFN--2a or -2b has received the most study in children who have chronic HBV infection (withoutHIV infection) and is recommended for treating chronic HBV infection with compensated liver disease inHIV-uninfected children aged 2 years who warrant treatment (AI). In a review of 6 randomized clinical trials in 240 HBV-infected children aged >1.5 years, IFN- therapyresulted in HBV DNA clearance in 35% of treated children, HBeAg clearance in 10%, and normalization ofserum transaminase levels in 39% at treatment completion.60Six to 18 months after therapy discontinuation,29% of children had persistent clearance of HBV DNA, and 23% demonstrated HBeAg clearance. Childrenmost likely to respond to IFN treatment are younger and have higher baseline serum transaminase levels andlower baseline HBV DNA levels.46,61-63Response is less (10%) in those with normal serum transaminaselevels, high HBV DNA levels, HBV genotypes C or D, or HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. IFN- therapy is the preferred agent to treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-coinfected children who do notrequire cART for their HIV infection (BIII).The standard course of IFN- therapy for HIV-uninfected children is 24 weeks. PEG-IFN-, which results inGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-8more sustained plasma interferon concentrations and can be administered by injection once weekly for 48 weeks,has proven superior to standard IFN- in treating HBV-infected adults.50,64However, the limited data on use ofpegylated IFN- in children come from treatment of hepatitis C infection, and appropriate dosing information isnot available for use of pegylated IFN- to treat chronic HBV infection in children.65-67LamivudineLamivudine (3TC) is an oral nucleoside analogue that inhibits HBV replication. It is approved for use inchildren aged 2 to 17 years who have compensated liver disease from chronic HBV infection. In a placebo-controlled trial in HIV-uninfected children with chronic HBV infection, lamivudine was well tolerated, withvirologic response (clearance of HBV DNA and HBeAg) in 23% of children receiving 52 weeks oflamivudine therapy, compared with 13% in placebo recipients.41Response rates were higher (35%) forchildren with baseline serum than two times normal.41In a 2-year, open-label extensionof this study, 213 children who remained HBeAg-positive after 1 year of therapy were continued onlamivudine treatment; virologic response was seen in 21% of the original lamivudine recipients, comparedwith 30% of prior placebo recipients, indicating that additional clinical response could occur over time withprolonged treatment.68However, longer duration of lamivudine therapy also was associated with progressivedevelopment of lamivudine-resistant HBV with locus of HBV DNA polymerase.Lamivudine should not be used as a single agent for treatment of chronic HBV infection in HIV-infected childrenwho are not receiving cART because of the risk of HIV resistance to lamivudine (CIII); as discussed above,lamivudine should be used only in HIV/HBV-coinfected children in combination with other ARV drugs in acART regimen (BIII). The dose of lamivudine required to treat HIV infection is higher than that for treatingpediatric chronic HBV infection alone; therefore, the higher dose of lamivudine should be used in HIV/HBV-coinfected children to avoid development of lamivudine-resistant HIV (AIII). Lamivudine resistance should be suspected if HBV DNA levels increase by 1 to 2 log during antiviral therapy.Such increases may precede increases in serum transaminase levels (hepatic flare) and liver decompensation.63EmtricitabineEmtricitabine is structurally similar to lamivudine and is active against HBV and HIV , although not approvedfor treatment of chronic HBV infection. Like lamivudine, emtricitabine also is associated with relativelyrapid onset of HBV and HIV drug resistance, and patients with suspected lamivudine resistance should beassumed to have cross-resistance to emtricitabine. Lamivudine and emtricitabine should be considered interchangeable for treatment of chronic HBV infectionand not additive (AIII). As with lamivudine, emtricitabine be used to treat chronic HBV infectionin coinfected children who are not being treated with cART for their HIV infection because of the risk ofHIV-associated resistance mutations (CIII).AdefovirAdefovir dipivoxil is an oral nucleotide analogue against Although active against HBV , adefovirhas minimal anti-HIV activity, and HIV resistance has not been observed in patients receiving a 10-mg dailydose of adefovir for 48 weeks.59HBV resistance is much lower to adefovir than to lamivudine, reportedly 2%after 2 years, 4% after 3 years, and 18% after 4 years of therapy in adults.69These adefovir-associatedmutations in HBV Polgene result in only a modest (threefold to eightfold) increase in the 50% inhibitoryconcentration and are partially cross-resistant with tenofovir. Adefovir is now FDA-approved for adults whorequire treatment for chronic HBV infection but do not yet require treatment for HIV . Adefovir has beenstudied in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults with lamivudine-resistant and HBV suppression wasdemonstrated.59Safety and effectiveness of adefovir for treating chronic HBV infection in children has beenreported.43In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adefovir was more effective than placebo in childrenage 12 years at suppressing viral replication and normalizing transaminases. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-9Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (Tenofovir)Tenofovir is structurally similar to adefovir that reduces HBV DNA levels in adults withlamivudine-resistant and wild-type HBV infection. A study in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults receiving stablecART comparing treatment with tenofovir or adefovir found similar efficacy in suppression of HBV DNAwith no difference in toxicity.70Another study of HIV/HBV-coinfected adults receiving tenofovir in additionto lamivudine as part of their ARV regimen found that HBV DNA became undetectable in 30% of HBeAg-positive and 82% HBeAg-negative of whom had lamivudine-resistant HBV infection.59Asnoted earlier, tenofovir is not approved for treatment of HBV infection in children aged <12 years, buttenofovir is approved as part of cART for HIV beginning at age 2 years. However, for HIV/HBV-coinfected children aged 2 years who require treatment of both infections, tenofovirin combination with an anti-HBV nucleoside (either lamivudine or emtricitabine) formulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir (Truvada) is available for adults. As with lamivudine andemtricitabine, tenofovir should not be used to treat chronic HBV in HIV-coinfected patients who are notreceiving cART for HIV because of the risk of HIV-associated resistance mutations (CIII).EntecavirEntecavir is an oral nucleoside analogue that inhibits HBV DNA polymerase. When compared to lamivudine,entecavir therapy results in greater HBV viral suppression, increased normalization of serum transaminaselevels, improved liver histology, and lower HBV resistance rates.71HBV viral suppression also has beendemonstrated in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults. Entecavir treatment is approved for treatment of chronic HBVin adults and is preferred for lamivudine-resistant HBV infections. However, it recently was demonstrated tohave suppressive activity against HIV .72Entecavir should not be used in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients whoare not receiving cART for HIV . Entecavir is approved for use in children aged 16 years; no data areavailable on safety and efficacy of entecavir in younger children.TelbivudineTelbivudine is a thymidine nucleoside analogue that was approved to treat chronic HBV in adults. It is welltolerated, but like lamivudine, resistance emerges over time, and telbivudine is not active against lamivudine-resistant HBV . No data are available on telbivudine in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults. Telbivudine is approved foruse in children aged 16 years; no data are available on safety and efficacy of entecavir in younger children.Duration of TherapyThe optimal duration of therapy in HIV/HBV-coinfected children is not known. The duration of IFN-treatment in HIV-uninfected children with chronic HBV infection is 6 months. At least 1 year of lamivudinetherapy is recommended for HIV-uninfected children who have chronic HBV infection, with continuation ofmedication for 6 months after documented HBeAg seroconversion.46The duration of IFN therapy in HIV-infected children with HBV infection in whom treatment is indicated should be at least 6 months (CIII).Among HBeAg-positive children who are HIV-uninfected, treatment of chronic HBV infection withantivirals should be continued until HBeAg seroconversion has been achieved and 6 months of additionaltreatment has been completed after the appearance of anti-HBe (BI*). However, because lamivudine (or emtricitabine) and tenofovir would be administered only to HIV/HBV-coinfected children who need HIV treatment and as part of a suppressive ARV regimen, treatment withlamivudine (or other anti-HBV drugs with anti-HIV activity) should be continued indefinitely in childrenwith HIV/HBV coinfection, even if HBeAg seroconversion occurs (CIII).Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)The parameters for successful therapy for chronic HBV infection are not well defined, but markers ofimprovement include decreased hepatic necroinflammatory disease, normalization of serum transaminaselevels, reduction of HBV DNA levels, and HBeAg seroconversion. In children starting treatment for chronicGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-10HBV infection, serum transaminase levels should be measured frequently at the start of therapy and then every3 to 6 months. In children who are also beginning cART, some experts would monitor transaminase levels morefrequently during the first few months of therapy (e.g, monthly for 3 months) because of the risk of IRIS (seebelow). Monitoring of response to treatment for chronic HBV infection is based on testing for HBV DNA andHBeAg and anti-HBe antibody on the same schedule as transaminase evaluations (every 3-6 months). Close monitoring for relapse is needed after withdrawal of therapy. In patients who are HBeAg-negative,treatment should be continued until HBsAg clearance has been achieved (BII).In HIV/HBV-coinfected patients starting cART, serum transaminase elevations (flares) can as part ofIRIS or secondary to cART-associated hepatotoxicity. HBV-associated liver injury is thought to be immune-mediated, and restoration of immunocompetence with ARV treatment may reactivate liver inflammation anddamage. Initiation of cART without anti-HBV therapy can lead to re-activation of HBV . This does not representa failure of cART but rather a sign of immune reconstitution. IRIS manifests by an increase in serumtransaminase levels as the CD4 cell count increases during the first 6 to 12 weeks of cART. Thus, serumtransaminase levels should be monitored closely after introduction of cART. In such situations, cART should becontinued and treatment for HBV infection initiated. The prognosis for most IRIS cases is favorable because arobust inflammatory response may predict an excellent response to cART in terms of immune reconstitution,and perhaps, improved survival. In patients experiencing hepatic flare, differentiating between IRIS and drug-induced liver toxicity may be difficult, and no reliable clinical or laboratory predictor exists to distinguishbetween the two. Close collaboration of the HIV specialist with a specialist in hepatic disease is recommendedfor such patients; a hepatologist should be consulted promptly if elevated aminotransferases levels areassociated with clinical jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction (e.g., serum albumin).Clinical and laboratory exacerbations of hepatitis and hepatic flare also can occur in coinfected childrenreceiving cART if agents with anti-HBV activity are discontinued. Generally, once ARV drugs with anti-HBVactivity are begun in coinfected children, they should be continued indefinitely unless contraindicated (CIII). Ifdiscontinuation of therapy for chronic HBV infection results hepatic flare, therapy for chronic HBV shouldbe re-instituted (BIII).Some clinicians recommend monitoring HBV-infected children or adolescents for HCC with baselinescreening and then annual or twice yearly determinations of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels andabdominal ultrasonography; however, no data support the benefit of such surveillance.3,38,46,47Currentrecommendations in HBV-infected, HIV-uninfected adults support abdominal ultrasonography in men aged>40 years and women aged >50 years. The use of AFP monitoring is controversial.Adverse effects of IFN- use in children, although frequent, usually are not severe or permanent; however,approximately 5% of children require treatment discontinuation. The most common side effects include aninfluenza-like syndrome, cytopenias, and neuropsychiatric effects. Influenza-like symptoms comprising fever,chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are seen in 80% of patients duringthe first month of treatment. These side effects decrease substantially during the first 4 months of therapy;premedication with acetaminophen or ibuprofen may reduce side effects. Subtle personality changes, whichresolve when therapy is discontinued, have been reported in 42% of children.40Depression and suicidal ideationalso have been reported in clinical trials of children treated with IFN-.73Ophthalmologic complications havebeen reported in clinical trials of children with pegylated IFN.74Neutropenia, which resolves afterdiscontinuation of therapy, is the most common laboratory abnormality; anemia and thrombocytopenia are lesscommon. Abnormalities in thyroid function (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) have been reported with IFN- therapy.75Loss of appetite with transient weight loss and impaired height growth can occur but usuallyresolves after completion of therapy.76Less commonly observed side effects of IFN- include epistaxis andtransient mild alopecia. Antinuclear auto-antibodies have been detected in some children treated with IFN-. IFN- therapy is contraindicated in children with severe cytopenia; severerenal, cardiac, or neuropsychiatric disorders; and autoimmune disease (CIII).77Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenK-11Elevation of serum transaminase levels has been reported during IFN- therapy in children and adults butusually is not an indication to stop therapy; these flares may herald impending HBeAg seroconversion.46Children receiving IFN- therapy should be monitored with frequent complete blood count and liver functiontests, and serum level of thyroid-stimulating hormone should be determined at baseline and periodically (e.g.,at least every 3 months) for the duration of treatment.Lamivudine usually is well-tolerated in children; rare cases of beenreported in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults. tenofovir and adefovir can cause renal tubular disease. Patientsreceiving either drug should have baseline urinalysis and periodic urinalysis, serum creatinine and phosphatemonitoring. Administration of other nephrotoxic agents increases the risk of renal toxicity. Tenofovir canlead to reduced bone density.Managing Treatment FailureTreatment failure is defined as ongoing HBV replication, persistent serum transaminase elevations, and thefailure of HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients at the completion of therapy (for IFN) and afteran adequate trial of oral anti-HBV antivirals (generally at least 6-12 months). In individuals with HBeAg-negative hepatitis, treatment failure is defined as ongoing HBV replication (>10,000 IU) and persistent serumtransaminase elevations. Flares of liver disease with increasing HBV DNA levels can be seen with thedevelopment of resistance to lamivudine or emtricitabine.In some children who have received initial treatment for chronic HBV infection with standard-dose IFN-monotherapy, use of higher-dose IFN- for retreatment improves response.58,78,79Lamivudine also has been used as secondary therapy for young (<12 years old) HIV-uninfected children whohave not responded to standard IFN- therapy (BI);80-82in HIV-infected children, initiation of a lamivudine-containing or emtricitabine-containing cART regimen (that also contains tenofovir, if aged 2 years) can beconsidered (CIII). For HIV/HBV coinfected children who develop lamivudine resistance during therapy, treatment options aremore limited because of lack of data on use of adefovir, entecavir, and tenofovir for treatment of HBV infectionin young children. Because these HBV drug-resistant isolates may have lower replicative capacity than wild-type HBV , some experts recommend continuing lamivudine or emtricitabine therapy in such cases (CIII). Alternatively, adding IFN- can be considered or, in children old enough to receive adult doses of adefovir,adding that drug to the regimen can be considered (CIII).Preventing RecurrenceNot applicable.Discontinuing Secondary Liaw Thomas HC.

In a serostudy of 535 HIV-infected children followedin pediatric HIV clinical trials, the prevalence of HCV infection by HCV antibody and RNA testing was1.5%.5In a more recent study of 228 HIV-infected children at an inner-city hospital in the Bronx, seven HIV-infected children had chronic HCV infection (3.1% [95% CI, 1.4%-6.5%]), defined as a reactive HCVPanel's RecommendationsTesting for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection should be performed on any child whose mother is known to have the infection (AIII). AllHIV-infected adults and adolescents should be tested for HCV infection (AIII).Recommendations for route of delivery and infant feeding for HIV/HCV-coinfected women and their infants are the same as those forHIV-monoinfected women and their infants (AII). Diagnostic evaluation for HCV infection in the first 18 months of life after HCV exposure: 2 negative HCV RNA tests at or after age 2months, including one at or after age 12 months, definitively excludes HCV infection (BIII). Two positive HCV RNA results before age18 months are required for definitive diagnosis of HCV infection (BIII).Diagnosis of HCV infection in the child older than age 18 months: Screen with anti-HCV antibody test and confirm active viral infectionwith HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing (AIII).Adolescents should be counseled to avoid injection drug use; if using drugs, they need HCV (and HIV and HBV testing), andappropriate referral and therapy, including drug treatment. Other exposures, such as through unprotected sex, (commercial) tattooingand body-piercing, represent a much lower risk of transmission but should also be avoided (BIII).All children (regardless of HIV and HCV infection status) should receive standard vaccination with hepatitis A and B vaccines (AIII).Treatment of children aged <3 years who have HCV infection usually is not recommended (BIII).Treatment should be considered for all HIV/HCV-coinfected children aged 3 years who have no contraindications to treatment (BIII).A liver biopsy to stage disease is recommended before deciding whether to initiate therapy for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection (BIII).However, some specialists would treat children infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 without first obtaining a liver biopsy (BIII).Treatment of HCV-infected children, regardless of HIV status, should include interferon alfa (IFN-) plus ribavirin combination therapy(AI). Duration of treatment for HIV/HCV-coinfected children should be 48 weeks, regardless of HCV genotype (BIII).Ribavirin and didanosine should not be used together (AIII). When possible, ribavirin and zidovudine should not be administered simultaneously because both are associated with anemia (BII*).IFN-therapy is contraindicated for children with decompensated liver disease, substantial cytopenias, renal failure, severe cardiac orneuropsychiatric disorders, and non-HCV-related autoimmune disease (AII*).Use of erythropoietin can be used to manage clinically significant anemia during HCV treatment (AIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or morewell-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data inchildrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-2antibody and positive HCV real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).6The mean age of HIV/HCV-coinfected children was 16 years, and 57% had mild elevation (up to twofold above upper limit of normal) inserum transaminase levels.Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the predominant mode of HCV acquisition in children.7,8Otherpotential sources of HCV infection in older children, as for adults, include injection-drug use and, to a lesserextent, non-commercial body piercing or tattoos, unintentional needle stick injury, household contact, andsexual exposure.9,10Before 1992, blood transfusion was a source of HCV infection in children. A recentretrospective study found that 3% of infants who had received blood transfusions in a neonatal intensive-careunit between 1975 and1992 were anti-HCV-antibody positive.11However, the incidence of HCV infectionfrom transfusion dramatically declined since 1992, when second-generation HCV enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (EIA) screening was implemented. With the current additional use of nucleic acidamplification testing, the risk of HCV infection through transfusion is approximately 1 in 2 million.12The overall risk for MTCT of HCV from a woman infected with HCV alone ranges from 4% to 10%.7,13-21The primary risk factor for perinatal HCV transmission is maternal HCV viremia at delivery, although anabsolute threshold for HCV transmission has not been identified.14,22-27Data do not indicate that HCVgenotype is related to risk of perinatal HCV transmission.14,20Although a few studies have suggested thatvaginal delivery increases risk of HCV transmission13,15,17,22and that HCV can be transmitted during theintrapartum period,28most studies have found that mode of delivery does not appear to influence perinatalHCV transmission.8,15,16,18,29-33In addition, even though HCV RNA can be detected in breast milk, studies ofinfants born to HCV-infected women have not demonstrated a higher risk of HCV transmission in breastfedinfants than in those who are formula-fed.8,13-16,18,25,28,29,34Maternal HIV coinfection increases the risk of perinatal transmission, with perinatal HCV transmission rates of6% to 23% reported for infants born to women who are HIV/HCV-coinfected7,13-15,19,26,30-32,35-41Furthermore, afew studies suggest that children who are infected with HIV during the perinatal period may be more likelythan HIV-uninfected children to acquire HCV infection from mothers who are HIV/HCV-coinfected.30,31,38,40Dual virus transmission has been reported in 4% to 10% of children born to HIV/HCV-coinfectedmothers.13,30,36,38,39HCV RNA levels are hypothesized to be higher among women coinfected with HIV than inthose infected with HCV alone, which could account, in part, for the increased risk of MTCT of HCV fromHIV/HCV-coinfected women; however, not all studies have found higher levels of HCV viremia among HIV-infected mothers.24,31,35One European study suggested that perinatal transmission of HCV may be reduced inHIV-infected women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).32Acute HCV infection appears to spontaneously resolve in 15% to 25% of adults.4Findings from a limitednumber of longitudinal studies suggest that HCV infection resolves 17% to more commonwith HCV genotype 3 and usually occurred by age 3 years.46,48Spontaneous viral clearance also has beenassociated with the presence perinatally HCV-infected defined as the presence of HCV RNA for >6 months. A study from Italy reportedon long-term outcome in more than 350 children with chronic, untreated HCV infection (mean follow up5.9\u00b13.8 years), encompassing both perinatal and parenteral modes of transmission. The overall proportion ofchildren who had spontaneous viral clearance was 7.5%. The rate of spontaneous viral clearance in thevertically acquired cases was 11.5%: half of these cases were genotype 3 and clearance occurred within thefirst 3 years of life. Evidence of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis was present in 1.8% of HCV-infectedchildren. The average time from diagnosis of HCV infection to development of cirrhosis was 9.87\u00b15.9years.50In a study comparing children with perinatal HIV/HCV coinfection with those with perinatal HCVinfection alone, spontaneous clearance of HCV infection occurred in 10 (17.5%) of 57 with HCVmonoinfection but none of the 13 children with HIV/HCV coinfection.51Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-3Clinical ManifestationsChildren with perinatal HCV infection appear to have a more benign clinical course than do adults withnewly acquired HCV infection.9,52,53Most HCV-infected children are asymptomatic, with minorabnormalities such as hepatomegaly, or mild nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, and poorweight gain;9,53,54however, intermittent asymptomatic elevations in transaminase levels are common duringthe first 2 years of life.45,54-56In a large European cohort of HCV-infected children, about 20% of children hadapparent clearance of HCV viremia; 50% had chronic asymptomatic infection, characterized by intermittentviremia, rare hepatomegaly, and usually normal liver transaminase levels; and 30% had chronic activeinfection with persistent viremia and abnormal transaminase levels.46Histopathologic inflammatory changes of chronic hepatitis may be present in patients with chronic HCVinfection despite lack of symptoms, normal serum transaminase levels, and low HCV RNA levels.54Analysis ofliver histology in 121 treatment-naive pediatric patients showed some degree of inflammation in all samples,mild fibrosis (Ishak stage 1-2) in 80% and 2% of patients.57Most children with chronic HCVinfection who have undergone liver biopsy and are included in published studies typically have mild-to-moderate liver disease as determined by signs of structural alterations, inflammatory activity, andnecrosis.9,24,53,55Similar proportions of vertically and parenterally HCV-infected children have signs of chronichepatitis on liver biopsy.56A small subset of children may develop severe liver disease. In a study of 60 childrenwith perinatally acquired or transfusion-acquired HCV infection who were infected for a mean duration of 13years, 12% had significant fibrosis on liver biopsy.53Older age at time of infection and serum adults, the natural history of HCV infection appears to be accelerated, with more rapidprogression to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death.58,59InHIV/HCV-coinfected adults, there are conflicting reports about the effect of cART and immune reconstitution onliver-related mortality, with some studies showing decreases and others little difference in liver-relatedmortality.60,61Data are minimal on the effect of HIV/HCV-coinfection on the natural history of HCV infection inchildren and insufficient to draw conclusions about HCV disease progression in coinfected children.7Data are conflicting on the impact of HCV infection on HIV disease progression in adults; some studiessuggest higher rates of HIV progression and others do not.7The effect of pediatric coinfection on HIVdisease progression also is unclear because the number of coinfected children is small, and few studies haveevaluated this. Two studies of children with perinatal HIV/HCV coinfection found no increase in HIVprogression. On the other hand, in a study from Spain comparing children with perinatal HIV/HCVcoinfection with those with perinatal HCV infection alone, and maximum transaminase levelswere higher in the coinfected children than in those with HCV infection alone.51In a study of older childrenwith thalassemia who were infected through transfusion, disease progression was more rapid and mortalityhigher in those with HIV/HCV-coinfection than in those with HIV monoinfection.30,39,62Making the DiagnosisTesting for HCV infection should be performed on any child whose mother is known to have HCV infection(AIII). All HIV-infected adults and adolescents should be tested for HCV infection (AIII).Serologic and nucleic acid tests are used to diagnose HCV infection. HCV RNA first becomes detectable 1 to3 weeks after HCV infection and precedes serologic response to HCV .4A third-generation EIA is availablefor detecting antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). Passively transferred maternal anti-HCV can be detected for upto 18 months in infants born to HCV-infected mothers. In a large cohort of HCV-exposed but -uninfectedchildren, anti-HCV was present in 15% of children at 12 months, 5% at 15 months, and 2% at 18 months.24Therefore, only the presence of persistent HCV viremia can be used to reliably verify HCV infection in at-risk children aged <18 months.63HCV infection can be diagnosed in such children using a nucleic acid test todetect HCV RNA after age 1 month; the sensitivity of the HCV RNA testing is low at birth (22%), butGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-4increases to 85% at 6 months.64Most children perinatal HCV infection will have a positive HCV RNAtest by age 12 months. However, because of intermittent viremia, a single negative HCV RNA test is notconclusive evidence of lack of infection. Thus, two negative HCV RNA results obtained at or after age 2months, including at least one test at or after age 12 months, definitively excludes HCV infection in an HCV-exposed infant (BIII). Two positive HCV RNA results before age 18 months are required for definitivediagnosis of HCV infection (BIII).64A positive anti-HCV antibody test in a child aged >18 months indicates prior HCV infection. Supplementaltesting with a more specific assay, such as HCV RNA testing, is recommended to clarify whether the positiveantibody test indicates a chronic active or a resolved infection (AIII). A positive HCV RNA test confirmscurrent HCV infection, and if positive for >6 months, indicates chronic infection. HCV RNA can bemeasured qualitatively or quantitatively. Qualitative nucleic acid tests include qualitative andtranscription-mediated amplification. branched-chain DNA amplification,quantitative PCR, and real-time PCR and are most useful for monitoring response to anti-HCV therapy.Quantitative HCV RNA level (i.e., HCV viral load) does not correlate with degree of liver damage and doesnot serve as a surrogate for measuring disease severity, but it does provide important information aboutresponse to antiviral therapy. Assays vary substantially, and if serial values are required to monitor treatment,continued use of the same quantitative assay for all assessments is strongly recommended.Liver biopsy is the most accurate test to assess the severity of hepatic disease and measure the amount ofhepatic fibrosis present. The degree of liver injury found on biopsy can be used to determine the need fortreatment. A liver biopsy is recommended before initiating therapy for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection,but is often used for other genotype infections (2, 3 or 4) as well.65,66Virus eradication from anti-HCVtherapy is much more likely in HCV genotypes 2 and 3 (~80%), compared with genotype 1 (<50%). Thus,the need for liver biopsy before treatment 2 or 3 is debatable.67Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureAll HIV-infected patients should be screened for HCV . No reliable strategy exists to prevent perinatal HCVtransmission. Cesarean delivery is not associated with reduced perinatal transmission of HCV infection andis not recommended for this purpose for women with chronic HCV infection (AII). The presence of maternalHCV coinfection does not alter the current recommendation for scheduled cesarean delivery for HIV-infectedwomen who have HIV RNA levels >1,000 copies/mL near delivery to prevent perinatal HIV transmission.Limited data suggest that breastfeeding does not transmit HCV; maternal HCV infection is not a reason toavoid breastfeeding. The presence of maternal HCV coinfection does not alter the current recommendationthat HIV-infected women in the United States should not breastfeed their infants (see Recommendations forUse of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions toReduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States). No vaccines are available to prevent HCV infection. Adolescents considering tattooing or body-piercing shouldbe informed about potential risks of acquiring HCV , which could be transmitted if equipment is not sterile or ifproper infection-control procedures are not followed, and to avoid injection-drug use and unprotected sex(BIII).68HCV-infected persons should be advised not to share toothbrushes, razors, tweezers, nail clippers andother personal-care articles that might be contaminated with blood to prevent transmission of HCV .Preventing First Episode of DiseasePatients with chronic liver disease can develop fulminant hepatitis from hepatitis A (HA V) or B (HAB)infection; all children (regardless of HIV and HCV infection status) should receive standard vaccination withHA V and HAB vaccines (AIII).68-70Patients with advanced HCV-related liver disease and/or HIV infectionmay not mount an appropriate immune response to vaccines.71Therefore, measurement of HBV antibodytiters 3 months after completion of the vaccination series is recommended.72Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-5Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseThe standard of care for treatment of chronic HCV infection in children, in the absence of HIV infection, iscombination therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa (Peg-IFN-) administered as a once a week and twice-daily oral ribavirin.73For HIV-uninfected individuals, the length of therapyis 48 weeks for treating HCV genotype 1, and 24 weeks for genotypes 2 or 3. Recent studies demonstrateimproved response rates in adults with the addition of protease inhibitors (PIs) (telaprevir or boceprevir) topegylated-IFN- and with and without ribavirin in HCV-infectedchildren has shown superior efficacy with combination therapy.76Improved viral eradication was previouslynoted with combination therapy in a non-randomized European study as well.67There is a paucity of studieson the treatment of HIV/HCV-coinfected children. Consultation with experts in treating chronic HCVinfection in children is recommended. The PIs telaprevir and boceprevir have been approved for use in adults for treatment of HCV genotype 1, inconcert with peg-IFN- associated with markedly improvedviral clearance, with sustained virologic responses demonstrated in up to 68% of treated patients.75HIV/HCV-coinfected Adults and AdolescentsRegardless of HIV coinfection status, treatment should be considered in all non-pregnant, HCV-infectedadults or adolescents who have abnormal serum transaminase levels and liver biopsies that show chronichepatitis with inflammation, fibrosis, and compensated liver disease.78Because of the high rate of HCVeradication with treatment for HCV genotypes 2 or 3, a liver biopsy is optional before initiating therapy.Treatment should be considered for HIV/HCV-coinfected adults and adolescents for whom potential benefitsof treatment are judged to outweigh potential risks, including those infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3,those with stable HIV infection not requiring cART, and those with HCV-related cryoglobulinemic vasculitisor glomerulonephritis.65,79Baseline serum primary predictors ofresponse to treatment. Younger age, higher CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count, elevated transaminaselevels, lack of liver fibrosis, low body mass index, lack of insulin resistance, and white race are othervariables associated with better treatment response.79The recommended treatment for HCV genotypes 2 and3 is combined peg-IFN-2a (or 2b) plus ribavirin for 48 weeks, while telaprevir is added to that regimen forthe first 12 weeks in most adults with HCV genotype 1 infection (see Adult OI Guidelines). In HIV/HCV-coinfected adults, rates of sustained virologic response to treatment with peg-IFN- plus ribavirin range from44% to 73% for treatment of HCV genotypes 2 and 3 infection and from 14% to 29% for HCV genotype 1infection.73,80,81Response CD4 cellcounts >200 cells/mm3; therefore, cART should be considered before anti-HCV therapy is initiated inHIV/HCV-coinfected patients with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3. Anti-HCV treatment is notrecommended because ribavirin is teratogenic.HCV-Infected, HIV-Uninfected ChildrenTreatment usually is not recommended for HIV-uninfected children aged <3 years who have HCV infectionbecause spontaneous HCV clearance can occur in this age group (BIII). All decisions about treatment of HCVinfection in children should be individualized because HCV usually causes mild disease in this population andfew data exist to identify risk factors differentiating those at greater risk for progression of liver disease.80,82HCV-infected, HIV-uninfected children 3 years old who are chosen for treatment should receivecombination therapy with peg-IFN- and ribavirin for 48 weeks for genotype 1 and 24 weeks for genotypes 2or 3 (AI). This recommendation is based on the results of a recently completed pediatric trial in the UnitedStates on the efficacy of peg-IFN- with or without ribavirin.76In this trial, children aged 5 to 17 years weredefined as having chronic HCV infection based on at least 2 positive HCV RNA blood tests for >6 monthsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-6duration and liver histology consistent with HCV infection. The primary outcome measured was a sustainedvirologic response (SVR) defined as non-detectable HCV RNA in plasma at 24 weeks after treatmentcompletion. The overall SVR was 53% with combination therapy and 21% with peg-IFN- monotherapy.Combination therapy resulted in SVR in 47% of patients for pediatric HCV infection inEurope found similar efficacy for combination therapy. SVR was achieved in 48% of patients with genotype1 and 100% of patients with genotypes 2 or 3.67Previous studies on the use of combination therapy with standard IFN- (SQ injections 3 times weekly) andribavirin reported overall rates of SVR ranging from 46% to 65%.66,83-87In these studies, children infectedwith genotype 1 were less likely to have a SVR (36%) than those infected with genotypes 2 or 3 (SVR84%).83Other factors associated with favorable response to anti-HCV treatment in children include lowerpretreatment HCV RNA levels, white race, and possibly younger age.66HIV/HCV-coinfected ChildrenNo specific studies have been done of treatment of children with HIV/HCV-coinfection, andrecommendations are based primarily on data from adults. Because therapy for HCV infection is more likelyto be effective in younger patients and in those without advanced disease or immunodeficiency, treatmentshould be considered for all HIV/HCV-coinfected children aged 3 years who have no contraindications totreatment (BIII)(see Dosing Table for contraindications to anti-HCV drugs). Treatment of HIV/HCV-coinfected children aged <3 years usually is not recommended (BIII), even though spontaneous HCVclearance in HIV/HCV-coinfected children may occur at lower rates than in HIV-uninfected children.51In HIV/HCV-coinfected adults, the recommended duration of combination treatment is 48 weeks for infectionswith all HCV genotypes, including 2 and 3, because coinfected adults may not respond as well as those who areHIV-uninfected and they may have higher rates of relapse. Moreover, the efficacy of shorter treatment has notbeen adequately evaluated in HIV-infected individuals.79By extrapolation, 48 weeks of therapy also arerecommended for HIV/HCV-coinfected children, regardless of genotype (BIII). Potential drug interactionscomplicate the concomitant use of cART and anti-HCV therapy. Ribavirin enhances phosphorylation ofdidanosine, which could increase the risk of toxicity; therefore, these drugs should not be used together (AIII).Ribavirin and zidovudine both are associated with anemia and should not be administered together (BII*).79The PIs telaprevir and boceprevir are approved only for use in adults with genotype 1 HCV infection. Theseagents may be tested and approved for use in children in the near future. No recommendations for use ofthese agents in children can be made at this time. See Adult OI Guidelinesfor important warnings about druginteractions between HCV PIs and HIV PIs and other antiretroviral drugs. Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Monitoring in Children Not Receiving Anti-HCV Therapy Although no evidence-based long-term monitoring guidelines exist for children with perinatally acquiredHCV , many experts monitor HCV RNA levels and serum transaminase levels every 6 to 12 months andcomplete blood counts (CBC) and serum alpha fetoprotein levels annually.82Serum levels canfluctuate and do not necessarily correlate with histologic liver damage because significant liver disease canbe present in patients with normal serum transaminase levels. In HCV-infected persons who are HIV-uninfected, HCC rarely is seen in the absence of cirrhosis. The benefits of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) andabdominal sonography as screening tools for HCC have not been studied in children. Some experts performperiodic sonographic screening at defined intervals (every 2-5 years) in children with chronic HCV infection;others do these tests only in those with advanced liver disease and/or rising serum AFP concentrations.82Therisk of HCC in HCV-infected children, with or without HIV infection, is unknown.As with HIV/HBV-coinfection, use of cART in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients can worsen hepatitis, withincreases in serum transaminase levels and clinical signs of liver disease, including hepatomegaly andGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-7jaundice (also called \"hepatic flare\"). This does not represent a failure of ART, but rather, is a sign ofimmune reconstitution. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) manifests by an increase inserum transaminase levels as the CD4 cell count increases during the first 6 to 12 weeks of cART. Thus,serum transaminase levels should be monitored closely after introduction of cART in HIV/HCV-coinfectedchildren. The prognosis for most patients with IRIS is favorable. Consultation with a hepatologist should besought if elevated aminotransferases are associated with clinical jaundice or other evidence of liverdysfunction, in other words, low serum albumin.Monitoring During Combination Therapy (Interferon and Ribavirin)HCV RNA quantitation is used to monitor response to antiviral therapy. HCV RNA levels should beperformed at baseline; after 5, 12, and 24 weeks of antiviral therapy; at treatment completion (48 weeks); and6 months after treatment cessation. Some experts continue to perform serial HCV RNA testing at 6- to 12-month intervals for an additional 1 to 5 years to exclude late virologic relapse. The following are outcomes measured during the treatment of HCV: Rapid Virological Response (RVR):Non-detectable plasma HCV RNA after 4 weeks of therapy;Early Virologic Response (EVR):Decrease in HCV RNA 2 log10IU/mL 12weeks of therapy;End Of Treatment Virologic Response:Non-detectable HCV of treatment completion;Sustained Virologic Response (SVR):Non-detectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after treatment completion;Virologic Relapse:Achievement of end of treatment response followed by return of HCV RNApositivity after treatment completion;Nonresponse:Failure to suppress HCV RNA below detection at any time during treatment; andBreakthrough Response:Reemergence of detectable HCV RNA from non-detectable status despite thecontinuation of therapy.4In the absence of specific data for HIV/HCV-coinfected children, the criteria for determining response totherapy in HCV-monoinfected children and HIV/HCV-coinfected adults are used. Failure to achieve EVRwith treatment with peg-IFN- and ribavirin correlates with a low chance (<3%) of achieving SVR (based onadult data) and treatment can be discontinued after 12 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patientswho achieve an EVR but still have detectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks of therapy. For all other HIV/HCV-coinfected children, treatment should be given for 48 weeks, regardless of genotype (BIII). In addition toHCV RNA quantification, patients receiving antiviral therapy for HCV infection should be closely monitoredfor medication side effects with CBC, measurement of serum transaminase levels, thyroid function tests,ophthalmologic exams, and assessment of mental status/mood disorders. Some experts would monitortransaminase levels more frequently during the first few months of therapy, such as monthly for 3 months, inHIV/HCV-coinfected children who are also starting cART because of the risk of IRIS.Side effects of IFN- in children are common but usually not severe; approximately 5% of children need todiscontinue treatment because of side effects. The most common side effects include influenza-like symptoms(e.g., fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) in 80% of patientsduring the first month of treatment. However, these symptoms usually resolve over time and usually are nottreatment-limiting; pre-medication with acetaminophen or ibuprofen may reduce the incidence of side effects.In 42% of children subtle personality changes that resolve when therapy is discontinued have been reported.88Depression and suicidal ideation also have been reported in clinical trials of children treated with IFN-.83Neutropenia, which usually improves with dose-reduction, is the most common laboratory abnormality; anemiaand thrombocytopenia are less common. Abnormalities in thyroid function (hypothyroidism orhyperthyroidism) have been reported with IFN- therapy.89Loss of appetite, with transient weight loss andGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenL-8impaired height growth, can occur but usually resolves after completion of therapy.90Less commonly observed side effects of IFN- include epistaxis and transient mild alopecia. Some childrendevelop antinuclear autoantibodies. The incidence of interferon-associated ophthalmologic complications inHCV-infected children on combination therapy was recently reported.91Three of 114 patients developedsignificant eye disease, including ischemic retinopathy with cotton wool spots, uveitis, and transientmonocular blindness. Despite the low incidence of disease, the severity of the ophthalmologic findingswarrants follow-up with eye exams at 24 and 48 weeks of therapy. IFN- therapy is contraindicated inchildren with decompensated liver disease, substantial cytopenias, renal failure, severe cardiac orneuropsychiatric disorders, and non-HCV-related autoimmune disease (AII*).92Side effects of hemolytic anemia and lymphopenia. Ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia isdose-dependent and usually presents with a substantial decrease in hemoglobin within 1 to 2 weeks afterribavirin initiation, but the hemoglobin usually stabilizes. Significant anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL) occurs inabout 10% of ribavirin-treated children.82Erythropoietin can anemiaduring HCV treatment (BIII). Coadministration of didanosine is contraindicated in children receiving ribavirinbecause this combination can increase the risk of mitochondrial toxicity and hepatic decompensation (AIII).Children receiving concomitant zidovudine may be more likely to experience bone marrow suppression; ifpossible, zidovudine should be avoided in children receiving ribavirin (BII*). Children who are receivingzidovudine and ribavirin together should be monitored closely for neutropenia and anemia. Ribavirin isteratogenic and should not be used by pregnant women. Sexually active adolescent girls or those likely tobecome sexually active who are receiving ribavirin should be counseled about the risks and need for consistentcontraceptive use during and for 6 months after completion of ribavirin therapy.In patients on HCV therapy who start cART and experience hepatic flares, differentiating between IRIS anddrug-induced liver toxicity may be difficult, and no reliable clinical or laboratory predictors exist todistinguish between the two. Close interaction of the HIV specialist with a specialist in hepatic disease\u2014usually a hepatologist\u2014is recommended for such patients; prompt consultation with a hepatologist should besought if elevated aminotransferases are associated with clinical jaundice or other evidence of liverdysfunction (such as low serum albumin).Managing Treatment FailureNo data exist on which to base recommendations for treatment of HIV/HCV-coinfected children in whominitial HCV treatment fails. In HIV/HCV-coinfected adults, a second course of treatment has a limited chanceof resulting in sustained virologic response in nonresponders (those who do not achieve early virologicresponse by week 12 or undetectable HCV load at week 24) or patients whose HCV relapses. Therapeuticinterventions for such adults need to be individualized according to prior response, tolerance, and adherenceto therapy; severity of liver disease; viral genotype; and other underlying factors that might influenceresponse. Some experts might extend the duration of treatment (e.g., to 72 weeks) in adults who experience avirologic response followed by relapse after adequate HCV therapy or in patients with advanced fibrosis. Inthe setting of treatment failure, the addition of PIs (telaprevir or boceprevir) to peg-IFN- and ribavirin mayincrease rates of eradication.74,75In a clinical trial, the addition of boceprevir to peg-IFN-ribavirin resulted insignificantly higher rates of sustained virologic response (up to 66%) in previously treated adults withchronic HCV genotype 1 infection, as compared with peg-interferon-ribavirin alone.93HIV/HCV-coinfectedadults with prior suboptimal treatment of HCV genotypes 2 or 3 infection may benefit from optimizedretreatment; coinfected adults with treatment failure for HCV genotype 1 infection may benefit fromretreatment with a combination regimen that includes boceprevir or telaprevir (see Adult OI Guidelines). SeeAdult OI Guidelinesfor important warnings about drug interactions between HCV PIs and HIV PIs and otherantiretroviral drugs. No data exist on which to base a recommendation for management of HCV treatmentfailure in HIV/HCV-coinfected children, and pediatric trials of triple therapy are warranted.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In et al.

HSV-1 is transmitted primarilythrough contact with infected oral secretions; HSV-2 is acquired primarily through contact with infected genitalsecretions. In the United States, HSV-1 seroprevalence in children increases from about 30% at ages 6 to 13Panel's RecommendationsHIV-infected patients should use male latex condoms consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse to reduce the risk ofexposure to herpes simplex virus (HSV) and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AI*). They should specifically avoid sexual contactwhen herpetic lesions (genital or orolabial) are evident (AIII).Although use of acyclovir or valacyclovir, beginning at 36 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the need for cesarean delivery, isrecommended in HIV-uninfected women with recurrent genital herpes, data are insufficient to make a specific recommendation for HIVand HSV coinfected women (BIII).For pregnant women who have active genital HSV lesions at the onset of labor, delivery by elective cesarean delivery, preferably beforerupture of membranes, is recommended (BII*).Acyclovir is the drug of choice for treatment of local and disseminated HSV in infants and children, regardless of HIV-infection status(AI). Neonatal HSV disease should be treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) acyclovir (20 mg/kg body weight), administered for 21 daysfor central nervous system (CNS) and disseminated disease and for 14 days for disease of the skin, eyes, and mouth (AI). IV acyclovirtherapy should not be discontinued in neonates with CNS disease unless a repeat cerebrospinal fluid HSV DNA polymerase chainreaction assay is negative near the end of treatment (BIII). Oral acyclovir prophylaxis for 6 months after treatment of neonatal diseaseinvolving the CNS or skin, eyes, and mouth can prevent cutaneous recurrences and may be associated with superiorneurodevelopmental outcome in those with CNS disease (AI).Beyond the neonatal period, HSV encephalitis should be treated with IV acyclovir for 21 days (AIII).First-episode orolabial or genital lesions in HIV-infected children or adolescents can be treated with oral acyclovir for 7 to 10 days (AI).Children or adolescents with severe immunosuppression and moderate-to-severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions should be treatedinitially with IV acyclovir and may require longer therapy (AI*).Recurrent mucocutaneous lesions, if treated, are generally treated with oral acyclovir for 5 days (AI*).Alternatives to oral acyclovir in adolescents and adults include valacyclovir and famciclovir (AI*)Patients with acute retinal necrosis should receive combination antiretroviral therapy and high-dose IV acyclovir for 10 to 14 days,followed by prolonged (i.e., 4-6 weeks) oral therapy, such as valacyclovir or acyclovir (AIII). HSV keratoconjunctivitis is usually treated with topical trifluridine or oral acyclovir alone, although many experts recommend thecombination (AII*). The treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant HSV is IV foscarnet (AI*)Children or adolescents who have frequent or severe orolabial or genital recurrences can be given daily suppressive therapy with oralacyclovir (AI*).

The seroprevalence of HSV-1 approaches 60% in older adults.2HSV-2 seroprevalence prior toreported sexual debut is low (2.6%) and rises to 22% to 26% in 30- to 49-year-olds and is higher in non-Hispanic blacks, individuals with large numbers of sex partners, females, and in those living below the povertylevel.2HSV-2 seroprevalence is higher among individuals who were age 17 years or younger compared with 18years or older at time of sexual debut.2Among young adolescent girls, a longer period of sexual activity andhaving had another sexually transmitted disease in the past 6 months was associated with HSV-2seropositivity.3Among some populations of older adolescents and young adults, HSV-1 is the cause of a largeproportion of first episodes of genital HSV infection.4-6These epidemiologic data indicate that children are atsignificant risk for primary infection or reactivation with HSV throughout childhood and adolescence. The age-specific seroprevalence of both HSV types is higher in many developing countries.Young children generally acquire HSV-1 from oral secretions of caretakers or playmates. Rarely is this theresult of contact with active herpetic lesions; infection most often results from exposure to HSV shedasymptomatically in the saliva of the contact. Salivary shedding of HSV detected by polymerase chainreaction (PCR) in HSV-1-seropositive adults is frequent (9% of days).7,8While older individuals may acquireHSV-1 in this manner, HSV-1 also can be acquired via sexual activity in adults who were not infected earlierduring childhood or adolescence. HSV-2 is more likely to be acquired during adulthood or adolescence,rather than childhood, as it is typically sexually transmitted. Genital shedding of HSV-2 by HSV-infectedwomen who are not HIV-infected, as detected by PCR, is very frequent (19% of days).8Either virus type canbe spread by oral-oral, oral-genital, and genital-genital contact. In general, shedding of oral HSV persistslonger in young children. Oral and genital HSV shedding are more common both in close proximity to thefirst episode of infection and also in HIV-infected patients. HSV infection can be acquired as a neonatalinfection, primarily through exposure to HSV-infected maternal fluids during vaginal delivery; lesscommonly, infection may occur in utero.9Newborns also infrequently are infected from oral secretions of anadult caretaker. The risk of transmitting HSV during delivery is approximately 1% in pregnant women withremote primary HSV infection, whereas the risk is much higher for infants born to women with recent HSVinfection (range: 30%-50%).9Maternal HSV antibody status before delivery likely influences the probabilityof transmission to infants and the severity of neonatal infection.10,11Genital shedding of HSV at deliveryincreases the risk of transmission, as does prolonged rupture of membranes (>6 hours), probably because ofascending HSV infection from the cervix. Importantly, mothers of neonates with HSV often do not provide ahistory of either past genital HSV infection or incident genital lesions.12,13Dual HSV and HIV infection of pregnant women is likely to be common, because both viral infections sharerisk factors (race, socioeconomic status, and number of sexual partners). Genital HSV was detected by PCRin 31% of HSV-seropositive, HIV-infected women at the time of delivery, compared with 9.5% of HSV-seropositive, HIV-uninfected pregnant women.14Shedding is greatest when the CD4 T-lymphocyte count islow.15In spite of the potential risk factors for the infant, there is no evidence that in uteroHSV infectionoccurs more frequently in HIV-infected pregnant woman coinfected with HSV-2 or that infants born to thesewomen are at increased risk of perinatal (intrapartum) HSV infection. In the general population, the neonatalHSV infection rate is 1 case per 2,000 to 10,000 deliveries,9,16indicating that neonatal HSV will rarely beobserved at clinics caring for dually-infected pregnant women.Conversely, numerous studies have shown that coinfection with genital HSV in adults is associated withhigher titers of HIV RNA in plasma and genital secretions; HSV-seropositivity increases the risk of HIVtransmission to sexual partners, even in the absence of genital ulcer disease.17,18Three studies suggest thatmaternal HSV coinfection HIV transmission.19-21Clinical ManifestationsIn most immunologically competent children, HSV infection causes minimal signs and symptoms and isusually not recognized as a distinct illness. Up to one third of children may develop a characteristic orolabialGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenM-3syndrome (primary gingivostomatitis), usually associated with HSV-1 infection, which consists of fever,irritability, tender submandibular lymphadenopathy, and superficial, painful ulcers on the gingival and oralmucosa and perioral area.22,23HSV viremia occurs in approximately one-third of patients with primaryherpetic gingivostomatitis.24HSV is a common cause of severe posterior pharyngitis in older children andadolescents.25Children with advanced HIV infection may have primary infection with multiple lesions thatare atypical in appearance and delayed in healing. Very rarely, disseminated HSV occurs with visceralinvolvement (including liver, adrenals, lung, and brain) and generalized skin lesions. Small crops of recurrentperioral vesicles (\"cold sores\") that heal quickly can occur throughout life in both healthy and HIV-infectedchildren, but those with AIDS are at risk of frequent recurrences, which can be associated with severeulcerative disease and symptoms similar to primary infection.26HIV-infected children also may haveprolonged shedding of HSV after both primary and reactivation infection. HSV esophagitis, which occurs inseverely immunocompromised children, can result from failure to limit replication of HSV present in saliva,although a study of adults found that evidence of oral HSV infection often is not present simultaneously.27Prolonged cutaneous HSV infection and organ involvement are AIDS-indicator conditions. These illnessesare uncommon in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), with a documented incidence rate ofsystemic HSV of 0.14 per 100 child-years.28Genital infection is the most common manifestation of HSV-2 infection in sexually active adolescents. Mostprimary infections are asymptomatic or subclinical; however, when symptoms do occur, they arecharacterized by painful, ulcerative lesions on the perineum, penis, and vaginal and urethral mucosae.Mucosal disease often is accompanied by dysuria and/or vaginal or urethral discharge. Inguinallymphadenopathy, particularly in primary infection, is common with perineal disease.29Frequent recurrencesand delayed healing are more likely in severely immunosuppressed patients. Severe proctitis and perianalinfection occur in patients who HIV-infected patients, HSV keratitis and herpetic whitlow are similar in presentation to diseases in HIV-uninfected individuals, but may be more severe. Acute retinal necrosis is a rare sight-threateningcomplication that occurs more frequently in immunocompromised individuals. HSV encephalitis occurs inHIV-infected patients, but is not more frequent or severe than in HIV-uninfected individuals and has similarsigns and temporal lobe abnormalities on neuroimaging are typical.31,32Neonatal infection in infants born to dually-infected mothers is similar in presentation to that seen in HIV-uninfected infants. Neonatal HSV can appear as disseminated multiorgan disease; localized disease of thecentral nervous system (CNS); or disease localized to the skin, eyes, and mouth.33Vesicular rash occurs inonly approximately 60% of infants with CNS or disseminated disease.33,34DiagnosisClinical diagnosis is based on the typical location and appearance of vesicles and ulcers. The virus is readilyisolated in tissue culture within 1 to 3 days, especially when samples are from first episode infections orobtained soon after the appearance of recurrent lesions (especially when vesicles are present).35,36Speed andaccuracy are maximized with the shell vial method, which combines centrifugation and staining withfluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to detect synthesis of early HSV proteins, thereby providing anetiologic diagnosis after 24 hours. Detection of HSV DNA by PCR, which is very sensitive and specific, is thegold standard method for diagnosis of HSV infection. DNA PCR may be especially useful when assessing skinlesions that are recurrent or that are being evaluated long after their appearance. In these cases, the HSV DNAremains in the healing lesions, even though HSV can no longer be cultured. Direct immunofluorescence forHSV antigen can be performed on cells scraped from skin, conjunctiva, or mucosal lesions.37The sensitivity ofthis method may not exceed 75%, often because it is difficult to obtain evaluable specimens.Detection of HSV DNA in the CSF is the preferred diagnostic test for evaluation of children with suspectedHSV encephalitis, because cultures of CSF are usually negative. Sensitivity of HSV PCR is generally 95% forGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenM-4CSF, especially if obtained more than 3 days after onset of herpes encephalitis.32,38During therapy for HSV-proven encephalitis, the CSF HSV PCR remains positive for a mean of 10 days after neurologic onset.39Inneonatal CNS HSV disease, CSF PCR has a sensitivity of 75% to 100% and a specificity of 71% to 100%.34Specimens from newborns with suspected neonatal HSV should be obtained from blood, skin vesicles, mouthor nasopharynx, conjunctiva, and stool or rectum. Positive cultures obtained from any of these sites more than48 hours after birth indicate viral replication rather than contamination after intrapartum exposure.Definitive diagnosis of HSV esophagitis requires staining with monoclonal antibodiessupplement culture or PCR results.The rapid onset of poor vision, red eye, or eye pain should result in an immediate referral to anophthalmologist, because these may be caused by herpesviruses or other pathogens that require specializeddiagnostic (including fluorescein staining to detect characteristic dendritic corneal ulceration and fundoscopicexam) and treatment approaches. Typing of HSV isolates (or genotyping of amplicons) can provide important prognostic information, sincerecurrence frequency after genital HSV-1 infection in HIV-uninfected patients is significantly less than afterHSV-2 infection.40,41Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureExposure to HSV-1 is an inevitable part of childhood. Although avoiding direct contact with secretions fromadult caretakers, siblings, or other close contacts with active herpes labialis is intuitive, it is likely that mostinfections occur as a result of unrecognized exposure to the frequent asymptomatic shedding of HSV byindividuals with prior infection.When used consistently and correctly, male latex condoms reduce the risk of genital herpes when the infected siteis covered, although data for this effect are limited (see http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/latex.htm).42Data pooled from 6 prospective studies estimated the odds of HSV-2 acquisition with every sexual act asincreased by 3.6%, 2.7%, and 0% when condoms were never used, sometimes used, or always used,respectively.43In another pooled analysis, individuals who always used condoms had a 30% lower risk of HSV-2acquisition compared with those who never used condoms, and risk of HSV-2 acquisition increased steadily witheach unprotected sex act.42Some data suggest that condom usage decreases the acquisition of genital HSV-2infection by women, but may not be protective for heterosexual men or against HSV-1 infection;44however,neither of the aforementioned pooled analyses detected such a difference between men and women.42,43HIV-infected patients should use latex condoms consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse to reduce the riskof HSV and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AI*). They should specifically avoid sexual contact whenherpetic lesions (genital or orolabial) are evident (AIII); however, most genital herpes infections are transmittedby individuals unaware that they are infected. Chronic suppressive therapy with valacyclovir in individuals withgenital herpes reduces HSV-2 transmission to susceptible heterosexual partners by 50%.45Use of suppressiveantiviral drugs against HSV in HIV-infected adults receiving cART resulted in fewer symptomatic lesions than inHIV-infected patients receiving such prophylaxis without cART, but subclinical mucosal HSV-2 shedding wassimilar regardless of cART.46The rate of HSV transmission to fetuses and neonates of HIV-infected pregnant women coinfected with HSVis unknown. Effective cART regimens may decrease, but not prevent, maternal genital HSV shedding andrecurrence of genital lesions.47Use of acyclovir or valacyclovir near term suppresses genital HSV outbreaks and shedding in late pregnancyin HIV-uninfected women with recurrent genital herpes and reduces the need for cesarean delivery forGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenM-5recurrent HSV .48Although the sample size was insufficient to determine the effect of prophylaxis on neonatalinfection, it is recommended that HIV-uninfected pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes be offeredsuppressive antiviral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks' gestation.49The safety and efficacy of this strategy havenot been evaluated in HIV/HSV coinfected women, who may have less HSV-2-specific antibody and/or T-cell function and are more likely to have both symptomatic and asymptomatic reactivation of genital HSV .Although suppressive antiviral therapy in late gestation is likely to also have efficacy in HIV-seropositivewomen, data are insufficient to make a specific recommendation (BIII).11Elective cesarean delivery,preferably before rupture of membranes, is recommended for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women whohave active genital HSV lesions at the onset of labor (BII*).50-53Preventing DiseaseAntiviral prophylaxis before or after exposure to HSV has been used successfully, but has not been studied inHIV-infected patients and is not recommended.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseAcyclovir is the drug of choice for treatment of local and disseminated HSV in infants and children,regardless of HIV-infection status (AI). Neonatal HSV disease should be treated with high-dose intravenous(IV) acyclovir (20 mg/kg body weight three times a day) administered for 21 days for CNS and disseminateddisease and for 14 days for disease of the skin, eyes, and mouth (AI).54IV acyclovir therapy should not bediscontinued in neonates with CNS disease unless a repeat CSF HSV DNA PCR assay is negative near theend of treatment (BIII).IV acyclovir is the drug of choice for disseminated HSV and HSV encephalitis beyond the neonatal be treated (10-20 mg/kg body weight three times aday) for 21 days (AIII).First-episode orolabial or genital lesions in HIV-infected children or adolescents can be treated with oralacyclovir for 7 to 10 days as indicated by the response to therapy (AI).22,23Children or adolescents withsevere immunosuppression and moderate-to-severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions should be treated initiallywith IV acyclovir and may need longer therapy, adjusted to the rate and character of healing (AI*). Patientscan be switched to oral therapy after their lesions have begun to regress, and therapy continued until lesionshave completely healed. Recurrent mucocutaneous lesions, if treated, are generally treated with oral acyclovir for 5 days (AI*).Patients in whom frequent or severe recurrences are an unacceptable burden may benefit from dailysuppressive therapy with acyclovir (AI*).Alternatives to oral acyclovir in older adolescents and adults include valacyclovir and famciclovir (AI*).Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir with improved bioavailability that is rapidly converted to acyclovirafter absorption. Sufficient information exists to support the use of valacyclovir in children, especially givenits two- to threefold improved bioavailability compared with acyclovir, at a dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg bodyweight administered 2 to 3 times a day.55,56No pediatric formulation is available and valacyclovir cangenerally only be used for children old enough to swallow the large valacyclovir tablets, although crushedvalacyclovir tablets can be used to make a suspension with good bioavailability.57The database on thepharmacokinetics and dosing of famciclovir in children is insufficient to make recommendations, and nopediatric preparation is available.58Because of their improved bioavailability, valacyclovir and famcicloviradministration at higher doses for only 1 to 3 days often is sufficient to manage recurrent genital HSVinfection in HIV-uninfected adults and oral infections in HIV-infected adults.59Treatment for acute retinal disease caused by HSV should be guided by an ophthalmologist. Patients withacute retinal necrosis should be on cART and receive high-dose IV acyclovir (10-15 mg/kg body weight IVGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenM-6every 8 hours for 10-14 days), followed by prolonged (i.e., 4-6 weeks) oral therapy, such as withvalacyclovir or acyclovir (AIII).60HSV keratoconjunctivitis is usually treated with topical trifluridine oracyclovir, although many experts recommend combination therapy (AII*).61Because of potential cornealtoxicity of topical therapy, close follow-up by an ophthalmologist is recommended and the duration oftherapy should be individualized. Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Primary toxicities of acyclovir are phlebitis (when administered IV), renal toxicity, nausea, vomiting, andrash. Toxicities are similar for valacyclovir. In infants receiving high-dose acyclovir for neonatal disease, themajor side effect was neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mm3).54Significantnephrotoxicity was observed in 6% of patients. For infants and children receiving high-dose IV acyclovir,monitoring of complete blood counts (CBCs) and renal function is recommended at initiation of treatmentand once or twice weekly for the duration of treatment, particularly in those with underlying renaldysfunction and who are receiving prolonged therapy. If possible, avoid other nephrotoxic drugs. IVacyclovir must be adequately diluted and administered slowly over 1 to 2 hours. Acyclovir is excretedprimarily by the kidney; as a result, dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is needed in patients withrenal insufficiency or renal failure.Anogenital HSV has been included by some investigators as a potential manifestation of immunereconstitution inflammatory syndrome, but this has not been validated by comparing the anogenital HSVincidence after cART with the incidence during a similar period prior to cART.Managing Treatment FailureResistance of HSV to acyclovir reflects thefact that acyclovir a drug and patients with inadequate HSV-specific cell-mediated immunity failto rapidly clear the HSV infection. Resistance to antiviral drugs should be suspected if systemic involvementand skin lesions do not begin to resolve within 5 to 7 days after initiation of therapy, skin lesions are atypicalin appearance, or satellite lesions appear after 3 to 4 days of therapy. If possible, a lesion culture should beobtained and, if virus is isolated, susceptibility testing performed to confirm resistance. This may be difficultto arrange and will involve significant delay. Thus, the decision to change therapy is often based on clinicalobservations. All acyclovir-resistant HSV strains are resistant to valacyclovir, and it is very rare that they aresensitive to famciclovir. The therapeutic choice for acyclovir-resistant herpes (AI*).63,64Foscarnet has significant nephrotoxic potential; up to 30% of patients experience increases in serumcreatinine levels. It also causes serious electrolyte imbalances (including abnormalities in calcium,phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium levels) in many patients, and secondary seizures or cardiacdysrhythmias can occur. Abnormal liver transaminases and CNS symptoms can also occur. For patientsreceiving foscarnet, CBC, serum electrolytes, and renal function should be monitored twice weekly duringinduction therapy and once weekly thereafter. Infusing foscarnet after saline fluid loading can minimize renaltoxicity. Doses should be modified in patients with renal insufficiency (see package insert). IV cidofovir is used to treat patients with HSV resistant to acyclovir and foscarnet.65For disease limited to asmall number of indolent, non-healing lesions, topical formulations of trifluridine, foscarnet, and cidofovirhave been used successfully, although this will require local preparation, and prolonged application for 21 to28 days or longer may be required.66Preventing RecurrenceAdministration of oral acyclovir prophylaxis (suppressive therapy) for 6 months can prevent cutaneousrecurrences of HSV after neonatal disease of the CNS or skin, eyes, and mouth and may be associated withsuperior neurodevelopmental outcome in those with CNS disease (AI).67Beyond the neonatal period, because recurrent episodes of mucocutaneous HSV disease can be treatedsuccessfully, chronic prophylaxis with acyclovir or other available antivirals against HSV is not required afterGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenM-7lesions resolve in most patients. Effective cART may decrease recurrences. Children who have frequent orsevere recurrences (i.e., 4 to 6 severe episodes a year) can be given daily prophylaxis with oral acyclovir (AI*).Valacyclovir or famciclovir also are options for prophylaxis in adolescents (AI*). Because corneal cloudingcan occur as a result of the stromal reaction of recurrent keratoconjunctivitis, some ophthalmologists useacyclovir prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of recurrences. However, resistance to acyclovir has beenreported in this circumstance in HIV-uninfected patients. Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisPatients receiving prophylactic therapy should be evaluated annually for the need to continue prophylaxis.Cessation of secondary prophylaxis will be determined by the level of immune reconstitution, frequency andseverity of subsequent recurrences, and each individual's tolerance for recurrent episodes.References1.Xu F, Lee FK, Morrow RA, et al.

Infections in regionsin which histoplasmosis is not endemic often result from travel to endemic regions within and outside theUnited States (e.g., Mexico, Central and South America). Risk factors predisposing to infection are exposure toactivities that disturb contaminated sites and are accompanied by aerosolization of spores and (in HIV-infectedadults) a CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count <150 cells/mm3. Because yeast forms of the fungus may remainviable within granulomas formed after successful treatment or spontaneous resolution of infection, late relapsecan occur if cellular immune function wanes, although the magnitude of this risk appears very low.1Infectioncan occur during pregnancy, and transplacental infection has rarely been reported.2Panel's RecommendationsRoutine use of antifungal medications for primary prophylaxis of histoplasmosis in children is not recommended (BIII).Amphotericin B is preferred for initial treatment of moderately severe to severe infections (AI*).Itraconazole is the azole preferred for treatment of histoplasmosis (AIII). In manifestations of histoplasmosis in which antigenuria is demonstrated, antigen levels should be monitored during therapy and for 1year thereafter to identify relapse (AIII).For severe or moderately severe acute primary pulmonary histoplasmosis, amphotericin B should be administered for at least 1 to 2weeks (and clinical improvement) (AIII). After treatment with amphotericin, patients with intact immunity should receive itraconazolefor at least 12 weeks (AIII). Adults with CD4 T (CD4) cell HIV-infected children with severeimmunosuppression should receive itraconazole consolidation therapy for at least 12 months (AIII). The preferred treatment for severe or moderately severe progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is initial (induction) therapy withamphotericin B for 2 weeks (and favorable clinical response), followed by consolidation therapy with itraconazole for at least 12months (AI*). Itraconazole monotherapy for 12 months is recommended for HIV-infected children with mild to moderate progressive disseminatedhistoplasmosis (AII*). Liposomal amphotericin B for 4 to 6 weeks is the preferred initial treatment in the presence of focal brain lesions (BIII*). Thereafter,children should receive itraconazole consolidation therapy for at least 12 months and until cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, includinghistoplasma antigen, have resolved (AII*). In the event of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, antiretroviral therapy should be continued along with antifungal therapy(AIII).Longer-term suppressive therapy (secondary prophylaxis) with itraconazole may be required in HIV-infected children who are severelyimmunosuppressed (meaning CD4 percentage <15% at any age or CD4 count <150 cells/mm3in children aged 6 years) and patientswho experience relapse despite receipt of appropriate therapy (AIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or morewell-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data inchildrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenN-2During the era before combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), histoplasmosis was reported in 2% to 5%of HIV-infected adults living in regions with endemic disease; rates of 25% have been reported in somecities.3In a highly endemic region, histoplasmosis was the AIDS-defining illness in 25% of adults and ofchildren.4Progressive (PDH) occurred in 5% of HIV-infected children inanother highly endemic region (M. Kleiman, unpublished data). The overall incidence of histoplasmosis inchildren has not been examined systematically but appeared to be low, even during the pre-cART era.5AnHIV-positive infant with probable congenital histoplasmosis has been reported in a non-endemic area.6Few epidemiologic data have been reported on disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-infected children andadolescents treated with cART. In several combined Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group cohorts, theincidence rate of all non-Candidainvasive fungal infection was 0.10 infections per 100 child-years (95% CI0.05-0.20) during the pre-cART era, and child-years (95% CI 0.03-0.17) since theadvent of cART.5,7These data were contributed from centers that underrepresented the geographic regions ofmaximal histoplasmosis prevalence, so the statistical power to detect decreases in incidence rates associatedwith cART may have been limited. However, none of the rates of domestic endemic fungal infections (e.g.,histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis) are likely to exceed these estimates in HIV-infectedchildren and adolescents.Clinical ManifestationsIn HIV-uninfected children, acute pulmonary manifestations are common; chronic pulmonary infection hasnot been described. Because of greater airway pliability in children, airway obstruction from mediastinallymphadenopathy is more common in children.8Meningitis often accompanies progressive disseminatedinfection in infancy; subacute meningitis and parenchymal lesions characteristic of central nervous system(CNS) disease in adults are unusual in children.9Isolated pulmonary granulomas resulting from pastinfections are common incidental findings in chest radiographs of asymptomatic persons who have resided inhistoplasmosis-endemic regions.The most frequent clinical manifestation of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected children with AIDS is PDH, whichis fatal if untreated. Prolonged fever and failure to thrive are uniform presenting complaints. Few reports havebeen published of presenting signs and symptoms in children with PDH complicating AIDS.4,10-12However,most are similar to those seen in PDH in otherwise normal infants and in infections in patients with otherprimary or acquired cellular immunodeficiencies. These include splenomegaly, cough, and diagnostic techniques have beendeveloped to aid in diagnosing histoplasmosis.16,17Understanding their uses and limitations is essential tointerpreting results.Histoplasmin skin tests are no longer available and were not useful in diagnosing disseminated disease.14,15Although isolation of the fungus using culture is diagnostic, it often requires invasive procedures, isinsensitive, and may take 10 to 30 days for growth to occur. Lysis-centrifugation methodology facilitatesgrowth of H. capsulatum, and a DNA probe permits prompt identification of isolates.18Histopathologicdemonstration of typical yeast forms in tissue specimens, bone marrow, or peripheral blood can be performedrapidly and, when positive, is highly suggestive of active infection. However, results are positive in only12% to 43% of adults with PDH.16Polymerase chain reaction and DNA probes have been developed todetect H. capsulatumDNA in tissues19and body fluids20but neither is sufficiently sensitive and DNA probesmay lack adequate specificity.16,17Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenN-3Interpretation of serologic testing using complement fixation (CF) and immunodiffusion methods isproblematic in immunocompromised hosts with PDH. CF titers of 1:32 to the yeast and/or mycelialantigens or detection of H and/or M bands with the immunodiffusion test are considered strongly suggestiveof active or recent infection. However, only 41% to 69% of HIV-infected adults are seropositive, comparedwith adults PDH and no underlying immunodeficiency.21,22Thus, seronegativity cannot be usedto exclude active infection, especially PDH. Although a fourfold increase in CF antibody is diagnostic ofactive infection, 2 to 4 weeks is needed to determine this. CF antibody titers of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)may be useful for diagnosing meningitis. In these instances, the assay should begin with undilutedspecimens. Concurrent serum titers should be evaluated to exclude false positivity caused by bloodcontamination of the CSF.9An enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) that rapidly identifies and quantifies histoplasma antigen in body fluidsfills most of the gaps left by other diagnostic methods.22EIA is especially suited for evaluating patients withlarge fungal burdens, a feature of infection in immunocompromised hosts. EIA can detect antigen in serum,bronchoalveolar lavage, and CSF specimens. The reported sensitivity of antigen detection is 91% to 92% inadults with PDH, and 95% in adults with AIDS;16,17sensitivity in children with underlying cellularimmunodeficiency, including those who are HIV-infected, and in otherwise normal infants approaches 100%.14,23The third-generation EIA is standardized by extrapolating antigen concentrations from a calibration curve thatis linear to a value of 39 ng/mL. However, urine antigen concentrations in serious infections frequently exceedthis value. In these instances, serum specimens should be followed because maximum serum concentrations arelower than those in urine and thus more likely to be in a range in which differences can be accurately measured.After resolution of the antigenemia, urine concentrations can be followed to monitor the effectiveness oftreatment and, thereafter, to identify relapse. Antigenuria is identified in 90% of patients whose complicated by cross-reactions with blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, andPenicillium marneffeiinfections.16,17Distinctive clinical and geographic features of these endemic fungalinfections permit accurate differentiation. Urine antigen is detectable in 75% to 81% of immunocompetenthosts with acute, primary pulmonary infection. This occurs early in infection, reflecting the primary fungemiathat is aborted by an effective cellular immune response. Thus, antigenuria in a patient with HIV who retainsnormal cellular immunity may not necessarily presage development of disseminated infection. Based on adultdata, testing both serum and urine following high inoculum exposure may improve sensitivity of detectingantigen in acute primary pulmonary infection, especially in patients with less severe CD4 depletion and milderillness, in whom sensitivity in urine may be lower.24Diagnosis of CNS infection is difficult, particularly in patients who have isolated meningitis withoutdisseminated disease.9Highest sensitivity is achieved by testing CSF for histoplasma antigen, antibody, andlarge-volume culture. In adults, CSF culture is positive in 20% to 60% of patients, CSF antigen is positive in40% to 70%, and CSF antibody is positive in 70% to 90%.16,17Meningitis frequently accompanies PDH ofinfancy,13an entity that has not been associated with a recognized immunodeficiency disorder. Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureMost infections occur without a recognized history of exposure to a high-risk site or activity. Therefore,complete avoidance of exposure in histoplasmosis-endemic regions is not possible. Sites and conditionssometimes implicated in high-risk exposure and point-source outbreaks include disturbances of contaminatedareas resulting in aerosolization of spores. These include soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings, olderurban and rural structures, decaying vegetation or trees, and caves. Dry and windy conditions, excavation,demolition, renovation, gardening, and agricultural activities often predispose to aerosolization of spores.Education should be directed toward avoidance of these activities. If not feasible, reducing the release ofspores by wetting soil, renovation sites, and other potentially contaminated areas, and use of protectiverespiratory devices,25should be recommended.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenN-4Preventing First Episode of DiseaseProphylaxis with itraconazole recommended for HIV-infected adults with CD4 counts <150 cells/mm3andwho reside in areas where histoplasmosis is highly endemic (that is, incidence >10 cases per 100 patient-years) and in instances in which risk of occupational exposure is high. Prophylaxis has no effect on survival.8Given the low incidence of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected children, possibility for drug interaction,development of antifungal drug resistance, and cost, routine use of antifungal medications for primaryprophylaxis of histoplasma infections in children is not recommended (BIII). Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNot applicable.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseasePDH is fatal without treatment. The clinical response to amphotericin B is faster than that of itraconazole andit is preferred for initial treatment of severe infections (AI*). Following amphotericin B induction,itraconazole, the azole preferred for treatment of histoplasmosis (AI*),8is used to complete the course oftherapy. A trial in adults26demonstrated that induction with liposomal amphotericin B was associated withless toxicity and improved survival, compared with induction using amphotericin B deoxycholate.Recommendations for HIV-infected children are derived from trials in adults and from anecdotal experiencein children.8Because of important differences in managing PDH in children, consultation with expertsshould be considered.Itraconazole is usually well tolerated in children. Itraconazole has a long half-life and reaches steady-state levelsat 2 weeks. The interval needed to achieve desired serum concentrations can be shortened if the recommendeddose is administered 3 times daily for the first 3 days of therapy (i.e., loading dose); the recommended dose,administered twice daily, should be started thereafter. Itraconazole solution is preferred to the capsuleformulation because it is better absorbed and serum concentrations are 30% higher than those achievedwith the capsules.The solution should be taken on an empty stomach or with a carbonated beverage. Ifcapsules are used, they should be taken with meals. Because absorption of itraconazole varies considerably frompatient to patient, serum concentrations should be measured to ensure effective levels of drug, monitor changesin dosage, and assess compliance (BIII). The minimal inhibitory concentration of H. capsulatumis 0.01 \u00b5g/mL,and although minimally effective serum concentrations have not been determined, a serum concentration of 1.0 \u00b5g/mL is recommended; dosage should be reduced if concentrations exceed 10 \u00b5g/mL.8Fluconazole is an alternative for patients with mild histoplasmosis and who are intolerant of itraconazole orin whom desired serum levels of itraconazole cannot be attained. Fluconazole is less effective thanitraconazole and has been associated with development of drug resistance.27Acute Primary Pulmonary HistoplasmosisPatients with acute primary pulmonary histoplasmosis can present with a wide spectrum of symptoms,ranging from dyspnea with high fever to only mild respiratory symptoms, and variable fever. Chestradiographs may show mediastinal adenopathy with or without focal pulmonary infiltrate and/or a diffusemiliary-like pattern in high-inoculum exposure; radiographic findings may mimic those of tuberculosis. Forsevere or moderately severe symptoms, liposomal amphotericin B should be administered for 1 to 2 weeks(AI*).8After clinical improvement, adults with CD4 counts >300 cells/mm3and, by extrapolation, HIV-infected children with 6 years, CD4 count >300 cells/mm3, should receiveitraconazole, beginning with a loading dose (see above) for the first 3 days, followed by the recommendeddoses administered twice daily for at least 12 weeks (AIII). All other HIV-infected children should receiveitraconazole for 12 months (AIII). Urine antigen usually is elevated in these situations and should bemonitored to gauge clinical response and, after treatment, identify relapse (AIII).Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenN-5HIV-infected children, particularly those with CD4 percentage >20% (or, if 6 years, CD4 counts >300cells/mm3) compatible with functional cellular immunity, occasionally present with fever, mild primarypulmonary infection, and histoplasmaantigenuria. Although an effective cellular immune response may limitsuch illnesses, it may be prudent to treat with itraconazole for 12 weeks and monitor histoplasma urineantigen concentrations to ensure that concentrations decrease (BIII).Moderately Severe to Severe PDHData derived from experience in HIV-infected adults suggest that HIV-infected children with moderately severeto severe disseminated histoplasmosis should be treated with an IV amphotericin B formulation for 2 weeks(and until they clinically improve), followed by itraconazole for 12 months (AI*). HIV-infected adults withmoderately severe to severe PDH have a higher response rate to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B thanwith the deoxycholate formulation (88% vs. 64%) a lower death rate (2% vs. 13%); therefore liposomalpreparations are preferred in adults and, by extrapolation, in children (AI*).8A loading dose (see above) ofitraconazole should be used for the initial 3 days. If itraconazole is not well tolerated, a 4- to 6-week course ofamphotericin B can be used (AIII). Progressive decline in histoplasma urine and serum antigen levels isexpected with effective treatment, and monitoring levels for lack of such decline can detect relapse.Although therapeutic trials of amphotericin B deoxycholate used to treat PDH in HIV-infected children havenot been performed, this formulation is effective for treating severe PDH in infants,13,28including those withCNS infection,13and in children with other primary or acquired immunodeficiency states. Amphotericin Bdeoxycholate is better tolerated by children than by adults, and it is less costly than other formulations. It canbe used if cost or availability of lipid formulations precludes their use (AIII). Mild to Moderate PDHIn 80% to 100% of patients without signs of CNS infection, mild to moderate PDH responds favorably toitraconazole monotherapy for 12 months (AII*).8,29This regimen also is recommended for HIV-infectedchildren with mild to moderate PDH (AII*). A loading dose of itraconazole (see above) should beadministered at the onset of treatment and serum concentrations monitored. Urine antigen concentrationsshould also be monitored.CNS InfectionCNS infection that accompanies PDH is expected to respond to the regimen recommended for moderatelysevere to severe PDH. Isolated CNS infection is unusual in children. In adults, frequent failure and relapseare common, and aggressive therapy is recommended. Penetration into the CSF is poor with all amphotericinB formulations. Liposomal amphotericin B is preferred for CNS disease in children and adults because itachieves higher concentrations in the brain (AII*); the deoxycholate formulation is an alternative. Anotherlipid formulation can be used at the same dosage if cost is a concern or in patients who cannot tolerateliposomal amphotericin B (AIII). Amphotericin should be administered for 4 to 6 weeks. Thereafter, a childshould receive a loading dose of itraconazole and continuation of itraconazole for 12 months and until CSFabnormalities, including histoplasma antigen, have resolved (AII*).Itraconazole levels should be followed and the dose adjusted to ensure optimal serum concentrations (AIII).Asymptomatic Histoplasma GranulomaIn asymptomatic >15% for all agesand CD4 cell count >150 cells/mm3for ages 6 years) and have resided in an area with endemichistoplasmosis, the presence of a typical granuloma in a chest radiograph should prompt evaluation ofhistoplasma urine antigen and both CF and immunodiffusion antibody. If any of these tests are positive,treatment with itraconazole for 12 weeks is prudent (BIII). If these tests are negative, therapy need not beused, and close clinical follow-up is recommended. In either instance, histoplasma urine antigen testingshould be considered if unexplained fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms occur.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenN-6Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)In manifestations of histoplasmosis in which antigenuria is demonstrated, antigen levels should be monitoredduring therapy and for a year thereafter to identify relapse (AIII).8After a recommended course of therapyand in the absence of symptoms, low-level, stable antigenuria may not constitute a basis for prolonging therecommended course of therapy. Serum levels of itraconazole should be monitored in patients receivingtreatment (AIII).Adverse effects of amphotericin B are primarily nephrotoxicity; permanent nephrotoxicity is related tocumulative dose. Infusion-related fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting can occur, especially early intreatment, although they are less frequent in children than in adults. Renal dysfunction and electrolyteimbalances are the primary toxicities; these parameters should be monitored during therapy.Itraconazole, like other azoles, has relatively low rates of toxicity. GI upset is seen occasionally and itsprincipal toxicity is hepatic. Because the azole drugs inhibit CYP450-dependent hepatic enzymes, druginteractions\u2014particularly with antiretroviral drugs\u2014should be carefully evaluated before initiation of therapy.Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) caused by an inflammatory response to histoplasmosisunmasked by cART-induced improvement in cellular immunity is unusual, and symptoms are often mild.30Inthe event of IRIS, cART should be continued along with antifungal therapy (AIII). IRIS related tohistoplasmosis has not been reported in children.Managing Treatment FailureBoth voriconazole and posaconazole have been used successfully in a small number of refractory cases inadults.8Because little experience has been reported using the newer azoles and data are limited on use ofthese agents in children, expert consultation is recommended for cases refractory to first-line agents.Preventing RecurrenceFollowing initial amphotericin B treatment (induction) and subsequent itraconazole consolidationtherapy for at least 1 year, longer-term suppressive therapy with itraconazole may be required in HIV-infected children who remain immunosuppressed (i.e., CD4 percentage <15% at any age or <150 cells/mm3in children aged 6 years) and in those who experience relapse despite receipt of appropriate therapy(AII*).8,31Fluconazole is less effective than itraconazole (CII*), and experience with voriconazole is limitedin children. Adherence to both antifungal treatment and cART should be monitored carefully, as non-adherence can increase the risk of relapse. Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisDiscontinuation of secondary prophylaxis (suppressive therapy) has not been examined in children. Based ondata from a clinical trial, adults with immune restoration on cART can discontinue itraconazole if itraconazolehas been received for 1 year, blood cultures are negative, serum antigen is <2 ng/mL, CD4 is good adherence to cART.31Extrapolating these recommendations to HIV-infected children on cART with immune restoration (meaning CD4 percentage 15% at any age; CD4 count>150 cells/mm3in children aged 6 years) seems reasonable (CIII). Secondary prophylaxis should resume ifthese parameters are not met. Chronic suppressive therapy is recommended for relapse that occurs despiteappropriate treatment (BIII).References1.Hage CA, Davis TE, Fuller D, et al.

HHV-8 has been causally linked to all forms of KS (i.e., HIV-related, classic endemic, and iatrogenic) and with two rare neoplastic conditions usually associated with HIV infection: body cavity-based lymphoma, also known as primary effusion lymphoma (a B-cell lymphoma that typically arises in body cavities such as the pleural space), and multicentric Castleman disease (non-cancerous tumors that may develop in lymph nodes in a single site or in multiple sites throughout the body). The exact mechanism by which HHV-8 infection leads to neoplastic disease has not been fully elucidated, but seroconversion to HHV-8 antibody positivity virtually always Panel's Recommendations I. Is there an indication for serologic testing for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in asymptomatic HIV-infected children (compared with not testing) to guide clinical management? Antibody (or DNA testing) for HHV-8 is insufficiently sensitive/specific to predict risk of Kaposi sarcoma. Therefore, routine testing to identify HHV-8-seropositive, HIV-infected patients is not recommended ( strong, very low). II. Among HIV-infected children, does initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (as compared with non-initiation) reduce the risk of Kaposi sarcoma? Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART is recommended to reduce the risk of HHV-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma ( strong, low). III. For HIV-infected patients initiating ART, are any specific ART regimens associated with lower rates of Kaposi sarcoma?Data are insufficient and conflicting upon which to base a recommendation for a particular ART regimen for prevention of Kaposi sarcoma ( weak, low). IV. Among HIV-infected children with active Kaposi sarcoma, is treatment with ART (as compared with no ART) associated with higher rates of remission and/or decreased mortality? Treatment with ART is associated with increased survival among HIV-infected children with active Kaposi sarcoma. Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART is recommended for all patients with evidence of active Kaposi sarcoma and other HHV-8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders ( strong, very low). V. Among HIV-infected children with active Kaposi sarcoma, is treatment with chemotherapy in addition to ART (as compared with ART alone) associated with higher rates of remission and/or decreased mortality? Systemic chemotherapy, in addition to ART, is associated with higher rates of remission and decreased mortality and is recommended for disseminated or visceral Kaposi sarcoma (stage T1 disease) and for strong, low). For localized Kaposi sarcoma (stage T0 disease), the benefit of systemic chemotherapy (in addition to ART) is unclear. VI. Among HIV-infected children treated with ART who develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), is chemotherapy in addition to continuation of ART (compared with no chemotherapy) associated with higher rates of remission and/or decreased mortality? For patients with Kaposi-sarcoma-associated IRIS, chemotherapy along with continuation of ART is recommended ( strong, low ). VII. Among HIV-infected children who achieve remission from Kaposi sarcoma, what therapies are recommended to lower the risk of recurrence? Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART in HIV-infected patients with Kaposi sarcoma may prevent Kaposi sarcoma progression or occurrence of new lesions and may decrease risk of recurrence after remission. Life-long ART is recommended for all individuals with evidence of active or treated Kaposi sarcoma or other HHV -8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders ( strong, low). Rating System Recommendation: Strong; Weak Quality of Evidence: High; Moderate; Low; or Very LowGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children O-2precedes development of the tumors.1 The prevalence of antibodies to HHV-8 varies widely with age, geography, and certain risk factors. In the United States and Europe, 1% to 3% of the general adult population is seropositive, with higher rates (8%) among men who have sex with men (MSM).2 In a U.S. cohort of HIV-infected and at-risk (but HIV-negative) adolescents with a median age of 19 years, 11.2% were HHV-8 seropositive.3 The highest rates were in adolescent HIV-infected MSM (23%). Seropositivity was associated with HIV infection, MSM, a history of syphilis, and injection-drug use. 3,4 The general adult seropositivity rate in Mediterranean countries ranges from 10% to 25%. In areas where HHV-8 is endemic, such as eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, HHV-8 seropositivity rates as high as 80% have been reported in adults. 5-9 HHV-8 is transmitted through oral and, possibly, genital secretions. Immunocompetent HHV-8-infected adults frequently shed HHV-8 in their oropharyngeal secretions.10 In areas where HHV-8 infection is endemic, the seroprevalence increases quickly during the first 5 years of life (especially when other family members are HHV-8-positive), then plateaus until adolescence and young adult years.11,12 The seroprevalence among infants and children increases with the number of HHV-8-positive parents and siblings in the home, indicating non-sexual transmission for prepubertal children, with a limited role for perinatal transmission. 11-18 HHV-8 can also be transmitted through exposure to infected blood, including through intravenous (IV) drug use and blood product transfusions.19 For HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HHV-8 places them at increased risk of KS. Most cases of KS occur in adults (compared with children). Before the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the overall incidence of KS in HIV-infected adults was as high as 20%. However, in the United States and England, KS represented less than 1% of pediatric AIDS-defining illnesses, likely due in part to low HHV-8 seroprevalence in children in these regions. Although KS occurs primarily in adults, the incidence in children has increased dramatically as a result of the HIV pandemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. 20-22 Iatrogenic KS has emerged as well, predominantly among adults in developed settings, with increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies and organ transplantation. 23 Pediatric cases of iatrogenic KS after liver or bone marrow transplantation have also been described.24-27 The risk of KS among HIV-infected individuals is highest among those with severe immunodeficiency. KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease can occur at any CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count, but they are described most often in HIV-infected patients with more advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 in adults). It should be noted, however, that 5% to 10% of newly diagnosed KS in adults occurs in those with CD4 cell count >300/mm3 and/or low or undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels.28,29 The incidence of KS appeared to decline in the United States even before the widespread use of ART. The reason is unclear but may have been related to the use of other antiviral agents, such as those used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) (i.e., foscarnet, ganciclovir, and cidofovir), which may inhibit HHV-8. 30-36 The incidence of KS in adults has continued to decrease with the advent of earlier and more aggressive ART. Clinical Manifestations Primary infection with HHV-8 in young, immunocompetent children may be asymptomatic or may present as a self-limited mononucleosis-like illness consisting of fever, mild upper respiratory symptoms, and a maculopapular rash. A similar presentation has been described in immunocompetent adults.37,38 A more severe illness has been described in immunocompromised patients, who may present with disseminated infection with fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. 39,40 Reactivation adults.41 presentation varies widely, with cutaneous, oral, lymphatic, or visceral involvement, or some combination of the three.42,43 Pediatric presentations differ from those of adults and are best described in retrospective cohort studies from sub-Saharan Africa.21,43-45 Cutaneous forms involve characteristic non-Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children O-3tender, purplish, indurated skin lesions, which may be seen in 47% to 83% of affected children. Children also commonly present with lymphatic involvement (30% to 64%), a particularly aggressive form of the disease, and as many as 10% to 18% of these children may not have skin lesions. Intraoral lesions may be seen in 21% to 41%, occasionally (4%) without skin lesions. Visceral dissemination occurs in 12% to 38% of children. Median age at presentation in these studies ranges from 6 years to 10 years, and KS has been diagnosed in children as young as 10 months to 2 years. Median CD4 percentage at presentation in these studies ranges from 7.4% to 16%. Multicentric Castleman disease presents with generalized adenopathy and fever and may progress to multi- organ failure. Primary effusion lymphoma presents with symptoms related to fluid accumulation in the pleural or pericardial space or with abdominal distention. Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of HHV-8 infection is most commonly based on serologic assays, such as immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. However, there is no gold standard for diagnosing HHV-8 infection. Serologic tests range in sensitivity from 80% to 90% and interassay agreement is poor. 46 Combination assays containing both lytic and late-phase antigens may improve detection rates. Nucleic acid-based tests, such as in situ DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are important for tissue diagnosis. Although these tests have high levels of sensitivity, their specificity and reproducibility are highly variable. Only 40% to 60% of patients with proven KS will have HHV-8 DNA in their blood or saliva detectable by PCR, and in them, positivity will vary over time. Diagnosis of KS requires biopsy and histologic examination of affected tissues. Prevention Recommendations Preventing Exposure Routine testing of children and adults for HHV-8 is not recommended; therefore, the serostatus of HIV- infected patients usually is unknown. Although the efficacy of condoms in preventing HHV-8 exposure has not been established, HIV-infected patients should use male latex condoms correctly and consistently during sexual intercourse to reduce exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens. Preventing First Episode of Disease The use of ART with suppression of HIV replication has markedly decreased the incidence of KS in HIV-infected adults. Several antiviral agents (i.e., ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir) inhibit HHV-8 replication in vitro, and data suggest that their use can prevent KS in patients who are HIV/HHV-8 coinfected. 47 However, antiviral use for prevention of KS is not currently recommended. Treatment Recommendations Treating Disease Specific treatment regimens are not included in this report because the HIV -related clinical entities associated with HHV-8, such as KS and Castleman disease, are oncologic and traditionally have been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, in HIV-infected patients with KS, effective suppression of HIV replication with ART may result in improvement in KS lesions, prevent KS progression, or prevent occurrence of new KS lesions. Therefore, ART is recommended for all HIV-infected patients with evidence of active KS and other HHV-8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. In HIV-infected adults with KS, HHV-8 cellular viremia and higher viral load have been associated with disease progression. 48 The vast majority of infected cells are not undergoing lytic replication, and anti- herpesvirus medications have had little or no effect on established KS or HHV-8 cellular viremia. Studies are under way of methods that induce lytic replication or attack the episomal (latent) HHV-8 genome.49,50Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children O-4In contrast to KS, in Castleman disease, many of the cells support lytic replication of HHV-8, and treatment with anti-herpesvirus drugs has led to substantial clinical improvement in some studies.50 IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir may be considered for treating multicentric Castleman disease51 and may be a useful adjunct for treating primary effusion lymphoma.52,53 These diagnoses are exceedingly rare in children; in such cases, adult guidelines should be consulted. Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) KS-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (KS-IRIS) generally describes the appearance of or paradoxical clinical worsening of KS after initiation of a potent ART regimen. KS-IRIS is not predicted by low CD4 cell count. 54 KS-IRIS is associated with higher mortality than KS not associated with IRIS. In African cohorts, where mortality from KS-IRIS is high, chemotherapy in addition to ART was associated with increased survival. 55 For patients with disease manifestations of HHV-8 infection who are treated with ganciclovir or valganciclovir, refer to the chapter on CMV infections ( Monitoring and Adverse Events ) for information on treatment-associated adverse events. Preventing Recurrence Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART in HIV-infected patients with KS may result in improvement in KS lesions, prevent KS progression, or prevent occurrence of new KS lesions and is recommended for all individuals with evidence of active KS and other HHV-8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. Primary Prevention I. Is there an indication for serologic testing for HHV-8 in asymptomatic HIV-infected children (compared with not testing) to guide clinical management? Routine testing to identify HHV-8-seropositive, HIV-infected patients is not recommended ( strong, very low). Although KS is one of the most common cancers in HIV-infected individuals, a minority of coinfected individuals will develop KS. Seroprevalence of HHV-8 varies by country, but in some areas reaches 50% by adulthood. Sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing vary , and HHV -8 DNA shedding in saliva and presence in plasma are not consistent. Studies are conflicting on utility of quantitative DNA PCR for prediction of risk of KS in HHV-8-seropositive, HIV-infected adults. Based on lack of accurate prediction of risk of KS by antibody and HHV-8 DNA assays, routine testing is not indicated. For someone known to be HHV-8-seropositive, that factor should be considered in discussions about ART initiation. II. Among HIV-infected children, does initiation of ART (as compared with non-initiation) reduce the risk of KS? Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART is recommended to reduce the risk of HHV-8-associated KS (strong, low). Multiple observational studies in adults have shown that the incidence of KS is drastically reduced in adults on ART. 56,57 In one retrospective pediatric study, 0 of 1,000 children on ART developed KS, in contrast with 32 children out of 3,000 who presented with or developed KS prior to starting ART.45 III. For HIV-infected patients initiating ART, are any specific ART regimens associated with lower rates of KS? Data are insufficient and conflicting on which to base a recommendation for a particular AR T regimen for prevention of KS (weak, low). Evidence has been conflicting as to whether non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNR TI)- or Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children O-5protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART has an advantage in the prevention of KS. Laboratory evidence of PI antitumor activity exists, most notably for nelfinavir, but also for ritonavir and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. In addition, there is preliminary evidence that PI-based therapy reduces HHV-8 DNA oropharyngeal shedding.58 One recent, large observational study of adults noted an advantage for PI-based therapy over NNRTI-based regimens in the prevention of KS, but other studies have found no difference between regimens. 56,57 There are no corresponding data from pediatric studies. It should be noted that 5% to 10% of new cases of KS in adults occur in those on therapy, with undetectable viral loads and/or CD4 cell counts >300 cells/mm 3.28,29 Treatment IV . Among HIV-infected children with active KS, is treatment with ART (as compared with no ART) associated with higher rates of remission and/or decreased mortality? Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART is recommended for all patients with evidence of active KS and/or other HHV-8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders ( strong, very low). Treatment with ART is first-line therapy against KS and other HHV-8-associated malignant proliferative disorders, and is associated with increased survival among HIV-infected children with active KS.21,44,58 V . Among HIV-infected children with active KS, is treatment with chemotherapy in addition to ART (as compared with ART alone) associated with higher rates of remission and/or decreased mortality? Systemic chemotherapy, in addition to ART, is associated with higher rates of remission and decreased mortality and is recommended for disseminated or visceral KS (stage T1 disease) and for primary effusion lymphoma ( strong, low). For localized KS (stage T0 disease), the benefit of systemic chemotherapy (in addition to ART) is unclear. There is a paucity of information to guide the clinical management of HIV-infected children with KS. The available studies were retrospective, had relatively small sample sizes, and were performed in sub-Saharan Africa. 44,45,58 Data from these studies were not adjusted for KS stage or for comorbidities. Additionally, AIDS Clinical Trials Group staging classification has not been validated in children. For focal or early stage KS, HIV-infected adults have been effectively treated with ART alone.59 Local intralesional chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be considered for focal disease. The available evidence in children suggests that systemic chemotherapy in addition to ART is associated with increased likelihood of remission and decreased mortality. It is unclear, however, if localized disease (stage T0) can be treated effectively without systemic chemotherapy. Data are insufficient on which to base a recommendation for a particular chemotherapy regimen, and various regimens have been used in different settings. Patient clinical presentation and available therapies in the practice setting should be considered, in consultation with an oncologist. VI. Among HIV-infected children treated with ART who develop IRIS, is chemotherapy in addition to continuation of ART (compared with no chemotherapy) associated with higher rates of remission and/or decreased mortality? For patients with KS-associated IRIS, chemotherapy along with continuation of ART is recommended (strong, low). Studies of HIV-infected adults with KS-associated IRIS (primarily from African cohorts) indicate that chemotherapy in addition to ART, as opposed to ART alone, is associated with reduced mortality. 55,60 Secondary Prevention VII. Among HIV-infected children who achieve remission from KS, what therapies are recommended to lower the risk of recurrence? Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART in HIV-infected patients with KS may prevent KS progression or occurrence of new lesions and is recommended for all individuals with evidence of active or treated KS and/or other HHV-8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders ( strong, low). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children O-6The risk of KS recurrence has decreased in the ART era. In 1 study of adults treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and ART (which continued after chemotherapy), the relapse rate was 13.5% per year, and was highest in the first year.61 In 1 large Italian study, a multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong association between use of ART and increased 10-year survival rates after KS.62 References 1.

Alpha HPVinfects cutaneous and mucosal squamous epithelium. More than 100 distinct types of alpha HPV exist.1HPVcan be detected on normal healthy mucosal and cutaneous surfaces but also is associated with warts andanogenital pre-cancers and cancers and oropharyngeal cancers in adults, and in rare cases, in adolescents andchildren. Certain types are found predominantly in cutaneous warts (such as HPV2) whereas other distinctPanel's RecommendationsHIV-infected individuals should use latex condoms during every act of sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of exposure tosexually transmitted pathogens, including human papillomavirus (HPV) (AII).Ideally, HPV vaccine should be administered before an individual becomes sexually active (AIII).HPV vaccination is recommended in HIV-infected females and males aged 11 to 12 (AIII)and 13 to 26 (BIII)years. HPVvaccination also can be administered to HIV-infected males and females aged 9 to 10 years. The bivalent and quadrivalentvaccines are approved for females and the quadrivalent vaccine is approved for males. Sexually active female adolescents who are HIV-infected should have routine cervical cancer screening whether or not they havebeen vaccinated (AIII).HIV-infected female adolescents who have initiated sexual intercourse should have cervical screening cytology (liquid-based orPap smear) obtained twice at 6-month intervals during the first year after diagnosis of HIV infection, and if the results arenormal, annually thereafter (AII). A Pap smear should be performed within 1 year of onset of sexual activity, regardless of age ormethod of HIV transmission (BIII).If the results of the Pap smear are abnormal, in general, care should be provided according to the Guidelines for Management ofWomen with Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology(http://www.asccp.org/ConsensusGuidelines/tabid/7436/Default.aspx).HIV-infected adolescent females should be referred for colposcopy if they have any of (ASC-H). For HIV-infected adolescent females with atypicalsquamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), either immediate referral to colposcopy or repeat cytology in 6-12months is recommended. If ASC-US or greater is found on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is warranted (BIII). Use ofHPV testing is not recommended for screening or for triage of HIV-infected women with abnormal cytology results or follow-upafter treatment (BIII).Because of the high rate of recurrence after treatment, conservative management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-1 (CIN1)and CIN2 with observation is the preferred method for HIV-infected adolescent females (BIII).Because risk of recurrence of CIN and cervical cancer after conventional therapy is increased in HIV-infected females, patientsshould be carefully followed after treatment with frequent cytologic screening and colposcopic examination according topublished guidelines (AII).Genital warts should be treated per the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines (located athttp://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/)Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-2mucosal types are associated with anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. The mucosal HPV types found incancers are referred to as high-risk and those not associated with cancers are referred to as low-risk types. Of theapproximately 40-plus genital (i.e., mucosal) HPV types, 12 types have been established as high-risk (16, 18, 31,33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59), and 6 as probable high-risk (26, 53, 66, 68, 73, 82).1HPV16 alone accountsfor 50% of all squamous cell (SC) cervical cancers and 80% to 90% of SC cancers. vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers, HPV16 is attributed to 50% to 80% as well.2-4Skin warts associated with HPV are common in children,5-7whereas mucosal warts, including anogenital8,9and oral warts, are less common.10HPV-associated cutaneous warts are transmitted by close person-to-person contact that is facilitated by minortrauma to the skin. Skin warts are most commonly associated with cutaneous HPV types 1, 2, 3, 4, 27, and 57,and are associated with distinct wart histology. The estimated prevalence of skin warts in immunocompetentchildren varies by population from approximately 5% to 50%.5-7In comparison, children with compromisedcellular immunity often have intense and widespread appearance of both cutaneous and mucosal warts.Unfortunately, no data are available on prevalence or incidence of skin warts in HIV-infected children.HPV-associated anogenital warts are known to be transmitted by sexual contact, thereby raising the concern ofsexual abuse when diagnosed in pre-pubertal children.9,11The prevalence of HPV-associated anogenital wartsvaries by population and factors, For example, varying prevalences of HPV-associated anogenital children referred to care hospital9and 1.8% in children with suspected sexual abuse.12Several studies have shown thatanogenital warts can be found in children with no evidence of sexual abuse, suggesting that transmission mayoccur through other means such as perinatally13or through other non-sexual means (e.g., autoinoculation ortransmission from the hands or mouth of a caretaker).14-16HPV6 and 11 are the most common types detected inanogenital warts in children.17In one study of children with anogenital warts, 24% of children had an adultfamily member with anogenital warts, 63% had a mother with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and48% had a family member with non-sexual transmission as the route ofinfection.19Rarely, cutaneous HPV types also have been associated with anogenital warts in children.20Oralpapillomas also have been described in children as well as sexually active adolescents and are commonlyassociated with HPV6 and 11. Juvenile Onset Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (JORRP), which is alsoassociated with HPV6 and 11, can be life-threatening due to the ability of the lesions to cause airwayobstruction. Incidence of JORRP in the United States is around 1.7 to 4.3 per 100,000. Detection of HPV DNA in normal tissue of infants has been documented, suggesting that perinatal transmissionalso can occur. Rates of HPV DNA detected in newborns vary significantly (0%-70%), and when found in theinfant, concordance between the mother and infant also is quite variable (<1%-100%).21-23Studies completedbefore 2000 tended to have higher rates of detection, whereas more recent studies find low rates of HPV DNAdetected in infants (<5%). A systematic quantitative review of maternal-neonatal transmission concluded thatpooled mother-to-child HPV transmission was around 6.5%.21Several authors have suggested that the rate ofHPV detection in infants depends on the rate found in pregnant mothers.22,24Risks of DNA detection innewborns include mother's HPV status at delivery and condyloma orsquamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL]) in studies have concluded that pregnancy itself,even in HIV-infected women, is not associated with increased vulnerability to HPV .25In a recent study, 19.7% of infants born to HPV-infected mothers and 16.9% of infants born to mothers whowere HPV-negative at delivery were found to be HPV-positive in their orogenital area at some time during a14-month follow-up period, suggesting that vertical transmission is not the sole source of oral or genital HPVinfection in infants.22Although maternal history of condyloma at time of delivery has been a well-describedrisk factor for appearance of genital condyloma in infants months later, the risk remains quite low, withestimates of 7 per 1,000 births with a maternal history of genital warts.26In a parent-child study in Finland,27the cumulative detection rates for high-risk HPV from the child's genital and oral samples were 36% and42%, respectively.28However, persistence of HPV was less common, with persistent oral HPV in 10% ofGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-3infants and persistent genital HPV in 1.5% of infants. Together, these data show that while oral and genitalperinatal transmission can occur, persistence is unusual when infection is acquired (whether through verticalor horizontal transmission). Genital HPV is most commonly a result of sexual transmission. Young age at first sexual intercourse and ahigher number of recent sex partners are strong risk factors for HPV in both women and men.29-34Prevalence ofHPV is common in sexually active adolescent girls, with prevalence of 12% to 64%, compared with 2% to 7%in women aged >35 years.32,35-37Cervical HPV is acquired shortly after onset of sexual activity, with 50%cumulative exposure within 3 years,29,30even among young women with one sex partner.38Recent data on youngmen suggest similarly high rates of genital HPV acquisition associated with number of sexual partners.39Ratesof HPV are higher in HIV-infected adolescents and adult women than in HIV-uninfected women.40-42As withHPV , CIN and condyloma also are more common in HIV-infected women than uninfected women.43-47Although the incidence of anogenital HPV infection in sexually active youth is high, longitudinal studies havedemonstrated that 80% to 90% of infections in HIV-uninfected youth are transient, and spontaneouslyregress.48,49Repeated infections with new types are common,49but whether repeat detection of same-HPV-typeinfections result from new exposures or from reactivation of latent infection is unknown.50Rates of clearanceof genital HPV infection are even higher in men.39Overall prevalence of HPV remains above 50% in menacross all age groups, suggesting that repeated infections are even more common in men than in women.51Arisk for HPV in the anus in women is associated with anal intercourse.52,53One study also showed that analHPV acquisition was associated with cervical HPV infection and was quite common even without reported analintercourse, suggesting that other sexual and non-sexual routes of anal acquisition are possible.53The higher prevalence of HPV infections in HIV-infected populations may result partly from increased HPVpersistence in these patients. In one study of adolescents with HIV , only 50% cleared their HPV infections.54Detection of anal HPV also is higher in HIV-infected youth.55Receptive anal sex is a risk factor for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men;56the association between anal and sex as clear studies of HIV-infected and -uninfected women, anal HPV infection is equal toif not more prevalent than cervical infection.53,58Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types is associated with increased risk of CIN and cervical andvulvovaginal carcinoma in women and of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal carcinoma in bothwomen and men. Rates of HPV-associated cancers including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal (men andwomen), and oropharyngeal are higher in HIV-infected individuals59-61and believed to result predominantlyfrom the increased risk of persistent infection in this group. The rates are highest in HIV-infected youngpeople.59Adolescent girls, whether HIV-infected or -uninfected, differ biologically from adult women (e.g.,increased areas of cervical squamous metaplasia in adolescents, resulting in an increased susceptibility toeither persistent infection or disease).40,62Even though combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically altered HIV's natural history, itsimpact on HPV and HPV-associated neoplasia is less clear. Several studies have shown that HPV prevalenceand rates of CIN and AIN have not been reduced with cART,54,63,64in contrast to rates of Kaposi sarcoma,which have fallen dramatically since the advent of cART. Current data suggest that cervical cancer rates havedecreased in most racial/ethnic groups, while anal cancer rates have increased in HIV-infected individuals.65Other risks associated with increasing rates of cervical cancer include lack of cervical cancer screening,prolonged use of hormonal contraception, parity, smoking, and immunocompromising conditions (other thanHIV).31A recent study of perinatally infected adolescents showed that 30% of HIV-infected girls had anabnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or greater) Pap smear.66The meanage at the time of the first Pap smear was 16.7 years (range 13-23 years). The observational study also notedthat 23 cases of condyloma were reported in those younger than age 13. In a small study of Brazilian infants,HIV in the mother was noted to be a risk factor for neonatal transmission.24These data suggest that perinatallyinfected children may be more vulnerable to maternal transmission of HPV , because of higher rates of HPV inthis group, and higher rates of HPV persistence in the neonatal and infant period due to immunosuppression.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-4Clinical ManifestationsGenital, bladder, andrespiratory tract mucosa. Lesions in the genital area are often referred to as condyloma accuminata. Wartscan be single or present with multiple lesions and often appear as papules, flat, smooth or pedunculatedlesions. Common sites for skin warts are the hand, elbows, knees, and feet. JORRP can present withhoarseness and difficulty breathing.Precancerous and Cancerous Lesions Genital lesions associated with HPV include high grade CIN; vulvar intraepithelial asymptomatic. high-risk vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal,specifically at the base of the tongue and tonsils. Cancers are often asymptomatic but also can be associatedwith bleeding, pain or a palpable mass.DiagnosisGenital, Anal, Oral and Skin Warts Most cutaneous and anogenital warts can be diagnosed by visual inspection. A speculum examination may berequired for cervical and vaginal lesions and anoscopy for intra-anal lesions. If the lesions do not respond tostandard therapy or the warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, or ulcerated, biopsy may be needed. Patients in whom cancer or JORRP is suspected should be referred to an expert for diagnosis and management.Intraepithelial and Squamous Cell CancersThe same cytology and colposcopic techniques used to detect CIN in HIV-uninfected patients should be usedin HIV-infected patients. Cytology is a screening test for cervical cancer (see Prevention section). However,histology remains the gold standard for confirming CIN and invasive cancers. In sexually active individuals,the entire genitalia and anal canal should be inspected carefully for visual signs of warts, intraepithelialneoplasia or invasive cancers. Vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers often can be palpated by digital examinationof the vaginal, vulvar, and intra-anal regions. Diagnosis is by histology; CIN, AIN, VaIN, VIN, and oralcancer are recognized through visual inspection, which includes colposcopy and high-resolution anoscopy(HRA), and biopsy to confirm diagnosis. Role of HPV TestingHPV DNA can be detected using several platforms.67HPV tests available can detect from 2 to 13 to 14oncogenic HPV types in clinical specimens. Currently, data are insufficient for use of HPV testing in triageof HIV-infected women with abnormal cytology results or for follow-up after treatment (BIII), and it is notrecommended for primary screening for any women younger than age 30. HPV testing also is not helpful indiagnosing or managing visible genital, skin or oral warts. HPV testing is not recommended in anycircumstance for adolescent girls (aged <20 years),68regardless of whether they are HIV-infected or HIV-uninfected, because of the high rates of HPV infection.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureHIV-infected individuals should use latex condoms during every act of sexual intercourse to reduce the riskof exposure to (or transmission of) sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). Condom use has been shown toGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-5reduce HPV genital acquisition, reduce risk of genital warts, and enhance clearance of CIN.33,69,70This is truein both HIV-infected men and women.71In all circumstances where a male condom cannot be used properly,the use of a female condom may be protective for vaginal intercourse (AII), but may not be protective foranal intercourse involving either women (BIII)or men who have sex with men (BIII).72,73HPV VaccineThe quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines have been shown to prevent HPV16 and 18 infections and associatedprecancers in females and the quadrivalent has been shown to prevent HPV16 and 18 infections andprecancers in males. The quadrivalent vaccine also protects against HPV6 and 11 infections and associatedgenital warts in females and males.74-77Because the HPV vaccine prevents infection and is not therapeutic, itideally should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual contact (AIII). Data fromclinical trials75of both vaccines showed that if previous exposure to the vaccine HPV types was documented,no efficacy was noted for that type, underscoring the fact that the vaccine is not therapeutic.A randomized clinical trial of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the United States found the vaccine to be safeand immunogenic in HIV-infected children aged 8 to 11 years.78Serum antibodies to HPV6 and 18 were 30%to 50% lower than in historic age-matched immunocompetent controls. In addition, at 18 months after thethird dose of vaccine, 94% to 99% had antibody to HPV6, 11, and 16, however, only 76% had antibody toHPV18. This group was also given a fourth dose which demonstrated an excellent amnestic response for allthe vaccine associated HPV types.79The clinical significance of this observation is unknown. Ongoingstudies will continue to evaluate the efficacy and duration of immune response in HIV-infected boys andgirls. Although no studies in HIV-infected adolescents and adult women have yet been published, a study inHIV-infected men found the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic.80Data on prior exposure to vaccine types in HIV-positive individuals aged 13 to 26 years are insufficient todetermine the proportion that would benefit from vaccination. HPV vaccination in HIV-infected youth is recommended (AIII). Either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccineoffers protection against the two most common types that are associated with HPV-associated genitalcancers. Quadrivalent vaccine also offers protection against the two most common types that cause genitalwarts. Either the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination of HIV-infected females aged 11 to 12 years; quadrivalent HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination ofHIV-infected males aged 11 to 12 years. The first dose of the HPV vaccine series should be administered to males and females aged 11 to 12 years,but can be administered as early as age 9 years. The second dose should be administered 1 to 2 months afterthe first dose, and the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose. HIV-infectedadolescents aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or have not completed the vaccineseries should be vaccinated (see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6050a3.htm) (AIII).Preventing DiseaseCircumcision There is evidence that circumcision reduces the rates of oncogenic HPV infection of the penis,81-85and isassociated with lower risk of penile cancer86,87and cervical cancer in sexual partners.88Because other studiessuggest no benefit,89evidence is insufficient to recommend adult male circumcision solely for the purpose ofreducing the risk of oncogenic HPV infection in HIV-infected men or their sex partners in the United States,or infant male circumcision solely for the purpose of reducing the future risk of oncogenic HPV infectionbefore or after they initiate sex. Preventing Cervical CancerHIV-infected adolescents and women who have initiated sexual intercourse should have cervical screeningcytology (liquid-based or Pap smear) obtained twice at 6-month intervals during the first year after diagnosis ofGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-6HIV infection, and if the results are normal, annually thereafter (AII). Because of the reportedly high rate ofprogression of abnormal cytology in HIV-infected adolescents46and young women who were infected throughsexual intercourse, providers should consider screening within 1 year of onset of sexual activity, regardless ofage or method of HIV acquisition (BIII). Although no similar prospective data are available for perinatallyinfected adolescents, Brogly et al66reported that 30% of perinatally infected adolescents had an abnormality(ASCUS or greater ) on their first Pap smear. HIV-infected adolescents and women who have become sexuallyactive, whether vaccinated or not, should continue screening annually throughout their lives (BIII). Evidence isinsufficient to recommend cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected girls who are not sexually active.If Pap smear results are abnormal, care should be provided according to the Guidelines for Management ofWomen with Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests by American Society for Colposcopy and CervicalPathology.68Exceptions include the role of HPV testing in women age 21 and older (see section HPV Testingabove). It is recommended that triage be done in HIV-infected adolescents similar to that in adult women, should be referred forcolposcopy (BIII). For ASC-US, either immediate referral to colposcopy or repeat cytology in 6 to 12months is recommended. Some clinicians may opt for colposcopy in HIV-infected adolescents/women. IfASC-US or greater is found on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is warranted.Preventing Vaginal and Vulvar CancerNo routine screening for vaginal or vulvar cancer is recommended for HIV-infected children and adolescents.Women with a history of high-grade CIN or invasive cervical cancer are at increased risk of vulvar andvaginal cancer and should be referred to a specialist (AIII).Preventing Anal CancerAt this time, no national recommendations exist for routine screening for anal cancer; some specialistsrecommend anal cytologic screening for HIV-seropositive men and women (CIII).69An annual digital analexamination may be useful to detect on palpation masses that could be anal cancer (BIII).90If and indicates ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL, or HSIL, then it should be followed by HRA (BIII).Visible lesions should be biopsied to determine the level of histologic changes and to rule out invasive cancer(BIII)(see section on treatment for details of treatment of AIN).Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseGenital WartsMultiple treatments for HPV-associated skin and external genital lesions exist, but no one treatment is idealfor all patients or all lesions (CIII).91Treatment can induce wart-free periods, but the underlying viralinfection can persist, resulting in recurrence. Treatment modalities for external genital warts are the same forHIV-infected and -uninfected populations. Guidelines for the treatment of warts found in the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, shouldbe followed.92Individuals who are immunosuppressed because of HIV may have larger or more numerouswarts, and may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to therapy for genital warts.Recurrences after therapy also are an issue for these patients.92-95Topical treatments may be ineffective inpatients with large or extensive lesions. Self-applied therapies include podofilox (0.5%) solution or gel,imiquimod Cidofovir gel (1%) is a topical preparation that has been evaluated ina limited number of adults for treatment of anogenital HPV infection (CIII). Topical cidofovir can beGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-7absorbed systemically and associated with renal toxicity.96Injectable therapy (such as with IFN- or 5-FU/epinephrine gel implant) should be offered in only severe recalcitrant cases because of inconvenientroutes of administration, frequent office visits, and a high frequency of systemic adverse effects.Lesions can be removed by cryotherapy or surgery (BIII). Cryotherapy (application of liquid nitrogen or dryice) must be applied until each lesion is thoroughly frozen. Treatment can be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks upto 4 times. The major toxicity is local pain. Adequate local pain management is essential for all caustictreatments. Topical anesthetics are favored. Lesions can be removed surgically by tangential scissor,tangential shave excision, curettage, or electrosurgery. Limited data are available on treatment of oral warts in HIV-infected patients. Limited lesions can be treatedwith provider-applied therapies such as TCA or BCA or surgical excision. Extensive lesions should bereferred to an expert.97Treatment of Histologically Confirmed CINHIV-infected female adolescents should be evaluated by a clinician with experience in colposcopy and treatmentof cervical cancer precursors, and managed according to The American Society for Colposcopy and CervicalPathology (ASCCP) guidelines.68Not only is progression of lesions more common in HIV-infected women,recurrence is also more common, thus close observation as outlined in the CDC Sexually Transmitted DiseasesTreatment Guidelines, 2010, should be considered for management of CIN1 and 2. Follow-up with annualcytologic assessment is recommended for with CIN1 (AII).68At the 12-month follow-up, onlyadolescents with HSIL or greater on repeat cytology should be referred back to colposcopy. At the 24-monthfollow-up, those with an ASCUS or greater result should be referred back to colposcopy (AII).For adolescent girls and young women with a histologic diagnosis of CIN2 or 3 not otherwise specified orcytologic diagnosis of HSIL, either treatment or observation for up to 24 months using both colposcopy andcytology at 6-month intervals is acceptable, provided colposcopy is satisfactory (BIII).68When a histologicdiagnosis of CIN2 is specified, observation is preferred, but treatment is acceptable. If compliance withfollow-up is a concern, then treatment may be preferable for CIN2. When CIN3 is histologically diagnosedor when colposcopy is unsatisfactory, (BIII).If appearance of the cytology a high-grade for 1 year, repeat biopsy is recommended (BIII). After 2 consecutive Negative for IntraepithelialLesion or Malignancy results, adolescents and young women with normal colposcopy can return to routinecytologic screening (BII). Treatment is recommended if CIN3 is subsequently identified or if CIN2 or 3persists for 24 months (BII).Persistent CIN1, 2, and 3 lesions in HIV-infected women should be treated as in HIV-uninfected women.68Conventional therapies used to treat CIN2 or 3 include cryotherapy, laser therapy, cone biopsy, and a loopelectrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Excisional methods are recommended for women with abnormalcolposcopy and for women with recurrent disease (AII). Recurrence rates of 40% to 60% after treatment havebeen reported in HIV-infected women undergoing these procedures.98-100Management of invasive cervicalcancer should follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (http://www.nccn.org).Treatment of VIN and Vulvar Cancer and of VaIN and Vaginal CancerTreatment of VIN/VaIN should be made in consultation with a specialist. Low-grade VIN/VaIN (VIN 1/V AIN 1)can be observed or managed as per recommendations for vulvovaginal warts. Various treatment modalities forVIN are available, including TCA, local excision, laser vaporization or ablation, and imiquimod therapy.Treatment options for VaIN include vaporization with a CO2laser, and excisional procedureswith electrosurgical loops or a scalpel excision. Fluorouracil cream and ointments should not be used inpregnant women. Management of invasive vulvar or vaginal cancer should follow the NCCN guidelines(http://www.nccn.org). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-8Treatment of AINThere are no adequate randomized, controlled, therapeutic trials reported for the treatment of AIN. Treatmentdecisions are based on size, location, and severity of histology. Several different treatments have beendescribed in small open-label studies, including topical 5-FU or imiquimod, infrared coagulation, lasertherapy, and surgical excision.101-104These data do not indicate that treatment for HIV-infected women withAIN should be modified for patients receiving cART nor is there evidence indicating that cART should beinstituted or modified for the purpose of treating AIN.Treatment of HPV-associated disease at other sites, including oral and penile lesions, does not differ in HIV-infected versus uninfected men and women. Role of Antiretroviral TherapySevere immunosuppression is associated with greater HPV-associated morbidity and mortality. However,studies show conflicting findings in reducing risk of HPV-related cervical and anal HPV disease, therefore,intraepithelial neoplasia by itself is not an indication for initiating cART.Monitoring of Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Monitoring for toxicity and recurrences is required during and after treatment of genital warts. The majortoxicity of podofilox, imiquimod, and sinecatechin ointment is inflammation at the application site. The majortoxicity of cryotherapy is local pain. The major toxicities of surgical treatment for genital warts are local pain,bleeding, and secondary infection. The major toxicities associated with acid cauterization are local pain andirritation or ulceration of adjacent normal skin. Intralesional IFN- can be associated with systemic toxicities ofIFN-, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, depression, and other influenza-like symptoms. Infraredcoagulation may lead to bleeding and abscess formation. Scarring can occur with any of the above treatmentmodalities. Topical cidofovir may result in systemic absorption and be associated with renal toxicity.96Secondary infections are not uncommon if ulcerations occur, and close monitoring post-treatment fortreatment-related toxicity is warranted. Treatment of CIN with ablative and excisional modalities can beassociated with several adverse events such as pain and discomfort, intraoperative hemorrhage, post-operative hemorrhage, infection, and cervical stenosis. Treatment of AIN is associated with adverse events,including ulcerations, abscesses, fissures, and fistulas.An immune reconstitution-like syndrome related to HPV-associated oral warts in HIV-infected adults hasbeen observed in which occurrence of oral warts was associated with decreased HIV RNA levels withcART.105Immune reconstitution in response to viral load reduction may result in a return of markedinflammatory responses against latent oral HPV infection. Some studies,105,106but not others,107have reportedan increase in oral warts following cART initiation.Preventing RecurrenceMonitoring after therapy for cervical disease should follow the ASCCP guidelines.108No recommendations existfor preventing recurrence of external genital warts. Patients should be monitored with cytologic screeningaccording to published guidelines and, when indicated, colposcopic examination for recurrent lesions (AI).90,109Managing Treatment FailureTreatment failure is defined as the persistence or recurrence of lesions after appropriate therapy. For persistent orrecurrent genital warts, re-treatment with any of the modalities previously described should be considered,preferably with an alternative modality to the one that previously failed (AIII). Genital warts often require morethan one course of treatment. Recalcitrant warts should be managed by experienced clinicians and referred forexcisional therapy. Recurrence of CIN may require additional treatments (e.g., LEEP, laser). Excisional therapyis recommended for recurrent lesions. Recurrent cytologic and histologic abnormalities after therapy for CINshould be managed according to the ASCCP guidelines.68There is no consensus on the treatment of biopsy-Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenP-9proven recurrent VIN, VaIN or AIN. Risk of recurrence of CIN and cervical cancer after conventional therapy isincreased in HIV-infected women, and patients should be carefully followed after treatment with frequentcytologic screening and colposcopic examination according to published guidelines (AII).99,110Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisNot applicable.

Use of a cryoprobe in the vagina isnot recommended.Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or podophyllinresin (10%-25%) is for urethralmeatal warts.Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or TCA/BCA orsurgical removal is anal warts.Abnormal Pap should be referredto colposcopy for diagnosis and management.Dosing Recommendations for Prevention and Treatment of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Key to Acronyms:5-FU = 5-fluorouracil; BCA = bichloroacetic = twice TID = three times dailyGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Among HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenQ-1Influenza (Last updated November 6, 2013; last reviewed November 6, 2013) EpidemiologyInfluenza viruses are spread directly from person to person across distances less than 6 feet via large or smalldroplets generated by coughing or sneezing or indirectly from contaminated surfaces to hands to mucosalmembranes.1Influenza has an incubation period of 1 to 4 days (mean: 2 days),2and can be shed by adultsfrom 1 day before to 5 to 10 days after onset of symptoms and by children from several days before to 10days after illness onset.3Viral shedding can occur over longer periods of time in those with chronic diseases,including patients with immunologic suppression or those receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy.4-7Seasonal influenza viruses can be divided into three types: A, B, and C. Influenza A viruses are furthersubdivided based on surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Influenza A virusescirculate primarily among aquatic birds, but also among humans and other animals, including pigs, horses,and seals. Influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 currently circulate among humans. Influenza B circulatesprimarily among humans.8Influenza C circulates primarily among animals such as swine and dogs and rarelyin humans.9,10Influenza A and B cause seasonal outbreaks and impose a higher disease burden than influenzaC, which is associated with milder illness, sporadic cases, and rarely, localized outbreaks. Two influenza Asubtypes and one influenza B strain are included in current seasonal influenza vaccines. Influenza virusescause annual outbreaks in the United States lasting from winter through early spring. Certain groups have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be at risk ofcomplications from influenza, including individuals with immunosuppression caused by HIV infection.11Theburden of influenza virus in HIV-infected children has been characterized in limited case reports and caseseries, but assessment of its impact has been confounded by the stage of HIV infection, type of antiretroviraltherapy (ART), and other comorbidities.12In the era before combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), multiplelarge epidemiological studies suggested high hospitalization and mortality rates with influenza in HIV-infectedPanel's RecommendationsThe approach to evaluation and treatment of HIV-infected children on stable combination antiretroviral therapy with suspected orconfirmed influenza should be similar to that of HIV-uninfected children (AIII). HIV-infected children with evidence of moderate-to-severe immunosuppression by CD4-defined or clinical disease-defined categories may be at increased risk of influenza-relatedcomplications and should be monitored closely until illness resolution (BII).Prevention of influenza in HIV-infected children aged 6 months and older should include annual administration of trivalentinactivated influenza vaccine, according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations (see annualupdated recommendations at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm) (AII).Influenza-specific antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be considered for HIV-infected children based on level ofimmunosuppression and other preexisting co-morbidities, influenza vaccination status, and degree of exposure to suspected orconfirmed influenza, according to CDC guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6001a1.htm) (BII).HIV-infected children with confirmed influenza should be considered for prompt antiviral therapy, according to CDC guidelines(see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6001.pdf) (AII).Rating of Recommendations:A = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Among HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenQ-2individuals.13,14However, observations reported during the cART era suggest that better control of HIVinfection is associated with a milder course of influenza. In an outbreak of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infectionin Germany involving 15 HIV-infected schoolchildren receiving cART, the clinical course in HIV-infectedchildren was similar to that in HIV-uninfected children.15A case series of 13 HIV-infected children with 2009H1N1 in Barcelona also reported outcomes similar to those in HIV-uninfected groups.16In both reports, half ofthe children were aged <13 years, had CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3, and very low or undetectable HIV viralloads. Existing data suggest that HIV-infected children receiving cART who have natural influenza infectiondevelop influenza-specific antibody levels similar to those seen in HIV-uninfected children.15Largerobservational studies of HIV-infected children are needed to further substantiate these findings.Clinical ManifestationsSigns and symptoms related to influenza are similar between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children andinclude fever, cough, and rhinorrhea in the majority of patients.15-17Loss of appetite was more common inHIV-infected patients than in HIV-uninfected patients in one study.18In a prospective cohort study conductedin South Africa from 1997 to 1999, prior to cART availability, hospitalized HIV-infected children withlaboratory-confirmed influenza had more radiographic evidence of alveolar consolidation when comparedwith HIV-uninfected children. However, other types of bacterial complications did not vary by HIV status.Clinical outcomes including duration of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality were similar for both HIV-infected and -uninfected groups.18,19The differential diagnosis for pneumonia in an HIV-infected child duringthe influenza season includes primary influenza pneumonia or influenza complicated by secondary bacterialpneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, orHaemophilus influenzae, most commonly identified bacterial co-pathogens. Consideration also must begiven to other potential pathogens including Pneumocystis jirovecii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypicalmycobacteria, endemic mycoses, and other respiratory viruses, according to the child's level ofimmunosuppression, potential exposures, and local epidemiology. DiagnosisThe laboratory approach to diagnosis of influenza in HIV-infected and -uninfected children is identical. Thisincludes rapid influenza (RIDTs), immunofluorescence assays, reverse transcription-polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, and viral culture. RT-PCR and viral culture are considered the gold standardinfluenza tests. Viral culture results are not immediately available and culture is not as sensitive as RT-PCR.RIDTs offer point-of-care diagnosis, but sensitivity that is substantially lower than for viral culture or RT-PCRand false-positivity\u2014particularly when prevalence is low\u2014limit their reliability for patient management.20Regardless of the method of laboratory diagnosis, clinical diagnosis with laboratory confirmation of influenza isimportant, especially in hospitalized patients and outpatients at higher risk of influenza complications. Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureBasic personal hygiene, including hand hygiene and proper cough etiquette, are mainstays of influenzaprevention. Individuals should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth and avoid contact with sickindividuals. Hands should be washed often with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rub containing atleast 60% alcohol, if soap and water are unavailable. Proper hand washing technique involves wetting handswith clean running water, applying soap, and rubbing and scrubbing all hand surfaces and under thefingernails for at least 20 seconds. Hands should be dried with a clean towel or air dried. When usingalcohol-based hand rub, the hand rub should be applied to one hand, and the hands (including all handsurfaces and fingers) should be rubbed together until dry. Cough etiquette directs the individual to cough or sneeze into a tissue (preferred) or, when a tissue isunavailable, into the upper sleeve or elbow rather than into the hands. A soiled tissue should be disposed ofGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenQ-3in a waste basket. Other prevention methods include reducing crowding, maintaining a few feet of distancefrom others, avoiding shaking hands or hugging at gatherings, and avoiding gatherings altogether (seehttp://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits.htm, http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing, andhttp://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/faithbased/factsheet2.htm).Prolonged influenza viral shedding in a hospitalized immunocompromised patient has implications forpreventing spread of influenza in the health care setting. Strategies to prevent the spread of influenza inhealth care facilities include use of droplet precautions by health care workers according to HealthcareInfection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines (see http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac).21Preventing First Episode of DiseaseAnnual influenza vaccination is a cornerstone of influenza prevention, at the individual and communitylevel.22Past concerns about an increase in HIV viral load following influenza vaccination have not beensubstantiated, particularly in the presence of cART.11,23-27Currently in the United States, trivalent inactivatedinfluenza vaccine (TIV) is recommended for HIV-infected patients according to the CDC AdvisoryCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. Multiple studies examining the immuneresponse of HIV-infected children and adolescents on ART to TIV have shown immune responsescomparable to those seen in HIV-uninfected individuals when matched for age and gender.26,28ART to maintain adequate CD4 lymphocytes is the cornerstone of adequate immune responses tovaccine.29,30In a multivariate analysis of the immune response to TIV in HIV-infected children during the1994-1995 influenza season, a higher pre-immunization CD4:CD8 ratio was associated with a greaterantibody response.25Multiple studies have shown that HIV-infected individuals with depleted T lymphocyteshave a suboptimal immune response to vaccines.31-33A randomized controlled trial of the immune responseof HIV-infected children on cART to either TIV or live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) showedprotective antibody titers after both vaccines (96%-98% for influenza A; 81%-88% for influenza B), withlow baseline HIV viral loads correlating with improved antibody responses to both vaccines.34AlthoughLAIV is not licensed for use in HIV-infected children, many experts would consider using it on the basis ofdemonstrated safety and immunogenicity in HIV-infected children on cART without CD4-definedimmunosuppression.35Quadrivalent LAIV is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and isanticipated to be available in upcoming influenza seasons. ACIP recommends TIV over LAIV for HIV-infected children. Household contacts (aged 6 months and older) of HIV-infected children should receiveinfluenza vaccine annually as a means to help protect against influenza illness. Contraindications to use of inactivated influenza vaccine are the same for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfectedindividuals. A physician should be consulted before flu vaccine is administered to children who have a severeallergy to chicken eggs, have had a severe reaction to influenza vaccine in the past, are less than 6 months ofage (influenza vaccine is not approved for this age group), or who have a moderate-to-severe illness with afever (in which case the child should be vaccinated after recovery).Antiviral chemoprophylaxis according to current CDC guidelines36is recommended for unvaccinated HIV-infected children who are close contacts of a person suspected of having or confirmed to have influenza.Selection of an antiviral drug for chemoprophylaxis should be based on current ACIP and CDC influenzaantiviral recommendations and consider the antiviral susceptibility testing data for circulating influenza virusstrains that can be obtained from the CDC (see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weeklyorhttp://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html). Ideally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis should bestarted within 48 hours of exposure to a known influenza contact. Either oseltamivir or zanamivir, part of theantiviral class of medications called neuraminidase inhibitors, are approved and recommended forchemoprophylaxis against influenza A and B viruses. Oseltamivir prophylaxis is not FDA-approved forchildren aged <1 year, but the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC have issued recommendations forprophylaxis of children 3 months of age and older; zanamivir prophylaxis is not recommended for childrenaged <5 years (see Table). Although oseltamivir resistance has been documented previously amongGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenQ-4circulating seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus strains during the 2008-2009 influenza season, sinceSeptember 2009, most (99%) circulating influenza A and B viruses have been susceptible to oseltamivir.36Amantadine and rimantadine, adamantane derivatives, are approved but not currently recommended forchemoprophylaxis of influenza A viruses because of resistance of current influenza A (H3N2 and 2009H1N1) virus strains to adamantanes.36,37Amantadine (generic) and rimantadine (Flumadine\u00ae, generic) areapproved to prevent only influenza A virus infection in people aged > 1 year. Because chemoprophylaxisdoes not totally eliminate risk of influenza illness, children who develop fever and respiratory symptomsshould be evaluated by a health care provider.36Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisDuration of chemoprophylaxis is typically 10 days.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseTreatment of influenza in HIV-infected patients is recommended according to the ACIP and CDC guidelines. Therecommended duration of treatment is 5 days, but may need to be extended in severely ill hospitalized orimmunocompromised patients.38As with primary prophylaxis, selection of an antiviral drug for treatment shouldbe based on current ACIP and CDC influenza antiviral recommendations and consider the antiviral susceptibilitytesting data for circulating influenza virus strains that can be obtained from the CDC (seehttp://www.cdc.gov/flu/weeklyor http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html). Currentlyrecommended influenza antiviral medications oseltamivir (orallyadministered) and zanamivir (inhaled); both are effective for treatment against influenza A and B viruses.Oseltamivir is approved for treatment of influenza in children aged 2 weeks. Although oseltamivir resistancewas documented in circulating seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus strains during the 2008-2009 influenza season,since September 2009, most (99%) of circulating influenza A and B viruses have been susceptible tooseltamavir.36Zanamivir is approved for treatment of influenza in children aged 7 years (see Table). Alternativedosing of influenza-specific antiviral drugs and duration of therapy are under investigation. Amantadine andrimantadine, adamantane derivatives, are both effective treatments for influenza A viruses, but not influenza Bviruses. Of the adamantanes, amantadine (generic) is approved to treat only influenza A viruses in people aged >1year and rimantadine (Flumadine\u00ae; generic) is approved to treat only influenza A virus infections in people aged13 years. However, some pediatric influenza specialists may consider rimantadine appropriate for treatment ofchildren aged >1 year. Adamantanes are not currently recommended for treatment of influenza A because ofresistance of current influenza A (H3N2 and 2009 H1N1) strains.36,37A fundamental feature of influenza in the immunocompromised host is prolonged influenza viral sheddingfrom the respiratory tract, which may persist weeks to months in an individual with poorly controlled HIVinfection.39,40However, patients with well-controlled HIV on cART will have diminished influenza viralshedding, with further attenuation with antiviral treatment. During the influenza pandemic of 2009, 2009H1N1 viral RNA was detectable by RT-PCR for a median of 4 days (range 4-5) in 5 HIV-infected,oseltamivir-treated children, compared with a median of 8 days (range 8-13) in 10 HIV-infected, oseltamivir-untreated children.15Monitoring of Adverse Events including IRISClinicians should take into account patients' age, weight, renal function, history of seizures, level ofimmunosuppression, presence of other medical conditions, and potential drug interactions when consideringadministration of influenza antiviral medications.36Zanamivir:Because of cases of respiratory deterioration manifested as decreased forced expiratory volumeor bronchospasm in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, zanamivir is notrecommended for treatment of patients with underling pulmonary disease. In clinical treatment studiesGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenQ-5involving patients with uncomplicated influenza, common adverse events were similar in those treated withinhaled zanamivir and those treated with inhaled placebo.36,38Oseltamivir:For patients with creatinine clearance 10-30 mL/min, a reduction in chemoprophylaxis dosageto 75 mg every other day and in treatment dosage to 75 mg once daily is recommended. Pharmacokinetic(PK) data are limited for dosing recommendations for patients with severe renal insufficiency on dialysis. Instudies of adults and children, mild nausea and vomiting has been the most common side effect of treatmentwith oseltamivir;41,42however, that can be somewhat alleviated if the medication is taken with food.43Despiteearlier post-market reports of transient neuropsychiatric events manifested as self-injury or delirium inJapan,44more recently, oseltamivir has not been associated with increased risk of neuropsychiatric events.45The FDA recommends close monitoring for abnormal behavior in patients treated with oseltamivir.43TheFDA and CDC also recommend that clinicians and pharmacists pay careful attention to the possibility ofdosing errors in young children.46Amantadine:For patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, the following dosage frequency reductionsare recommended: 30 to 50 mL/min - once daily; 15 to 29 mL/min - once every 48 hours; <15 mL/min -once weekly. These patients should be observed carefully for adverse reactions that would necessitate afurther decrease in dose.36,47Because an increased incidence of seizures has been noted in patients with ahistory of seizure disorders exposed to amantadine, such patients should be observed for increased seizureactivity when given the drug.36,48Rimantadine:For patients with creatinine clearance <10 mL/min, a reduction of dosage to 100 mg/day isrecommended. Patients with any degree of renal insufficiency, including older individuals, should becarefully observed for adverse reactions necessitating a further decrease in dose. Also, in patients with severehepatic dysfunction, a reduction in dosage to 100 mg/day is recommended.36,49Seizure or seizure-likeactivity was seen in patients taking rimantadine who had a history of seizure disorders and were not takinganticonvulsants.50Patients aged 18 years with suspected influenza should not be given aspirin or aspirin-containing productssuch as bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) because of the risk of Reye syndrome. In such cases, it isrecommended that fever be treated with other antipyretics such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.51Drug Interactions:Clinical data are limited with respect to drug interactions between zanamivir oroseltamivir and antiretroviral drugs, and no clinical trials to date have evaluated the safety or efficacy ofusing combinations of different classes of influenza antiviral drugs.36However, information derived frompharmacology and PK studies of oseltamivir suggests that clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely,and zanamivir is not a substrate nor does it affect cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes; no clinicallysignificant drug interactions are predicted based on in vitrostudies. Managing Treatment FailureClinicians developing management plans in response to treatment failure or severe illness associated withinfluenza viral infections can consider changes in dosing or route of administration, increasing duration oftherapy, or tailoring therapy based on viral resistance. Patients who are severely ill and hospitalized or whoare immunosuppressed may require longer treatment.38In treating severely ill patients with avian influenza A(H5N1), doubling of the dose of oseltamivir (e.g., 150 mg twice daily in adults) was well tolerated in onecase report52and may be more effective.53For oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus infection, treatment undercompassionate use and Emergency Act Authorization using nebulized54and intravenous (IV) zanamivir andIV peramivir have been described. Although the Emergency Act Authorization for use of these drugs throughthese routes of administration has expired, clinical trials of IV zanamivir, peramivir, and oseltamivir areunder way through the National Institutes of Health. Clinicians interested in learning more about these trialsof IV antiviral products should go to the http://www.clinicaltrials.govwebsite. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenQ-6Zanamivir:IV zanamivir has occasionally been used as therapy for patients with proven resistance becauseof the H275Y mutation in neuraminidase. The H275Y mutation is associated with no change in susceptibilityto zanamivir, but high-level neuraminidase zanamivir was previously used to treat cases of oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 infection, although it is not approved for this use. In one case report, an 18-month-oldchild with relapsed hematologic malignancy was admitted for a stem cell transplant and was started onoseltamivir early in the hospital course after developing cough and fever and being diagnosed with influenzaA virus infection. After the child was diagnosed with 2009 H1N1 virus and experienced clinicaldeterioration, IV zanamivir was administered on a compassionate use basis (GlaxoSmithKline), 320 mg (20mg/kg per dose) every 12 hours. Sequence analysis of the neuraminidase gene from virus detected inendotracheal aspirates demonstrated absence of H275Y mutation on day 2, but presence of the mutationbeginning on day 13. Although this patient died on hospital day 57, administration of IV zanamivir wasassociated with a logarithmic drop in 2009 H1N1 viral RNA levels.56In another case report, a 10-year-oldgirl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and PCR-documented 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infectionfailed oseltamivir therapy and had progressive respiratory clinical deterioration leading to intubation. TheH275Y neuraminidase mutation was detected and the patient was changed to IV zanamivir for 15 days (600mg every 12 hours) under an emergency investigational new drug application. Treatment with IV zanamivirwas associated with a substantial decrease in influenza A viral loads to undetectable levels by PCR testingand the patient was weaned off the ventilator approximately 3 weeks after zanamivir initiation. The patienttolerated zanamivir well with no adverse effects.57Peramivir:Both adults and children with severe, progressively worsening 2009 H1N1 influenza viralpneumonia and respiratory failure experienced recovery associated with administration of IV peramivir, aninvestigational neuraminidase inhibitor, despite most having received oseltamivir therapy. Administration ofthe drug was made possible through the Emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) regulations. FromApril through October 2009, in 20 adults and 11 children aged <18 years who received oseltamivir for amedian of 10 days (range 1-14 days), the 14-, 28-, and 56-day survival rates were 76.7%, 66.7%, and 59.0%,respectively. The adult dosage was 600 mg IV once daily with adjustments for renal impairment, and thepediatric dose ranged from 6 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, not to exceed 600 mg IV per day. Seventeen of 31 patientscontinued oseltamivir administration after initiating peramivir. Survival was associated with earlieradministration of peramivir, on hospital days 2 to 8, compared with hospital days 10 to 16 in those who died.Delay in administration of the drug was mainly secondary to a delay in requesting the drug afterhospitalization. The investigational drug was generally well tolerated with no reports of associated seriousadverse events. Peramivir has been approved in Japan and South Korea and is undergoing U.S. Phase IIItrials in hospitalized patients with influenza.58It is important to reiterate that for patients with the H275Ymutation, peramivir is not recommended because of associated intermediate-level resistance.

Key to Acronyms:CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; FDA = Food and Drug AdministrationGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenR-1Isosporiasis (Cystoisosporiasis) (Last updated 2013) EpidemiologyIsospora belli(Cystoisospora belli)is an parasite in the phylum Apicomplexa. It was firstlinked with human disease in 1915 and is believed to infect only humans.1Isosporiasis, also known ascystoisosporiasis, occurs worldwide but is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions; it has beenreported as an etiologic agent of traveler's diarrhea.2-4Prior to the availability of combination antiretroviraltherapy (cART), the prevalence of isosporiasis among adults with AIDS was reported to be 15% in Haiti but<0.2% in the United States.1,5Infected individuals pass non-infective, unsporulated (immature) oocysts in their stools. The oocysts mustsporulate (mature) outside the host, in favorable environmental conditions, to become infective.1,4Therefore,direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely. Infection results from ingestion of sporulated oocysts, suchas in contaminated food or water. In the proximal small intestine, the ingested oocysts release sporozoitesthat invade the intestinal epithelial cells. They then enter an asexual reproduction stage that infectsneighboring epithelial cells. Sexual gametocytes are also produced; their fertilization results in unsporulatedoocysts, which are shed in stool.1,6Clinical ManifestationsOn the basis of limited data, the incubation period averages approximately 1 week but may range fromseveral days to 2 or more weeks; symptom onset may be acute or insidious.1,2,4,5The most common symptomis watery (non-bloody) diarrhea, which can be profuse and result in dehydration, weight loss, andmalabsorption. Affected people also can have crampy abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, vomiting,anorexia, and low-grade immunocompetent hosts typically have self-limited chronic, debilitatingdiarrhea common in untreated HIV-infected patients.Panel's RecommendationsAntiretroviral treatment of HIV-infected children to reverse or prevent severe immunodeficiency may reduce the incidence orprevent recurrence of isosporiasis (CIII).Careful hand washing and thorough washing of fruits and vegetables are recommended to prevent exposure (AIII).Travelers to endemic areas should avoid untreated water for drinking, brushing teeth, and in ice, as well as unpeeled fruits andvegetables, all of which can be contaminated (BIII).Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for treatment of isosporiasis in HIV-infected children (AI*).In those with severe immunosuppression, treatment should be followed by secondary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX until severeimmunosuppression resolves (AII*).As with all causes of diarrhea, supportive care, including replenishment of fluids and electrolytes, is essential (AIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenR-2DiagnosisIsosporiasis is diagnosed by identifying I. bellioocysts in stool (or duodenal aspirates using the Entero-Test)or developmental stages of the parasite in biopsy specimens (such as of the small intestine). The oocysts arerelatively large (23-33 \u00b5m long by 10-19 \u00b5m wide) but may be difficult to find. Oocysts may be shed in lownumbers even by individuals who have severe diarrhea, which underscores the utility of repeated stoolexaminations, using methods that concentrate and highlight the parasite. Although staining is frequentlyvariable, the organism can be identified with use of a modified acid-fast stain, staining bright red on a greenbackground.5,6The organism also autofluoresces when viewed by ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy.1Blunting and clubbing of villi and hypertrophied crypts can be seen on small bowel biopsy. There also maybe an increase in lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in the lamina propria.6Serologic tests fordiagnosing I. belliinfection are not available. Peripheral eosinophilia occurs in up to half of patients.Polymerase chain reaction is a promising diagnostic tool but is not yet commercially available.9Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureCareful hand washing and thorough washing of fruits and vegetables are recommended (AIII). As always,travelers to endemic areas should avoid untreated water for drinking, brushing teeth, and in ice, as well asunpeeled fruits and vegetables (BIII).Preventing DiseaseThere are no U.S. recommendations for primary prophylaxis of isosporiasis. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, 160 mg and 800 mg, respectively) was effective in preventing isosporiasis inadults with World Health Organization stage 2 or 3 HIV infection in Cote d'Ivoire.10In addition, in anobservational study, the incidence of isosporiasis decreased after widespread availability of cART, exceptamong persons with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/\u00b5L.11Although there have been no studies in children, therelationship between severe immunosuppression and disease in adults suggests that initiation of cART inHIV-infected children before development of severe immunodeficiency may reduce the incidence or preventrecurrence of isosporiasis (CIII).Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseTMP-SMX is the recommended treatment for isosporiasis. Three randomized trials performed in HIV-infectedadults in Haiti not receiving antiretroviral therapy have demonstrated the effectiveness of variousregimens.5,12,13In the first study, TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg, respectively) was administered 4 times dailyfor 10 days and then twice daily for 3 weeks. Improvement in diarrheal symptoms occurred within a few days,but 7 of 15 patients (47%) had recurrent symptoms within a mean of 8 +/- 5.8 weeks following completion oftherapy.5In the second study, TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg, respectively) was administered 4 times dailyfor 10 days; subjects were then randomized to 1 of 3 secondary prophylaxis arms. At the completion of theinitial 10 days of TMP-SMX, all 32 participants had resolution of diarrhea and abdominal pain as well as stoolsamples that tested negative for I. belli.12In the third study, subjects were randomized to receive either TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg, respectively) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily for 7 days. TMP-SMXtreatment resulted in cessation of diarrhea in all 10 patients and negative results on stool examination at day 7in 9 of the 10, while ciprofloxacin resulted in resolution of diarrhea in 10 of 12 patients and 9 of 12 withnegative stool examinations.13On the basis of these studies in adults, the recommended treatment for HIV-infected children is TMP-SMX, 5 mg/kg per dose of the trimethoprim component, given twice daily, for 10days (AI*). If symptoms worsen or persist, the TMP-SMX dose may be increased to 5 mg/kg/dose of thetrimethoprim component, 3 to 4 times daily, for 10 days or the duration of treatment lengthened (up to 3-4Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenR-3weeks) (CIII).5,14Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be for patients with potential ordocumented malabsorption. Daily pyrimethamine (50-75 mg in adults), with folinic acid (10-25 mg/day) to prevent myelosuppression,may be an effective therapy and is typically the alternative for patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMX(BIII).15Other agents to consider in a TMP-SMX-intolerant patient include ciprofloxacin (CI*)ornitazoxanide (CIII). Based on the study previously cited,13ciprofloxacin is less effective than TMP-SMX,and nitazoxanide has only been studied in small numbers of HIV-uninfected children and adults.16Asreviewed above, the relationship between the use of cART and recovery from isosporiasis remains unknown.However, because the incidence of isosporiasis has been reported to be higher in those with more severeimmune suppression, it seems reasonable to initiate cART in children with isosporiasis not already receivingcART to prevent recurrence (CIII).As with all causes of diarrhea, supportive care, including replenishment of fluids and electrolytes, is essential(AIII).Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has not been reported in association with treatment ofisosporiasis. In general, recommended treatment regimens are well tolerated.Managing Treatment FailureReports of treatment failure are relatively uncommon. Mixed data regarding treatment outcomes areavailable for albendazole,17-19doxycycline,20roxithromycin,21and spiramycin.22Preventing RecurrenceFollowing treatment of an acute episode, secondary prophylaxis should be continued in those with severeimmunosuppression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] immunologic category 3) for anindefinite period until sustained immunologic recovery is observed (AII*). Pape et al., randomized HIV-infected adults completing therapy for acute infection to one of three regimens: TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800mg, respectively) three times per week, sulfadoxine (500 mg) plus pyrimethamine (25 mg) once weekly, orplacebo.12The two active treatment arms were equally effective in preventing relapse. However, thecombination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is not recommended in the United States because ofincreased risk of severe cutaneous reactions. In another study, adult patients with a clinical responsefollowing treatment of acute infection with TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin received secondary prophylaxis for10 weeks with the same agent as treatment, but at reduced doses: TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg,respectively) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) three times per week. The two agents were equally effective inpreventing recurrence during the monitoring period.13Based on these findings in adults, acceptable regimensin HIV-infected children include TMP-SMX, 2.5 mg/kg body weight twice daily of the trimethoprimcomponent, administered 3 days per week. The 3 days per week can be three consecutive days or analternating-day schedule (e.g., Monday-Wednesday-Friday) (AII*). Patients intolerant of as secondary prophylaxis15(BIIII). Ciprofloxacin timesweekly can be considered as a second-line alternative (CI*).22Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisThere are no data to provide guidance regarding the duration of secondary prophylaxis. All patients shouldbe monitored for recurrence (BIII)and those with severe immunosuppression may require secondaryprophylaxis indefinitely (CIII). Secondary prophylaxis can probably be discontinued in patients whodemonstrate sustained recovery from severe immunosuppression. In adults, a CD4 count >200 cells/\u00b5L for atleast 6 months is recommended to discontinue secondary prophylaxis. In children, a reasonable time todiscontinue secondary prophylaxis would be after sustained improvement in CD4 count or CD4 percentagefrom CDC immunologic category 3 to 1 or 2.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenR-4References1.Lindsay DS, Dubey Clin Microbiol Rev.

Worldwide, malaria is a leading killer of children andpregnant women. In the United States, most malaria cases occur in patients who have returned from travelsto areas of endemic malaria transmission. Rarely, cases occur as a result of exposure to infected bloodproducts, local mosquito-borne transmission (i.e., autochthonous transmission), or mother-to-childtransmission (MTCT) (congenital malaria). Prompt recognition and treatment are essential, and failure to actquickly and appropriately can have grave consequences. Panel's RecommendationsFamilies traveling to malaria-endemic countries should receive pre-travel counseling, on insecticide-treatedbed nets, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, and for antimalarial prophylaxis (AIII).Treatment of malaria is based on disease severity, patient age, parasite species, pregnancy status, and local resistance patternswhere the malaria infection was acquired (AI).The choice of malaria therapy is not affected by HIV status but can be modified based on potential interactions betweenantiretroviral and antimalarial drugs (AIII). Quinidine is not recommended for patients who are taking ritonavir (AIII)(ritonavirmay be replaced if quinidine is needed for severe malaria) and should be administered with caution with atazanavir, darunavirand fosamprenavir (AIII).The treatment childrenaged 8 years), or clindamycin. Mefloquine is considered an alternative regimen (AIII).Chloroquine should not be used to treat malaria infections acquired in areas with chloroquine resistance (AIII).Treatment of uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant malaria may include atovaquone-proguanil, quinine sulfate plus eitherdoxycycline or tetracycline (specifically in children aged 8 years) or clindamycin or artemether-lumefantrine (AIII).Treat for presumptive chloroquine-resistant P. f a l c i p a r u mmalaria in symptomatic patients who have traveled to a region withchloroquine-resistant P. f a l c i p a r u mand for whom reliable identification of the malaria species is not possible or who are severelyill (AIII).After initial treatment for Plasmodium vivaxand Plasmodium ovale(same as for uncomplicated P. f a l c i p a r u m), primaquine isrecommended for treatment of the dormant liver stage (hypnozoites) (AIII). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency must be excluded before use of primaquine because of risk of severe hemolyticanemia (AIII)Treatment of severe malaria includes both IV quinidine gluconate plus either doxycycline ORclindamycin ORtetracycline.Alternatives include artesunate IV (under Investigational New Drug protocol: Contact the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention Malaria Hotline at (770) 488-7788) followed by = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenS-2In 2009, 1484 cases of malaria were reported in the United States, of which 4 were fatal.1In the majority ofcases in which species were identified, Plasmodiumfalciparumwas the pathogen involved; however, in 38%of cases, the species was either not reported or unidentified. Lack of adherence to prophylaxis is the keyidentified risk factor for acquisition of malaria in those for whom data are available. High-Risk Groups United States-born children visiting family in malaria-endemic regions are at highest risk of malaria infection.Children of foreign citizenship, children of unknown resident status, and adopted children who come fromcountries of endemic malaria transmission are also at high risk. Education regarding the misconception thatprior exposure to malaria confers protection against re-infection is important; families should be prepared (withmalaria chemoprophylaxis) and educated with travel advice (e.g., such as recommending use of insecticide-treated nets and insect repellants) before returning to endemic areas (AII). Although some parents may assumethat their children are protected from disease because of their ethnic background (from high malaria endemiccountries),2,3,4the converse is true, with patients in this group at high risk because of factors such as visitingprivate residences, sleeping in homes that lack screens or air conditioning, and having longer visits, all ofwhich contribute to a higher risk of contracting malaria (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/vfr.html). Adultsliving in the United States but born in malaria-endemic areas often believe they are not susceptible to malariabecause of naturally acquired immunity. Such acquired immunity develops after age 5 years in people whoreside in areas of stable malaria transmission, but it is partial (providing relative protection against disease, notinfection), wanes quickly once people are no longer living in malaria-endemic areas, and may not be present inHIV-infected populations with advanced immunodeficiency. Therefore, both adults and children living in theUnited States who were born in malaria-endemic areas should be prescribed the same prophylaxis as any otherpatients traveling to malaria-endemic areas. Prevention RecommendationsRecommendations for preventing exposure and for primary chemoprophylaxis are identical for HIV-infectedand HIV-uninfected individuals (see http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/index.html). All travelers tomalaria-endemic regions should pre-travel counseling on appropriate chemoprophylaxis andavoidance of mosquitos (AII).4,5Families should be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of malaria andthe need for early medical intervention if these signs and symptoms are present. An early appropriate medicalevaluation should be completed on all patients returning from a malaria-endemic area who have unexplainedfever or other signs or symptoms of malaria. Preventing Exposure All travelers should use personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites when traveling to malaria-endemic areas (AII),6including sleeping under an insecticide-treated bed net and wearing clothingimpregnated with permethrin (effective for weeks and through several washings, but not dry cleaning).Discussions regarding the routine use of bed nets should be individualized as per specific sleepingarrangements (air-conditioned hotel vs. open windows). Long-acting N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET)mosquito repellents are safe, practical, and effective, and the duration of protection increases with increasingDEET concentrations, plateauing between 30% and 50%. DEET should be applied (by patients or theircaregivers when appropriate) to skin, but not to wounds, cuts, irritated areas, the mouth, or hands of youngchildren (AIII). Additional information about other recommended mosquito repellants can be found athttp://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm. Depending on the level of risk, it may be appropriate to recommend to travelers no specific interventions,mosquito-avoidance measures only, or mosquito-avoidance measures plus chemoprophylaxis (Centers forDisease Control and Prevention [CDC] Yellow book; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/malaria.htm). Pregnant women should discuss travel to endemic areaswith a travel medicine expert. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenS-3Primary Chemoprophylaxis Primary chemoprophylaxis should be prescribed to all individuals traveling to malaria-endemic areas,regardless of ethnicity or prior exposure to or illness with malaria. Antimalarial medications may needspecial preparation, and some are not easily delivered to children. Therefore, families planning to travel tomalaria-endemic areas are advised to visit a travel medicine specialist with training and experience inpediatrics at least 2 weeks before departure (AII). If that is not possible, families can still see a travelmedicine specialist up to the day of departure, because some antimalarial prophylaxis regimens can still beprescribed and effectively used even at that late date.For patients traveling to areas with chloroquine-sensitive malaria, chloroquine phosphate (5 mg/kg bodyweight base, up to 300-mg base) given once weekly is acceptable. Other acceptable choices includeprimaquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine. For travelers to areas with mainlyPlasmodiumvivax, primaquine is a very good option. Travellers who will be given primaquine should haveglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing before this medication is started. Travelers to areas withchloroquine-resistant malaria should take atovaquone/proguanil daily (dosed on a sliding scale by weightbands), or daily doxycycline (2.2 mg/kg body weight for children aged 8 years) or weekly mefloquine,dosed based on weight. Medications for prophylaxis should be started before leaving and continued afterreturning from travel, as per their specific schedule. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is not asurrogate for antimalarial prophylaxis, effective prophylaxis for malaria (AIII).Although TMP-SMX prophylaxis appears to reduce episodes of clinical malaria to varying degrees, with thealready almost universal resistance to sulfadoxine pyrimethamine, it is extremely unlikely that TMP-SMXwould be useful alone as primary prophylaxis.7Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisTravel-related chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine, mefloquine, or doxycycline usually should be continuedfor 4 weeks after departure from a malaria-endemic area because these drugs are not effective againstmalarial parasites developing in the liver and kill the parasite only once it has emerged to infect the red bloodcells. Atovaquone-proguanil and primaquine may be discontinued 1 week after departure from malaria-endemic areas. Clinical and Laboratory ManifestationsHIV increases the frequency and severity of clinical malaria episodes in more severely immunosuppressedadults, pregnant women, and older children, possibly reflecting HIV-mediated interference with acquisitionof malaria immunity, but not related to failure of initial antimalarial therapy.7,8In young children, there is noclear evidence that HIV infection is associated with more severe malaria disease, although one case-controlstudy in Uganda found an association between HIV infection and cerebral malaria in children.9In a case series of returning travelers, symptoms most commonly reported include fever (100%), headache(100%), weakness also have pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, orjaundice. Altered consciousness or seizures may indicate progression to severe malaria. Splenic rupture canbe a rare presentation of malaria, requiring urgent medical and surgical management. Rash,lymphadenopathy, and signs of pulmonary consolidation are not characteristic of malaria. Laboratory valuesmay include anemia; high, normal, or low neutrophil counts; normal or low platelets; low sodium (usuallybecause of inappropriate and malaria may present before severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) is documented. Although fever is often the most common clinical presentation of malaria in people coming from areas ofendemic malaria transmission, it is not uniformly present in children. Non-specific clinical findings oftenpredominate in children and clinical diagnosis in them can be difficult. Malaria fever patterns in children alsoGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenS-4often do not follow the classically described tertian or patterns described in adults.13,14Children moreoften present with hepatomegaly, jaundice, or splenomegaly than do adults. They are also more likely to havefever >40\u00b0C and may present with febrile convulsions. Laboratory findings may include low serum glucose(seen with falciparum malaria), whereas serum glucose measurements in adults may be normal. Childrenwho have severe malaria also may have concomitant bacteremia/sepsis.2,11,12In returning travelers, whenchildren are diagnosed with malaria, their siblings might present with malaria at the same time.2Splenomegaly, fever, and thrombocytopenia are highly specific for malaria in immigrant children and needappropriate evaluation.13,15Congenital malaria is rare but should be considered in febrile neonates whosemothers migrated from areas where malaria is endemic; however, empiric therapy should not be administeredwithout a confirmed diagnosis.13HIV/malaria coinfection during pregnancy has been shown to haveadditional detrimental effects on maternal and infant survival and to confer increased risk of MTCT of bothHIV and malaria.16DiagnosisFor early and prompt recognition of malaria, physicians must obtain a complete travel history from every febrilepatient and maintain a high index of suspicion for malaria in travelers returning from areas of endemic malaria,remembering that signs and symptoms also can vary depending on chemoprophylaxis and prior partial treatmentfor malaria (see Table 7 from17for list of resources or http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list.htm).Children who have recently migrated from regions where malaria is endemic should be evaluated for malarialinfection upon arrival and/or if they become ill after arriving in the United States. A Giemsa-stained thick bloodsmear is the most sensitive smear technique for detecting infection, whereas a thin blood smear is used fordetermination of parasite species and burden (for an example of malaria parasites on smear, please visithttp://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Image_Library.htm). Smear accuracy depends upon proper preparationand interpretation of thick and thin smears by experienced laboratory personnel.17Because symptoms candevelop before parasitemia is detectable in a non-immune person, the initial blood-smear examination may bemisleadingly negative. Blood smears should be obtained every 12 to 24 hours for a total of 3 sets to fullyevaluate for malaria; if all 3 sets are negative, the probability of malaria is extremely low. In all patients inwhom malaria is suspected, smears should be read immediately. A qualified person who can perform and readsmears should always be available, even at off-hours. Every effort should be made to establish a diagnosisbefore therapy is initiated. However, if severe malaria is strongly suspected and diagnostic interpretation is notreadily available, empiric intravenous therapy for presumed P . falciparuminfection should be initiated, with ablood smear preserved for reading as soon as possible. Consultation and aid in the initial diagnosis, speciation,and treatment plan is available via the CDC Malaria Hotline at (770) 488-7788 (Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.,eastern time. For emergency consultation after hours, call (770) 488-7100, and ask to speak with a CDC MalariaBranch clinician). Performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) varies greatly, and only one test (Binax) currently is Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved. Such tests may have limited usefulness early in infection because theirsensitivity is decreased with lower parasite density (see http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/rdt/who_rdt_evaluation/).However, if microscopy is not immediately available, these tests can be used to aid in establishing a diagnosis ofmalaria. Microscopy must still be performed on all suspected cases of malaria, despite positive and negativeRDTs, for confirmation.Malaria in the United States is a reportable disease. Directions on case definitions and reporting can be foundat http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/report.html.Treating DiseaseChemoprophylaxis is not completely effective, and malaria should be included in the differential diagnosis offever or other signs or symptoms consistent with malaria in anyone who traveled to malaria-endemic areasGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenS-5during the previous 12 months (see http://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/overseas/malaria-guidelines-overseas.html#sect2). Malaria medications purchased in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asiamay be counterfeit; therefore, the index of suspicion must remain high when evaluating children with fevercoming from endemic areas, regardless of prior history of antimalarial therapy.CDC recommends presumptive treatment for malaria for all refugees and adoptees resettling to the United Statesfrom sub-Saharan Africa, including those who were treated for malaria before departing from Africa but who didnot receive primaquine for treatment of dormant liver stage forms (hypnozoites) of Plasmodiumovaleand P. v i v a xinfection. These patients remain at risk of developing malaria after arrival in the United States and shouldbe evaluated with a high index of suspicion for malaria. Children with past or current P. v i v a xor P. o v a l einfectionshould receive treatment with primaquine to eradicate the dormant liver stage, if the drug was not previouslyadministered (see CDC Guidance located at http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/treatmenttable.pdf). Treatment of malaria is based on the disease severity, patient age at onset, parasite species, pregnancy status,and known resistance patterns in the area where the malaria infection was acquired (AI). Drug dosing forpediatric patients must be adjusted for weight, and dosing should never exceed the recommended adult dose.Recommendations for treatment\u2014including drug dosing in HIV-infected children and adolescents withmalaria\u2014by species are described below and summarized in Table 1, and can also be found athttp://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/treatment.html. Additional information can be found athttp://www.malaria.org/ABOUT%20MALARIA/Treatment%20of%20Malaria-Guidelines%20for%20clinicians%20WHO.pdffor further clinical guidance. HIV infection status does not affect choice or dosing of antimalarial therapy. However, choice of antimalarialtherapy may be affected by interactions between antiretroviral (ARV) and antimalarial drugs; clinicians areurged to evaluate for drug interactions before initiating antimalarial therapy (please see Drug Interactionssection below). Unknown SpeciesClinicians should always treat patients who traveled to a region in which chloroquine-resistant P . falciparummalaria is present for chloroquine-resistant P . falciparummalaria if reliable identification of the malariaspecies is not possible or the patient is severely ill (AIII).Uncomplicated Malaria Uncomplicated malaria is defined by the World Health Organization as \"symptomatic infection with malariaparasitemia without signs of severity and/or evidence of vital organ dysfunction.\"18The preferred treatmentoptions for uncomplicated malaria include chloroquine phosphate (if chloroquine-susceptible), atovaquone-proguanil, artemether-lumefantrine, or quinine sulfate plus a second medicine (either tetracycline,doxycycline [in children aged 8 years] or clindamycin) (see Dosing Table for details) (AI). Mefloquine alsocan be used for treatment, but has a higher rate of side effects (AIII). Primaquine also must be administeredfor radical cure vivaxand P . ovaleinfection. G6PD deficiency mustbe excluded before first use ofprimaquine because of the risk of severe hemolytic anemia. Primaquine should not be used in pregnantwomen because the presence of G6PD deficiency cannot be determined in the unborn child (AIII). Severe Malaria Severe malaria is defined as acute malaria \"with signs of severity and/or evidence of vital organdysfunction\"18and is most often caused by P . falciparum, but can also be caused by P . vivax. Mixedinfections can also occur. These signs, symptoms, and laboratory parameters include diminishedconsciousness or seizures, respiratory distress (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], Kussmaul'srespiration), prostration, hyperparasitemia insufficiency, shock, cessation of eating and drinking, repetitivevomiting, or hyperpyrexia. Cerebral malaria is usually defined by presence of coma (Glasgow coma scaleGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenS-6<11, Blantyre coma scale <3). Severe malaria can present long before hemoglobin goes below the 7 mg/dLthreshold because of the hemo-concentrating effects of dehydration.Patients diagnosed with severe malaria should be treated aggressively with intravenous (IV) antimalarialtherapy. The only FDA-approved regimen includes quinidine gluconate the following:doxycycline, or clindamycin. A promising19alternative parenteral therapy is IV artesunate(available under Investigational New Drug protocol from CDC for certain patients meeting criteria).Additional alternative therapies include atovaquone-proguanil, clindamycin, mefloquine, or (for childrenaged 8 years) doxycycline. Treatment with IV quinidine or artesunate should be initiated as soon as possibleafter the diagnosis has been made. Patients with severe malaria treated with quinidine should be given an IVloading dose unless they have received more than 40 mg/kg body weight of quinine in the preceding 48hours or if they have received mefloquine within the preceding 12 hours. Consultation with a cardiologistand a physician with experience treating malaria is advised when treating malaria patients with quinidinebecause of the known complications of quinidine, including widening of the QRS complex and/orlengthening of the QTc interval. Cardiac complications, if severe, may warrant temporary discontinuation ofthe drug or slowing of the IV infusion. IV quinidine administration should not be delayed for an exchangetransfusion and can be given concurrently throughout it.Exchange transfusion should be considered (BII)only for treatment of very severe malaria when childrenhave a parasite density of more than 10% and if complications such as cerebral malaria, ARDS or renalcomplications exist. The risks of exchange transfusion include fluid overload, febrile and allergic reactions,metabolic disturbances (e.g., hypocalcaemia), red blood cell alloantibody sensitization, blood-bornetransmissible infection, and line sepsis.20-22The parasite density should be monitored every 12 hours until itfalls below 1%, which usually requires the exchange of 8 to 10 units of blood in adults. Malaria Despite Chemoprophylaxis Medication used for chemoprophylaxis should not be used as a part of a new treatment regimen inindividuals who develop malaria despite taking chemoprophylaxis; rather, treatment with one of the otheroptions is recommended. Drug Interactions There are multiple potential interactions between ARV and antimalarial drugs, but data from HIV-infectedchildren and adults remain limited.7,23-25Many antimalarials are metabolized eitherinhibit induce cytochrome p450 enzymes.26-28Tetracyclines have no clinically significant interactionsexpected with PIs or NNRTIs. Atovaquone is not expected to have any significant interaction with commonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, although no data are available for proguanil. Ritonavir inhibitsquinidine metabolism; therefore, concomitant lopinavir/ritonavir that contain ritonavir) and quinidine is not recommended. Replacement of ritonavir inritonavir-containing cART should be considered. The inhibitory action of ritonavir will still be present forseveral days after dosing is interrupted; thus, in patients with severe malaria already on ritonavir, artesunateshould be considered. Caution is also advised before co-administering quinidine with other PIs (includingatazanavir, darunavir, and fosamprenavir). Other drug-drug interactions exist but have not been studied. The CDC Malaria Hotline is an excellent resourcefor additional assistance with drug-drug interactions, as are the World Health Organization's Guidelines for theTreatment of Malaria (http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241547925_eng.pdf). An interactiveweb-based resource for checking on drug interactions involving ARV drugs is found at the University ofLiverpool website http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org.

Le Loup, et al. Consequences of HIV infection on malaria and therapeutic implications: a systematicreview. Lancet Infect Dis. 2011. 11(7);541-556.Special Populations Because primaquine is not routinely prescribed for immigrants as part of a post-treatment/pre-departureregimen, patients who may have had P . vivaxor P . ovaleinfection in the past would be at continued risk ofdeveloping malaria months to years after arrival in the United States. Presumptive treatment on arrival(preferable) or laboratory screening to detect Plasmodiuminfection is recommended for refugees originatingin sub-Saharan Africa who have not received pre-departure therapy with a recommended regimen (seehttp://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/malaria-guidelines-domestic.html).Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Severe malaria commonly induces hypoglycemia in children, especially when treated with IVquinine/quinidine because of inhibition of gluconeogenesis and induction of endogenous insulin production.Therefore, monitoring glucose levels and use of a glucose-containing crystalloid solution for fluid maintenanceis prudent until IV quinine/quinidine therapy has been completed. Monitoring glucose is especially importantfor children with altered mental status. Cardiac and intensive-care monitoring is also recommended because IVquinine/quinidine can cause hypotension and widening of the QRS interval. Quinine toxicity, a cluster ofsymptoms that includes tinnitus, dizziness, disorientation, nausea, visual changes, and auditory deficits, canGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenS-8occur. Many of the adverse events associated with quinine are dose-related, and because of age-relateddifferences in the rate at which quinine is eliminated from the body, the frequency and severity of adverseeffects associated with quinine drug products may be lower in children. Tinnitus alone, a common (50%-75%)adverse reaction to both oral and IV quinine, usually resolves after treatment. Use of mefloquine at treatmentdoses may be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Following antimalarial therapy, HIV-infectedchildren should be monitored closely for hematologic complications (especially anemia and neutropenia),which are more frequent because of both the direct hematologic effects of HIV infection and of HIV treatmentwith other bone-marrow-suppressive drugs such as TMP-SMX and zidovudine. Immune reconstitutioninflammatory syndrome caused by malaria has not been reported.Managing Treatment FailureFailure of treatment for P . falciparumis uncommon in children who receive a full course of appropriateantimalarial therapy. Patients should be monitored for clinical and laboratory response (thick and thin smear)and for signs of recrudescence after therapy completion. Relapse of . vivaxand P . ovalecan occur from thedormant (hypnozoite) liver form but is less common following primaquine treatment. When treatment failureoccurs, malaria speciation should be confirmed, as should the geography of where the malaria was acquired.Retreatment with an appropriate first-line regimen (but not the same regimen as initially used) should begiven. Discussion with a Pediatric Infectious Disease specialist or consultation through the CDC malariahotline is appropriate when complex situations arise.Preventing RecurrenceExcept for re-activation of P . vivaxand P once successfully treated does notrecur, unless re-exposure and re-infection occur. One or even several episodes of malaria infection does notimply protective immunity, and continued exposure to malaria parasites can result in repeated infection,which should be treated as aggressively as the initial event.References1.Mali S, Tan KR, Arguin PM, et al.

They are ubiquitous and infect most animal species. They are classified as fungi and defined by their unique single polar tube that coils around the interior of the spore. 1 Many microsporidia have been reported as pathogens in humans, but Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis are the most common microsporidia that cause infection in HIV-infected patients. also have been implicated in human infections. The organisms develop in enterocytes and are excreted in feces. They are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, including through ingestion of contaminated food or water, and, possibly, through contact with infected animals. 2,3 Vertical transmission from an infected mother to her child has not been demonstrated in humans but it does occur in animals.3 Prior to the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevalence rates for microsporidiosis were reported to be as high as 70% in HIV-infected adults with diarrhea. 1,4-6 The role of microsporidiosis in chronic diarrhea was questioned early in the HIV epidemic but is now believed to be causal.7,8 The incidence of microsporidiosis has declined with the widespread use of effective ART, but it is still observed in HIV-infected individuals who are not receiving effective ART. 9 Among HIV-uninfected individuals, microsporidiosis is increasingly recognized in children, travelers, organ transplant recipients, contact lens wearers, and the elderly.10 Panel's Recommendations I. In children with HIV infection, what are the best interventions (compared with no intervention) to treat microsporidiosis? Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the primary initial treatment for microsporidiosis in HIV-infected children (strong, very low). Supportive care with hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional supplementation should be provided (expert opinion). Albendazole, in addition to AR T, is also recommended for initial therapy of microsporidiosis caused by microsporidia other than Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Vittaforma corneae (strong, low). Systemic fumagillin (where available), in addition to AR T, is recommended for microsporidiosis caused by E. bieneusi and V. corneae (strong, moderate). Topical therapy with fumagillin eye drops, in addition to ART, is recommended in HIV-infected children with keratoconjunctivitis caused by microsporidia (strong, very low). Oral albendazole can be considered in addition to topical therapy for keratoconjunctivitis due to microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V. corneae (expert opinion). II. In HIV-infected children who have been treated for microsporidiosis, when can treatment (secondary prophylaxis) be safely discontinued? Clinicians may consider continuing treatment for microsporidiosis until improvement in severe immunosuppression is sustained (more than 6 months at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunologic category 1 or 2) and clinical signs and symptoms of infection are resolved (weak, very low). Rating System: Strength of Recommendation: Strong, weak Quality of Evidence: High; Moderate; Low; or Very LowGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children T -2Clinical Manifestations The most common manifestation of microsporidiosis is gastrointestinal (GI) tract infection. Microsporidia- associated diarrhea is intermittent, copious, watery, and non-bloody. It may be accompanied by crampy abdominal pain; fever is uncommon. Chronic severe diarrhea can result in dehydration, malnutrition, and failure to thrive. Microsporidia species have been found to cause disease in multiple other organs besides the GI tract, as well as disseminated disease. 4,11 Different infecting species may result in different clinical manifestations. E. bieneusi is associated with malabsorption, diarrhea, pulmonary disease, and cholangitis. E. cuniculi is associated with hepatitis, encephalitis, peritonitis, keratoconjunctivitis, ) intestinalis is associated with diarrhea, cholangitis, dermatitis, disseminated infection, and superficial keratoconjunctivitis. E. hellem is associated with superficial keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis, respiratory spp. are also associated with encephalitis, cardiac disease, and disseminated disease. Diagnosis To diagnose microsporidia GI infection, thin smears of unconcentrated stool-formalin suspension or duodenal aspirates can be stained with modified trichrome stain. Microsporidia spores are small (1-5 \u00b5m diameter) and ovoid; they stain pink to red with modified trichrome stain and contain a distinctive equatorial belt-like stripe. They can also be visualized with hematoxylin-eosin, Giemsa, and acid-fast staining but are often overlooked because of their small size. Chemofluorescence agents such as chromotrope 2R, calcofluor - white (a fluorescent brightener), or Uvitex are useful as selective stains for microsporidia in stool and other body fluids. Urine sediment examination by light microscopy can be used to identify microsporidia spores causing disseminated disease (such as Encephalitozoonidae or Trachipleistophora ). Transmission electron microscopy, staining with species-specific antibodies, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (using specific primers) is needed for speciation. Endoscopic biopsy should be considered for all patients with chronic diarrhea of longer than 2 months duration and negative stool examinations. Touch preparations are useful for rapid diagnosis (i.e., within 24 hours). The organisms can be visualized with Giemsa, tissue Gram stain, monoclonal are also available. Sensitive assays using PCR amplification of DNA sequences extracted from stool or biopsy specimens have been developed E. bieneusi E. intestinalis , E. hellem , and E. cuniculi13,14 and can be performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Primary Prevention Preventing Exposure Because microsporidia are most likely transferred from contaminated water, food, or contact with an infected individual or animal, direct contact should be avoided. Untreated water sources (drinking water that has not been chemically treated, filtered, or boiled to eliminate infectious agents) should also be avoided. Fresh fruit and vegetables should be thoroughly washed or peeled prior to eating. This recommendation is especially important for individuals with severe immunosuppression. Hand-washing after exposure to potentially contaminated material or contact with infected individuals or animals also is recommended. In a hospital, standard precautions (e.g., use of gloves and hand-washing after removal of gloves) should be sufficient to prevent transmission from an infected patient to a susceptible HIV -infected individual. However , contact precautions should be used in the case of a diapered or incontinent child.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children T -3Preventing Disease No chemoprophylactic regimens are known to be effective in preventing microsporidiosis. Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis Not applicable. Treatment Recommendations Treating Disease Immune reconstitution resulting from ART often results in clearance of microsporidia infections. Effective ART is the primary initial treatment for these infections in HIV-infected children and adults.15 Interestingly, some protease inhibitors, but not others, may have direct inhibitory activity against microsporidia.16 Supportive care with hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional supplementation should be provided. Albendazole has activity against many species of microsporidia,17-19 but it is not effective against Enterocytozoon infections or V . corneae.20,21 Albendazole, in addition to ART, is recommended for initial therapy of microsporidiosis caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and corneae. Fumagillin Aspergillus fumigatus ) and its synthetic analog, TNP-470,22 have both been used to treat microsporidiosis in animals and humans. In a placebo-controlled study of immunocompromised adults (10 of 12 of whom were HIV-infected adults) with E. bieneusi microsporidiosis, fumagillin (20 mg/dose orally 3 times daily for 2 weeks) was associated with decreased diarrhea and clearance of microsporidia spores, which was not observed in placebo recipients.23 Placebo recipients received fumagillin at the conclusion of the trial and all 6 demonstrated clearance of microsporidia. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 of the 6 patients randomized to receive fumagillin. No data are available on use of fumagillin or TNP-470 in HIV-infected children, and neither drug is available for systemic use in the United States. Despite the lack of experience using these agents in children, fumagillin and TNP-470 (where available), in addition to ART, are recommended based on demonstration of efficacy in adults. Consultation with an expert is recommended. Keratoconjunctivitis caused by microsporidia in HIV-infected adults responds to topical therapy with investigational fumagillin eye drops prepared from Fumidil B \u00ae (fumagillin bicyclohexylammonium, a commercial product used to control a microsporidia disease of honeybees) in saline to achieve a concentration of 70 \u00b5g/mL of fumagillin.24-27 Topical therapy with investigational fumagillin eye drops, in addition to ART, is recommended for HIV-infected children with keratoconjunctivitis caused by microsporidia. The addition of oral albendazole to topical fumagillin can be considered for keratoconjunctivitis due to microsporidia other than infections with Enterocytozoon or V . corneae, because microsporidia may persist systemically despite clearance from the eye with topical therapy alone. 28,29 Children with suspected keratoconjunctivitis that is unresponsive to antibacterial or antiviral therapy should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for evaluation for possible microsporidiosis. Other agents, including nitazoxanide, atovaquone, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones, have been reported to reduce diarrhea associated with microsporidia infection. However , metronidazole and atovaquone are not active in vitro or in animal models and should not be used to treat microsporidiosis. The role of alternative agents or the use of combination regimens for initial therapy is unknown; albendazole remains the preferred therapy for GI tract and disseminated infection caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V. corneae. 21,30,31 Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Patients with diarrhea should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, electrolyte and weight loss, and malnutrition. In severely ill patients, total parenteral nutrition may be indicated. Albendazole side effects are rare, but hypersensitivity (e.g., rash, pruritus, fever), neutropenia (reversible), Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children T -4central nervous system effects (e.g., dizziness, headache), GI disturbances (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), hair loss (reversible), and elevated hepatic enzymes (reversible) have been reported. Dose-related bone marrow toxicity is the principal adverse effect of systemic fumagillin, with reversible thrombocytopenia and neutropenia being the most frequent adverse events; topical fumagillin has not been associated with substantial side effects. There has been one report of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following initiation of ART in a patient with E. bieneusi infection, 32 but IRIS has not been described in association with treatment for non-E. bieneusi microsporidiosis. Concern for IRIS should not delay institution of ART in the presence of microsporidia infection. Managing Treatment Failure The only feasible approaches to managing treatment failure are supportive treatment and optimization of ART to achieve full virologic suppression. The roles of alternative and combination therapy are unknown. Secondary Prevention No pharmacologic interventions are known to be effective in preventing recurrence of microsporidiosis. However, the use of ART alone in patients with microsporidiosis has resulted in clearance of infection and symptoms, 15 suggesting that improvements in the immune system after successful ART are critical to recovery and may prevent recurrence. Continued albendazole therapy after treatment for an acute episode of GI or disseminated infection caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V . corneae may be considered in those with severe immunosuppression (CDC immunologic category 3) until immune recovery is observed (longer than 6 months at CDC immunologic category 1 or 2). For keratoconjunctivitis, discontinuation of fumagillin and albendazole treatment may be considered after resolution of infection in patients and immune recovery is observed (longer than 6 months at CDC immunologic category 1 or 2). Therapy should be continued indefinitely if severe immunosuppression (CDC immunologic category 3) persists because recurrence or relapse may follow treatment discontinuation. Discontinuing Secondary Prophylaxis Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis can be considered when immune recovery is observed (longer than 6 months at CDC immunologic category 1 or 2). Recommendations Treatment I. In childr en with HIV infection, what are the best interventions (compared with no intervention) to treat microsporidiosis? Ef fective ART is the primary initial treatment for microsporidiosis in HIV-infected children (strong, very low). An observational study of four adults with documented E. bieneusi infection followed stool samples and duodenal biopsy pre-ART, then 1-3 and 6 months post-ART.15 Results demonstrated that if the patient responded to ART, symptoms related to microsporidiosis improved within 1 month and evidence of eradication of the organism occurred at 6 months. Unfortunately, there are no comparable data for children. Supportive care with hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional supplementation should be provided (expert opinion). There are no studies that address this specific management issue in microsporidiosis. However , Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children T -5recognition and management of hydration status and electrolyte imbalance are key to management of infectious diarrhea. Albendazole, in addition to ART, is also recommended for initial therapy of microsporidiosis caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V . corneae (strong, low). Albendazole has activity against many species of microsporidia but it is not ef fective against E. bieneusi or V . corneae. Small observational cohort studies in adults have demonstrated improvement in symptoms and resolution of diarrhea as well as clearance of the organism in some patients following albendazole treatment. 17,18 A large randomized, open-label study in immunocompetent children in Costa Rica demonstrated clinical improvement in 95% of children receiving albendazole within 48 hours of initiation of therapy compared with only 30% who received supportive care only. 19 Case reports suggest that albendazole therapy is not effective in cases of infection with E. bieneusi and V . corneae.20 In these cases, systemic fumagillin therapy, where available, is recommended. Systemic fumagillin (where available) in addition to ART is recommended for microsporidiosis caused by E.bieneusi and V . corneae (strong, moderate). In a placebo-controlled study of immunocompromised adults (10 of 12 of whom were HIV -infected adults) with E. bieneusi microsporidiosis, fumagillin (20 mg/dose orally 3 times daily for 2 weeks) was associated with decreased diarrhea and clearance of microsporidia spores, which was not observed in placebo recipients. 23 Placebo recipients received fumagillin at the conclusion of the trial and all 6 demonstrated clearance of microsporidia. T opical therapy with fumagillin eye drops, in addition to ART, is recommended in HIV-infected children with keratoconjunctivitis caused by microsporidia (strong, very low). Improvements have been demonstrated in a small number of reported cases of topical fumagillin treatment of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis. Treatment with this agent is complicated by lack of a licensed preparation in the United States. 24-27 Oral albendazole can be considered in addition to topical therapy for keratoconjunctivitis caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V . corneae (expert opinion). The addition of oral albendazole to topical fumagillin can be considered for keratoconjunctivitis caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi or V . corneae because microsporidia may persist systemically despite clearance from the eye with topical therapy alone.28,29 Secondary Prevention II. In HIV -infected children who have been treated for microsporidiosis, when can treatment (secondary prophylaxis) be safely discontinued? Clinicians may consider continuing treatment for microsporidiosis until improvement in severe immunosuppression is sustained (more than 6 months at CDC immunologic category 1 or 2) and clinical signs and symptoms of infection are resolved (weak, very low). Recurrence of microsporidiosis has been documented following discontinuation of treatment in severely immunosuppressed patients.24 However, discontinuation of therapy following immune restoration resulting from initiation of ART was successful in a small number of patients.15Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children T -6Preventive Regimen Indication First Choice Alternative Comments/Special Issues Primary Prophylaxis N/A N/A Not recommended Secondary Prophylaxis Disseminated, Non-Ocular Infection or GI Infection Caused by Microsporidia Other Than E. bieneusi or V. corneae: Albendazole 7.5 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) by mouth twice daily Ocular Infection : T opical bicyclohexylammonium 70 g/mL) eye drops: 2 drops every 2 hours for 4 days, then 2 drops QID (investigational use only in United States) plus, for infection attributed to microsporidia other than E. bieneusi or V. corneae, albendazole 7.5 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) by mouth twice daily for management of systemic infection N/A Criteria for Discontinuing Secondary Prophylaxis : After initiation of ART, resolution of signs and symptoms and sustained immune reconstitution (more than 6 months at CDC immunologic category 1 or 2) Treatment Effective ART Therapy: Immune reconstitution may lead to microbiologic and clinical response.

Combination therapy with aminimum of two drugs (e.g., clarithromycin or azithromycin plus ethambutol) is recommended to prevent or delay the emergenceof resistance (AI*). Some experts use clarithromycin as the preferred first agent (AI*), reserving azithromycin for patients withsubstantial intolerance to clarithromycin or when drug interactions with clarithromycin are a concern (AII*).Use of rifabutin as a third drug added to the macrolide/ethambutol regimen is controversial. Some experts would add rifabutin as athird drug to the clarithromycin/ethambutol regimen, particularly in the absence of cART and in the presence of high mycobacterialcounts (CIII); however, drug interactions should be checked carefully, and more intensive toxicity monitoring may be warranted withsuch combination therapy (AIII). Other experts recommend against using this third agent in children because of rifabutin's increasedcytochrome P450 activity, which leads to increased clearance of other drugs such as protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors, and the potential for increased toxicity associated with concomitant administration of drugs (CIII).Treatment failure is defined as the absence of clinical response and the persistence of mycobacteremia after 8 to 12 weeks oftreatment. Repeat susceptibility testing of MAC isolates is recommended in this situation, and a new multidrug regimen of two ormore drugs not previously used and to which the isolate is susceptible should be administered (AIII). Drugs that should beconsidered for this scenario include rifabutin, amikacin, and a quinolone.Secondary Prophylaxis:Children with a history of disseminated MAC and continued immunosuppression should receive lifelong prophylaxis to preventrecurrence (AII*). Secondary prophylaxis typically consists of continued multidrug therapy used in treatment of disease.Some experts recommend discontinuation of therapy in HIV-infected children who meet allof the following criteria:Aged 2 years and have completed 12 months of treatment for MAC; Remain asymptomatic for MAC; Receiving stable cART (i.e., cART not requiring change for virologic or immunologic failure); Have sustained (6 months) CD4 count recovery well above the age-specific target for initiation of primary prophylaxis (i.e., asin adults, >100 cells/mm3for children aged 6 years >200 children 2 to <6 years) (CIII).Rating Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or morewell-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data inchildrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenU-2EpidemiologyMycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC) refers to Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis)that are widely distributed in the environment. Recent surveillance data have shown an increasing rate ofMAC infection in some regions within the United States.1Comprehensive guidelines on the diagnosis,prevention, and treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases were published in 2007.2Theseguidelines highlight the tremendous advances in laboratory methods in mycobacteriology that have expandedthe number of known NTM species from 50 in 1997 to 125 in 2006. In the United States, NTM infectionsoutnumber Mycobacterium tuberculosisinfections and have become an important cause of pulmonarymorbidity in adults.3MAC was the second most common opportunistic infection (OI) in HIV-infected children in the UnitedStates after Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia during the era before combination antiretroviral therapy(cART), but its incidence has greatly decreased from 1.3 to 1.8 episodes per 100 person-years during thattime to 0.14 to 0.2 episodes per 100 person-years during the cART era.4,5MAC is ubiquitous in theenvironment and presumably is acquired by routine exposures through inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation.6A recent population-based study in Florida of adults and children associated soil exposure, along with blackrace and birth outside the United States, with MAC infection.7Respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI)colonization can act as portals from which infection can disseminate.8MAC can appear as isolated lymphadenitis in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children. Disseminatedinfection with MAC in pediatric HIV infection rarely occurs during the first year of life; its frequencyincreases with age and declining CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count, but can occur at higher CD4 counts inyounger HIV-infected children than in older children or adults. It is a recognized complication of advancedimmunologic deterioration among HIV-infected children.6,9,10Clinical Manifestations Respiratory symptoms are uncommon in HIV-infected children who have disseminated MAC, and isolatedpulmonary disease is rare. Early symptoms can be minimal and may precede mycobacteremia by severalweeks. Symptoms commonly associated with disseminated MAC infection in children include persistent orrecurrent fever, weight loss or failure to gain weight, sweats, fatigue, persistent diarrhea, and persistent orrecurrent abdominal pain. Mesenteric adenitis may mimic acute appendicitis. GI symptoms can occur aloneor in combination with systemic findings. Lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly may occur.Laboratory abnormalities include anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Although serum chemistriesare usually normal, some have elevated alkaline phosphatase or lactate dehydrogenase levels.These signs and symptoms also are relatively common in the absence of disseminated MAC in HIV-infectedchildren with advanced immunosuppression.DiagnosisProcedures used to diagnose MAC in children are the same as those used for HIV-infected adults.11MAC isdefinitively diagnosed by isolation of the organism from blood or from biopsy specimens from normallysterile sites (e.g., bone marrow, lymph node). Multiple mycobacterial blood cultures over time may berequired to yield a positive result. The volume of blood sent for culture also influences yield, with increasedvolume leading to increased yield. Use of a radiometric broth medium or lysis-centrifugation culturetechnique can enhance recovery of organisms from blood.Histology demonstrating macrophage-containing acid-fast bacilli is strongly indicative of MAC infection in apatient with typical signs and symptoms, but culture is essential to differentiate nontuberculous mycobacteriafrom M. tuberculosis, to determine which nontuberculous mycobacterium is causing infection, and toperform drug-susceptibility testing. Testing of MAC isolates for susceptibility to clarithromycin orGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenU-3azithromycin is recommended (BIII). The BACTEC method for radiometric susceptibility testing can beused. Resistance for clarithromycin is defined as a minimal inhibitory concentration 32 \u00b5g/mL and aminimal inhibitory concentration of 256 \u00b5g/mL for azithromycin.12As with tuberculosis testing, multiplexpolymerase chain reaction systems have been developed for rapid identification and drug susceptibilitytesting, but these are currently only available in research laboratories.13,14Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureMAC is ubiquitous in the environment. Available information does not support specific recommendationsregarding exposure avoidance.1Person-to-person transmission is not believed to be common.Preventing First Episode of DiseaseThe most effective way to prevent disseminated MAC among HIV-infected children is to preserve immunefunction through use of effective cART. HIV-infected children who have advanced immunosuppressionshould be offered prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease according to following CD4 countthresholds (AII):15,16Children that clarithromycin and azithromycin are the preferred prophylactic agents for adults,either one is recommended for prophylaxis in children (AI*); oral suspensions of both agents arecommercially available in the United States. Before prophylaxis is initiated, at-risk children should beevaluated for disseminated MAC disease, including obtaining a blood culture for MAC (AIII). For childrenwho cannot tolerate azithromycin or clarithromycin, rifabutin is an alternative prophylactic agent for MAC,although drug interactions and a lack of efficacy data in children limit its use (CIII). Combination therapyfor prophylaxis has not been shown to be cost effective and increases rates of adverse events, and therefore,generally should be avoided in children (AIII).Although detection of MAC in stool or the respiratory tract may precede disseminated disease, no datademonstrate a correlation between initiation of prophylaxis in patients with detectable organisms at thesesites and reduced risk of developing disseminated MAC. Therefore, routine screening of respiratory or GIspecimens for MAC is not recommended (BIII).Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis On the basis of both randomized controlled trials and observational data, primary prophylaxis for MAC canbe safely discontinued in HIV-infected adults who respond to cART with an increase in CD4 count.17,18In astudy of discontinuing OI prophylaxis among percentages were 20% forthose aged >6 years and 25% for those aged 2 to 6 years, 63 HIV-infected children discontinued MACprophylaxis, and no MAC events were observed during 2 years of follow up.19On the basis of both thesefindings and data from studies in adults, primary prophylaxis can be discontinued in HIV-infected childrenaged 2 years receiving stable cART for 6 months who experience sustained (>3 months) CD4 cellrecovery well above the age-specific target for initiation of prophylaxis (i.e., as in adults, >100 cells/mm3forchildren aged 6 years and >200 cells/mm3for children aged 2 to <6 years) (BII*). No specificrecommendations exist for discontinuing MAC prophylaxis in HIV-infected children aged <2 years.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenU-4Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseDisseminated MAC infection should be treated in consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialistwho has expertise in pediatric HIV infection (AIII). Combination therapy of MAC with a minimum of 2 drugsis recommended to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance (AI*).20-23Monotherapy with a macrolideresults in emergence of high-level drug resistance within weeks.24Improved immunologic status is important for controlling disseminated MAC disease; cART should beinitiated in children with MAC disease who are antiretroviral (ARV) naive. However, the optimal time tostart cART in this situation is unknown; many experts treat MAC with antimycobacterial therapy for 2 weeksbefore starting cART to try to minimize immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), althoughwhether this makes a difference is unknown (CIII). For children already receiving cART, it should becontinued and optimized with careful attention to potential drug interactions between the ARV andantimycobacterial drugs.Initial MAC empiric therapy should include 2 or more drugs (AI*): clarithromycin or azithromycin plusethambutol.25Some experts use first agent (AI*), reserving azithromycin forpatients with substantial intolerance to clarithromycin or when drug interactions with clarithromycin are aconcern (AII*).26Clarithromycin levels can be increased by protease inhibitors (PI) and decreased byefavirenz, but no data are available to recommend dose adjustments for children. Azithromycin is notmetabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system; therefore, it can be used without concern forsignificant drug interactions with PIs and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).Because a study in adults demonstrated a survival benefit with the addition of rifabutin to clarithromycin plusethambutol, some experts would add rifabutin as a third drug to the clarithromycin/ethambutol regimen (CIII);23however, drug interactions should be checked carefully, and more intensive toxicity monitoring may bewarranted if such drugs are administered concomitantly (AIII).27Because rifabutin increases CYP450 activitythat leads to increased clearance of other drugs (e.g., PIs, NNRTIs), and toxicity might increase withconcomitant administration of drugs, other experts recommend against using this third agent in children (CIII).Guidelines and recommendations exist for dose adjustments necessary in adults treated with rifabutin and PIs,but the absence of data in children precludes extrapolating these to HIV-infected children undergoing treatmentfor disseminated MAC. No pediatric formulation of rifabutin exists, but the drug can be administered mixedwith foods such as applesauce. It can also be compounded in a liquid formulation by a pharmacist. Limitedsafety data are available from 22 HIV-infected children (median age: 9 years) who received rifabutin incombination with 2 or more other antimycobacterial drugs for treatment of MAC for 1 to 183 weeks; dosesranged from 4 mg/kg to 18.5 mg/kg, and reported adverse effects were similar to those reported in adults.28Themost commonly reported dose in children has been 5 mg/kg.Therapy is typically prolonged and depends upon response and immune reconstitution as discussed undercessation of secondary prophylaxis.Monitoring and Adverse Events, Including IRISClinically, most patients improve substantially during the first 4 to 6 weeks of therapy. A repeat blood culturefor MAC should be obtained 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of antimycobacterial therapy in patients who fail torespond clinically to their initial treatment regimen. Some experts would consider a repeat blood culture forall patients with an initial positive culture, regardless of clinical response to therapy. Improvement in fevercan be expected within 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of appropriate therapy. However, for those with moreextensive disease or advanced immunosuppression, clinical response may be delayed, and elimination of theorganism from the blood may require up to 12 weeks of effective therapy.IRIS in patients receiving MAC therapy during cART has been reported in HIV-infected adults andchildren.29-32New onset of systemic symptoms, especially fever or abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and focalGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenU-5lymphadenitis (cervical, thoracic, or abdominal) associated with preexisting but relatively asymptomaticMAC infection has occurred after the start of cART. In addition, paradoxical worsening of systemic or localsymptoms of MAC may occur as the immune system is reconstituted.In children with very low CD4 counts, the decision to begin immediate cART must take into consideration notonly the urgent need for rapid immunologic improvement, but also the possibility of IRIS due to MAC. Ifsymptoms suggestive of MAC infection are present at the time of cART initiation, the clinician should evaluatefor MAC and can consider treating for MAC presumptively. cART generally should be withheld until after thefirst 2 weeks of antimycobacterial therapy have been completed in patients with disseminated MAC diseasewho have not been treated previously with or are not receiving effective cART to reduce the risk of druginteractions and complications associated with IRIS and to lower the pill burden (CIII). However, ART shouldbe started as soon as possible after the first 2 weeks of antimycobacterial therapy in order to reduce the risk ofdeveloping additional AIDS-defining OIs, and to facilitate immune reconstitution and further improve theresponse to antimycobacterial therapy (CIII). Children with moderate symptoms of IRIS can be treatedsymptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or, if unresponsive to NSAIDS, a shortcourse (such as 4 weeks) of systemic corticosteroid therapy while continuing to receive cART (CIII).Adverse effects from clarithromycin and azithromycin include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abnormaltaste, and elevations in liver transaminase levels or hypersensitivity reactions. The major toxicity associatedwith ethambutol is optic neuritis, with symptoms of blurry vision, central scotomata, and red-green colorblindness, which usually is reversible and rare at doses of 15-25 mg/kg in children with normal renalfunction. Assessments of renal function, ophthalmoscopy, and (if possible) visual acuity and color visionshould be performed before starting ethambutol and monitored regularly during treatment with the agent(AIII). Use of ethambutol in very young children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored requires carefulconsideration of risks and benefits.33,34Patients receiving clarithromycin plus rifabutin should be observed for the rifabutin-related development uveitis, polyarthralgias, and pseudojaundice. Tiny, almost transparent, asymptomatic peripheraland central corneal deposits that do not impair vision have been observed in some HIV-infected childrenreceiving rifabutin as part of a multidrug regimen for MAC.28Managing Treatment FailureTreatment failure is defined as the absence of clinical response and the persistence of mycobacteremia after 8 to12 weeks of treatment. Repeat susceptibility testing of MAC isolates is recommended in this situation, and a newmultidrug regimen of 2 or more drugs not previously used and to which the isolate is susceptible should beadministered (AIII). Drugs that should be considered for this scenario include rifabutin, amikacin, and aquinolone. Data from treating MAC in HIV-uninfected patients indicate that an injectable agent such as amikacinor streptomycin should be considered (CIII).2,3Because dosing of these agents in children can be problematic,drug-resistant disseminated MAC should be treated with input from an expert in this disease (AIII). Optimizationof cART is an especially important adjunct to treatment of patients in whom initial MAC therapy has failed.Preventing RecurrenceChildren with a history of disseminated MAC should be given prophylaxis to prevent recurrence (AII*)untiltheir immune systems are reconstituted.35Prophylaxis in this setting means continuation of multidrugtherapy, because use of a single agent (clarithromycin or azithromycin) for secondary prophylaxis carries ahigh risk of inducing drug-resistant MAC infection.Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisOn the basis of immune reconstitution data in adults34,36and data in children discontinuing primaryprophylaxis, some experts recommend discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis in HIV-infected childrenaged 2 years who have completed 12 months of treatment for MAC, remain asymptomatic for MAC, andare receiving stable cART (i.e., cART not requiring change for viral or immune failure) and who haveGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenU-6sustained (6 months) CD4 count recovery well above the age-specific target for initiation of primaryprophylaxis (as in adults, >100 cells/mm3for children aged 6 <6 years) reintroduced the Infect Dis.

TST and IGRA should NOTbe used to rule out disease and cannot replace regular screening for TB exposure (AII). In high-TB-burdensettings, screening for TB exposure and for signs or symptoms suggestive of TB disease is universally applicable and should occur atevery health care visit (AII). Treatment for LTBIHIV-infected children should receive preventive therapy if they have a positive TST or IGRA result or if they are exposed to anindividual with infectious TB (regardless of previous treatment for TB or the TST or IGRA result), after TB disease has been excluded(AII).The preferred preventive therapy regimen is isoniazid daily for 9 months (AII). If adherence with daily isoniazid cannot be ensured,then consider twice-weekly isoniazid by directly observed therapy (DOT) by a trained worker, not a family member (BII).With exposure to an isoniazid mono-resistant source case, preventive therapy consisting of daily rifampin for 6 months isrecommended, with adjustment of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) as required (BII).A 12-dose combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine by DOT is as safe and effective as other regimens inpreventing TB disease, and the completion rate is greater than for longer regimens. However, pediatric experience with this regimen islimited, and drug-drug interactions between rifapentine and other antiretroviral drugs have not been determined. This regimen is notrecommended for children aged <2 years, nor for HIV-infected adults or children who are receiving cART or individuals who have LTBIwith presumed isoniazid or rifampin resistance; the preferred regimen for children aged 2 to 11 years remains daily isoniazid for 9 months.Treatment of TB DiseaseIn children diagnosed with TB, DOT must be started immediately (AII)and all cases of suspected and confirmed TB disease must bereported to the relevant health authorities.All children diagnosed with TB should be tested for HIV infection (AIII).In HIV-infected children, the recommended treatment for fully-drug-susceptible TB is a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid,rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol given daily during the 2-month intensive phase, followed by a 7-month continuation phaseusing only isoniazid and rifampin (AII), with adjustment of cART as required. With good adherence and treatment response, thrice-weekly treatment under DOT during the continuation phase can be considered (CII). For children with extrapulmonary disease caused by drug susceptible TB involving the bones or joints, central nervous system (CNS),or disseminated/miliary disease, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 months (AIII).For TB meningitis (TBM), pending drug-susceptibility testing results, ethionamide can replace ethambutol (or an injectableaminoglycoside) as the fourth drug because of its superior cerebrospinal fluid penetration (CII).Children with suspected and confirmed multidrug resistant (MDR) TB (i.e., resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin) should bemanaged in consultation with an expert. In the United States, treatment of MDR-TB should be individualized based on drugsusceptibility test (DST) results (in cases where DST results for the child are not available, then DST results for the source case shouldbe used to guide initial choice of regimen) (AII).Treatment for TB must commence as soon as the diagnosis is established in HIV-infected children, both those who are already oncART and those not yet receiving cART; those not yet on cART should be evaluated for early cART initiation, preferably within 2 to 8weeks of starting TB therapy (AII).Depending on age and previous cART exposure, an efavirenz-based regimen usually is preferable because such regimens areassociated with better treatment outcomes (AII). Nevirapine with potential dose adjustment with concomitant rifampin administrationcan also be considered (CIII). If a protease inhibitor-based regimen is used, superboosting with ritonavir (using a ritonavir dose equal to the lopinavir dose) for thefull duration of rifampin treatment (and 2 weeks after termination) is required (AII).Pyridoxine supplementation (1-2 mg/kg body weight/day, max 50 (with is indicated for children with TBM or pericardial effusion (AII). Itcan also be considered with severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, airway compression, or pleural effusion (BII).Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-2EpidemiologyOf the 11,182 cases of tuberculosis (TB) reported in the United States in 2010, 637 (6%) occurred in childrenaged <15.1Information on the epidemiology of TB in the United States can be found athttp://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/default.htm. Among TB cases with known HIV tests results reported in theUnited States between 1994 and 2007, HIV coinfection was reported in 20% of adults and 3% of childrenand adolescents (<18 years) overall.2The actual rate of HIV coinfection in U.S. children and adolescentswith TB is unknown because of the very low rate of HIV testing in this population\u2014more than 70% did nothave an HIV result reported to the National TB Surveillance System;2however, routine HIV testing isindicated in all individuals with confirmed or suspected TB. Numerous studies have documented the increased risk of TB in HIV-infected adults. Domestic andinternational studies have documented a similar increased risk of TB in HIV-infected children.3-5Unlikeother AIDS-related opportunistic infections, a decreasing or low CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count is notnecessary for increased risk of TB in HIV-infected children. Congenital TB is rare, but has been reportedwith possible increased frequency in children born to HIV-infected mothers with TB.6,7Children with TB usually have been infected by an adult in their immediate environment, and their diseaserepresents progression of primary infection rather than reactivation disease.8Discovery and treatment of thesource case and evaluation of all exposed members of the household are particularly important to terminateongoing transmission (from primary and secondary cases) and to find and diagnose high-risk individualswith latent Mycobacterium tuberculosisinfection who may benefit from preventive therapy.9All confirmedand suspected cases of TB disease must be reported to state and local health departments, which will assist incontact evaluation.Disease caused by Mycobacterium bovisis less common than disease caused by M. tuberculosisin theUnited States, but pediatric cases have been reported.10,11Among 11,860 TB cases reported in the UnitedStates between 1995 and 2005 for which genotyping information was available, 165 (1.4%) were caused byM. bovis; of these, 12(7.3%) of the patients were aged 0 to 4 years and 19 (11.5%) were aged 5 to 14 years.Risk factors for M. bovisdisease in the United States include Hispanic ethnicity, age <15 years, HIVinfection, and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB).12Several reports demonstrate bovisis primarilytransmitted via ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products,10,12which may have been consumed outside theUnited States or imported casually. Although ingestion is the usual route of entry, human-to-human airbornetransmission has been observed and its likelihood may be increased by HIV coinfection. Distinction betweenM. tuberculosisand M. bovisis important, because nearly all M. bovisisolates are resistant to pyrazinamideand the public health interventions are different. The emergence and effective transmission of drug-resistant TB is a major obstacle to global TB control.13-15In the United States, comprehensive public health measures successfully reduced the rates of drug-resistantPanel's Recommendations, continuedLiver chemistry tests should be performed before initiation and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment for TB (the same for cARTinitiation while receiving treatment for TB) (BIII). Beyond 2 months, routine testing every 2 to 3 months is advisable for all childrenreceiving cART, or more frequently if clinically indicated (BIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-3TB; the proportion of primary multidrug-resistant cases declined from 2.5% in 1993 toapproximately 1.1% in 1997 and has remained at about 1% since.16Between 1994 and 2007, M. tuberculosisresistance to any first-line TB drug was found in 17% of children and adolescents (<18 years) who hadculture-confirmed TB and drug-susceptibility testing results reported to the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), with higher rates in foreign-born (20%) than children (15%).2The fractionof was 2% in foreign-born children.2However, fraction foreign-born TB patients in the United Statescontinues to rise,16many originating from countries with high rates of drug-resistant TB. Parents, guardians,or visiting relatives may expose children to infection.Extensively drug-resistant (MDR-TB) withadditional resistance to any fluoroquinolone of three second-line injectable drugs(capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin), emerged globally as an important new threat, particularly in HIV-infected individuals.13,14,17Of the 49 cases of XDR-TB reported in the United States from 1993 to 2006, one(2%) was in a child aged <15 years.18However, this number possibly underestimates the burden in children,because most TB cases in children are not culture-positive; thus, a definitive diagnosis of drug-resistant TB isnot achieved.Clinical Manifestations Once infected with TB, young (aged <5 years) and/or immunocompromised children such as those who areHIV-infected are highly susceptible to developing TB disease, with the first 12 months after primaryinfection representing the period of greatest risk for progression to TB disease.5,19Generally, the clinicalfeatures of TB in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children are similar, with non-localizing signs such asfailure to thrive, cough, and intermittent fever present, although disease progression may be more rapid andthe development of complicated or disseminated disease more likely in HIV-infected children.8,20,21BothHIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children may present with characteristic pulmonary involvement such ashilar and/or mediastinal adenopathy, which may cause airway compression. Immunocompromised children,including those who are HIV-infected, may also such as multi-lobar including meningitis or sepsis, ismore likely in the very young and/or immunocompromised, including HIV-infected children. Descriptions ofthe disease's natural history provide the following general patterns that characterize childhood TB, althoughexceptions to the rule are common and HIV-infected children of all ages are more likely to have diseasemanifestations similar to those seen in very young (immune immature) children:8Aged <1 year:Greatest risk of disease progression and disease manifestations poorcontainment such as 1-4 years:Persistent risk of disseminated forms of disease. Children <5 years are atgreatest risk of complications resulting from airway compression, because of their small, pliable airwaysand exuberant lymph node responses. Extra-thoracic manifestations are not uncommon (see below).Aged 5-9 years:Period of lowest risk for immunocompetent children, but they may contributesignificantly to the total case load, depending on the average age at which primary infection occurs in theepidemiological setting. In this age group, a wide range of disease manifestations is seen, includingdisease patterns seen in young children and adult-type disease. Adult-type pulmonary disease, with upperlobe infiltration, cavitation, and sputum production, is more common starting at age 8 years, and in high-TB-burden settings, and is seen more frequently in adolescent girls than in boys.Aged >10 years:Adult-type pulmonary disease is more common. Children in this age group are morelikely to have positive results from acid-fast bacteria (AFB) sputum-smear microscopy and should beregarded as a potential infectious source.22Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-4Approximately 25% of children with TB involvement, forms morecommon in HIV-infected children.20,23-25Extra-thoracic disease manifestations include:Peripheral lymphadenitis (usually cervical). Features include matted mass see immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [IRIS] discussion).TBM is most common in children aged <3 years, but especially with HIV coinfection, can occur at anyage. Disease manifestations are often similar, but the list of differential diagnoses is greatly expanded inimmunocompromised individuals, including HIV-infected children.27,28Osteo-articular disease can involve any bone or joint, but vertebral involvement with typical TB gibbusformation with/without para-vertebral abscess formation is most common. Cold abscesses can occur at any site, but often develop in association with bone involvement or in deepmuscle groups, such as psoas muscle.A great variety of disease manifestations are possible, including such by definition is a symptomless condition, can be diagnosed using thetuberculin skin test (TST), administered by the Mantoux method, or by interferon-gamma release assays(IGRAs). Both categories of testing methods are indirect ways of detecting M. tuberculosisinfection andrequire T-cell immune activity; thus, HIV infection and the degree of immune alteration diminish the utilityof these tests and change interpretation of results. A negative result with any of these tests cannot be regardedas exclusionary for M. tuberculosisinfection (AII), whether latent or active, especially in the context of HIVinfection, and the interpretation of any result with any of these tests must take into account an individualpatient's epidemiological and medical factors and the circumstances of testing. The QuantiFERON-TB GoldIn-Tube (QFT) (Cellestis Limited, Valencia, California) and the T SPOT\u00ae.TB assay (Oxford Immunotec,Marlborough, Massachusetts) are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved. An IGRA ispreferred for testing BCG-vaccinated patients and for use in settings when the return rate for TST reading ispoor; however, studies of IGRA performance in HIV-infected children and in very young children arelimited, and results from these studies have shown inconsistent results, with data on sensitivity andspecificity in this age group not available.30TST is preferred over IGRAs for children younger than age 5years (AII).31When increased sensitivity for diagnosing M. tuberculosisinfection is sought, TST and anIGRA can be done simultaneously, with a positive result from either being diagnostic. Younger age, HIVinfection, and reduced numbers of CD4 cells increase the rate of indeterminate IGRA results.32A recentsystematic review and meta-analysis also found reduced QFT sensitivity in young children with greatlyreduced diagnostic utility in TB-endemic areas.33Because HIV-infected children are at high risk of TB, annual LTBI testing is recommended beginning at ages3 to 12 months and annually thereafter for those who tested negative in the past (AIII),34depending on thelocal epidemiology, region of birth, and travel history. In HIV-infected patients, a TST induration 5 mm isconsidered positive, but even with this reduced cut-off, sensitivity remains poor; in U.S. recommendations,cut-off points for IGRAs are not adjusted for HIV infection. It is important that skin tests be administeredand read correctly (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/Mantoux/default.htm).34The use of control skinantigens to assess cutaneous anergy is of uncertain value and not recommended (AII). Sensitivity totuberculin is reduced by severe malnutrition and some viral infections, including measles; the additive effectof HIV infection in these circumstances has not been determined. As a precaution, skin testing scheduledaround the time of live-virus vaccination should be done at the same time as, or delayed until 4 weeks afterGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-5vaccination to avoid potentially suppressed sensitivity (AIII). Test characteristics for IGRAs in thesesituations have not been determined, but the same scheduling adjustments as for TST are advisable.31Two-step skin testing may boost sensitivity in adults, but its utility has not been assessed in children nor in thepresence of HIV infection and its use is not recommended. Patients who test positive should undergo chestradiography and clinical evaluation to exclude TB disease. TB DiseaseThe most rigorous diagnosis of TB requires culture confirmation. However, in clinical practice, a diagnosisof TB in children frequently depends on a combination of TB exposure or infection together with symptomsand clinical signs suggestive of TB and chest imaging studies with findings suggestive of active disease;where EPTB is suspected, histopathology and other laboratory results (such as evidence of granulomaformation on histological examination of biopsy specimens) also may aid diagnosis. Chest radiographyshould include both posteroanterior (or anteroposterior) and lateral views for optimal assessment of hilaradenopathy; in cases of uncertainty, ongoing symptom review and repeat radiography in 1 to 2 weeks may behighly informative. All children diagnosed with TB should be tested for HIV infection (AIII).Direct methods for detection of M. tuberculosisinclude AFB tests(NAATs), on AFB microscopy in 50% to 70% of adultswith pulmonary TB; however, young children and children infected with HIV often have paucibacillary disease(low bacterial load), resulting in lower yield from sputum smear microscopy and culture, and specimens maybe difficult to obtain because young children are unable to expectorate.35A positive smear result is suggestiveof TB, but it does not differentiate M. tuberculosisfrom other mycobacterial species. Mycobacterial cultureimproves both sensitivity and specificity beyond that of AFB microscopy and permits species identification,drug-susceptibility testing, and genotyping. Confirming the presence of M. tuberculosisis most helpful in HIV-infected children because of the expansive differential diagnosis.36Obtaining a total of 3 sputum specimens37for microscopic evaluation and mycobacterial culture is advisable.38-40Performing NAAT on at least onerespiratory specimen is advisable in adults and also has added value in children.41,42For children who areunable to produce sputum spontaneously, specimens should be collected via early-morning gastric aspirates orsputum induction; the first gastric aspirate collected gives the very highest yield and should be undertakencarefully.43The sensitivity and specificity of AFB microscopy of gastric aspirate specimens is poor.Bronchoscopy can be considered for patients unable to produce sputum.37When extrapulmonary involvementis suspected, relevant specimens should be obtained as clinically indicated and sent for histology and culturecarefully.43Overall yield is increased by collecting multiple specimens. A single FDA-approved commercial NAAT for direct detection of M. tuberculosisin sputum samples withpositive or negative smear-microscopy results is available in the U.S. market: Amplified M. tuberculosisDirect Test (Gen-Probe). Newer direct tests that also can detect genetic markers of drug resistance, such asGenXpert (Cepheid), have been developed for point-of-care applications; these tests have been adopted atsome sites in the United States after local validation but are not yet FDA-approved. GeneXpert testing of nonsputum samples is not recommended. Data on the use of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in children isunavailable. For children who can produce sputum, consideration should be given to performing NAAT on atleast one respiratory specimen if a diagnosis of TB is being considered and if a positive test result wouldalter case management; however, further research is needed before specific recommendations can be madeon the use of NAAT in the diagnosis of TB in children who cannot produce sputum and in the diagnosis ofEPTB. Individual case reports have shown the utility of such testing without determining the overall testcharacteristics for this off-label usage.41Use of NAATs on gastric aspirate and cerebrospinal fluid specimensproved disappointing in the past;44-46they may be useful for increasing specificity of diagnosis (confirmingdisease) but sensitivity is inadequate to exclude disease.47Because of the challenges of specimen collection and poor bacteriologic yield in children including thosewho are HIV-infected, the epidemiologic risk factors and a TB exposure history are critical determinants formaking the diagnosis. In clinical practice, diagnosis often rests on indirect tests for TB infection (positiveGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-6result from TST or IGRA) together with symptoms and chest radiograph findings suggestive of activedisease.19A high index of suspicion is important, together with awareness that the stage of HIV infectionaffects the frequency of symptoms and radiologic signs and the characteristic performance of the indirecttests for infection such as TST, as well as the likelihood of alternative diagnoses (such as chronic lymphoidinterstitial pneumonitis or recurrent bacterial infections).4Drug-resistant TB should be suspected in the following situations:43Exposure to a person with drug-resistant TB,Residence in or travel to a region with high rates of drug-resistant TB,Residence in or work in an institution or setting in which drug-resistant TB is documented,Treatment of pulmonary problems with a prolonged course of multiple medicines or an injectable agentfor more than a few weeks in a foreign country (i.e., the patient may not realize that he or she was treatedfor TB),Treatment of a pulmonary illness with a fluoroquinolone, andTreatment for LTBI when TB disease was not recognized.Careful inquiry about the drug susceptibility pattern and treatment history of the likely source case (thisshould be routinely available for all newly diagnosed adult TB cases)48is essential to guide clinicalmanagement and choice of treatment regimen in children. TB drug-susceptibility testing (genotypic andphenotypic) should be performed in all cases where M. tuberculosisis isolated from a child; obtainingspecimen(s) for mycobacterial culture and TB-drug susceptibility testing is particularly important for thosewho meet any of the risk criteria for drug resistance or if treatment failure occurs. A service for the molecular(i.e., genotypic) detection of drug resistance, provided by CDC through public health microbiologylaboratories, provides rapid assessment of drug resistance, but phenotypic testing, using well standardizedtechniques, remains the reference standard.41Prevention RecommendationsThe most effective way to reduce TB-related morbidity and mortality is to prevent TB disease, which can beachieved by preventing TB exposure, minimizing HIV-related immunocompromise with early initiation ofcombination antiretroviral therapy (cART),49,50and preventing progression to disease by diagnosing infectionor high-risk exposure early and treating it.36TB infection control has proven to be critical in healthcare andhigh-risk congregate settings. Preventing ExposureMost childhood infections with M. tuberculosiscome from exposure in the immediate environment, often thehousehold. Risk factors for TB disease (such as homelessness, incarceration, exposure to institutionalsettings, birth or residence in a high TB burden region) in close contacts of HIV-infected children also shouldbe considered. The peripartum period seems to be a particularly vulnerable period for HIV-infected mothers;they should be evaluated for TB if they develop any symptoms suggestive of disease.51Preventing DiseaseBCG vaccine, which is not routinely administered in the United States, should not be administered to HIV-infected infants and children (AII). In the United States, where TB exposure is uncommon and BCG is not routinely administered at birth, HIV-infected children should have a TST (IGRA has uncertain value) during infancy (3-12 months of age) andannually thereafter (AIII).34However, the value of this strategy will depend on the local TB epidemiology,region of birth, and travel history. After TB disease has been excluded, all HIV-infected children who haveGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-7had close contact with an infectious TB case (regardless of their TST or IGRA result or previous history ofTB diagnosis) or who test positive for the first time (AI)should receive preventive therapy (AII). Thepreferred regimen is isoniazid (10-15 mg/kg body weight/day for 9 months) (AII); if adherence with dailytreatment supervised by the parent or other family member cannot be ensured, then isoniazid (20-30 mg/kgbody weight twice weekly as directly-observed therapy [DOT] by a trained worker, not a family member)can be considered (BII). For HIV-infected children, liver chemistry tests (serum alanine aminotransferase[ALT] concentration at a minimum) should be performed before initiating isoniazid (AII)and monthlythereafter or if any symptoms or signs suggestive of possible hepatotoxicity develop; medical providersshould emphasize to patients that isoniazid treatment should be stopped immediately upon the earliest onsetof toxicity (such as excess fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or jaundice), even before a clinicalevaluation has been conducted, and that initial symptoms can be subtle and may not include jaundice.52Ifisoniazid mono-resistance is known or suspected in the source case, daily rifampin for 6 months isrecommended (BII). A 2-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide has been associated with severe andfatal hepatotoxicity in adults and was never recommended for children (AII). Children exposed to otherdrug-resistant TB should receive individualized medical management in consultation with an expert, takinginto account the susceptibility pattern and treatment history of the likely source-case.53,54As noted above, in the United States, treatment for LTBI should be given to all HIV-infected patientsfollowing exposure to an infectious TB case or who test positive for the first time (i.e., positive on TST orIGRA) after TB disease has been excluded. Ongoing prophylaxis after treatment for TB is completed (secondary or post-treatment prophylaxis) is notrecommended. TB exposure screening should be ongoing and post-exposure prophylaxis provided followingdocumented close contact with an infectious TB case, irrespective of previous exposure or treatment.A 12-dose combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine by DOT is safe and as effective asother regimens in preventing TB disease, and the completion rate is greater than for longer regimens.1,55-57However, pediatric experience with this regimen is limited, and the drug-drug interactions betweenrifapentine and antiretroviral drugs have not been determined. This regimen is not recommended for childrenaged <2 years, for HIV-infected adults or children who are receiving cART, or for individuals who haveLTBI with presumed isoniazid or rifampin resistance; the preferred regimen for children aged 2 to 11 yearsremains daily isoniazid for 9 months.1Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseEmpiric therapy for TB should be started in HIV-infected infants and children in whom the diagnosis isstrongly suspected and continued until the diagnosis is definitively excluded. The use of DOT (by a trainedworker, not a family member) is recommended to maximize adherence (AII). Principles for treatment of TBare similar in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children. However, treating TB in an HIV-infected child iscomplicated by cART interactions and overlapping toxicities. Once TB is diagnosed, treatment must bestarted immediately (AII). The recommended total treatment duration is a minimum of 9 months for HIV-infected children (AIII).34,58An overview of dosing recommendations for the prevention and treatment of TBin HIV-infected children is provided in the Dosing Recommendations Table.In HIV-infected children, treatment given daily during the 2-month intensive-therapy phase, followed by a 7-month continuation phase using only isoniazid and rifampin (AII).34Therapy for HIV-infected childrenshould be given as daily DOT. With good adherence and treatment response, thrice-weekly treatment duringthe continuation phase can be considered (CIII); once- or twice-weekly dosing has been associated with anincreased rate of relapse or treatment failure with rifamycin resistance in HIV-infected adults with low CD4counts and, therefore, is not recommended.59,60For children without significant immune compromise andGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-8with minimal disease with fully drug-susceptible TB, experts would consider a standard 3-drugregimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide) during the 2-month intensive phase and a continuation phase(using isoniazid and rifampin) of 4 months (BII). Ethionamide can be used as an alternative to ethambutol (or an injectable aminoglycoside) in TBM cases (CII),because of superior cerebrospinal fluid penetration.61-64For children with extrapulmonary disease involvingthe bones or joints, central nervous system (CNS), or miliary disease, the minimum recommended total durationof treatment is 12 months (2-month intensive phase followed by 10-month continuation phase) (AIII);34,62,65seethe Dosing Recommendations Table. These recommendations assume that the organism is believed to be fullysusceptible, that adherence is ensured by DOT, and that a child responds well clinically (and, if laboratoryconfirmed, microbiologically) to therapy. Co-Treatment of TB and HIVConcomitant treatment of TB and HIV is complicated by unfavorable pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions andoverlapping toxicities and should be managed by a specialist with expertise in treating both conditions.Issues to consider when treating both conditions include: The critical role of rifampin because of its bactericidal and sterilizing properties, but also its potentinduction of the CYP3A enzyme system and p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux that lowers cART druglevels, especially those of the protease inhibitors (PIs); Overlapping toxicities; and The challenges of adhering to a medication regimen that may include seven or more drugs. See theSummary of Recommendations Table. Standard anti-TB treatment must start as soon as TB is diagnosed (AII). For children already receiving cART,the cART regimen should be reviewed to minimize potential toxicities and drug-drug interactions. For childrennot yet receiving cART, early cART initiation should be planned, preferably within 2 to 8 weeks of startingtreatment for TB (AII). Results from treating TB/HIV coinfection in adults suggest that early initiation ofcART after the start of treatment for TB (within 2-8 weeks) may increase the risk of IRIS, but it is associatedwith a significant reduction in mortality.66Results from treating TB/HIV coinfection in children also supportearly cART initiation.49For severely ill children, immediate cART initiation may be advisable (CIII). Thetiming of cART initiation with CNS TB remains more controversial because of the potentially devastatingeffects of CNS IRIS.67,68The choice of cART regimen in an HIV-infected child receiving a rifampin-based TB treatment regimenshould be carefully considered. Rifampin is a potent inducer of the CYP3A enzyme system, with resultantsevere reductions in PI levels (except ritonavir, which partially reverses this effect) and moderate nucleoside semi-synthetic antibiotic related to rifampin, exhibits minimal CYP3Ainduction and has been used in this context. However, drug dose adjustments are still required and data on itsuse in children remain limited; use only with expert guidance. NRTI drug levels are least affected byrifampin; therefore, a classic double NRTI backbone is maintained. However, because a triple NRTI strategyis associated with inferior virologic outcomes69(unless the viral load is sufficiently suppressed), the thirddrug of choice is usually a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI); efavirenz is the preferredNNRTI, but alternative options need to be considered in children in whom efavirenz is contraindicated orintolerable. Efavirenz is the preferred NNRTI in children and evidence suggests that no dosage adjustment isnecessary (AII).70Efavirenz was FDA approved in 2013 for children aged 3 months (and at least 3.5 kg) to 3years old, but experience in this age group remains very limited. Nevirapine can be considered, but serumdrug levels are reduced by more than 30% to 40% during rifampin co-treatment.71Adult data suggest that nodosage adjustment is necessary, apart from omitting the lead-in dose,32but many pediatric experts stillrecommend a 30% increase in the nevirapine dose in children, given the low risk of hepatic toxicity (aGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-9particular concern in healthy in young women) and the need to ensure optimal drug levels in young childrenwith high viral loads (CIII) (See the Summary of Recommendations Table).If a PI-based regimen is used, then a super-boosted PI regimen is advised, such as lopinavir/ritonavir withadditional ritonavir to equal the lopinavir dose.73The super-boosted PI regimen should be continued for thefull duration of rifampin treatment and 2 weeks after termination of TB therapies (AIII). For children alreadyreceiving cART, the issues are similar. cART must continue and concurrent treatment of TB must be startedimmediately (AII). The cART regimen should be reviewed to ensure optimal treatment of both TB and HIVand to minimize potential toxicities and drug-drug interactions. Combined use of integrase inhibitors andother cART classes with rifampin-based treatment has not been evaluated in children. Ongoing studies inadults suggest that dosage adjustment also is required with integrase inhibitors (See the Summary ofRecommendations Table).When available, therapeutic drug monitoring can be used to help guide drug dose adjustments duringHIV/TB co-treatment. Treatment of Drug-Resistant TBFor treatment of drug-resistant TB, a minimum of 4 drugs to which the isolate is susceptible should beadministered, including two or more bactericidal drugs (AII). Therapeutic regimens are individualized on thebasis of the resistance pattern of the M. tuberculosisisolate and treatment history of the patient and the likelysource case, considering the relative activities of each drug, the extent of disease, and any comorbidconditions. Children with suspected or confirmed drug-resistant TB should be managed in consultation withan expert. Mono-Drug ResistanceIf the strain is resistant only to isoniazid, isoniazid should be discontinued and the patient treated with 9 to 12months of a rifampin-containing regimen (e.g., rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) (BII). Rifampin mono-resistance is rare, and rifampin resistance usually is a marker of MDR-TB. Therefore, if rifampinmono-resistance is detected with a rapid test, it should be regarded as MDR-TB until the susceptibility orresistance to both isoniazid and rifampin is confirmed by phenotypic testing, because the rapid molecular(genotypic) methods for detecting resistance are not as sensitive to isoniazid as they are to rifampin. MDR-TBChildren with suspected and confirmed MDR-TB (resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin) should bemanaged in consultation with an expert. In the United States, treatment of MDR-TB should be individualizedbased on drug susceptibility test (DST) results. In cases where DST results for a child are unavailable, DSTresults for the source case should be used to guide initial choice of regimen. For treatment of drug-resistantTB, a minimum of 3 to 4 drugs to which the isolate is susceptible should be administered, including two ormore bactericidal drugs (AII). Children with extensive or disseminated disease should be treated with at least5 active drugs, because early aggressive treatment provides the best chance for cure.14,53,54All treatment forMDR-TB in HIV-infected children should be given daily with DOT.34,74XDR-TB Children with suspected or confirmed XDR-TB should be managed in consultation with an expert. XDR-TBis a form of MDR-TB for which the principles of management are similar, albeit with even greaterchallenges.53Adjunctive Treatment Adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids is indicated for children with TBM, since it reduces mortality andlong-term neurologic impairment (AII). Adjunctive corticosteroid use reduces long-term constrictiveGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-10complications in TB pericarditis (AII)and is associated with more rapid symptom resolution in TB pleuraleffusion (relative indication). It also can be considered with severe airway obstruction related toendobronchial TB and highly symptomatic body weight/day) for 4to tapered over 2 weeks. Pyridoxine (1-2 mg/kg body weight/day, max 50 mg/day) isrecommended for all HIV-infected children treated with isoniazid, because of persistent low pyridoxinelevels and possible increased risk of peripheral neuropathy (AII).75Monitoring of Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Regular monitoring of clinical and bacteriologic response to therapy is important (AII). For children withpulmonary TB, chest radiographs should be obtained 2 months after the start of treatment to evaluate acuteresponse to therapy and then serially as needed, judging by clinical response.34Hilar adenopathy may persistor even worsen despite successful treatment, and normalization of the chest radiograph is not a criterion forshortening or discontinuing therapy. The most important indicators of treatment response are bacteriologicconversion, symptom resolution, and weight gain; all children with culture-confirmed disease should bemonitored regularly for bacteriologic response;37this is critical in all children with extensive lung disease orculture-confirmed drug-resistant TB (CIII). Gastric upset can occur during the initial weeks of isoniazid treatment, but it usually can be avoided byhaving some food in the stomach when the drug is administered. Hepatotoxicity is the most common seriousadverse effect. It includes subclinical hepatic enzyme elevation, which usually resolves spontaneously duringcontinuation of treatment, and clinical hepatitis that usually resolves when the drug is discontinued. It rarelyprogresses to hepatic failure, but the likelihood increases when isoniazid is continued despite hepatitissymptoms (jaundice; tender, enlarged liver). Hepatotoxicity is less frequent in children than in adults, but noage group is risk-free. Transient asymptomatic serum transaminase elevations have been noted in 3% to 10%and clinical hepatitis in <1% of children receiving isoniazid; <1% required treatment discontinuation.65,76Therate of hepatotoxicity may be higher in children who take multiple hepatotoxic medications. Although the risk in HIV-infected children has not been quantified, excessive hepatotoxicity has not beendocumented. Liver chemistry tests (serum ALT at a minimum; AST and bilirubin also should be considered)should be performed before initiation and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment for TB (the same for cARTinitiation while receiving treatment for TB) (BIII). Beyond 2 months, routine testing every 2 to 3 months isadvisable for all children receiving ART, and more frequently if clinically indicated (BIII). Patients and theirfamilies should be educated about the signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity; for children who develop them,treatment should be stopped and evaluation done on an urgent basis and liver enzymes measured (AIII).Mild elevations in serum transaminase concentration (i.e., less than 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN])do not require drug discontinuation in children who are asymptomatic and in whom other findings (includingbilirubin) are normal (AII). If transaminase levels exceed five times the ULN or three times the ULN in thepresence of any symptoms or signs indicative of hepatotoxicity (e.g., anorexia, jaundice, raised bilirubin),then all hepatotoxic drugs should be immediately discontinued. Discussion with an expert on furthermanagement using non-hepatotoxic drugs, and future careful re-challenge with first-line TB drugs should beconsidered. With transaminase levels three to five times the ULN in the absence of any symptoms or signsindicative of hepatotoxicity, treatment can cautiously continue with regular (at least weekly) liver chemistrytests and ongoing expert consultation.52,77Rifampin is also associated with hepatotoxicity. If transaminase levels exceed 5 times ULN or 3 times the ULN inthe presence of any symptoms or signs indicative of hepatotoxicity (e.g., anorexia, jaundice, raised bilirubin), thenall hepatotoxic drugs should be immediately discontinued. Discussion with an expert on further managementusing non-hepatotoxic drugs, and future careful re-challenge with first-line TB drugs should be considered.Rifampin may lead to color changes in secretions including urine and saliva, and may lead to discoloration ofcontact lenses. Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis, with symptoms of blurry vision, central scotomata, and red-green color blindness, but it is rare at the recommended daily dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg body weight34,37,62and isusually reversible78,79(see http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_TB_2006.365_eng.pdf). BecauseGuidelines for the Prevention Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenV-11ethambutol should be given daily as part of a 4-drug regimen for TB treatment, intermittent dosing (i.e., two orthree times weekly) in children is not recommended. The maximum recommended dose of ethambutol given asdaily dosing is 1.6 g. Visual acuity should be evaluated before starting ethambutol and monitored regularly duringtreatment (AIII). Use of ethambutol in very young children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored requirescareful consideration of risks and benefits.34Hypothyroidism has been associated with ethionamide and 4 (para)-aminosalicylic acid use;80periodic (i.e.,every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function is recommended (AIII). Major adverse effects ofaminoglycoside drugs are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; periodic (i.e., every 3 months) audiometry andblood urea and creatinine measurements are recommended (AIII). Audiometry should be continued until 6months after treatment completion, because ototoxicity can progress after termination of prolongedaminoglycoside use. (AIII). Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) TB IRIS after initiation of cART was first reported in HIV-infected adults.81-83It may present with new onsetof systemic symptoms, especially high fever; expanding CNS lesions; and worsening adenopathy, pulmonaryinfiltrates, or pleural effusions. Similar cases in children have been reported.65,84,85IRIS should be suspectedin children with advanced immunosuppression who initiate cART and develop new symptoms shortlythereafter (within 3-6 months), despite evidence of good HIV control (increased weight and CD4 count,reduced viral load). It represents a temporary exacerbation of symptoms and occurs in two clinical scenarios.In patients who have occult TB before cART initiation, TB may be unmasked by subsequent immunerecovery.86This unmasking or incident TB-IRIS usually occurs within 3 months of cART initiation and thepathogen typically is detectable.87IRIS also can result in paradoxical worsening of TB disease in HIV/TB-coinfected patients after cART initiation; treatment failure because of microbial resistance or poor adherencealso must be excluded in these cases. In prospective observational studies, IRIS occurred in nearly 20% ofchildren, usually within 4 weeks of cART initiation, resulting mostly from atypical mycobacteria, BCG (inyoung vaccinated infants) and TB (more prevalent in older children).88,89Mild-to-moderate symptoms ofIRIS can be treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, while short-term use ofsystemic corticosteroids can be considered in more severe cases (BIII);81-83,90treatment for TB and ARTshould not be discontinued.Managing Treatment FailureMost children with TB, including those who are HIV-infected, respond well to standard treatment. If clinicalresponse is poor, then adherence to therapy, drug absorption, and the possibility of drug resistance should beaddressed. Mycobacterial culture, drug-susceptibility testing, and serum concentrations of TB drugs shouldbe done whenever possible. Drug resistance should be suspected in any child whose smear or culture fails toconvert after 2 months of DOT or in any of the situations previously emphasized. Also consider possiblealternative diagnoses or dual pathology. Preventing RecurrenceTB recurrence can represent relapse or re-infection disease. The relapse rate is low in children with drug-susceptible TB who receive DOT and cART. Recurrence within 6 to 12 months of treatment completion shouldbe regarded as relapse and managed the same as treatment failure. Recurrence more than 6 to 12 months aftertreatment completion is probably re-infection disease, especially after new TB exposure or a visit to a TBendemic setting. Re-infection disease should be managed the same as first-time TB. Secondary (post-treatment)prophylaxis is not recommended. However, regular TB exposure screening should continue after completion oftreatment, and preventive therapy should be considered whenever repeat exposure occurs.

Paper presented at: Paris, France: IUATLD , 2010Guidelines for the Prevention and Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-1Pneumocystis jirovecii 2013)Panel's RecommendationsPrevention of Primary ExposureSome experts recommend that consideration be given to not placing a patient with Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP) in ahospital room with another patient and not placing an at-risk immunocompromised patient in a room with a patient who has arespiratory tract infection (BIII).ChemoprophylaxisChemoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing PCP . Prophylaxis is recommended for all HIV-infected children aged CD4 counts <200 with CD4 counts<500 cells/mm3or CD4 percentage <15%, and all HIV-infected infants aged <12 months regardless of CD4 count or percentage (AII).Infants with indeterminate HIV infection status should receive prophylaxis until they are determined to be HIV-uninfected orpresumptively HIV-uninfected (AIII). HIV-infected infants should be administered prophylaxis until age 1 year, at which time they shouldbe reassessed on the basis of the age-specific CD4 count or percentage thresholds mentioned above (AII). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; cotrimoxazole), administered either on 3 consecutive days/week or daily, is the drug ofchoice for prophylaxis because of its high efficacy, relative safety, low cost, and broad antimicrobial spectrum (AI).Other effective and safe prophylaxis regimens are available for patients unable to take TMP-SMX. A second choice would be eitheratovaquone (AI)or dapsone (BI*).Aerosolized pentamidine is recommended for children who cannot take TMP-SMX, atovaquone, or dapsone and who are old enough a Respirgard II\u00aenebulizer (Marquest; Englewood, CO) (BI*).Intravenous (IV) pentamidine is not recommended for prophylaxis unless no other options are available (BII).Discontinuation of PCP prophylaxis should be considered for HIV-infected children when, after receiving combination antiretroviraltherapy for 6 months, CD4 percentage is 15% or CD4 count is 200 cells/mm3for aged 6 years (BII)and CD4 percentageis 15% or CD4 count is aged 1 to <6 years (BII)for >3 consecutive months. Thereafter, CD4 percentageand CD4 count should be reevaluated at least every 3 months and prophylaxis reinstituted if the age-specific criteria for prophylaxis arereached (BIII).TreatmentTMP-SMX, administered IV, is the recommended treatment for PCP (AI). As the acute pneumonitis subsides, children with mild-to-moderate disease who do not have malabsorption or diarrhea can be transitioned to oral treatment with the same total daily dose ofTMP-SMX administered in 3 or 4 divided doses to complete a 21-day course (AII).IV pentamidine isethionate once daily is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX or who demonstrate clinical treatmentfailure after 5 to 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy (AI*).Atovaquone is an alternative for treatment of mild-to-moderately severe PCP (BI*).Dapsone/TMP is effective in treating mild-to-moderate PCP (BI*).Clindamycin/primaquine has been used to treat mild-to-moderate PCP; data in children are unavailable (BIII).A short course of corticosteroids is recommended in cases of moderate or severe PCP , starting within 72 hours of diagnosis (AI*).Patients who have experienced an episode of PCP should continue on PCP prophylaxis after completion of treatment until CD4 countsexceed the threshold for initiating prophylaxis (AI).Children who present with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with PCP after discontinuation of prophylaxis should be evaluatedthoroughly despite normal or high CD4 counts or percentages (BI*).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or morewell-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data inchildrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-2EpidemiologyPneumocystisspp. are found worldwide in the lungs of humans and lower animals. The organisms are hostspecific, and cross-infection between humans and other species does not occur. Pneumocystisspp. from allsources are morphologically, tinctorially, and biologically similar, but surface antigens and gene sequencinghave demonstrated host-specific differences. Since the original designation of Pneumocystiscariniia centuryago, several changes in terminology have been suggested. The most recent proposal was to change P . cariniito Pneumocystisjiroveciifor isolates from human lungs. Pneumocystishas been designated a fungus on thebasis of DNA analysis, but it has several biologic features of protozoa. Most humans are infected withPneumocystisearly in life. By ages 2 to 4 years, more than 80% of children in most countries have acquiredantibodies to Pneumocystis.1-3Immunocompetent infants with the infection are either asymptomatic or havemild respiratory symptoms. Pneumocystisjiroveciipneumonia (PCP) occurs almost exclusively in theimmunocompromised host.PCP remains an important AIDS-indicator disease among HIV-infected children. The highest incidence ofPCP in HIV-infected children is in the first year of life, with cases peaking at ages 3 to 6 months.4-6Datafrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pediatric Spectrum of Disease Project (1994-2001)indicate a decline in PCP infection rates (cases per 1000 HIV-infected children) from 25 in 1994 to 18 in1996 to 6 in 2001.7Similarly, analyses of data from the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Studyrevealed a 95% decline in PCP (cases per 100 child-years) from 5.8(pre-combination antiretroviral therapy[cART] era) to 0.3 (cART era).8Finally, the incidence rate for PCP (cases per 100 child-years) was 1.3during the pre-cART era (1981-1988) and <0.5 during the cART era (2001-2004).9This decline probablyresulted from implementation of interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV , introductionof cART in HIV-infected children in 1995, and chemoprophylaxis for PCP.PCP continues to be a major cause of death among HIV-infected infants and children in the developing world.Autopsies done in Africa revealed PCP in 16% of children who died with HIV/AIDS during 1992 and 1993,10in 29% of those who died during 1997 and 2000,11and in 44% of those who died during 2000 and 2001.12The mode of transmission of Pneumocystisamong HIV-infected infants, children, and adults is not firmlyestablished, but airborne human-to-human transmission is likely. Animal studies show Pneumocystisistransmitted by air from infected to susceptible rats.13,14Furthermore, Pneumocystiscan infect normal mice,produce subclinical disease and be transmitted to normal or immunocompromised mice.15Human-to-humantransmission has been suggested by molecular epidemiology and global clustering of PCP cases in recentstudies.16-18Intrauterine transmission is considered rare. However, in one report, 1 of 8 infants born towomen who had AIDS and PCP during pregnancy had evidence of Pneumocystisinfection.19The single most important factor in susceptibility of HIV-infected patients of all ages to PCP is the status ofcell-mediated immunity of the host. Severe compromise, reflected by a marked decrease in CD4 Tlymphocyte (CD4) cell count and percentage, is the hallmark of high risk for PCP and is discussed further inthe prevention section.Clinical ManifestationsProminent clinical features of PCP among HIV-infected children are fever, tachypnea, dyspnea, and cough. Theseverity of these signs and symptoms varies from child to child. Onset can be abrupt or insidious withnonspecific symptoms such as mild cough, dyspnea, poor feeding, diarrhea, and weight loss. Some patientsmay not be febrile, but almost all will have tachypnea by the time pneumonitis is evident on chest radiograph.Physical examination sometimes shows bilateral basilar rales with evidence of respiratory distress and hypoxia.In HIV-infected children with pneumonia, four clinical variables are independently associated with PCP:aged <6 months, respiratory rate >59 breaths per minute, arterial percentage hemoglobin saturation 92%,and absence of vomiting.20A high plasma HIV RNA concentration strongly predicts PCP and otheropportunistic infections (OIs).21Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-3Extrapulmonary Pneumocystisorganisms, often associated with a localized inflammatory reaction, are foundin <2.5% of HIV-infected adults and children.22,23This can occur without concurrent PCP and can be locatedat multiple noncontiguous sites. Involved sites have included ear, eye, thyroid, spleen, gastrointestinal (GI)tract, peritoneum, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, transverse colon, liver, and pancreas. Less frequentlyinvolved sites include adrenal glands, muscle, bone marrow, heart, kidney, ureter, lymph nodes, meninges,and cerebral cortex.DiagnosisMost children with PCP have hypoxia with arterial <15% and CD4 counts are usually <200 cells/mm3in children aged 6 years and older. Lactic dehydrogenase is often increased, but this is not specific forPCP. Serum albumin may be depressed. Chest radiographs most commonly reveal bilateral diffuseparenchymal infiltrates with \"ground-glass\" or reticulogranular appearance, but they also can be normal orhave only mild parenchymal infiltrates. The earliest infiltrates are perihilar, progressing peripherally diagnosis of PCP requires demonstration of the organism in pulmonary tissues or fluids in thepresence of pneumonitis. Diagnostic procedures are the same as for adults suspected of having PCP (seeGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults),24but someprocedures may be more difficult to perform in children.Induced sputum analysis, during which the patient produces sputum after inhalation of nebulized 3%hypertonic saline, may be difficult in children aged <2 years because of small airways and poor ability toproduce sputum. Complications from the procedure include nausea, vomiting, and bronchospasm. Sensitivityof sputum analysis in adults ranges from 25% to 90%. After a negative induced sputum sample, abronchoalveolar lavage may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.Nasogastric aspirates, if positive, are of diagnostic value. Pneumocystisorganisms were found in 48.6% ofHIV-infected children with respiratory illnesses in whom gastric aspirates were obtained on three consecutivemornings.25Other studies have shown the organism only found in gastric contents of patients with PCP.26Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is the diagnostic procedure of choice for most infants andchildren. Sensitivity ranges from 55% to 97% and results may be positive for 72 hours after initiation ofPCP treatment; treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results. Complications include hemoptysis,pneumothorax, transient increase in hypoxemia, a transient increase in pulmonary infiltrates at the lavagesite, and post-bronchoscopy fever.Fiberoptic lavage isnegative or non-diagnostic despite a clinical picture consistent with PCP. Sensitivity is 87% to 95%, andcysts can typically be identified up to 10 days after initiation of treatment. Complications includepneumothorax and hemorrhage; this procedure is contraindicated in children with thrombocytopenia.Open-lung biopsy is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic technique, but not recommended routinelybecause it requires thoracotomy and often chest tube drainage. It has the advantage of revealing the type andextent of disease as well as the organism. Histopathology shows alveoli filled with eosinophilic, acellular,proteinaceous material that contains and but few inflammatory cells. Complicationsinclude pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and hemorrhage.Three types of stains can be used to identify Pneumocystisorganisms in specimens. Gomori methenamine-silver method stains the cyst wall brown or black. Toluidine blue stains the cyst wall blue or lavender. Bothmethods stain fungal elements. Giemsa, Diff-Quick\u00ae, and Wright stains depict the trophozoites andintracystic sporozoites pale blue with a punctate red nucleus, but unlike other stains, these do not stain theGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-4cyst wall. Monoclonal immunofluorescent Inc.;Cincinnati, OH) that identify the cyst wall also can be used for diagnosis and have enhanced specificity andsensitivity compared with the other staining methods. A cyst wall, trophozoite, and immunofluorescentantibody stain is recommended for each specimen studied.Polymerase chain reaction assays to amplify the human PneumocystisMSG/gpA gene, mitochondrial largesubunit (mtLSU) RNA, the dihydropteroate synthase gene, and the internal transcribed spacer region geneshave been developed for diagnostic evaluation. These tests are usually more sensitive but less specific thanmicroscopic methods and are not standardized or available in most centers.27,28Pneumocystis-specific DNA isfound in 18% of bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients without clinical PCP, HIV , or other infections.29Coinfection with other organisms such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or pneumococcus has been reported inHIV-infected children.6,30,31Children with dual infections may have more severe disease. Although CMV inlung secretions of children with PCP indicates colonization, it usually does not require therapy in the absenceof histopathologic evidence of invasive CMV disease.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureClinical data are unavailable upon which to make a decision regarding isolation of patients with PCP.However, animal model experiments, which generally provide an accurate demonstration of thepathophysiology seen in humans, suggest that transmission occurs easily; therefore, isolation should bestrongly considered (AIII).32Immunocompromised patients who are compliant with PCP prophylaxis,especially with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), are unlikely to acquire PCP. However, someexperts still suggest that such at-risk patients not be placed in a room with another patient with PCP. Cautionis also advised in having an at-risk patient share a room with another patient with an undiagnosed respiratoryillness that could be PCP (AIII). This is especially true of respiratory illnesses occurring during the first 2 years of life when 85% of children undergo a primary infection with Pneumocystis.1Preventing First Episode of DiseaseChemoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing PCP. Criteria for its use are based on a patient's age andCD4 count or percentage.33Prophylaxis is recommended for all HIV-infected children aged 6 years whohave CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3or CD4 percentage <15%, with CD4 counts<500 cells/mm3or CD4 percentage <15%, all HIV-infected aged <12 months regardless ofCD4 count or percentage (AII).33Infants born to HIV-infected mothers should be considered for prophylaxis beginning at 4 to 6 weeks of age.HIV-infected infants should be administered prophylaxis until age 1 year, at which time they should bereassessed on the basis of the age-specific CD4 count or percentage thresholds mentioned previously (AII).34Infants with indeterminate HIV infection status should receive prophylaxis until they are determined to bedefinitively HIV-uninfected34or presumptively HIV-uninfected (AIII).35-37Prophylaxis is not recommendedfor infants who criteria for being definitively or presumptively HIV-uninfected. In non-breastfeedinginfants with no positive HIV virologic test results, presumptive exclusion of HIV infection can be based ontwo negative virologic test results, one obtained at 2 weeks and one obtained at 4 weeks of age; onenegative virologic test result obtained at 8 weeks of age; or one negative HIV-antibody test result obtainedat 6 months of age. Definitive exclusion of HIV infection is based on two negative virologic test results: 1obtained at 1 month of age and one obtained at 4 months of age, or on 2 negative HIV-antibody test resultsfrom separate specimens obtained at 6 months of age. For both presumptive and definitive exclusion ofinfection, a child should have no other laboratory (e.g., no positive virologic test results) or clinicalconditions (e.g., no AIDS-defining conditions that cannot be explained on the basis of other causes ofimmunosuppression) or evidence of HIV infection.35-37Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-5Four drug regimens have been found effective and relatively safe for preventing PCP in high-risk HIV-infected children and adults.TMP-SMX (cotrimoxazole) is the drug of choice for prophylaxis because of its high efficacy, relative safety,low cost, and broad antimicrobial spectrum (AI).38-40TMP alone has little, if any, anti-Pneumocystisactivity,but it enhances the activity of the sulfonamide. The prophylactic dosage is 150 mg/m2body surface area perday TMP and 750 mg/m2body surface area per day SMX 5.0-10 mg/kg body weight per dayTMP and 25-50 body weight per day SMX; dosing on component) administered orallyeither every 25-50 mg/kg body weight/doseonce daily SMX) or on consecutive per week mg/kg body weight/dose TMP and 12.5-25mg/kg body weight/dose SMX twice per day)42or every other day (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday). Thetotal daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX. In patients with impaired renal function,a reduced dose may be necessary.TMP-SMX, preferably given daily, also is effective in preventing toxoplasmosis43and some bacterialinfections (e.g., Salmonella, Haemophilus, Staphylococcus).41,44-46Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in Pneumocystisfrom have been observed with TMP-SMX and dapsone prophylaxis, suggestive of possible drug resistance, but studies for clinical correlates havenot provided conclusive results.27More apparent is the association of prolonged TMP-SMX prophylaxis forPCP with the emergence of TMP-SMX resistant bacterial species due to selective pressure, a point to beconsidered in managing bacterial infections in patients receiving prophylaxis.47,48Other effective and safe prophylaxis regimens are available for patients unable to take TMP-SMX. A secondchoice would be either atovaquone (AI)49or dapsone (BI*).39Atovaquone is effective and safe but expensive.Dapsone is effective and inexpensive but associated with more serious adverse effects than atovaquone.Atovaquone is administered with a meal as an oral yellow suspension as a single daily dose of 30 mg/kg bodyweight/day for patients aged 1 to 3 months and >24 months to 12 years, as 45 mg/kg body weight/day forinfants aged >3 months to 24 months,50and as 1500 mg (10 cc) for adolescents and adults aged 13 years(BI*).39,40Outcomes with atovaquone equaled those of dapsone for the prevention of PCP in patients with HIVinfection who cannot tolerate trimethoprim, sulfonamides, or both.39Unlike TMP-SMX, effective against Toxoplasma gondii. Azithromycin, in a single dosage of 5.0 mg/kgbody weight/day, has been used to supplement atovaquone for greater broad-spectrum prophylaxis. Therandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (PACTG) 254compared TMP-SMX and atovaquone plus azithromycin for 366 HIV-infected childrenqualifying for PCP prophylaxis.49Results showed atovaquone-azithromycin to be as effective as TMP-SMX forpreventing serious bacterial infections, as well as PCP.Dapsone can be administered on a daily or weekly schedule as 2.0 mg/kg body weight/day (maximum totaldosage 100 mg/day) or 4.0 total dosage 200 mg/week) orally (AI).51Approximately two-thirds of patients intolerant to TMP-SMX can take dapsone successfully. Studies inadults show dapsone is as effective as atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine but slightly less effective thanTMP-SMX.39,50Aerosolized pentamidine is recommended for children who cannot take TMP-SMX, atovaquone, or dapsoneand are old enough to use nebulization with a Respirgard II\u00aenebulizer (Marquest; Englewood, CO) (BI*).33The dosage for all ages is 300 mg once a month.45Adverse reactions in HIV-infected children include cough,sneezing, and bronchospasm.52Atypical systemic presentations of PCP can occur in children on aerosolizedpentamidine. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (Fansidar\u00ae) also is recognized as an effective prophylactic regimen in adults(CIII).53Although this drug was effective in preventing PCP in Iranian orphanages in the 1960s, it has notbeen evaluated adequately in HIV-infected children.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-6Intravenous (IV) pentamidine can be considered in children older than age 2 years when other options areunavailable (BII*).54Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisStudies of HIV-infected adults and children following immune reconstitution after receipt of cARTdemonstrate acceptably low risks for PCP after discontinuation of prophylaxis.55-60Data from the PACTG1008 study evaluated 235 HIV-infected children and adolescents on antiretroviral therapy who received PCPprophylaxis for 6 months and achieved CD4 percentages 20% for patients aged >6 years and 25% forpatients aged 2 to 6 years, after which the prophylaxis was stopped.55At median follow-up of 2.5 years (547person-years), no cases of PCP occurred in children not receiving prophylaxis; 9.4% of patients enrolledrequired reinstitution of PCP prophylaxis because of low CD4 counts during the observation period. Thesedata, along with data from studies in adults, support the expectation for very low risk for PCP afterprophylaxis is discontinued in children who have achieved immune reconstitution.Discontinuation of PCP prophylaxis should be considered for HIV-infected children when, after receivingcART for 6 months, CD4 percentage is 15% or CD4 count is 200 cells/mm3for patients aged 6 years(BII)and CD4 percentage is 15% or CD4 count is 500 cells/mm3for patients aged 1 to <6 years (BII)for>3 consecutive months.55,61Subsequently, the CD4 percentage and CD4 count should be reevaluated at least every 3 months andprophylaxis reinstituted if the original criteria for prophylaxis are reached (BIII). PCP prophylaxis DiseaseTMP-SMX is the recommended for PCP (AI).38,63,64The dose for HIV-infected children aged >2 months is 3.75 to 5 mg/kg body weight/dose of the TMP component and 19 to 25 mg/kg body weight/doseof the SMX component administered IV every 6 hours, with each IV dose infused over 1 hour for 21 days(AI).62As the acute pneumonitis subsides, children with mild to moderate disease who do not havemalabsorption or diarrhea can be transitioned to oral treatment with the same total daily dose of TMP-SMXadministered in 3 or 4 divided doses to complete a 21-day course (AII).62Effective therapeutic serumconcentrations of 5 to 10 \u00b5g/mL TMP can be reached with the recommended dose administered orally in HIV-infected children.65IV pentamidine isethionate (4 mg/kg body weight) once daily is recommended for patients who cannottolerate TMP-SMX or who demonstrate clinical treatment failure after 5 to 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy(AI*).62,66,67No evidence exists for synergistic or additive effects on efficacy of these agents;68therefore,because of potential increased toxicity, their combined use is not recommended (BIII).62In patients withclinical improvement after 7 to 10 days of IV therapy with pentamidine, an oral regimen (i.e., atovaquone[BI] or TMP/dapsone [CIII]) can be considered to complete a 21-day course.62Atovaquone is an alternative for treatment of mild to moderately severe PCP in adults (BI).39,63,69The dosagefor adolescents aged 13 years is 750 mg/dose (5 mL) administered orally twice daily with food.39,63,69-71Therapeutic data are limited for children, but based on studies of prophylaxis, the primary dosage for children<3 months and >24 months to 12 years of age is 30 to 40 mg/kg body weight/dose administered orally once aday with food, and for children aged 2 to 24 months of age is a higher dose of 45 mg/kg body weight/dose oncedaily (BI*).49,50Based on adult studies that use twice-daily dosing, some experts also use an alternate dosingregimen for children <3 months and >24 months to age 12 years of 15 to 20 mg/kg body weight/doseadministered orally twice daily with food, and for children aged 2 to 24 months, a dose of 22.5 mg/kg bodyweight/dose twice daily with food (CIII). Food increases the bioavailability of atovaquone approximatelythreefold compared with that achieved with the fasting state. Atovaquone concentration increases with co-Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-7administration of fluconazole opiates,cephalosporins, rifampin, and benzodiazepines. Some experts suggest desensitizing the patient to allow for useof TMP-SMX.Dapsone/TMP is effective in treating mild-to-moderate PCP in adults (BI);72data on toxicity and efficacyamong children are limited. The dosage of dapsone for adolescents and adults is 100 mg (total dose)/doseorally once daily and TMP 5 mg/kg body weight/dose three times per day administered for 21 days. In childrenaged <13 years, a dapsone dosage of 2 mg/kg body weight/dose once daily is required to achieve therapeuticlevels (AI).73The pediatric dose of TMP is 5 mg/kg body weight/day/dose three times per day. Dapsone is lesseffective than the combination.74Clindamycin/primaquine has been found to be effective in treating mild tomoderate PCP in adults but can be considered as an alternative therapy for PCP in children despite lack ofpediatric data. (CIII). Primaquine is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiencybecause of the possibility of inducing hemolytic anemia. Dosing information for treating PCP is available onlyfor adults. For patients who weigh >60 kg, clindamycin 600 mg IV every 6 hours for 10 days, then 300 to 450mg orally every 6 hours to complete 21 days of treatment, is recommended. Primaquine is administered as 30mg of base orally for 21 days. Dosing for children is based on use of these drugs for treating other infections;the usual pediatric dose of clindamycin for treating bacterial infection is 10 mg/kg body weight/dose every 6 hours, and the pediatric dose of primaquine equivalent to an adult dose of 20 mg base (when used formalaria) is 0.3 mg/kg body weight/day of the base.On the basis of studies in both adults75-79and children,80a short course of corticosteroids is recommended incases of moderate or severe PCP, starting within 72 hours of diagnosis (AI*). Pediatric studies have indicatedreduced acute respiratory failure, decreased need for ventilation, and decreased mortality with early use ofcorticosteroids in HIV-infected children who have PCP.80-82Indications for corticosteroid treatment include aPaO2value of <70 mm Hg or an alveolar-arterial gradient of >35 mm Hg. Doses for children vary betweenstudies. A commonly used scheme is prednisone 1 mg/kg of body weight/dose twice daily on days 1 through5; 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 6 through 10; and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose once daily on days11 through 21. Alternative regimens include: 1.Adult dosage of prednisone: 40 mg/dose twice daily on days 1 through 5; 40 mg/dose once daily on days6 through 10; 20 mg/dose once daily on days 11 through 21, and 2.Methylprednisolone IV 1 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours on days 1 through 7; 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily ondays 8 through 9; 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 10 and 11; and 1 mg/kg/dose once daily on days12-16.Some case reports have documented improved pulmonary function with use of surfactant in cases of severedisease such as respiratory distress syndrome with established respiratory failure requiring ventilation.83-85Alterations in surfactant function and composition have been demonstrated in HIV-infected adults withPCP.86Data are insufficient to recommend surfactant administration for PCP in children.Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)Clinical parameters for monitoring disease status include temperature, respiratory rate, arterial oxygensaturation, and chest radiograph.87Clinical improvement can be expected at a mean of approximately 4.5 \u00b1 2.5days and radiographic improvement at approximately 7.7 \u00b1 4.5 days.87Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been less frequently associated with Pneumocystisinfection (2% of 44 adults with IRIS) than with several other OIs in HIV-infected adults and children.88Whether this low rate is related to PCP prophylaxis is unknown.In children, adverse reactions to TMP-SMX include rash (mild maculopapular in most cases but rarelyerythema and hematologic abnormalities (e.g., neutropenia,thrombocytopenia, megaloblastic or aplastic anemia), GI complaints (usually mild), hepatitis, and renaldisorders (e.g., interstitial nephritis).89,90Data from a PACTG study of HIV-infected children at high risk ofGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-8PCP receiving TMP-SMX for a median of 3 years showed 28% had a rash, 9.3% had neutropenia, 8.8% hadthrombocytopenia, and 2.2% had anemia.49None were fatal or irreversible reactions. Some very mildreactions will resolve while the drug is continued. With any significant adverse effect, TMP-SMX should bewithheld until the reaction has subsided. Based on adult randomized clinical trials, unless the reaction hasbeen life-threatening, TMP-SMX prophylaxis can be resumed in children, preferably by beginning with lowdesensitizing daily doses and gradually increasing to therapeutic dosing (CIII).91,92In adults, 75% of patientsaffected tolerated re-challenge with TMP-SMX.92The overall frequency of adverse reactions appears to belower in HIV-infected children than in adults; approximately 15% of children have substantial adversereactions to TMP-SMX.57If an urticarial rash or SJS occurs, TMP-SMX should be discontinued and not re-administered (AIII).89,90,92The most common adverse drug reaction to pentamidine isethionate is renal toxicity, which usually occursafter 2 weeks of therapy and can be averted by adequate hydration and careful monitoring of renal functionand electrolytes. Severe hypotension (particularly if infused rapidly), prolonged QT interval (torsades depointes), and cardiac arrhythmias can occur. Hypoglycemia after days of therapy) hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, pancreatitis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus also havebeen reported. Patients may report a metallic or bitter taste. Serious adverse reactions to pentamidine havebeen reported in approximately 17% of children receiving the drug.93This drug should not be administeredwith other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, associated with pancreatitis (e.g., didanosine).With dapsone and TMP, the primary adverse reaction is reversible neutropenia; other reactions include skinrashes, elevated serum transaminases, methemoglobinemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.72,74Dapsone isthe problematic component of the combination and accounts for most of the adverse reactions.50Skin rashes (10%-15%), nausea, and diarrhea can occur with atovaquone administration. Liver enzymes mayincrease briefly. No serious toxicity or fatality has been demonstrated from use of atovaquone in adults orchildren.Adverse reactions to clindamycin/primaquine include skin rash, nausea, and diarrhea.Managing Treatment FailureOccasionally an inflammatory reaction, thought to be due to antibiotic-induced killing of the organism in thelungs, can result in an initial early and reversible deterioration during the first 3 to 5 days of therapy, so anadequate trial of therapy is needed before switching drugs because of lack of clinical improvement. Clinicalfailure is defined by lack of improvement or worsening of respiratory function documented by arterial bloodgases after at least 4 to 8 days of anti-PCP treatment. Other concomitant infections need to be excluded ascauses of clinical failure. With evidence of treatment failure after the use of TMP-SMX, therapy can bechanged. If tolerated, pentamidine isethionate is the drug of next choice (AI*).94,95No evidence exists forsynergistic or additive therapeutic effects; therefore, because of potential increased toxicity, theircombination is not recommended.Preventing RecurrenceNone of the drugs administered to treat and prevent PCP completely eliminates Pneumocystis, andprophylaxis is effective only while the selected drug is administered. Patients who have experienced anepisode of PCP should remain on a prophylactic regimen after completion of treatment unless they meetcriteria for discontinuing secondary prophylaxis (AIII).95Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisIn most patients, secondary prophylaxis can be discontinued using the same criteria as for discontinuingprimary prophylaxis. PCP prophylaxis is not to be discontinued in HIV-infected infants aged <1 year.Children who present with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with PCP after discontinuation ofGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenW-9prophylaxis should be evaluated thoroughly despite normal or high CD4 counts or percentages (AIII).96IfPCP recurs at a CD4 count 200 cells/mm3, lifelong be administered (CIII).

Not all patients withPML have severe immune dysfunction, however, and PML has been reported in HIV-infected patients withhigh CD4 counts who are receiving successful combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). PML is caused by JC virus (JCV), a ubiquitous polyomavirus, named using the initials of the patient, JohnCunningham, from whom it was first isolated. Most humans are infected with JCV early in life; in aseroepidemiology study, 50% of Swedish children were seropositive for JCV by ages 9 to 11 years, and 72%of adult women aged 25 years in the Finnish Maternity Cohort were JCV seropositive.2The exact mode oftransmission of JCV between individuals is unknown. Because the virus is commonly detected in urine, JCVhas been detected in sewage effluent. It is also detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of bothhealthy and immunocompromised individuals. Vertical transmission from mother to newborn also has beendocumented.3,4Lymphocytes, renal tubular epithelium, bone marrow, and possibly spleen and lymphoidtissue likely represent sites of viral latency, and lymphocytes also may be a vehicle for spread of the virus toother organ systems, including the CNS.5,6The evolution of asymptomatic infection with JCV to symptomatic PML probably involves a series of eventsthat are both virologic and immunologic. The original infecting strain of JCV\u2014the strain that is commonlydetected in urine and blood\u2014mutates and alters a regulatory gene through rearrangement of a non-codingregion (at-NCCR to rr-NCCR) to become a neurotropic strain of JCV capable of replicating in neuronal glialcells.7Failed immune surveillance allows replicating virus to persist in peripheral blood cells and serum. Ifthe neurotropic form of JCV gains entry into the brain, it can then establish a productive infection inoligodendrocyte cells, which leads to PML in the absence of proper CNS immune surveillance.8Serotoninreceptor 5-HT(2a) appears important for JCV infection of brain glial cells.9Recently, in HIV-uninfectedadults, an increased incidence of PML has been associated with use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies,Panel's RecommendationsThe main approach to treatment of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is treatment with an effectiveantiretroviral regimen that for treatment of PML (BIII). Immunomodulatory approaches, such as interferon alfa, are not routinely recommended for treatment of PML (BIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenX-2including natalizumab (an alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 7 antagonist that targets activated lymphocytes),efalizumab (an anti CD-11a antibody that targets T-lymphocytes), rituximab CD-20 antibody thattargets B-lymphocytes), and alemtuzumab (an anti-CD52 antibody that depletes both T and B cells).8,10-12PML is an AIDS-defining illness in HIV-infected individuals. It has rarely been seen in reports from largeseries of HIV-infected children,13-15but cases have been reported in children with a wide range of ages and abroad geographical distribution.16-22The incidence of PML has decreased from 3.3 cases per 1000 person-years at risk during the era before cART, to 1.3 cases per 1000 person-years after the introduction of cART.23During the pre-cART era, survival was extremely poor in adults and children with PML.15Survival amongadults has improved during the cART era24-26from 10% to 50%, and mean survival time from time ofdiagnosis of PML has increased from 0.4 years to 1.8 years.27No comparable data exist for children.Clinical ManifestationsNo symptoms are known to be associated with acute or latent JCV infection. Asymptomatic urinary sheddingis common. PML is the primary disease caused by JCV and clinical manifestations in children are similar tothose in adults. The disease has an insidious onset and produces a neurologic syndrome that steadilyprogresses over weeks or months, characterized by confusion, disorientation, lack of energy, loss of balance,cognitive dysfunction, dementia, seizures, ataxia, aphasia, cranial nerve deficits, visual abnormalities(blurred or double vision or loss of vision), hemiparesis or quadriparesis, and eventually coma. Demyelination is at first patchy, involving subcortical regions, and then spreads to deep white matter in aconfluent pattern; thus, PML initially may present with focal neurologic deficits that involve different brainregions. DiagnosisThe established criteria for clinical diagnosis are focal signs and symptoms on neurologic examination, focalwhite matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) without masseffect, and exclusion of other causes of the clinical and neuroradiologic findings.28A confirmed diagnosis ofPML requires a compatible clinical syndrome and radiographic findings, coupled with brain biopsydemonstrating a characteristic triad of pathologic foci of demyelination, enlarged hyperchromaticoligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei and basophilic-staining intranuclear material, and enlarged astrocyteswith bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei. When only two of these features are present, JCV can be demonstratedby in situhybridization or by electron microscopy for definitive diagnosis.Brain biopsy remains the gold standard confirmatory test for diagnosis of PML, but brain imaging with MRIor CT can reveal characteristic lesions. The radiologic features of PML are typically non-inflammatory(unless associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [IRIS] related to initiation of cART).Typical CT abnormalities include single or multiple hypodense, non-enhancing cerebral white matter lesions;cerebellum and brain stem occasionally are involved. MRI may be more sensitive for detecting changes inthe brain associated with PML, and may be positive before JCV DNA is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF). MRI depicts white matter lesions of low T1 signal intensity and high proton density on T2-weightedimages with absence of edema or mass effect. Post-contrast enhancement is unusual, and when present,usually is sparse, with a thin or reticulated appearance adjacent to the edge of the lesions.PML diagnosis is now facilitated by use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect JCV DNA inCSF, which may obviate the need for brain biopsy in patients with a compatible clinical syndrome andradiographic findings. Nested JCV DNA PCR on CSF is highly sensitive (90%-100%) and specific (92%-100%) for PML in adults, and in the absence of comparative data for children, similar performancecharacteristics are anticipated but not proven in that population.29False-negative tests occur, however, andPML may be present and diagnosed by brain biopsy in patients with a negative JCV DNA PCR test in theCSF. Measurement of JCV DNA levels in CSF samples can be a useful virologic marker for managing PMLGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenX-3in patients receiving cART.30With the advent of multiple modalities to support PML diagnosis, diagnosticcriteria can be stratified according to the following terminology and levels of certainty of diagnosis: Biopsy-confirmed PML:JCV antigens detected by immunohistochemistry, JCV in situnucleic acid hybridization, or JC virions detected by electron microscopy in brain tissue obtained bycerebral biopsy, associated with typical histology, in patients with typical clinical and radiologicalfindingsLaboratory-confirmed PML:JCV DNA detected by PCR of CSF in patients with typical, clinical, andradiological findings (detection of intrathecal antibody production may also support the diagnosis)Possible PML:Patients with typical clinical and radiological findings, without virologic or histologicconfirmation in brain tissue or CSF.31,32Presence of antibodies to JCV in the serum or presence of JCV DNA in the blood or urine of patients does notestablish the diagnosis of PML because these studies can be positive in individuals without PML. Conversely,while most patients with JCV-associated PML have moderate to high anti-JCV antibodies and JCV DNA intheir peripheral blood, serum, and CSF, some patients with PML diagnosed by brain biopsy will not havedetectable anti-JCV antibody or JCV DNA in their blood or CSF. Most patients with JCV-associated PML,however, have moderate to high anti-JCV antibodies and JCV DNA in their peripheral blood, serum, and CSF.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureThere is no known way to prevent exposure to JCV .Preventing First Episode of DiseaseUse of cART can prevent or reverse the severe immunosuppression that increases the risk of PML. Incidenceof PML has decreased in the cART era. There are no means of preventing PML in severelyimmunosuppressed individuals. Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNo means of primary prophylaxis of JCV infection or development of PML have been demonstrated.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseaseNo effective specific therapy has been established for JCV infection or PML. Survival in HIV-infected adultswith PML has substantially improved during the post-cART era, with an increase in median survival from 14to 64 weeks.27,33A CD4 count >100 cells/mm3at PML diagnosis is associated with improved survival, anduse of cART after diagnosis of PML is strongly associated with improved survival.33Thus, the mainapproach to treatment involves optimizing cART to reverse the immunosuppression that interferes withnormal host response to this virus (AII).A number of agents have been proposed or reported anecdotally as more specific treatments for PML, butnone has proven effective after greater scrutiny or more extensive study. In a randomized, open-label trial ofintravenous (IV) open-label trial of IVcidofovir,35neither drug was effective in producing clinical improvement of PML in HIV-infected adults, andneither agent is routinely recommended (BIII). Immunomodulatory approaches such as interferon-alfa (IFN-) also have been described in case reports in HIV-infected adults; however, none have been studied in acontrolled clinical trial and, in one analysis, these approaches did not provide any benefit beyond that withcART.36Thus, they are also not routinely recommended (BIII). Anecdotal reports have been published aboutGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenX-4use of mirtazapine of immunosuppressive therapy, to treat PML in HIV-uninfected adults who developed the diseasewhile on immunosuppressive therapy. While the results with this adjunctive treatment are encouraging, thereis insufficient evidence to recommend it at this time.31,37,38In addition, recent in vitrostudies have shown thatCMX001, an investigational oral ester form of cidofovir, suppresses JCV replication in human brain cellcultures, and the compound may be evaluated in clinical trials in the near future.39,40No therapeutic trialshave been conducted in children. Monitoring and Adverse Events, Including IRISPatients may develop PML before starting cART or may manifest PML as an unmasking IRIS event afterimmune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Neurologic stability or improvement and prolongedsurvival are associated with reduced levels of JCV DNA in CSF, appearance of JCV-specific antibody inCSF, and presence of JCV-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses in patients receiving cART.41After cART is initiated and CD4 counts rise, some patients will experience neurologic improvement; however,reports have documented worsening neurologic manifestations after initiation of ART.26Clinical worseningmay represent the natural history of PML in these patients. However, this apparent worsening may also be aparadoxical reaction from inflammatory responses to JCV potentiated by cART-induced immune reconstitution,called IRIS,26,42-44examples of which have occurred in children.45The underlying mechanism of cART-associated PML IRIS is controversial. One hypothesis is that a reduction in inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IFN-and interleukin-12) after cART promotes JCV re-activation within the brain or increases trafficking of JCV-infected peripheral lymphocytes into the brain.46Another possibility is that JCV infection occurringcoincidental to cART initiation results in a beneficial inflammatory response, with lack of diseaseprogression.46This may be particularly likely in cases of perinatal HIV infection, because JCV acquisition ismost common early in life. The overall prevalence of PML-associated IRIS in children is unknown.Inflammatory PML should be suspected in cART-treated children with advanced HIV who show acuteneurologic deterioration and contrast-enhancing demyelinating lesions on MRI, even if immunological andvirological measures show improvement in HIV status.22Retrospective data suggest that early and prolongedtreatment with steroids may be beneficial for some patients in whom immune reconstitution with ART activatesan inflammatory response to JCV . No clinical trial data exist, however, to substantiate the anecdotal evidence.47Managing Treatment FailurePML remission with cART may take several weeks, and no criteria exist that define progression of disease. Aworking definition of treatment failure used for HIV-infected adults is continued clinical worsening andcontinued detection of CSF JCV DNA at 3 months (see Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment ofOpportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults).48In addition, lack of JCV antibody response or JCV-specific cytotoxic T-cell immune responses are associated with poor prognosis. In some patients, PMLworsens despite cART, either because of IRIS or because of the natural history of PML. Whichever is thecase, cART should be continued. If cART fails to suppress HIV RNA or to increase the CD4 count, thenattention should focus on modifying and optimizing the cART (AII). In HIV-infected children respondingwell to cART but with continued worsening of PML, an expert in pediatric HIV infection should beconsulted for consideration of investigational therapies. Preventing RecurrenceOn the basis of its role in reversing the disease, the main measure for preventing PML recurrence is aneffective cART regimen that suppresses HIV viremia and preserves or restores CD4-defined immunefunction (AII).Discontinuing Secondary ProphylaxisNo methods for secondary prophylaxis of JCV infection or PML have been proven effective.

Note:For comprehensive discussion and recommendations, see Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SexuallyTransmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines, 2010. Treatment for proven or highly probable congenital syphilis is aqueous crystalline penicillin G for 10 days (AII).If congenital syphilis is diagnosed after age 1 month, the dosage of aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be increased pertreatment guidelines (AII).An alternative to aqueous crystalline penicillin G is procaine penicillin G for 10 days (BII).All seroreactive infants (or infants whose mothers were seroreactive at delivery) should receive careful follow-up examinationsand serologic testing (a nontreponemal test) every 2 to 3 months until the test becomes nonreactive or the titer has decreasedfourfold (AIII). Infants whose initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluations are abnormal should undergo repeat lumbar punctureapproximately every 6 months until the results are normal (AII).After treatment of congenital syphilis, children with increasing or stable nontreponemal titers at ages 6 to 12 months should beevaluated (i.e., including a CSF examination) and treated with a 10-day course of parenteral penicillin (AIII).Infants in whom the nontreponemal test is reactive at age 18 months should be fully evaluated or re-evaluated (physical,serological, CSF, radiographic exams) and (AIII).Sexually-Acquired SyphilisEarly SyphilisAcquired syphilis in children and adolescents is treated with a single dose of benzathine penicillin G for early-stage disease (i.e.,primary, secondary, and early latent disease) (AII).HIV-infected children and adolescents with early syphilis (i.e., primary, secondary, early latent) should receive a single dose ofbenzathine penicillin G. Those with primary and secondary syphilis should have clinical and serologic response monitored at 3,6, 9, 12, and 24 months after therapy, and those with early latent syphilis should have clinical and serologic response monitoredat 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after therapy (AIII).(For comprehensive discussion and recommendations, see the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention STD Treatment Guidelines, 2010). Re-treatment of patients with early-stage syphilis (i.e., primary, secondary, early latent) and evaluation for HIV infection isrecommended for those who: Do not experience at least a fourfold decrease in serum nontreponemal test titers 6 to 12 months after therapy,Have a sustained fourfold increase in serum nontreponemal test titers after an initial reduction post-treatment, or Have persistent or recurring clinical signs or symptoms of disease. Individuals whose titers do not decline should at a minimum receive additional clinical and serologic follow-up. If such additionalfollow-up cannot be ensured, re-treatment is recommended. Because occult central nervous system infection may be signaledby persistently elevated serum nontreponemal test titers, evaluation of CSF can be considered in the event of such persistentlyelevated titers (BIII). If initial CSF examination demonstrates pleocytosis, repeat lumbar puncture should be conducted, and then every 6 months untilthe cell count is normal (AIII).Late Latent SyphilisFor late latent disease, 3 doses of benzathine penicillin G should be administered over 3 weeks (AIII).Patients with late-latent syphilis should have CSF examination if they have clinical signs or symptoms attributable to syphilis, afourfold increase in serum nontreponemal test titer, or experience an inadequate serologic response (i.e., less than fourfolddecline in nontreponemal test titer) within 12 to 24 months after therapy if initial titer was high (>1:32) (BIII). CSF examinationGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenY-2Panel's Recommendations, continuedshould also be performed. Treatment for neurosyphilis should be initiated if CSF examination is positive for neurosyphilis.Benzathine penicillin G should be administered at 1-week intervals for 3 weeks to patients in whom CSF examination does notconfirm the diagnosis of neurosyphilis (AIII). NeurosyphilisNeurosyphilis should be treated with aqueous penicillin G for 10 to 14 days (AII).If a patient has signs or symptoms consistent with neurosyphilis, and repeat CSF examination is consistent with CNSinvolvement and cannot be attributable to other ongoing illness, re-treatment for neurosyphilis is recommended (AIII);Re-treatment of neurosyphilis should be considered if the CSF white blood cell count has not decreased 6 months aftercompletion of treatment or if the CSF white blood cell count or protein is not normal 2 years after treatment (BIII).For All SyphilisFor penicillin-allergic patients or for a discussion of alternative therapies such as doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or azithromycin,please see pages 30, 34, and 38 of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD Treatment Guidelines, 2010.Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsEpidemiologyTreponema pallidumcan be transmitted from mother to child at any stage of pregnancy or during delivery.Among women with untreated primary, secondary, early latent (lacking clinical manifestations within firstyear after infection), or late latent (lacking clinical manifestations >1 year since infection) syphilis atdelivery, approximately 30%, 60%, 40%, and 7% of infants, respectively, will be infected. Treatment of themother for syphilis 30 days before delivery is required for effective in uterotreatment.Congenital syphilis has been reported despite adequate maternal treatment. Factors that contribute totreatment failure include maternal stage of syphilis (early stage, including primary, secondary, or early latentsyphilis), advancing gestational age at treatment, higher nontreponemal titers at treatment and delivery, andshort interval from treatment to delivery (<30 days).1,2Since 1991, rates of congenital syphilis have trendeddownward 92% to 8.5 cases per 100,000 live births in 2011.3The continuing decline in the rate of congenitalsyphilis probably reflects the substantially reduced rate of primary and secondary syphilis in women duringthe last decade.Drug use during pregnancy, particularly cocaine use, has been associated with increased risk of maternalsyphilis and congenital infection.4Similarly, HIV-infected women have a higher prevalence of untreated orinadequately treated syphilis during pregnancy, which places their newborns at higher risk of congenitalsyphilis.5Rates of mother-to-child HIV transmission may be higher when syphilis coinfection is presentduring pregnancy.5-7Risk of HIV transmission does not appear to be higher in mothers whose syphilis iseffectively treated before pregnancy.5Although individuals aged 15 to 24 represent one-quarter of the ever-sexually-active population aged 15 to44, approximately half of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosed annually in the United States occurin individuals aged 15 to 24 years.8,9Furthermore, individuals in this age group accounted for 28% ofprimary and secondary syphilis cases during 2011.3In 2011, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis wasGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenY-3highest among individuals aged 20 to 24 years and 25 to 29 years (13.8 and 12.1 cases per 100,000population, respectively). Nevertheless, the prevalence and incidence of syphilis in HIV-infected youth andof HIV infection in youth with syphilis are appreciable; in a study of 320 HIV-infected and HIV-uninfectedU.S. adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, the prevalence of syphilis was 9% in HIV-infected girls and 6% inHIV-infected boys.10In a meta-analysis of 30 studies including individuals of all ages, the median HIVseroprevalence in those infected with syphilis in the United States was 15.7% (27.5% in men and 12.4% inwomen with syphilis).11In 2010, coinfection with HIV was reported in 46% of 15- to 29-year-old men whohave sex with men with primary and secondary syphilis who knew their HIV status.12Clinical ManifestationsUntreated early syphilis during pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, hydrops fetalis,preterm delivery, and perinatal death in pregnancies.13In children with congenital syphilis, twocharacteristic congenital syphilis. Early congenital syphilisrefers to clinical manifestations that appear during the first 2 years of life. Late congenital syphilisrefers toclinical manifestations that appear in children older than age 2 years.At birth, infected infants may manifest signs such as hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, mucocutaneous lesions (e.g., osteochondritis, periostitis, orosteitis). In a study of 148 infants born to mothers with untreated or inadequately treated syphilis, 47% hadclinical, radiographic, or conventional laboratory findings syphilis, and 44% had apositive rabbit infectivity test, reaction assay, or immunoglobulin M (IgM) ofserum, blood, or (CSF).14Manifestations of congenital syphilis in infants of HIV-infectedwomen are expected to be similar to those in HIV-unexposed infants. However, as many as 60% of infants withcongenital syphilis do not have any clinical signs at birth.15If untreated, these asymptomatic infants can developclinically apparent disease in the ensuing 3 weeks to 6 months. In addition, fever, nephrotic syndrome, andhypopituitarism can occur. Clinical manifestations of late congenital syphilis are similar to late manifestations ofsyphilis in adults (e.g., involvement of bone and soft tissue, eyes, ears, and the central nervous system [CNS]).The manifestations of sexually acquired syphilis in older children and adolescents are similar to those inadults (see Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults).16HIV-infected individuals with early syphilis may be at increased risk of neurologic complications and mayhave higher rates of serologic treatment failure.17DiagnosisThe standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody.Because IgG antibody in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred antibody from the mother,interpretation of reactive serologic tests for syphilis in infants is difficult. Therefore, the diagnosis ofneonatal congenital syphilis depends on a combination of results from physical, laboratory, radiographic, anddirect microscopic examinations.All infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with aquantitative nontreponemal test (e.g., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] slide test, rapid plasmareagin [RPR], the automated reagin test) from the infant and compared with the same test done at the samelaboratory on the mother's serum. Umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of the potential formaternal blood contamination. Specific treponemal tests, such as the antibodyabsorption (FTA-ABS) test and T. not necessary to evaluatecongenital syphilis in the neonate. There is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnosticuse. Note:Some laboratories use treponemal tests (e.g., enzyme immunoassay, chemiluminescence) initialscreening, and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens.18However, such an approach withcongenital syphilis has not been published.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenY-4Congenital syphilis can be definitively diagnosed if T. pallidumis detected by using darkfield microscopicexamination or special stains of lesions or body fluids such as umbilical cord, placenta, nasal discharge, orskin lesion material from an infant. Failure to detect T. pallidumdoes not definitively rule out infectionbecause false-negative results are common.19A quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer in infant that isfourfold higher than the mother's is suggestive of infection. Infection also should be assumed in infants bornto mothers who were untreated or inadequately treated for syphilis prior to delivery (e.g., non-penicillinregimen or treatment completion <30 days before delivery), regardless of lack of physical, radiographic, orlaboratory findings in the infants suggestive of congenital syphilis. Evaluation of suspected cases of congenital syphilis should include a careful and complete physicalexamination. Physical signs and symptoms of congenital syphilis include, but are not limited to, non-immunehydrops, jaundice, rhinitis, skin rash, and pseudoparalysis of Furtherevaluation to support a diagnosis of congenital syphilis depends on maternal treatment history for syphilis,findings on physical examination, and planned infant treatment. and may include a complete blood count anddifferential and platelet count, long bone radiographs, and CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein. Apositive CSF VDRL test, elevated CSF protein, and/or elevated CSF white blood cell (WBC) count withoutother causes may be due to congenital syphilis. Other tests should be performed as clinically indicated radiograph, liver-function tests, cranial ultrasound, ophthalmologic latent syphilis have or ophthalmologic signs or symptoms, activetertiary syphilis, or serologic treatment failure should have a CSF examination. Different scenarios indicatingclinical management and follow-up recommendations for congenital syphilis are provided on page 36through 37 of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD Treatment Guidelines, 2010. For diagnosis of acquired syphilis, a reactive nontreponemal test must be confirmed by a specific treponemaltest such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA. Treponemal tests usually remain positive for life, even with successfultreatment. The prozone phenomenon (a weakly reactive or falsely negative) reaction is more common inHIV-infected patients.20Treponemal antibody titers do not correlate with disease activity and should not beused to monitor treatment response.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureCongenital SyphilisEffective identification and treatment of congenital syphilis depends on the identification of syphilis inpregnant women and, therefore, on routine serologic screening of pregnant women during the first prenatalvisit. In communities and populations in which the risk of congenital syphilis is high, serologic testing and asexual history also should be obtained at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery. Moreover, as part ofmanagement of pregnant women who have syphilis, information about treatment of sex partners should beobtained to assess the risk of reinfection. Serologic testing at delivery of the mother's serum is preferred overtesting of the infant's serum because the serologic tests performed on infant serum can be non-reactive if themother's serologic test result is of low titer or the mother was infected late in pregnancy. No HIV-exposedinfant should leave the hospital unless the maternal syphilis serologic status has been documented at leastonce during pregnancy and at delivery in communities and populations in which the risk of congenitalsyphilis is high.21,22Routine screening of serum from newborns or umbilical cord blood is not recommended.Acquired SyphilisPrimary prevention of syphilis includes routine discussion of sexual behaviors that may place individuals atrisk of infection. Providers should discuss risk reduction messages that are client-centered and providespecific actions that can reduce the risk of STD acquisition and HIV transmission.23-25Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all sexually active HIV-Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenY-5infected individuals, with more frequent screening (i.e., 3-6 months) depending on individual risk behaviors(e.g., as multiple partners, sex in conjunction with illicit drug use, methamphetamine use, partners whoparticipate in such activities).17,26Syphilis in an HIV-infected individual indicates high-risk behavior andshould prompt intensified counseling messages and consideration of referral for behavioral intervention.Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other STDs.27Discontinuing Primary ProphylaxisNot applicable.Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseasePenicillin remains the treatment of choice for syphilis, congenital or acquired, regardless of HIV status (AI*).Congenital SyphilisData are insufficient to determine whether infants who have congenital syphilis and whose mothers arecoinfected with HIV require different evaluation, therapy, or follow-up for syphilis than that recommendedfor infants born to mothers who are not HIV-coinfected. Response to standard treatment may differ in HIV-infected mothers. For example, some studies in adults have shown a lag in serologic improvement inappropriately treated HIV-infected patients.28,29Treatment for congenital syphilis should be administered to infants whose mothers:Have been untreated or inadequately treated for syphilis (including treatment with erythromycin or anyother non-penicillin regimen),Have no documentation of receiving treatment,Received treatment <30 days before delivery, orHave experienced a fourfold or greater increase in nontreponemal antibody titer suggestive of relapse orreinfection (AII)(proven or highly probable disease). (Sexually Transmitted Disease TreatmentGuidelines, 2010)27 Infants should be treated regardless of maternal treatment history if they have an abnormal physicalexamination consistent with congenital syphilis, positive darkfield or serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer that is at least fourfold greater than maternal titer(AII)(proven or highly probable disease).27Treatment for proven or highly probable congenital syphilis is aqueous crystalline penicillin G 100,000 to150,000 administered as 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose intravenously (IV)every 12 hours during the first 7 days of life and every 8 hours thereafter for a total of 10 days (AII). Ifcongenital syphilis is diagnosed after age 1 month, the dosage of aqueous penicillin G should be increased to200,000 to 300,000 units/kg/day IV , administered as 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IV every 4 to 6 hoursfor 10 days (AII). If 1 day of therapy is missed, the entire course should be restarted. An alternative toaqueous penicillin G is procaine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose intramuscularly (IM) in asingle dose daily for 10 days (BII). However, aqueous penicillin G is preferred because of its higherpenetration into the CSF. Insufficient data are available on the effectiveness of ampicillin or other therapiesfor treatment of congenital syphilis.For infants who do not meet criteria for proven or highly probable disease, treatment options are influencedby several factors, including maternal treatment, maternal serologic results, and response to therapy, andinfant physical exam, infant serologic results, and other laboratory test results. Scenarios that includevariations of these factors with treatment recommendations are provided in detail in on pages 36 and 37 ofthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD Treatment Guidelines, 2010.27In the setting of maternalGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenY-6and possible infant HIV infection, the more conservative choices among scenario-specific treatment optionsmay be preferable.Acquired SyphilisAcquired syphilis in children and adolescents is treated with a single dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000units/kg body weight IM (up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units) for early-stage disease (i.e., primary,secondary, and early latent disease) (AII). For late latent disease, three doses of benzathine penicillin G50,000 units/kg body weight (up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units) should be administered IM onceweekly for 3 doses (total 150,000 units/kg body weight, up to the adult total dose of 7.2 million units) (AIII).Alternative therapies (e.g., ceftriaxone, azithromycin) should be administered to HIV-infected patients onlywhen treatment with penicillin is not feasible, and with close clinical and serologic monitoring because dataon their use are limited (BII). See the Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines, 2010.27Neurosyphilis should be treated with aqueous penicillin G 200,000 to 300,000 units/kg body weight per doseIV every 4 to 6 hours (maximum dosage: 18-24 million units/day) for 10 to 14 days (AII).30See Guidelinesfor the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adultsfor dosingrecommendations for older HIV-infected adolescents with acquired syphilis.16Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS)All infants with a reactive nontreponemal test for syphilis (or infants whose mothers were seroreactive atdelivery) should receive careful follow-up examinations and serologic testing (i.e., a nontreponemal test)every 2 to 3 months until the test becomes non-reactive or the titer has decreased fourfold (AIII).Nontreponemal antibody titers should decline by age 3 months and should be non-reactive by age 6 monthsin infants who were not infected (i.e., if the reactive test result was caused by passive transfer of maternalIgG antibody) or who were infected but have been adequately treated. The serologic response after therapymay be slower in infants treated after the neonatal period. Whether children with congenital syphilis whoalso are HIV-infected take longer to become nonreactive and require retreatment is unknown.Treponemal tests should not be used to evaluate treatment response because in infected children, the results canremain positive despite effective therapy or be related to maternal infection. Passively transferred maternaltreponemal antibodies can be present in infants until age 15 months. A reactive treponemal test after age 18months is diagnostic of congenital syphilis. If the nontreponemal test is non-reactive at that time, no furtherevaluation or treatment is necessary. Infants in whom the nontreponemal test is reactive at age 18 monthsshould be fully (re)evaluated and (re)treated for congenital syphilis (AIII).Infants whose initial CSF evaluations are abnormal should undergo repeat lumbar puncture approximatelyevery 6 months until the results are normal (AII). A repeat reactive CSF VDRL test or abnormal CSF indicesthat cannot be attributed to other ongoing illness requires retreatment for possible neurosyphilis.HIV-infected children and adolescents with acquired primary and secondary syphilis should have clinical andserologic response monitored at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after therapy (AIII); nontreponemal test titersshould decline by at least fourfold by 6 to 12 months after successful therapy, with examination of CSF andre-treatment strongly considered in the absence of such decline. For acquired syphilis of longer duration(e.g., early and late latent syphilis), follow up is indicated at 6, 12,18, and 24 months; fourfold decline shouldbe expected by 12 to 24 months. If initial CSF examination demonstrated pleocytosis, repeat lumbarpuncture should be conducted at 6 months after therapy, and then every 6 months until the cell count isnormal (AIII). Follow-up CSF examinations also can be used to evaluate changes in the CSF-VDRL or CSFprotein levels after therapy, but changes in these parameters occur more slowly than changes in CSF cellcounts. Data from HIV-infected adults with neurosyphilis suggest that CSF abnormalities may persist forextended times, and close clinical follow up is warranted.31Syphilis in HIV-infected children (congenital or acquired) manifesting as immune response inflammatorysyndrome (IRIS) has not been reported, and only very rare reports of syphilis-associated IRIS in adultsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenY-7(primarily syphilitic ocular inflammatory Treatment FailureAfter treatment of congenital syphilis, children with increasing or stable nontreponemal titers at ages 6 to 12months or children who are seropositive with any nontreponemal titer at 18 months should be evaluated(including with a CSF examination) and considered for retreatment with a 10-day course of parenteralpenicillin G (AIII).Management of failed treatment of acquired syphilis in older children and adolescents is identical to that inadults.17Re-treatment of patients with primary or secondary syphilis should be considered for those who: Do not experience at least a fourfold decrease in serum nontreponemal test titers 6 to 12 months aftertherapy,Have a sustained fourfold increase in serum nontreponemal test titers after an initial reduction post-treatment, or Have persistent or recurring clinical signs or symptoms of disease (BIII).Adolescents or adults in whom CSF examination does not confirm a neurosyphilis diagnosis should receivebenzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM, at 1-week intervals for 3 weeks (BIII). If titers fail to respondappropriately after re-treatment, the value of repeat CSF evaluation or re-treatment is unclear, but notrecommended.Re-treatment is warranted for patients with early or late-latent syphilis who have new or sustained clinicalsigns or symptoms of syphilis, have a fourfold increase in serum nontreponemal test titer, or experience aninadequate serologic response (less than fourfold decline in nontreponemal test titer) within 12 to 24 monthsafter therapy if initial titer was high (>1:32)(BIII). Repeat CSF examination should be performed on thesepatients, and if the results are consistent with CNS involvement, re-treatment should follow the neurosyphilisrecommendations (AIII). Adolescents or adults whose CSF profile is not indicative of CNS disease shouldreceive a repeat course of benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 weeks (BIII); re-treatmentof neurosyphilis should be considered in patients whose CSF WBC count has not decreased 6 months aftercompletion of treatment or in whom CSF WBC count or protein is not normal after 2 years (BIII).Preventing RecurrenceNo recommendations have been developed for secondary prophylaxis or chronic maintenance therapy forsyphilis in HIV-infected children.Discontinuing J, of treatment for pregnancy.Obstet Gynecol.

The estimated incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis in the United States is one case per 1,000 to12,000 live-born infants.1,2The seroprevalence of T. gondiiin U.S.-born individuals aged 12 to 49 yearsdeclined from 14.1% in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 1994 to 9.0%from 1999 to 2004.3Older children, adolescents, and adults typically acquire Toxoplasmainfection by eatingundercooked meat that contains parasitic of undercooked meats that could contain tissue cysts and contact with cat feces that could contain sporulated oocystsshould be avoided (AIII).Initiating Primary ProphylaxisToxoplasma-seropositive children aged with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell percentage <15% and children aged years <100 cells/mm3should be prophylaxis against Toxoplasmaencephalitis agent forprophylaxis of TE is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one double-strength tablet daily for adolescents and adults (or weight-equivalentdosing for children) (AII*).Primary preventive therapy can be discontinued once a child responds to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with a sustainedrise in CD4 percentage above 15% for children <6 years of age, and >200 cells/mm3for children aged 6 years (BIII)Most experts recommend treating pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis in an attempt to prevent fetal infection (BII). For moreextensive information on diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of pregnant women with toxoplasmosis, please see the Guidelines forthe Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents.Empiric therapy should be strongly considered for newborns of HIV-infected mothers who had symptomatic or asymptomatic primaryToxoplasma infection during pregnancy, regardless of whether treatment was administered during pregnancy (BIII). The preferred treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis is pyrimethamine combined with sulfadiazine, with supplementaryleucovorin (AII). The recommended duration of treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected infants is 12 months (AIII).Therapy for acquired toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected children is sulfadiazine plus pyrimethamine and leucovorin (AI*). Please refer tohttp://www.daraprimdirect.comfor information regarding access pyrimethamine. If pyrimethamine is unavailable clinicians maysubstitute trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dosed according to age and weight, in place of the combination of sulfadiazine,pyrimethamine, and leucovorin.Corticosteroids are recommended for HIV-infected children with central nervous system toxoplasmosis when cerebrospinal fluidprotein is highly elevated (i.e., >1,000 mg/dL) or who have focal lesions with substantial mass effect (BIII). Anticonvulsants should beadministered only to children with TE who have a history of or current seizures (AIII). Complete blood count should be monitored weekly in patients taking daily pyrimethamine (AIII). Patients who have completed initialtherapy for TE should be given suppressive therapy (i.e., secondary prophylaxis or chronic maintenance therapy) unless cART resultsin immune reconstitution (AI*). The preferred regimen for suppressive therapy for TE is sulfadiazine plus pyrimethamine and leucovorin (AI*).

However, cats excrete oocysts in their feces only transiently after initialinfection, and most studies have failed to show a correlation between cat ownership and Toxoplasmainfection in humans. Indeed, Toxoplasmainfection in humans in the United States has declined despiteincreased cat ownership.4The overall risk of maternal-fetal transmission in HIV-uninfected women who acquire primary Toxoplasmainfection during pregnancy is 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25%-33%), with variation dependingupon the trimester during which primary maternal infection occurs.6The risk of congenital infection is lowamong infants born to women who become infected during the first trimester (range: 2%-6%) but increasessharply thereafter, with a risk as high as 81% in women who become infected during the last few weeks ofpregnancy.6,7Infection of the fetus in early gestation usually results in more severe disease than doesinfection late in gestation.The prevalence of latent Toxoplasmainfection in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women in the UnitedStates was assessed in a cross-sectional study of 2,525 non-pregnant women enrolled in the Women'sInteragency Health Study.8The prevalence of Toxoplasmaseropositivity was 15% and did not differ by HIVinfection status. The overall rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of Toxoplasmain HIV-infectedpregnant women is unknown; however, of MTCT of Toxoplasmain HIV-infected women havebeen reported.9-13HIV-infected women may be at increased risk of transmitting T. gondiito their fetuses, andserologic testing for Toxoplasmashould be performed on all HIV-infected pregnant women. Prenataltransmission of T. gondiiis rare from women without HIV infection who acquired chronic Toxoplasmainfection before pregnancy.14However, with HIV coinfection, perinatal transmission of in with chronic Toxoplasmainfection (transmission rate: <4%), presumably because ofreactivation of replication of the organism in women who are severely immunosuppressed.9-12Central nervous system (CNS) infection with T. gondiiwas reported as an AIDS-indicator condition in <1%of pediatric AIDS cases before the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).15Since then, thiscondition is rarely encountered in HIV-infected U.S. children. CNS toxoplasmosis occurred in 5 of 2,767(0.2%) HIV-infected children enrolled in the long-term follow-up study Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group219c since cART has been available.16Infection is considered to have occurred in uteroin most cases ofToxoplasmaencephalitis (TE) seen in HIV-infected children.More rarely, it has been reported in older HIV-infected children, who presumably had primary acquiredtoxoplasmosis.17-19As in adults, the greatest risk is among severely immunosuppressed children (i.e., CD4 Tlymphocyte [CD4] cell congenital infants (70%-90%) areasymptomatic at birth. However, most asymptomatic children develop late sequelae (i.e., retinitis, visualimpairment, and intellectual or neurologic impairment), with onset of symptoms ranging from severalmonths to years after birth. Symptoms in newborns take either of two presentations: generalized disease orpredominantly neurologic including hydrocephalus, intracerebralcalcification, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and seizures.20Toxoplasmosis acquired after birth most often is initially asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they arefrequently nonspecific and can include malaise, fever, sore throat, myalgia, lymphadenopathy (cervical), anda mononucleosis-like syndrome featuring a maculopapular rash and hepatosplenomegaly.21TE should be considered in all HIV-infected children with new neurologic findings, but especially those withsevere immunosuppression. Although focal findings are typical, the initial presentation can vary and reflectGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenZ-3diffuse CNS disease. Generalized symptoms include fever, reduced alertness, and seizures.Isolated ocular toxoplasmosis is rare in immunocompromised children and usually occurs in association withCNS infection. As a result, a neurologic examination is indicated for children in whom Toxoplasmachorioretinitis is diagnosed. Ocular toxoplasmosis appears as white retinal lesions with little associatedhemorrhage; visual loss can occur initially.Less frequent presentations in HIV-infected children with reactivated chronic toxoplasmosis include systemictoxoplasmosis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and cardiomyopathy/myocarditis.12,22DiagnosisAll infants whose mothers are both seropositive for Toxoplasmashould be evaluated forcongenital toxoplasmosis assay to detect Toxoplasma-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, orIgE in neonatal serum within the first 6 months of life or persistence of specific immunoglobulin G antibodybeyond age 12 months.24-28IgA may be more sensitive for detecting congenital infection than IgM or IgE.25However, approximately 20% to 30% of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis will not be identified duringthe neonatal period with IgA or IgM assays.26Serologic testing is the major method of diagnosis, but interpretation of assays often is confusing anddifficult. When considering a diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis, specialized reference laboratories canperform serology, isolation of organisms and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and can offer assistance ininterpreting results.25,28Additional methods that can be used to diagnose infection in the newborn include isolation of theToxoplasmaparasite by mouse inoculation or inoculation in tissue cultures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),urine, placental tissue, amniotic fluid, or infant blood. T. gondiiDNA can be detected by PCR performed onclinical specimens (e.g., white blood cells, CSF, amniotic fluid, tissue) in a reference laboratory.25,26Thefollowing evaluation should be undertaken for all newborns in whom a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis issuspected: ophthalmologic, auditory, head(either CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans) to determine whether hydrocephalus orcalcifications are present.CNS toxoplasmosis is presumptively diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, serologic evidence ofinfection, and presence of a space-occupying lesion on imaging studies of the brain.29TE rarely has beenreported in individuals without Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies; therefore, negative serology does notdefinitively exclude that diagnosis. Brain computer tomography (CT) that demonstrates multiple, bilateral,ring-enhancing lesions, especially in the basal ganglia and cerebral corticomedullary junction, would betypical of TE. Calcifications are more typical in congenital toxoplasmosis than in TE seen later in life.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive and will confirm basal ganglia lesions in mostpatients.30F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positive emission tomography reportedly is helpful in adults indistinguishing Toxoplasmaabscesses from primary CNS lymphoma, but the accuracy is not high, and thistest is not widely available.Definitive diagnosis of TE requires histologic or cytologic confirmation biopsy isreserved by some experts for patients who do not respond to specific therapy.Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureAll HIV-infected children and adolescents and their caregivers should be counseled about sources of T.gondiiinfection. They should be advised not to eat raw or undercooked meat, including undercooked lamb,Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenZ-4beef, pork, or venison (BIII). All meat (lamb, beef, and pork) should be cooked to an internal temperature of145\u00b0F for 3 minutes.31However, a study has found that T. gondiican survive at 64\u00b0C (147.2\u00b0F) for 3minutes, so higher temperatures than this seem best for immunosuppressed patients.32Ground meat and wildgame meat should be cooked to 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F). Poultry should be cooked to 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F). Hands should bewashed after contact with raw meat and after gardening or other contact with soil; in addition, fruits andvegetables should be washed well before being eaten raw (BIII). Stray cats should not be handled oradopted; a cat already in the household should be kept inside and the litter box changed daily, preferably byan HIV-uninfected individual who is not pregnant (BIII). Cats should be fed only canned or driedcommercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats (BIII). Patients need not beadvised to part with their cats or to have their cats tested for toxoplasmosis (AII).Preventing DiseaseIn the United States, routine Toxoplasmaserologic screening of HIV-infected children whose mothers do nothave toxoplasmosis is not recommended because of its low incidence. However, in regions with highincidence of Toxoplasmainfection (1% per year), or for children immigrating from such regions, serologictesting can be selectively considered for HIV-infected children aged >12 months (CIII). HIV-infectedadolescents without previous Toxoplasmainfection should undergo serologic testing (CIII). Toxoplasma-seronegative adults and adolescents who are not taking Pneumocystispneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis knownto be active against TE should be retested for IgG antibody to Toxoplasmaif their CD4 cell counts decline to<100 cells/mm3to determine whether they have seroconverted to Toxoplasma.Toxoplasma-seropositive adolescents and adults who have CD4 cell counts <100 cells/mm3should be givenprophylaxis against TE.33Specific levels of immunosuppression that increase the risk of TE in children areless well defined. Toxoplasma-seropositive children with CD4 percentages <15% should be givenprophylaxis against TE (AIII). For children aged 6 years, the same absolute CD4 count level used for HIV-infected adults can be used (AIII).In HIV-infected adolescents and adults, the double-strength-tablet daily dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) recommended as the preferred regimen for PCP prophylaxis is effective TEprophylaxis (AII).33Data from case series in children and from trials in adults support this as the preferredregimen in children using age-based dosing (See Table: gondii) TMP-SMX, one double-strength tablet 3 times weekly (or 3consecutive days a week), is an alternative (BIII). If patients cannot tolerate TMP-SMX, the recommendedalternative is dapsone-pyrimethamine, which also is effective against PCP (BI*).34,35Atovaquone orwithout (AIII). Aerosolized pentamidinedoes not protect against TE and is not recommended.33,36Severely immunosuppressed children who are notreceiving TMP-SMX or reported that primary prophylaxis can bediscontinued with minimal risk of TE in patients who have responded to cART with an increase in CD4 cellcount to 200 cells/mm3for >6 months. Although patients with CD4 cell counts of <100 cells/mm3are atgreatest risk of TE, the risk of TE when CD4 cell counts increase to 100 to 200 cells/mm3has not been studiedas rigorously as an increase to >200 cells/mm3. Thus, the recommendation for adults and adolescents specifiesdiscontinuing prophylaxis after an increase to >200 cells/mm3. Discontinuing primary TE prophylaxis whenCD4 cell counts have increased to >200 cells/mm3is recommended because prophylaxis adds limited diseaseprevention for toxoplasmosis and because discontinuing drugs reduces pill burden, the potential for drugtoxicity, drug interactions, selection of drug-resistant pathogens, and cost. Data do not exist on the safety ofdiscontinuing primary TE prophylaxis for HIV-infected children whose immunologic status improves on cART.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenZ-5Data on adults suggest discontinuation of TMP-SMX may be safe once a child responds to cART with asustained rise in CD4 percentage above 15%; for children aged 6 years, the same CD4 cell count used forHIV-infected adults can be used (BIII). A sustained response in children has been defined as a CD4 count orpercentage above the threshold level for >3 consecutive months after receiving cART for >6 months.Prophylaxis should be reintroduced in HIV-infected adults (AIII), adolescents (AIII), and children 6 yearsold (BIII)if the CD4 cell count decreases to <100 to 200 cells/mm3or the CD4 percentage falls children aged <6 years (BIII).Treatment RecommendationsTreating DiseasePregnant women with suspected or confirmed primary toxoplasmosis and newborns with possible ordocumented congenital toxoplasmosis should be managed in consultation with an appropriate infectiousdisease specialist. Although controversy exists about the efficacy of treating pregnant women who have acutetoxoplasmosis in an attempt to prevent infection of the fetus,42most experts would recommend such therapy(BII).23Empiric therapy should be strongly considered for newborns of HIV-infected mothers who hadsymptomatic or asymptomatic primary Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy, regardless of whethertreatment was administered during pregnancy (BIII).The preferred treatment for is pyrimethamine for acquired children is sulfadiazine pluspyrimethamine and http://www.daraprimdirect.comfor information regardingaccess to pyrimethamine. If pyrimethamine is unavailable, clinicians may substitute age-appropriate-dosedtrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in place of the combination of sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin.Although the optimal duration of therapy is undefined, the recommended duration of treatment for congenitaltoxoplasmosis in HIV-uninfected infants is 12 months (AII).43Older HIV-infected children with acquired CNS,ocular, or systemic toxoplasmosis should be treated with pyrimethamine and leucovorin plus sulfadiazine(AI*). Acute therapy should be continued for 6 weeks, assuming clinical and radiologic improvement (BII*).Longer courses of treatment may be required for extensive disease or poor response after 6 weeks. The primaryalternative for sulfadiazine in patients who been used withpyrimethamine and leucovorin in sulfa-allergic adults, but this regimen has not been studied in children.Extrapolation of doses used in adults corresponds to a dose of 20 mg/kg given every 24 hours (maximum 1,000mg) but this dose has not been evaluated in children.Another alternative in adults is atovaquone plus pyrimethamine and leucovorin, or atovaquone withsulfadiazine alone, or atovaquone as a single agent in patients intolerant to both pyrimethamine andsulfadiazine; however, these regimens have not been studied in children (BII*). In adults, atovaquone isdosed at twice the total daily dose used for PCP prophylaxis and is divided into four doses per day, but suchdosing for treatment of acquired toxoplasmosis in children has not been evaluated. In a small (77 subjects)randomized trial in adults, TMP-SMX was reported to be effective and better tolerated than pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine.44Others have reported similar efficacy in open-label observational studies.45However, this hasnot yet been studied in children.For isolated ocular toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts, TMP-SMX alone is as effective aspyrimethamine-sulfadiazine.46However, these data have not been duplicated in HIV-infected patients;therefore, this regimen cannot be recommended for this group of patients.Based upon treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis in HIV-uninfected children, corticosteroids such asdexamethasone and prednisone are recommended for all HIV-infected children with CNS disease when CSFprotein is highly elevated (i.e., >1,000 mg/dL) or who have focal lesions with substantial mass effects (BIII).Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenZ-6Because of the potential immunosuppressive effects of steroids, they should be discontinued as soon as possible.Anticonvulsants should be given to children with TE who have a history of seizures (AIII)but should not beadministered prophylactically to children without a history of seizures (BIII). Anticonvulsants, ifadministered, should be continued at least through acute therapy.Although the initiation of cART aids in the treatment of many opportunistic infections and malignancies, ithas not been definitively shown to improve the outcome of TE therapy.Monitoring and Adverse Events, Including IRISChildren with TE should be routinely monitored for clinical and radiologic improvement and for adverseeffects of treatment; changes in antibody titers are not useful for monitoring responses to therapy.Toxoplasmosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been described rarely inHIV-infected adults and has not been described in HIV-infected children, although it could presumablyoccur.47,48IRIS in HIV-infected pregnant women may pose additional risk to the fetuses49although anyunique risk for pregnant women co-infected with HIV and Toxoplasmahas not been defined. Pyrimethamine can be associated with rash (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and nausea. The primarytoxicity of pyrimethamine is reversible bone marrow suppression (i.e., neutropenia, anemia, andthrombocytopenia). A complete blood count should be performed at least weekly in children who are ondaily pyrimethamine and at least monthly in those on less-than-daily (AIII). Leucovorin (folinic acid)always should be administered with increased doses of leucovorin may be required in theevent of marrow suppression. Because of the long half-life of pyrimethamine, leucovorin should becontinued 1 week after pyrimethamine has been discontinued.Adverse effects of sulfadiazine include rash, fever, leukopenia, hepatitis, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (e.g.,nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and crystalluria. Clindamycin can be associated with fever, rash, and GI symptoms(e.g., nausea; vomiting, and diarrhea, and including pseudomembranous colitis) and hepatotoxicity.Drug interactions between anticonvulsant and antiretroviral drugs should be evaluated. Patients receivingcorticosteroids should be closely monitored for development of other opportunistic infections.Managing Treatment FailureBrain biopsy should be considered in the event of early clinical or radiologic neurologic deterioration despiteadequate empiric treatment or in children who do not clinically respond to anti-Toxoplasmatherapy after 10to 14 days. In children who undergo brain biopsy and have confirmed histopathologic evidence of TE despitetreatment, a switch to an alternative regimen as previously described should be considered (BIII).Preventing RecurrencePatients who have completed initial therapy for acquired TE should be given suppressive therapy (i.e.,secondary prophylaxis or chronic maintenance therapy) (AI*)50,51until immune occurs withcART. The combination of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is highly effective for this purpose(AI*). A commonly used regimen for patients who cannot tolerate sulfa drugs is pyrimethamine plusclindamycin with leucovorin (BI*); however, only the combination of pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazineprovides protection against PCP as well. Data on adults indicate atovaquone with or without pyrimethaminealso can be considered for children (CIII). Limited data support the use of TMP-SMX for secondaryprophylaxis;52this regimen should be used only for patients who do not tolerate pyrimethamine plussulfadiazine or pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (CIII)or if Secondary ProphylaxisAdults and adolescents receiving secondary prophylaxis for acquired TE are at low risk of recurrence of TEwhen they have successfully completed their initial therapy, continue to have no signs or symptoms of TE, andGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenZ-7have a sustained increase in CD4 cell count of >200 cells/mm3after cART (i.e., >6 months).38,39,41,53,54Discontinuing chronic maintenance therapy in HIV-infected adolescents and adults who meet these criteria is areasonable consideration. The highest risk of relapse appears to occur within the first 6 months after stoppingsecondary prophylaxis. Some specialists would obtain an MRI of the brain as part of their evaluation todetermine whether discontinuing therapy is appropriate. The safety of discontinuing secondary prophylaxisafter immune reconstitution with cART in children has not been studied extensively. However, given the data inadults, clinicians caring for HIV-infected children aged 1 to <6 years can consider discontinuing secondaryprophylaxis against T. gondiiafter they have completed TE therapy and 6 months of stable cART and areasymptomatic and once the CD4 percentage has risen to 15% for >6 consecutive months (BIII). For childrenaged 6 years, the same CD4 cell count used in adults (CD4 count >200 cells/mm3) also can be used (BIII).Prophylaxis should be re-instituted if these parameters are not Hsu HW, Meissner HC, et and early treatment for congenital Toxoplasmagondii infection.

Household contacts of HIV-infected patients should receive varicella vaccine if they lack evidence of immunity toavoid the possibility of transmitting wild-type varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to their HIV-infected contacts (AIII).HIV-infected children aged 1 through 8 years without evidence of varicella immunity and whose CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cellcounts are 15% should be considered for 2 doses of varicella vaccine, the first dose administered as early as age 12 to 15months (or as soon as possible after the first birthday) and the second dose 3 months later (BII). Older children with comparablelevels of immune function (i.e., CD4 cell counts 200 cells/mm3) who lack varicella immunity may be considered for 2 doses ofvaricella vaccine administered 3 months apart (BIII).Combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine should not be administered to HIV-infected children (AIII).HIV-infected children with low CD4 percentages (<15%) should not be vaccinated against varicella (AIII). Vaccination of such childrencan be safely undertaken after reconstitution of their immune systems (CD4 percentage 15%) with combination antiretroviral therapy(cART) for at least 3 months (AII). Herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine should not be given to HIV-infected children (AIII).HIV-infected children and adolescents who: 1)lack evidence of immunity to varicella, and 2)have a non-transient exposure to a contact or herpes zoster should receive VZV immunoglobulin prophylaxis as soon as possible (ideally within 96 hours but potentially beneficial up to 10days) after the close contact (AII). Many experts limit this recommendation to varicella- or zoster-exposed HIV-infected childrenwho are considered to be severely immunocompromised (i.e., CDC Immunologic Category 3) especially if they have high HIVviral loads and would be classified in CDC Clinical Category C (BIII). When passive immunization is impossible, some expertsrecommend prophylaxis with acyclovir beginning 7 to 10 days after exposure, while others consider it prudent to wait until thefirst appearance of rash to start acyclovir therapy in VZV-susceptible and VZV-exposed, HIV-infected children (CIII).Acyclovir is the drug of choice for treating VZV infection in HIV-infected children (AI). Intravenous (IV) acyclovir is recommendedfor treating varicella in HIV-infected children with severe immunosuppression (i.e., CDC Immunologic Category 3) and those whohave high fever, abdominal pain, respiratory symptoms, or numerous or deep, necrotic, or hemorrhagic skin lesions (AIII). Oralacyclovir should only be used to treat varicella in HIV-infected children who are in CDC Immunologic Category 1 or 2 and whohave mild varicella disease (BIII). Acyclovir is the oral treatment of choice for zoster in HIV-infected children, given for 7 to 10 days, although longer durations oftherapy should be considered if lesions are slow to resolve (AII*). Oral administration of acyclovir for HZ is considered safe forchildren with mild to moderate immune suppression (AII). Initial IV administration is recommended for HIV-infected childrenwith severe immunosuppression (i.e., CDC Immunologic Category 3), extensive HZ, disseminated infection,visceral involvement, or otherwise complicated HZ (AII*). It can also be considered for trigeminal nerve or sacral dermatomalinvolvement. IV acyclovir should be continued until cutaneous lesions and visceral disease are clearly resolving (AIII), afterwhich oral administration can be considered to complete the course of therapy\u201410 to 14 days in this situation (AIII).Recommended treatment for progressive outer retinal necrosis includes optimization of cART and IV anti-VZV therapy thatincludes combinations of systemic antivirals (acyclovir and/or (AIII). retinal sometimes recommended, along withcorticosteroids and/or low-dose aspirin (BIII). Acute retinal necrosis can be treated with IV acyclovir for 10 to 14 days, followedby prolonged (i.e., 4-6 weeks) oral treatment (AIII). Alternatives to oral acyclovir in older adolescents include valacyclovir and famciclovir (AI*).The treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant VZV is IV foscarnet for 7 days (AII*)or until no new lesions for at least 48 hours (AIII).Rating of Recommendations:A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = OptionalRating of Evidence:I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One ormore randomized trials in adultswith clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = Oneor more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies long-term outcomes; II* = One ormore well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adultswith long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenAA-2EpidemiologyVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) infections are endemic worldwide. Prior to the universal administration ofvaricella vaccine, approximately 4 million cases of varicella occurred annually in the United States. Theannual incidence in children aged <10 years was 9%; by adulthood more than 95% of individuals hadantibodies to VZV , indicating prior primary infection.1In tropical and subtropical areas, varicella may beacquired later in childhood or early adulthood, but seroprevalence is high by age 30. Because of universalvaccination in the United States, the incidence of varicella and its associated morbidity and mortality havedecreased by 74% to more than 90%.2,3VZV is transmitted by an airborne route.4It is highly contagious;clinical infection develops in about 80% of susceptible individuals exposed in a household.5Second attacksof varicella are uncommon. Vertical mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of VZV can occur. However, because most pregnant women areimmune, varicella complicating pregnancy is unusual. Congenital in approximately 2% (95% CI: 0%-5%) of infants born to women who have varicella at 13 to 20 weeksof pregnancy,6,7but is not seen in infants born to women who develop herpes zoster (HZ) during pregnancy.MTCT of VZV has not been reported in HIV-infected pregnant women who develop varicella.VZV also can be transmitted to fetuses in late gestation, resulting in neonatal varicella. In mothers whodevelop varicella in the interval of 5 days before to 2 days after delivery, the attack rate for infants isapproximately 20% and mortality, before the availability of antiviral therapy, was approximately 30%.8Incomparison, if maternal varicella precedes delivery long enough to allow transfer of VZV antibodies acrossthe placenta, infants can still develop varicella in the first 5 days of life, but it is rarely severe.VZV causes both varicella (primary infection; chickenpox) and HZ, which represents reactivation of VZVthat resides in a latent state in dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia following varicella. Once established, latency persists for life, but reactivation to cause HZ in 25% to 30% of peoplewho had varicella. HZ is less contagious than varicella, but virus from HZ lesions can spread by directcontact or by an airborne route from immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals to causevaricella in people who never had this infection. HZ occurs because the VZV-specific cellular immunity thatis acquired with varicella and is needed to maintain latency declines with age. This same immunity istypically lost with HIV infection, explaining why HZ is common in HIV-infected people.9,10HZ was a verycommon complication in HIV-infected children in the era before combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)(approximately 10 cases/100 patient-years prior to 1996); the incidence of HZ remains at 2 to 3 cases per 100patient-years in the cART era, which is 10 to 25 times higher than in the general population.11-13Risk factorsfor development of HZ include low lymphocyte count/percentage; of varicella when the CD4 percentage is <15%.13-15As in adults, the frequency of HZ recurrences in children correlates inversely with the CD4 cell count.13,16The incidence of HZ increases with age; this trend extends into adulthood, particularly in individualsyounger than age 50.In addition to cART and immune reconstitution, another reason for the declining incidence of HZ in HIV-infected children in countries with varicella vaccination programs is that many received the licensed varicellavaccine. This is associated with a decrease in HZ in HIV-uninfected children.17HZ is also less common invaccinated HIV-infected children compared with those who had wild-type infection.18Clinical Manifestations The incubation period for varicella ranges from 10 to 21 days (average: 14 days) in immunocompetentchildren. Varicella can be associated with a brief prodrome of malaise and fever, followed by skin lesionsthat are more numerous on the face and trunk than on the extremities. These evolve over 5 days throughmacular, papular, vesicular, and pustular stages, culminating in crusts. Combinations of these types of lesionsGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenAA-3are present simultaneously. Complications of varicella include superinfection of skin with bacterialpathogens, primarily staphylococci and streptococci. Clinically important systemic involvement can cerebellar coagulation.Varicella causes more morbidity in HIV-infected patients than in the general population. Initial reports ofvaricella in HIV-infected children suggested severe disease manifestations and chronic atypical skinlesions,19,20but more recent studies support less complicated courses, particularly in children receiving cARTor who have higher CD4 cell counts at the time of infection.14,21However, the disease may last longer thannormal, and the rate of complications is higher than in otherwise healthy children with varicella.15,22Uncommonly, severely immunocompromised HIV-infected children can have persistent chronic infection,with continued appearance of new VZV lesions for >1 month after primary or recurrent infection.20,23Thelesions are characteristically varicelliform at onset but evolve into non-healing ulcers or necrotic, crusted,and hyperkeratotic verrucous lesions. Chronic of HIV-infected children with VZVin the pre-cART era, usually in children with low CD4 cell counts.16The classical presentation of HZ is an often painful or pruritic, vesicular dermatomal rash. Typically painprecedes the rash by 2 to 3 days. Less typical rashes, similar to those described for chronic varicella,including rashes that extend beyond dermatomal boundaries or are bilaterally distributed or generalized, canoccur during HZ in HIV-infected children. They often have multiple recurrent episodes of HZ.13,16Disseminated zoster with multiorgan involvement can occur, with or without the typical rash of HZ.Encephalitis long after HZ, or without rash, has been reported in HIV-infected children.24Ruling out herpessimplex virus infection, which can be confused with VZV skin manifestations, is important in evaluatingHIV-infected children with possible HZ infection.Retinitis is a complication of VZV infection in HIV-infected children and adolescents25,26that can be confusedwith cytomegalovirus retinitis.27Progressive outer retinal necrosis is a VZV-associated entity that typicallyoccurs with CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm3and is often associated with HZ. Acute retinal necrosis can occur inHIV-infected children at any CD4 cell count. A rapid decrease in visual acuity, or occurrence of red eye or eyepain, should result in an immediate consultation with an ophthalmologist for diagnosis and specific therapy. DiagnosisTypical presentations of varicella and HZ are readily diagnosed clinically. Laboratory methods are requiredfor atypical presentations, prolonged course, and non-response to therapy. VZV DNA polymerase chainreaction (PCR) is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing a VZV infection. It can provide anetiologic diagnosis within 24 to 48 hours and some research laboratories can differentiate between wild-typeand vaccine strain VZV . In addition to lesion specimens, PCR can be applied to blood, cerebrospinal fluid,and pharyngeal and conjunctival swabs. Direct immunofluorescence for VZV antigen can be performed collected from conjunctiva, or mucosal lesion scrapings. Optimal sensitivity requires obtainingcells from base of a lesion after unroofing a fresh vesicle. This method requires only a 3-hour turnaroundtime, but is significantly less sensitive (<75%) than PCR.28,29VZV can be isolated in cell culture fromvesicular fluid or ulcer swabs, but the virus is labile and specimens must be processed rapidly. Typicalcytopathic effect is noted only after 5 to 7 days. Even the more rapid shell vial method, which combinescentrifugation of samples onto tissue culture monolayers and staining with fluorescein-conjugatedmonoclonal antibodies to detect synthesis of early VZV proteins, requires at least 48 hours and is lesssensitive than PCR.29Culture methods are most often positive when an ulcer or vesicle is sampled, especiallyduring the early days after illness onset and before initiation of antiviral therapy, whereas PCR often remainspositive late in the illness and when scabs are used as a sample. PCR is critical for evaluating atypicalpresentations of HZ. Serologic tests are of little value in diagnosing active VZV infection in either HIV-infected or HIV-uninfected children.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenAA-4Prevention RecommendationsPreventing ExposureHIV-infected children who are susceptible to VZV infection (with no verified history of varicella or HZ andlack of evidence of appropriate vaccination or varicella immunity by a sensitive, specific antibody assay)should avoid exposure to individuals with varicella or HZ (AIII). Commercially available VZV antibodyassays can have false-negative and false-positive results, however, limiting the ability to determine varicellaimmunity with certainty.30Household contacts who lack evidence of immunity should receive varicellavaccine to reduce the possibility of transmitting wild-type VZV to their HIV-infected contacts (AIII).31Forthe same reason, elderly household contacts should receive the HZ vaccine according to Advisory Committeeon Immunization Practices recommendations.Preventing DiseaseActive Immunization HIV-infected children aged 1 to 8 years without evidence of varicella immunity and whose CD4 percentagesare 15% should be considered for two doses of varicella vaccine, the first dose administered as early as age12 to 15 months or as soon as possible after the first birthday and the second dose 3 months later (BII).Limited data from a clinical trial in HIV-infected children with these characteristics indicate that the vaccinewas well-tolerated and that >80% of subjects had detectable VZV-specific immune responses (eitherantibody or cell-mediated immune response or both) at 1 year after vaccination.32,33This has been validatedby other investigators.34-36In the absence of specific safety and immunogenicity data, the combinationmeasles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine should not be administered in place of the single-antigen varicellavaccine to HIV-infected children (AIII).Data are limited on use of varicella vaccine in older HIV-infected children and adolescents. However, thesafety of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected individuals aged >8 years who have comparable levels of immunefunction (i.e., CD4 cell count 200 cells/mm3) is likely to be similar to that in children aged <8 years; however,based on observations with HIV-uninfected individuals, immunogenicity may be lower in older HIV-infectedchildren, adolescents, and adults. Weighing the risk of severe wild-type VZV disease against the potentialbenefit of vaccination, older children with CD4 percentages 15% and CD4 cell counts 200 cells/mm3wholack varicella immunity can be considered for vaccination on the same schedule (BIII). The response tovaccination should be optimal in patients on cART for an extended period and in those with high CD4 cellcounts and very low viral loads. This should be considered in scheduling this (and other) immunizations. Although HIV-infected children who are not severely immunocompromised tolerate the vaccine well, they,like healthy children, infrequently develop mild rashes around 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination. They rarelyrequire antiviral therapy, and skin lesions usually clear in 3 to 5 days without treatment. Vaccine-strain VZVis susceptible to acyclovir. Because there is still varicella in some communities, VZV rashes (especially whenthey are extensive) that develop shortly after vaccination require virologic investigation to distinguishvaccine-associated rashes from those caused by wild-type VZV . HZ from the vaccine (Oka strain) isdescribed in some healthy children and some children with acute lymphocytic leukemia.HIV-infected children with low CD4 percentages (<15%) may rarely develop systemic disease (i.e.,pneumonia and neurologic manifestations) from vaccine-strain VZV and should not be vaccinated againstvaricella (AIII).37Vaccination of such children can be safely undertaken after stable reconstitution of theirimmune systems (CD4 percentage 15%) with cART for 3 months (AII).35Efficacy of the varicella vaccinein HIV-infected children is suggested by long-term follow-up studies of vaccinees at several institutions.12,18Vaccination was >80% effective against varicella and no cases of HZ were observed in vaccinees. Thiscompares favorably with the efficacy in vaccinated healthy children (after one dose) and in children withunderlying leukemia (after two doses), where an efficacy of 80% to 85% was observed for prevention ofclinical infection. In vaccinated HIV-uninfected children, most breakthrough varicella cases are mild, withGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenAA-5few lesions (commonly <50), less fever, and a shorter duration of illness.31,38Because HZ vaccine is licensed only for use in healthy people aged 50 years to prevent HZ and has notbeen studied in HIV-infected children, it should not be given to HIV-infected children (AIII). Passive Immunization HIV-infected children and adolescents who1) lack evidence of immunity to varicella (as defined above), and 2) have a non-transient exposure to a contact with varicella or herpes zoster should receive human VZV immunoglobulin (VariZIG) prophylaxis as soon as possible after the closecontact, ideally within 96 hours but potentially beneficial up to 10 days39,40(AII). Many experts limit thisrecommendation to varicella- or zoster-exposed HIV-infected children who are considered to be severelyimmunocompromised (i.e., in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Immunologic Category3), especially if also classified as CDC Clinical Category C41and experiencing a high HIV RNA plasma viralload (BIII). When passive immunization is not possible, some experts recommend oral acyclovir for post-exposure prophylaxis (see below) for less immunocompromised HIV-infected patients. Passive immunizationis achieved with VariZIG, a lyophilized preparation which, when properly reconstituted, is a 5% solution ofhyperimmune Immunoglobulin G that can be administered intramuscularly. Previously available under aninvestigational new drug application expanded access protocol, VariZIG was approved by the FDA inDecember 2012. It is now available commercially and can be obtained 24 hours a day from the soleauthorized U.S. distributor (FFF Enterprises, Temecula, California) at 1-800-843-7477 or online athttp://www.fffenterprises.com. The duration of the incubation period for varicella may be prolonged up to 28days after VariZIG administration, thus also extending the period of potential infectiousness. Subsequentactive immunization, provided the vaccine is not contraindicated, should be delayed for 5 months. Analternative to VariZIG is intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), 400 mg/kg body weight, administered once assoon as possible (ideally within 96 hours after exposure). Patients who have received this dose of IVIGwithin the prior 3 weeks should be protected.Post-Exposure Antiviral Prophylaxis Several small studies suggest that post-exposure prophylaxis with acyclovir in healthy children oftenprevents or attenuates varicella.42-44Note that this approach is dependent upon adequate specific immuneresponses developing in exposed children during the incubation period. Thus, when passive immunization isnot possible, some experts recommend prophylaxis with oral acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (maximumdose 800 mg), administered 4 times daily for 7 days, beginning 7 to 10 days after exposure.45The use ofacyclovir for prophylaxis in HIV-infected, VZV-exposed children has not been studied. For that reason, someexperts consider it prudent to wait until rash appears to start acyclovir therapy in VZV-susceptible and VZV-exposed, HIV-infected children who were not given Prophylaxis with Varicella Vaccine Post-exposure prophylaxis with has been successfully used in HIV-uninfected children andadults.46However, this preventive approach is predicated on a prompt and robust immune response, which iswhy it has not been studied in HIV-infected patients and is not recommended. Treating DiseaseOn the basis of controlled trials in children with malignancies, and response to therapy in HIV-infectedchildren severely ill with varicella,19acyclovir is the drug of choice for treating VZV infections (AI).Acyclovir should be initiated as soon as possible after varicella lesions appear. In immune competentchildren, new lesions can continue to appear for 72 hours after initiation of acyclovir and crusting of allGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenAA-6lesions may take 5 to 7 days. Intravenous (IV) acyclovir is recommended for treating varicella in HIV-infected children with severe immunosuppression (i.e., CDC Immunologic Category 3) and those who havehigh fever, abdominal pain, respiratory symptoms, or numerous or deep, necrotic, or hemorrhagic skinlesions (AIII). For children aged <1 year, the dose of acyclovir is 10 mg/kg body weight administered IVevery 8 hours as a 1-hour infusion. Some health-care providers administer the same dose to older children,while others base the dose of acyclovir in older children on body surface area (500 mg/m2IV every 8 hoursas a 1-hour infusion).45Administration is for 7 to 10 days, provided that new lesions have ceased to appearfor at least 48 hours. Oral administration should only be used to treat varicella in HIV-infected children whoare in CDC Immunologic Category 1 or 2 and who have mild varicella disease (BIII). Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (800 mg maximum dose) administered 4 times per day for 7 to 10 days is theoral treatment of choice for HZ in HIV-infected children, although longer therapy should be considered whenlesions are slow to resolve (AII*). Oral administration of acyclovir for HZ is considered safe because the riskof disseminated, life-threatening disease is lower with HZ than with varicella. However, initial IVadministration is recommended for HIV-infected children with severe immunosuppression (i.e., CDCImmunologic Category 3), extensive HZ, disseminated infection, visceral involvement, orotherwise complicated HZ (AII*). It also can be considered for trigeminal nerve or sacral dermatomalinvolvement. IV acyclovir should be continued until cutaneous lesions and visceral disease are clearlyresolving (AIII), after which oral administration can be considered to complete the course of therapy\u201410 to 14days in this situation (AIII). Doses of IV acyclovir for treating HZ are the same as those for treating varicella.Progressive outer retinal necrosis is rapidly progressive and prognosis for visual preservation is poor despiteaggressive therapy. Optimal therapy has not been defined.25,47,48Regardless of specific VZV antiviral therapy,optimization of cART is recommended. Most experts recommend IV anti-VZV therapy that includescombinations of systemic antivirals (acyclovir or ganciclovir twice-weeklyintravitreal ganciclovir and/or foscarnet (AIII).49Adjunctive retinal surgery is sometimesrecommended, along for associated occlusive vasculopathy andoptic neuropathy (BIII). In contrast, acute retinal necrosis appears more responsive to high-dose IV acyclovir(10-15 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours for 10-14 days), followed by prolonged (i.e., 4-6 weeks) oraltreatment with acyclovir, or valacyclovir for older patients (AIII).49Alternatives to oral acyclovir in older adolescents and adults include valacyclovir and famciclovir (AI*).Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir with improved bioavailability that is rapidly converted to acyclovirafter absorption. Sufficient information exists to support the use of valacyclovir in children, especially givenits two- to three-fold improved bioavailability compared with acyclovir, at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight(maximum dose 1 g) three times a day.50,51However, because no pediatric formulation is available,valacyclovir can generally only be used for children old enough to swallow the large valacyclovir tablets.Alternatively, crushed valacyclovir tablets, which can be used to make an extemporaneous suspension,provide good bioavailability.52Data on the pharmacokinetics and dosing of famciclovir in children areinsufficient to make recommendations, and no pediatric preparation is available.53Monitoring and Adverse Events, Including IRISAcyclovir is excreted primarily by the kidney; as a result, dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance isneeded in patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure. Primary toxicities of acyclovir are phlebitis (withIV administration), renal toxicity, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Toxicities are similar forvalacyclovir. If possible, avoid other nephrotoxic drugs when acyclovir is administered. IV acyclovir must beadequately diluted and administered slowly over 1 to 2 hours. Adequate hydration should be assured and mayrequire IV fluid administration for ill patients. For infants and children receiving high-dose IV acyclovir,monitoring of the complete blood count (CBC) and renal function is recommended at initiation of treatmentand once or twice weekly for the duration of treatment, particularly for those with underlying renaldysfunction and those receiving prolonged therapy. Periodic monitoring of CBCs and renal function is alsorecommended for children receiving prolonged oral therapy. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenAA-7HZ has been considered an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome event in numerous reports wherethe incidence of HZ was increased transiently after institution of cART.54However, an analysis comparing HZincidence rates in the 3 months prior to cART with HZ incidence in the 3 months after cART indicated nodifference.13This suggests that the high incidence occurring in the 3 months after cART represents persistenceof the inability to develop a robust VZV-specific cell-mediated immune response in this early post-cARTperiod. The incidence of HZ falls in the subsequent follow-up period as immune reconstitution proceeds. Thisrelationship has been demonstrated with numerous opportunistic infections55and confirmed for HZ.12Managing Treatment FailureChildren who continue to develop lesions, whose lesions fail to heal, or whose lesions progress after 7 daysof treatment may be infected with acyclovir-resistant VZV .56This reflects the fact that acyclovir is avirostatic drug, and that such patients have inadequate VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity to rapidly clearthe VZV infection. If possible, a lesion culture should be obtained and, if virus is isolated, susceptibilitytesting should be performed to confirm drug resistance. This may be difficult to arrange and will involvesignificant delay. Thus, the decision to change therapy is often based on clinical observations. All acyclovir-resistant VZV strains are resistant to valacyclovir, famciclovir, and ganciclovir. The therapeutic choice foracyclovir-resistant VZV is foscarnet 40 to 60 mg/kg body weight, which should be administered IV 3 timesdaily for 7 days (AII*)or until no new lesions have appeared for at least 48 hours (AIII).49,57Foscarnetshould be administered slowly IV over the course of 2 hours (no faster than 1 mg/kg/minute).Foscarnet has significant nephrotoxic potential; 30% of patients experience increases in serum creatininelevels. It also causes serious electrolyte imbalances (including abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus,magnesium, and potassium levels) in many patients, and secondary seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias canoccur. Abnormal liver transaminases and central nervous system symptoms can occur. Infusing foscarnetwith saline fluid loading can minimize renal toxicity, and infusion through a central venous catheter canavoid thrombophlebitis. Doses should be modified in patients with renal insufficiency (see package insert).For patients receiving foscarnet, CBCs, serum electrolytes, and renal function should be monitored at least 2to 3 times per week during induction therapy and once weekly thereafter.Preventing RecurrenceNo preventive measures are available for HZ in HIV-infected children and adolescents. However, varicellavaccination reduces the incidence (perhaps severity) of HZ compared with that in healthy or HIV-infectedchildren who had natural infection.12,17,18The likelihood of initial or recurrent attacks of HZ is reduced witheffective cART.13A vaccine to prevent HZ has been approved for use in immunocompetent adults aged 50years. Data regarding safety and efficacy of this vaccine in HIV-infected persons of any age are lacking, anduse of the vaccine in HIV-infected patients is not recommended. However, prospective clinical trials areunder way to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the HZ vaccine in HIV-infected from NHANES III: controlthrough 1:S111-118.

NIH-CDC-HIVMA/IDSA-PIDS-AAP Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children A Working Group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC) (Last updated 'HFHPEHU\u0003\u0014\u0018 , 2016; last reviewed 'HFHPEHU\u0003\u0014\u0018 , 2016) Important Guideline Considerations Topic Comment Goal of the Guidelines Provide guidance to HIV care practitioners on the prevention and management of HIV -related opportunistic infections for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in the United States. Panel Members The panel is composed of the Executive Secretary and two non-governmental Co-Chairs with expertise in pediatric HIV infection and infectious diseases. The panel has members who represent the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the HIV Medical Association of the Infectious Disease Society of America (HIVMA/IDSA), the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), plus approximately 30 members with expertise in HIV clinical care, infectious disease management, and research in children. The panel members are selected from government, academia, and the healthcare community by the Executive Secretary and Co-Chairs and assigned to a working group for one or more of the guidelines' sections based on the member's area of subject matter expertise. Each working group is chaired by a panel member selected by the co-chairs. Members serve on the panel for a four-year term, with an option to be reappointed for additional terms. The list of the current working group members can be found in Appendix 2. Financial Disclosure and Management of Conflicts of Interest All members of the panel submit an annual written financial disclosure reporting any associations with manufacturers of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, or diagnostics used to manage HIV -related opportunistic infections. A list of these disclosures and the date of their last update are available in Appendix 3. The panel co- editors review each reported association for potential conflict of interest and determine the appropriate action: disqualification from the panel, disqualification/recusal from topic review and discussion, or no disqualification needed. A conflict of interest is defined as any direct financial interest related to a product addressed in the section of the guidelines to which a panel member contributes content. Financial interests include direct receipt by the panel member of payments, gratuities, consultancies, honoraria, employment, grants, support for travel or accommodation, or gifts from an entity having a commercial interest in that product. Financial interest also includes direct compensation for membership on an advisory board, data safety monitoring board, or speakers' bureau. Compensation and support that filters through a working group member ' s university or institution (e.g., grants, research funding) is not considered a conflict of interest.

A separate set of guidelines outlines similar recommendations for adults. These guidelines are also available on the AIDSinfo website (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov) . Update Plan Each working group and the co-editors meet at least every 6 months by teleconference to review data that may warrant modification of the guidelines. Updates may be prompted by approvals of new drugs, vaccines, medical devices, or diagnostics; by new information regarding indications or dosing; by new safety or efficacy data; or by other information that may affect prevention and treatment of HIV-related opportunistic infections. Updates that may significantly affect patient safety or treatment and that warrant rapid notification may be posted temporarily on the AIDSinfo website (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ) until the guidelines document can be updated. Public Comments After release of an update on the AIDSinfo website, the public is given a 2-week period to submit comments to the panel. These comments are reviewed, and a determination is made by the appropriate working group and the co-editors as to whether revisions are indicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time at contactus@aidsinfo.nih.gov .Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children CC-1Appendix 2.

Chemoprophylaxis of vaccinated HIV-infected children with severe immunosuppression also may be indicated based on health-care provider assessment of the exposure situation. Post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure. a Oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis duration: Recommended duration is 10 days when administered after a household exposure and 7 days after the most recent known exposure in other situations. For control of outbreaks in long-term care facilities and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis for a minimum of 2 weeks and up to 1 week after the most recent known case was identified (see www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ preview/mmwrhtml/rr6001a1.htm ). b Oseltamivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of influenza in children aged 2 weeks. It is not approved for prophylaxis in children aged <1 year. However, the CDC recommends that health-care providers who treat children ages 3 months to <1 year administer a chemoprophylaxis dose of 3 mg/kg body weight/dose once daily. Chemoprophylaxis for infants aged <3 months is not recommended unless the exposure situation is judged to be critical. Premature infants: Current weight-based dosing recommendations for oseltamivir are not appropriate for premature infants (i.e., gestational age at delivery <38 weeks). See J Infect Dis 202 [4]:563-566, 2010 for dosing recommendations in premature infants. Renal insufficiency: A reduction in dose of oseltamivir is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. c Zanamivir: Zanamivir is not recommended chemoprophylaxis in children aged <5 years old.November 6, 2013Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children EE-3Table 1: Primary Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children\u2014Summary of Recommendations (page 3 of 9) Indication First Choice Alternative Comments/Special IssuesLast Reviewed Influenza Primary Chemoprophylaxis Influenza A (ONLY) Oseltamivir-resistant, adamantane-sensitive strains Based on CDC influenza surveillance; for 2.5 mg/ kg body weight/dose twice daily (maximum dose of 150 mg/day) Aged 10 years <40 kg; 2.5 mg/kg body weight/dose twice daily 40 kg; 100 mg per dose twice daily (maximum dose of 200 mg/day)d Adamantanes: Because of resistance in currently circulating influenza A virus strains, amantadine and rimantadine are not currently recommended for chemoprophylaxis or treatment (adamantanes are not active against influenza B virus). However, potential exists for emergence of oseltamivir-resistant, adamantane-sensitive circulating influenza A strains. Therefore, verification of antiviral sensitivity of circulating influenza A strains should be done using the CDC influenza surveillance website: http://www. cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm If administered based on CDC antiviral sensitivity surveillance data, both amantadine and rimantadine are recommended for chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in children aged 1 yr. For treatment, rimantadine is only approved for use in adolescents aged 13 years. Rimantadine is preferred over amantadine because of less frequent adverse events. Some pediatric influenza specialists may consider it appropriate for treatment of children aged >1 year. Renal insufficiency: A reduction in dose of amantadine is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.November 6, 2013 Isosporiasis (Cystoisosporiasis)There are no U.S. recommendations for primary prophylaxis of isosporiasis.N/A Initiation of cART to avoid advanced immunodeficiency may reduce incidence; TMP-SMX prophylaxis may reduce incidence.November 6, 2013Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children EE-4Table 1: Primary Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children\u2014Summary of Recommendations (page 4 of 9) Indication First Choice Alternative Comments/Special IssuesLast Reviewed Malaria For Travel To Chloroquine-Sensitive Areas : Chloroquine base 5 mg/kg body weight base by mouth, up to 300 mg once weekly (equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg body weight chloroquine phosphate).

Please refer to the following website for the most recent recommendations based on region and drug susceptibility: http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ For travel to chloroquine-sensitive areas. Equally recommended options include chloroquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline (for children aged 8 years), and mefloquine; primaquine is recommended for areas with mainly P. vivax. G6PD screening must be performed prior to primaquine use. Chloroquine phosphate is the only formulation of chloroquine available in the United States; 10 mg of chloroquine phosphate = 6 mg of chloroquine base. For travel to chloroquine-resistant areas, preferred drugs are atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline (for children aged 8 years) or mefloquine.November 6, 2013 Microsporidiosis N/A N/A Not recommended December 15, 2016Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children EE-5Table 1: Primary Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children\u2014Summary of Recommendations (page 5 of 9) Indication First Choice Alternative Comments/Special IssuesLast Reviewed Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) Clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg body weight (maximum 500 mg) by mouth orally twice daily, or Azithromycin 20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 1200 mg) orally once weekly Azithromycin 5 mg/ kg body weight (maximum 250 mg) orally once daily Children aged >5 years: rifabutin 300 mg orally once daily with foodPrimary Prophylaxis Indicated for Children: Aged <1 year with CD4 <750 cells/mm3 to <2 years with CD4 count <500 cells/mm3; Aged 2 to <6 years with CD4 count cells/mm3 Aged 6 years with CD4 count <50 cells/mm3 Criteria for Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis : Do not discontinue in children age <2 years.

These patients often are receivingother medications, including antiretrovirals that interfere with metabolism or elimination of OI medications.In particular, protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors affect the CYP450 orother transporter systems and may be associated with clinically significant drug interactions. The integraseinhibitor raltegravir is metabolized by UGT1A1 and may be a suitable option when trying to minimizeinteractions with other drug classes. Table 5 provides clinicians with information regarding known or suspected drug interactions between drugscommonly used for treatment or prevention of HIV-associated OIs and treatment of HIV infection. Druginteraction information is generally obtained from studies involving healthy adult volunteers. Somepharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from studies involving HIV-infected adults, whereas data in childrenare extremely limited. New information continues to become available and it is important to carefully reviewa patient's current medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medications. It is difficult topredict the interaction potential when three or more drugs with similar metabolic pathways are co-administered and there is substantial inter-patient variability in the magnitude of these interactions. Whenpossible, alternative agents with less drug interaction potential or use of therapeutic drug monitoring shouldbe considered. Table 5 contains only a partial listing of drug interactions for drugs used to treat or prevent OIs.Thelinks below are excellent resources for investigating the potential for drug interactions. These tools includemore comprehensive information and provide up-to-date information as new PK data become available. http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/http://tdm.pharm.buffalo.edu/home/di_search/http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv-guidelines/32/drug-interactions/http://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.htmlhttp://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=ar-00-02http://www.nynjaetc.org/clinical_support.htmlhttp://www.clinicaloptions.com/inPractice.aspxhttp://epocrates.comGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenII-2Table 5: Significant Drug Interactions for Drugs Used to Treat or Prevent Opportunistic Infections(page 1 of 9)Drug NameOverlapping ToxicitiesRecommendation* The drug interactions included in this table were selected on the basis of their potential clinical significance and are notinclusive of all potential drug interactions (see drug label and the drug interaction websites listed for complete informationon drug interactions).Acyclovir(Zovirax)Overlapping Toxicities: Nephrotoxic drugsMonitor QT prolongation.BoceprevirPlease see Adult OI guidelinesfor information about drug interactions, including warnings about interactionsbetween boceprevir HIV protease co-administered with CYP450 inducers.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenII-3Table 5: Significant Drug Interactions for Drugs Used to Treat or Prevent Opportunistic Infections(page 2 of 9)Drug NameOverlapping ToxicitiesRecommendation* The drug interactions included in this table were selected on the basis of their potential clinical significance and are notinclusive of all potential drug interactions (see drug label and the drug interaction websites listed for complete informationon ciprofloxacin 2 hours before dose or consider switchingto azithromycin, which has less potential for druginteractions.Increases Concentration has lesspotential for drug interaction.For concomitant use of rifabutin and clarithromycin,consider before or 4 hoursafter the other medication.Overlapping Toxicities: Bone therapeutic failure.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenII-4Table 5: Significant Drug Interactions for Drugs Used to Treat or Prevent Opportunistic Infections(page 3 of 9)Drug NameOverlapping ToxicitiesRecommendation* The drug interactions included in this table were selected on the basis of their potential clinical significance and are notinclusive of all potential drug interactions (see drug label and the drug interaction websites listed for complete informationon drug interactions).ErythromycinIncreases Concentrations of Erythromycin and Co-Administered Medication: drugsCaution ARV drugs: saquinavir, need to saquinavir.

Recommended Immunization Schedule for HIV-Infected 0-6 United States, 2013(Last updated November 6, 2013; last reviewedNovember 6, 2013) This schedule summarizes recommendations for routine administration of vaccines for HIV-infected children0-6 years and indicates the recommended ages for vaccine administration in this population for childhoodvaccines licensed in the United States. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should beadministered at a subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. Licensed combination vaccines may be usedwhenever any component of the combination is indicated and other components of the vaccine are notcontraindicated and if approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that dose of the series. Providersshould consult the relevant Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices statement for detailedrecommendations. Clinically significant adverse events that follow immunization should be reported to theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Guidance about how to obtain and complete a V AERSform is available at http://www.vaers.hhs.govor telephone 800-822-7967.Hepatitis age: BirthAt Birth: Administer monovalent HepB to all newborns before hospital discharge. If mother is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive, administer HepB and 0.5 mL of hepatitis Bimmune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours after birth. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJJ-2If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer HepB within 12 hours after birth. Determine mother'sHBsAg status as soon as possible and if HBsAg-positive, administer HBIG as soon as possible After the Birth Dose:The HepB series should be completed with either monovalent HepB or a combination vaccine containingHepB. The second dose should be administered at ages 1 through 2 months. Monovalent HepB should beused for doses administered before 6 weeks. The final dose should be administered no earlier than age 24weeks. Infants who did not receive a birth dose should receive 3 doses of a HepB-containing vaccine onan age-appropriate scheduleFour-Month Dose:It is permissible to administer 4 doses of HepB when combination vaccines are administered after the birthdose. If monovalent HepB is used for doses after the birth dose, a dose at age 4 months is not needed.Post-Vaccination:Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg and the antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) after completion of at least 3 doses of a licensed HepB series, at ages 9 through 18 months(generally at the next well-child visit). Testing is recommended for HIV-infected children and should be performed 1 to 2 months afteradministration of the last dose of the vaccine series using a method that allows determination of aprotective level of anti-HBs (10 mIU/mL).Children with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after the primary schedule should receive a second series, followedby anti-HBs testing 1 to 2 months after the third dose, which usually is more practical than serologictesting after one or more doses of vaccine. Booster Dose:In HIV-infected children, the need for booster doses has not been determined. Annual anti-HBs testingand booster doses when anti-HBs levels decline to < 10 mIU/mL should be considered in individualswith ongoing risk for exposure. See MMWR2005:54(No. RR-16).Rotavirus vaccine (RV)Minimum age: 6 weeks Practitioners should consider the potential risks and benefits of administering rotavirus vaccine to infants withknown or suspected altered immunocompetence. Consultation with an immunologist or infectious diseasespecialist is advised. Limited safety and efficacy data are available for the administration of rotavirus vaccinesto infants who are potentially immunocompromised, including those who are HIV-infected. However, thefollowing considerations support vaccination of HIV-exposed or HIV-infected infants: a)In infants born to HIV-positive mothers, the HIV diagnosis may not be established before the age ofthe first rotavirus vaccine dose (only 1.5%-3% of HIV-exposed infants in the United States willeventually be determined to be HIV-infected), and b)Vaccine strains of rotavirus are considerably attenuated. The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks and 6 days; for the final dose in the series, itis 8 months and 0 days. Vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks and 0 days or older.If Rotarix\u00ae is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at 6 months is not indicated. Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Dtap)Minimum age: 6 weeks The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided that at least 6 months haveGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJJ-3elapsed since the third dose. Haemophilus Influenzae (PedvaxHIB\u00ae or ComVax\u00ae [Hep B-Hib]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose atage 6 months is not indicated. Hiberix should not be used for doses at ages 2, 4, or 6 months for the primary series but may be used asthe final dose in children aged 12 months through 4 years.One dose of Hib vaccine should be administered to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated persons aged 5years or older who have leukemia, malignant neoplasms, anatomic or functional asplenia (includingsickle cell disease), HIV infection, or other immunocompromising conditions.Pneumococcal Vaccine Minimum age: 6 weeks for pneumococcal (PCV); 2 years series begun 13-valent PCV (PCV13). Asingle supplemental dose of PCV13 is recommended for children aged 14 months through 71 monthswho have received an age-appropriate series of PCV7. For incompletely vaccinated children aged 24months through 71 months, administer 2 doses of PCV13 at least 8 weeks apart. Children who havepreviously received 3 PCV doses need only 1 dose. Children aged 2 years or older also should receive PPSV after their last PCV dose.Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV)Administer annually to HIV-infected children aged 6 months through 6 years and to all their eligibleclose contacts (including household members). TIV is recommended for HIV-infected children.For healthy, non-pregnant close contacts aged 2 years through 49 years, either live, attenuated influenzavaccine (LAIV) or TIV may be used. Children receiving TIV should receive 0.25 mL if aged 6 through 35 months or 0.5 mL if aged 3 years orolder. Administer 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks) to children aged younger than 9 years per currentinfluenza vaccine recommendations. Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Minimum age: 6 weeksIf 4 or more doses are administered prior to age 4 years, an additional dose should be administered atages 4 through 6 years.The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least 6 monthsafter the previous dose.Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine (MMR) Minimum age: 12 months Two doses of MMR vaccine for all HIV-infected individuals aged 12 months who do not have evidenceof current severe immunosuppression (i.e., individuals aged 5 years must have CD4 T lymphocyte[CD4] percentages 15% for 6 months; and individuals aged >5 years must have CD4 percentages15% and CD4 200 lymphocytes/mm3for 6 months) or other current evidence of measles, rubella, andmumps immunity. In cases when only CD4 cell counts or only CD4 percentages are available for thoseGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJJ-4older than age 5 years, the assessment of severe immunosuppression can be based on the CD4 values(count or percentage) that are available. In cases when CD4 percentages are not available for those aged5 years, the assessment of severe immunosuppression can be based on age-specific CD4 counts at thetime CD4 counts were measured; i.e., absence of severe immunosuppression defined as age-specific CD4 andCD4 count 500 lymphocytes/mm3while aged 1 through 5 years.The first dose should be administered at ages 12 months through 15 months and the second dose at ages4 years through 6 years, or as early as 28 days after the first dose.Individuals with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated prior to establishment of effectivecombination antiretroviral therapy (cART) should receive 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccineonce effective cART has been established (for individuals aged 5 years: must have CD4 percentages15% for 6 months; and for individuals aged must have CD4 percentages 15% and CD4200 lymphocytes/mm3for 6 months) unless they have other acceptable current evidence of measles,rubella, and mumps immunity.Varicella Vaccine Minimum age: 12 months Limited data are available on safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected childrenaged 1 year through 8 years in CDC immunologic categories 1 and 2 (CD4 T-lymphocyte percentages15% or greater) and clinical categories N, A, and B. Single-antigen varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children who have CD4percentages 15%. Eligible children should receive 2 doses 3 months apart, with the first doseadministered as soon as possible after the first birthday. Varicella vaccine is not recommended for HIV-infected children who have evidence of severeimmunosuppression (CD4 percentage <15% at any age; for those older than age 5 years, CD4 count<200 cells/mm3). MMRV vaccine has not been studied in HIV-infected children and should not be substituted for single-antigen varicella vaccine. Hepatitis A Vaccine (HepA)Minimum age: 12 months Administer to all children aged 12 months through 23 months. The 2 doses in the series should beadministered at least 6 months apart.Children who are not fully vaccinated by age 2 years can be vaccinated at subsequent visits.HepA is also recommended for children 24 months and older who live in areas where vaccinationprograms target older children, who are at increased risk of infection, or for whom immunity againsthepatitis A is desired. See MMWR2006;55(No. RR-7). Meningococcal Vaccine years formeningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4)Administer MCV4 to children aged 2 years through 6 years who have functional asplenia and certainother high-risk groups. A primary series of 2 doses should be administered with a minimum interval of 8weeks. See MMWR2007;56(48):1265-6.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenJJ-5Administer MCV4-D (Menactra) to infants/children 9 months through 23 months who have persistentcomplement component deficiency, are traveling to an area endemic for meningococcal disease, or areinvolved in a meningococcal outbreak.Children who received MPSV4 3 years previously and remain at increased risk of meningococcaldisease should be revaccinated with MCV4. HIV-infected children are not considered at increased risk of meningococcal disease because of HIVinfection, per se. Although the efficacy of MCV4 among HIV-infected children is unknown, providerscan vaccinate HIV-infected children. HIV-infected children who remain at increased risk of meningococcal disease should be vaccinated every5 years thereafter.Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenKK-1Figure 2. Recommended Immunization Schedule for HIV-Infected 7-18 United States 2013(Last updated November 6, 2013; last reviewedNovember 6, 2013) This schedule summarizes recommendations for routine administration of vaccines for HIV-infected childrenand adolescents aged 7 through 18 years and indicates the recommended ages for vaccine administration forvaccines licensed in the United States in 2013. Licensed combination vaccines may be used whenever acomponent of the combination is indicated and other components of the vaccine are not contraindicated andif approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that dose of the series, unless otherwise specified.Clinically significant adverse events that follow immunization should be reported to the Vaccine AdverseEvent Reporting System (V AERS). Guidance about how to obtain and complete a V AERS form is availableat http://www.vaers.hhs.govor telephone 800-822-7967. Tetanus And And Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap)Minimum age: 7 yearsIndividuals aged 11 through 18 years who have not received Tdap should receive a dose followed byTetanus Diphtheria (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter.Individuals aged 7 through 10 years who are not fully immunized against pertussis (including those nevervaccinated or with unknown pertussis status) should receive a single dose of Tdap. Refer to the catch-upschedule if additional doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine are needed.Tdap can be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus dose. Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV)Minimum age: 9 years Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenKK-2Note:Two HPV vaccines are licensed. A quadrivalent vaccine (HPV4) is licensed for use in females andmales; a bivalent vaccine (HPV2) is licensed for use in females. Because these are not live virus vaccines,they can be administered to individuals who are immunosuppressed because of disease or medication,including those who are HIV-infected. However, the immune response and vaccine efficacy may be less thanin immunocompetent individuals.HPV vaccines are most effective for both males and females when given before exposure to HPVthrough sexual contact. Administer the first dose at ages 11 or 12 years. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the firstdose (at least 24 weeks after the first dose). Administer the series at ages 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. HPV4 can be administered in a 3-dose series to individuals aged 9 through 10 years. Meningococcal Vaccine (Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine [MCV4])Individuals who receive the second dose of the primary series at or before age 11-12 years should receivea booster dose at age 16 years. Although the efficacy of MCV4 among HIV-infected patients is unknown,HIV-infected patients aged 7 through 10 years may elect vaccination. Influenza Vaccine (Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine [TIV])Administer annually to HIV-infected children and adolescents. Only TIV should be used in HIV-infectedindividuals. For healthy non-pregnant close contacts aged 2 through 49 years, either live, attenuatedinfluenza vaccine (LAIV) or TIV can be used. Administer 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks) to children aged younger than 9 years who arereceiving influenza vaccine for the first time or based on previous influenza vaccine history, per currentinfluenza vaccine recommendations. Pneumococcal Vaccine (Pneumococcal (PCV13) should be routinely administered toHIV-infected children aged 6 through 18 years who did not previously receive a dose of PCV13 beforeage 6 years. The dose should be administered at least 8 weeks after the previous dose of PCV .Administer 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at least 8 weeks after the last doseof PCV13 to children aged 2 years. A single revaccination dose should be administered 5 yearsthereafter. HIV-infected children who have already received a dose or doses of PPSV23 should receive a dose ofPCV13 a minimum of 8 weeks after the dose of PPSV23. A second dose of PPSV23 is recommended 5years later.Hepatitis A Vaccine (HepA)HepA is recommended for children older than age 23 months who live in areas where vaccinationprograms target older children, who are at increased risk of infection, or for whom immunity againstHepatitis A is desired. See MMWR2006;55(No. RR-7).Hepatitis B Vaccine (HepB)Administer the 3-dose series to those who were not previously vaccinated. Post-vaccination testing is recommended for HIV-infected individuals. Testing should be performed 1 to2 months after administration of the final dose. Individuals found to have anti-HBs levels of <10Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections In HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected ChildrenKK-3mIU/mL after the primary series should be revaccinated. Administration of 3 doses on an appropriateschedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1 to 2 months after the third dose, is usually more practical thanserologic testing after 1 or 2 doses of vaccine. Modified dosing regimens, including doubling of thestandard antigen dose, may increase response rates. However, data are limited on response to thesealternative vaccination schedules. In HIV-infected individuals, the need for booster doses has not been determined. Annual anti-HBs testingand booster doses when anti-HBs levels decline to <10 mIU/mL should be considered in individuals withongoing risk of exposure. See MMWR2005:54(No. RR-16).Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV)The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least 6 monthsafter the previous dose. For children who received an all-IPV or all-oral poliovirus (OPV) series, a fourth dose is not necessary ifthe third dose was administered at age 4 years. If both OPV and IPV were administered as part of a series, a total of 4 doses should be administered,regardless of a child's current age. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine (MMR)If eligible and not previously vaccinated, administer 2 doses with the second dose at least 28 days afterthe first dose, or administer the second dose for those who received only 1 dose, with at least 28 daysbetween doses. Two doses of MMR vaccine are recommended for all HIV-infected individuals aged 12 months who donot have evidence of current severe immunosuppression (i.e., individuals aged >5 years must have CD4T lymphocyte [CD4] percentages 15% and othercurrent evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity. In cases when only CD4 counts or only CD4percentages are available for those older than age 5 years, assessment of severe immunosuppression canbe based on the CD4 values (count or percentage) that are available.Individuals with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated prior to establishment of effectivecombination antiretroviral therapy (cART) should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMRvaccine once effective cART has been established (individuals aged >5 years: must have CD4percentages 15% and CD4 200 lymphocytes/mm3for 6 months) unless they have other acceptablecurrent evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity. Varicella VaccineLimited data are available safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected childrenaged 1 through 8 years in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunologic categories 1 and 2(CD4 percentages 15%) and clinical categories N, A, and B. Varicella vaccine should be considered forHIV-infected children aged 1 through 8 years with CD4 percentages 15%. Eligible children shouldreceive 2 doses at least 3 months apart. Data are lacking on use of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected children older than age 8 years. However, onthe basis of expert opinion, the safety of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected individuals older than age 8years with similar levels of immune function (CD4 age-specific percentages 15% or count 200cells/mm3) is likely to be similar to that for children aged 8 years. Immunogenicity may be lower inHIV-infected adolescents (and adults).
