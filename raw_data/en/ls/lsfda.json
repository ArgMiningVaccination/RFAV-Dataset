They are said to be themost organised and stable examples ofphysical matter in the natural world and assuch they represent the lowest state of entropy(disorder) possible. 1 Examples of crystals areagate, alexandrite, amber, amethyst, bloodstone, turquoise.Countless and medicinal propertieshave been attributed to crystals and gemstonesover the centuries. For example, diamondsgave immunity to poison and revealedinfidelity, amethysts protected against drunken-ness, and sapphires enabled the wearer toescape from prison. 2 Crystal balls from high-quality rock crystal found in the Alps were oncevery popular. In Europe, crystal gazing wasused not only as an aid to foreseeing thefuture, but also as a stimulus to the mind.Musicians, authors and even politicians bene-fited from self-hypnosis induced by crystalgazing. For many centuries, because the originof disease was unknown, its treatment waslinked with magic and superstition. Definition Crystal therapy, crystal healing or gem therapyis defined as the use of crystals, individuallyselected for their wavelengths, to influence thebody's \"energy field\". 3 Crystal healing is basedon tuning in to the natural vibrations of amineral from the earth, which has infused it withits energies. 4 Crystals and gems are said to bean inexhaustible source of energy, as they canbe used to heal, invigorate, balance or tran-quillise in an all-together natural way. Historical development Humans have always searched for ways tobeautify themselves. Carrying crystals asprotective amulets or wearing them as jewellerywere the simplest ways to utilise their naturalpotential. Evidence has been found for the useof gemstones as jewellery as early as thePalaeolithic Age. 1 The first written accounts ofcrystal healing came from the ancient Egyp-tians who gave detailed recipes for usinggemstones such as malachite for healing andprotection. 1 Religious and cultural connections Gemstones have had a place in religion forthousands of years. The Bible refers to thetwelve stones set in the breastplate of the HighPriest, symbolising the twelve tribes of Israel. 2 In the book of Revelations twelve stones arealso mentioned as the foundation stones of thewall of New Jerusalem. Though the symbolismof each stone is open to speculation, most ofthese stones have been used in churches inone form or another since the inception ofChristianity. Precious stones adorn the tiaraand mitre of the Pope and bishops as well asthe shrines and icons found in Christianchurches.While many of the beliefs surrounding CRYSTAL HEALING andGEM THERAPY - \"Using energy vibrations to heal and harmonise\" Ilse Truter, Department of Pharmacy, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 55SA Pharmaceutical Journal - September 2006gemstones are regarded in the scien-tifically influenced Western (and mainlyChristian) thinking as perhaps primarilyof historic interest, the Eastern religionshave a far greater reverence for gem-stones. The Chinese believed that allnatural things have an animate spirit oftheir own. 2 Jade is, for example, thesymbol of the virtues of mercy, modes-ty, courage, justice and wisdom.The Greeks made ornaments of plaingold until around 400 BC when avariety of gems and cameos (preciousand semi-precious gemstones carvedin relief on one layer with another con-trasting layer as background) wereused. 2 Gemstones were also widelyused in the production of seals, carveddies or stamps to mark documents orobjects with a sign of official origin orownership. Magical and healing properties Although the healing properties ofcertain gemstones were first recordedin the early Egyptian days, it was notuntil Roman times that scholars suchas Pliny wrote of gemstones as a formof medicine. 2 It was the ecclesiasticalwriters who compiled the first majortreatises on healing with gems. 2 The use of gemstones for healing wascarried out in different ways. At times,the mere presence of the stone wasthought to be sufficient to effect a cure.At other times the gem was placed onthe affected body part and sometimesthe stone was powdered and eaten.Successes achieved by the variousapplications of gemstones may nothave been due to the gems directly, butto the effect of suggestion on thesufferer. Failures were then often ex-cused by the explanation that the stonewas not \"genuine\". Crystal healing today The majority of crystals used today forhealing are minerals. 1 The rocks wherethese crystals are found are aggre-gates of minerals and are described asigneous, sedimentary or metamorphic,depending on how they were formed.For a mineral to qualify as a crystal, theatoms that make it up must normally bearranged in a systematic, orderly andrepeating three-dimensional structure.These arrangements determine thecrystal's properties, including its hard-ness, colour and type of symmetry.Various types of crystals are used,namely natural, raw or tumbledcrystals, terminations, wands orfashioned crystals (as in jewellery).Clear quartz is known as the \"masterhealer\" or \"cure all\" because it containsthe full spectrum of visible white light - a broad spectrum healing energy whichclears disease from all levels. Clearquartz crystals are said to stabilise,focus and amplify the vital life-force,which heightens natural healing powerand healing potential as well asstimulating personal growth andspiritual development. Imitation or syn-thetic crystals are not suitable forhealing.Some people choose crystalsintuitively, while others select crystalson the basis of therapeutic qualities.Crystals are usually purified before andafter use to ensure that any residualdisharmonies are removed and that thecrystals are filled with positive energy.Different cleansing techniques existdepending on the specific crystal, forexample some crystals can be cleanedwith water, some with salt, others withsmudging, sound or specialist cleaningproducts. When a crystal is not in use itshould be wrapped in a soft cloth. Conditions frequently treated A wide range of mental and physicalconditions are claimed to benefit fromcrystal or gem therapy. 3 Table 1 givesa list of some of the healing propertiesthat have been attributed to variousgemstones over the years. Types of treatment Crystals are used in various ways fortreatment. Many people also usecrystals in combination with otherhealing methods. Wearing of jewellery Crystals or gems can be set in jewellery and kept close to the body. Aparticularly popular jewellery item formany years was, for example, thesignet ring. Feng shui Feng shui, the ancient Oriental art, hasnine \"cures\", all designed to repel,dispel or dissipate stagnant or harmfulenergy (or chi ) - of these, crystals areprobably the most popular. 1 Largeamethyst geodes or quartz clusters aresaid to be effective room cleansers,while quartz obelisks are said to bepotent energy enhancers that mag-netise or pull positive chi towards them.Crystals are therefore often used inhomes and offices to improve thequality of everyday life, and to absorbany bad vibrations that are caused bycommon pollutants and machinery(including computers). Electrocrystal therapy In electrocrystal therapy, the body isinitially scanned with a specially adap-ted video camera that relays a colouredpicture of the auric field onto a com-puter screen. 5 The therapist marksthose areas where the colour of theaura is inappropriate, indicating stressor dysfunction. Electrocrystal therapyuses quartz crystals in saline solutionthat are enclosed in a sealed, glasselectrode connected to a battery. 5 Up Table 1: Healing properties attributed to gemstones over the years 2 carnelian, malachite, turquoise, magnetiteWoundsCarnelian COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SA Pharmaceutical Journal - September 200656 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE to five electrodes are placed againstthe affected area or over a chakrapoint. The crystals are electricallystimulated, which amplifies their naturalhealing vibrations until they vibrate andresonate at a desired frequency. Thistreatment is thought to bring the en-dogenous fields back to a harmoniousstate. Crystal cards Crystal cards, created to be worn onthe body, were developed as a result ofthe NASA space programme. 5 Astro-nauts travel into space with a numberof pyramid-shaped quartz crystals,electronically charged to vibrate at thefrequency of the earth's geomagneticfield, to combat the negative effects ofspending time outside the earth'smagnetic field. Electronic gem therapy Electronic gem therapy blends moderntechnology with traditional Ayurvedicmedicine by combining gemstones orcrystals, coloured light and electronicamplification. 5 Depending on the con-dition, patients either require coolinggems such as emerald, topaz or car-nelian, or warming gems such as ruby,chrysoberyl or citrine. 5 During treat-ment the gemstone is electronicallyvibrated at a frequency set for a specificcondition. The energy from the gem-stone is focused via special colouredlamps called gem transducers onto thepart of the body requiring treatment. Itis believed the treatment providesadditional energy needed to bringabout self-healing. The seven chakrasare assigned different gemstonescorresponding to their rates. Gem essences Gem essences are bottled essences ofgemstones that are made by immersingthe stones in pure water and leavingthem in natural sunlight. 1 The sun'senergy percolates through the stonesinto the water taking the gem'svibrations with it (transferring their\"vibratory signature\" into the water). Itis believed that they are more effectivewhen taken in a relaxed state and atleast half an hour before or after eating.Normally seven drops are taken threetimes a day under the tongue, but it canalso be dissolved and sipped slowly,placed on a meridian, added to bath-water or massage oil, or sprayedaround the body. Meditating with a crystal Crystals of the quartz family, such asclear quartz, amethyst and rose quartz,are the crystals used most frequently inhealing. Amethyst is the \"stone ofmeditation\", creating a state of en-hanced spirituality and contentment.Clear quartz represents the clarity ofmind that people hope to achievethrough meditation. Maintaining a focuson a crystal helps quiet thoughts duringmeditation. The crystal is held orplaced in front of the person on thefloor or on a small table. Some peopleuse three similar crystals and positionthem in an equilateral triangle, forminga charged energy field in which to sit. Chakra cleansing and revitalisation In crystal bodywork, people place crys-tals on the chakras as they meditate.Illnesses are treated with certain gemsand crystals by laying them on oraround the body or even on themeridian points of the body.In a previous article on colour therapy,the seven main chakras wereidentified. 6 It is said that the chakrascontrol the organs and glands of thebody and each of the seven mainchakras relate to a specific area of thebody. The flow of energy between thechakras can affect physical health aswell as emotional feelings of well-being. When the chakras are clear andvitalised, each resembling a whirlingcentre of energy, the body is at itshealthiest. However, when one of thechakras is not in harmony or a block-age occurs, this will hinder the flow ofenergy.It is thought that the positive vibration ofgemstones can harmonise the chakrasand allow the energy to flow freely.Different stones are thought to be moreeffective with each chakra, usuallyassociated with the colour of the stones(see Table 2). Some stones, such asrock crystal, diamonds and sugilite, areconsidered to be helpful in clearingblockages in all the chakras.The method that is used to clean orrevitalise the chakras is to lie down andplace a suitable stone on each chakraand relax in this way for about 10minutes. It is best to treat all sevenchakras at the same time, but if acrystal is used start with the root chakraand move the crystal up the body,allowing about three minutes on eachchakra. When placed on each chakrathe point of the crystal should beupwards, pointing towards the crownchakra. Precautions and adverse effects There are no known safety concerns. 3 Gemstone Links Other related applications of crystal orgem therapy are summarised below. Signs of the Zodiac Astrology is based on the supposedinfluences of the stars and planets onhuman affairs and terrestrial events bytheir positions and aspects. It isbelieved that there is a relationshipbetween each planet and each sign ofthe zodiac and every person and everyobject (including gemstones) on theearth. It is thus thought by many that theinfluence of the planets over humanfortunes is enhanced by wearing thegem appropriate to the planet or zodiacsign concerned.
