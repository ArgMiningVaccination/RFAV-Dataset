Executive Summary The enabling legislation of the dairy producer and fluid milk processor promotion programs requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to submit an annual report to the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The dairy promotion programs are conducted under t he Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4501 et seq. ) (Dairy Act); the Dairy Research Order (7 CFR \u00a7 1150) (Dairy Order); the Fluid Milk Promotion Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6401 et seq. ) (Fluid Milk Act); and the Fluid Milk Promotion Order (7CFR \u00a7 1160) (Fluid Milk Order), respectively. This report includes summaries of the activities for the Dairy and Fluid Milk programs, including an accounting of funds collected and spent; USDA activities; and an independent analysis of the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns of the two programs. Unless otherwise noted, this report addresses program activities for the fiscal period January 1 through Decembe r 31, 2011, of the Dairy Promotion and Research Program and the Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program. National Dairy Promotion and Research Program Mandatory assessments collected under the Dairy Act totaled $98.4 million in 2011 , including assessment s and interest income . The National Dairy Promotion and Research Board (Dairy Board) p ortion of the revenue from the 15 -cent per hundredweight producer assessment was $97.6 million and the 7.5- cent per hundredweight dairy importer assessment was $761,000. Qualified Programs revenue was $184.5 million, for 2011. On March 17, 2011, USDA announced a final rule that amended the Dairy Order and established a dairy import assessment program as required by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill) and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill). Additionally, the term \"United States\" was amende d in the Dairy Act to mean all S tates, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. All provisions of t he final rule were effective April 1, 2011 , except those regarding dairy importer assessments, which became effective August 1, 2011. Details of the import assessment program are presented in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. Expenditures by the Dairy Board and many of the Qualified Programs are integrated through a joint process of planning and program implementation so that the programs on the national, regional, State, and local level work together. The Dairy Board continued to develop and implement programs to expand the human consumption of dairy products by focusing on partnerships and innovation, product positioning with consumers, and new places for dairy product consumption. Focusing on health and wellness, the Dairy Board continued its support for F uel Up to Play 60, a partnership between the National Dairy Council (NDC), the National Football League (NFL), and in collaboration with the USDA, to combat childhood obesity in schools. Through the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy, the Dairy Board continued its focus on maintaining consumer confidence in dairy products through food safety workshops that provide education to dairy processors on best practices and techniques for in -plant pathogen control. Through the Dairy Research Institute, the Dairy Board continued its support for nutrition, product , and sustainability 1 research and launched Dairy Research Insights, an informative monthly e -newsletter for the dairy industry that highlights technical insights related to the priority areas of dairy nutritio n research, product research, and sustainability. Details of the activities of the dairy producer and dairy importer program are presented in Chapter 1. National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program The National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board (Fluid Milk Board) continued to administer a generic fluid milk promotion and consumer education program funded by America's fluid milk processors. The program is designed to educate Americans about the benefits of milk, increase milk consumption, and mai ntain and expand markets and uses for fluid milk products in the 48 States and the District of Columbia. During 2011, the Fluid Milk Board embarked upon the industry's first -ever long range planning project. In doing so, research revealed that a key strategy to reverse th e decline in fluid milk consumption was to focus on consumer occasions, and \"Breakfast at home\" was identified as a key occasion and new focal point for the Fluid Milk Board's activities. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the Fluid Mi lk Board's existing work around post -workout chocolate milk consumption, or \"Refuel,\" was also a focal point in 2011. 2011 kicked off with \"Pour One More,\" which encouraged Moms to \"pour one more\" serving of milk for herself and her family, highlighting that Americans are falling short of the essential nutrients in their diets which milk readily provides. Similarly, the Fluid Milk Board launched Una Mas Cuenta (One More Counts), a parallel program with the goal of educating Hispanic consumers and giving them an actionable message to help improve their family's health and well-being. By emphasizing milk's nutrient density, the campaign encouraged Hispanic moms to pour one more serving of milk for herself and her family to help close the nutrient gap. For teens, the program supported messages to keep future moms drinking milk and \"The Power of 9\" - a program focused upon milk's nine essential nutrients, showed teen girls that making good food choices and drinking low fat or fat free milk can help them look great on the outside and feel confident and strong on the inside. T he Fluid Milk Board's messaging for the \"Refuel W ith Chocolate Milk\" campaign continue d to stress the importance of muscle recovery and rehydration post -exercise by drinking a glass of lo w fat or fat free chocolate milk . Additionally, research from the long range planning project revealed that adults, aged 18 -34, who exercise regularly and are not chocolate milk rejecters, are the most viable refuel targets - with an estimated audience of 42 million consumers. Assessments generated $ 104.6 million in 20 11. The Fluid Milk Order requires the Fluid Milk Board to return 80 percent of the funds received from California processors to the California Milk Processor Board. The amount returned to California from the 2011 assessments was $ 9.8 million. The California fluid milk processor promotion program uses the funds to conduct its promotion activities, which include the got milk? \u00ae advertising campaign. The 2011 activities of the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program are presented in the Fluid Milk Board section in Chapter 1 of this report. USDA Oversight USDA has oversight responsibility for the dairy and fluid milk promotion programs. The oversight objectives ensure that the Boards and Qualified Programs properly account for all 2 program funds and that they administer the programs in accordance with the respective Acts and Orders. All advertising, promotional, research, and educational materials are developed under established guid elines. All Board budgets, contracts, and advertising materials are reviewed and approved by USDA. USDA employees attend all Board and Committee meetings, monitor all Board activities, and have responsibility for obtaining an independent evaluation of the programs. Additional USDA responsibilities relate to nominating and appointing Board members, amending the Orders, conducting referenda, assisting with noncompliance cases, and conducting periodic program audits. The Boards reimburse the Secretary, as required by the Acts, for all of USDA's costs of program oversight and for the independent analysis. In 2011 the Secretary of Agriculture appointed 10 members to the Dairy Board and 6 me mbers to the Fluid Milk Board. Chapter 2 details USDA's oversight activities. Independent Analysis Chapter 3 presents the results of the independent econometric analysis, conducted by Texas A&M University, on the effectiveness of the programs implemented by the Dairy Board and the Fluid Milk Board. It is estimated tha t the generic fluid milk marketing activities sponsored by the programs have helped mitigate the decline of fluid milk consumption. Due to the dairy promotion programs, fluid milk consumption was 5.8 percent higher than it otherwise would have been over t he period of the study. Specifically, gains in revenue at the farm level were greater than the costs of the programs. The benefit cost ratios for fluid milk were calculated to be $3.95 for every dollar invested; for cheese $4.43 for every dollar invested; and for butter $6.26 for every dollar invested. Details of Texas A&M's independent evaluation are presented in Chapter 3. 3 Chapter 1 The Dairy and Fluid Milk Promotion Programs The Dairy B oard and the Fluid Milk Board continued to develop and implement programs to expand the human consumption of fluid milk and dairy products. T his chapter details the activities of each board . National Dairy Promotion and Research Board The mission of the Dairy Board is to coordinate a promotion and research program that maintains and expands domestic and foreign markets for fluid milk and dairy products. The Dairy Board is responsible f or administering the Dairy Order, developing plans and programs, approving budgets , and monitoring the results of the programs. The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) appoints 38 members to the Dairy Board, 36 of whom are dairy producers that represent 12 geographic regions within the United States , and 2 of whom represent dairy importers. The appointments are made from nominations submitted by producer organizations, importer organizations, general farm organizations, and qualified dairy product promot ion, research, or nutrition education programs. Members serve staggered three- year terms with no member serving more than two consecutive terms. Total Dairy Board actual revenue for 20 11 was $9 8.4 million (including assessments and interest). The Dai ry Board amended its budget to $103.9 million by incorporating program development funds not budgete d previously and carry -forward from their 20 10 budget. The Dairy Board budget for 2012 projects total revenue of $100.2 million from domestic and import assessments and interest. The Dairy Board 's administrative budget conti nued to be within the 5-percent -of-revenue limitation required by the Dairy Order. A list of actual income and expenses for 2011 is provided in Appendix B -1. USDA's oversig ht and eval uation expenses for 2011 are listed in Appendix B -2. Appendix B -3 displays the Dairy Board's approved budget for 2011. An independent auditor's report for 2011 is provided in Appendix C -1. The Dairy Board has two standing committees: the Finance and Ad ministration (F&A) Committee and the Executive Committee. The F&A Committee is made up of the Dairy Board officers and appointees named by the Dairy Board Chair. The Dairy Board Treasurer is the c hair of the F&A Committee, and the full Dairy Board serve s as the Executive Committee. The remaining committees for the Dairy Board are joint program committees with the United Dairy Industry Association (UDIA). Dairy Management Inc. (DMI), a management and staffing corporation , is a joint undertaking between the Dairy Board and U DIA. UDIA is a federation of 19 of the 66 Qualified Programs under the direction of a board of directors. DMI manage s the Dairy Board programs as well as those of the American Dairy Association \u00ae and National Dairy Council\u00ae. The m ission of DMI is to drive increased sales of and demand for dairy products and ingredients, on behalf of dairy producer s and dairy importers . DMI works p roactively in partnership with leaders and innovators to increase and apply knowledge that leverages opportunities to expand dairy 4 markets. The DMI Board of Directors comprises all Dairy Board (3 8) and all UDIA (4 5) members. Voting is equalized be tween the Dairy Board and UDIA. DMI serves both boards and facilitates the integration of promotion funds thr ough a joint process of planning and program implementation so that the programs on the national, regional, State, and local level work together. The Dairy Board and UDIA Board must separately approve the DMI budget and annual plan before they can be impl emented. In September 2010, both boards approved the 2011 unified dairy promotion plan budget and national implementation programs. During 2011, DMI continued to implement a national staffing structure which utilizes personnel throughout DMI and the UDIA federation to plan and execute the national programs. DMI funds 1 to 3- year research projects that support marketing efforts. Six Dairy Foods Research Centers and one Nutrition Institute provide much of the research. Their locations and the research ob jectives are listed in Appendix E -1. DMI's dairy foods competitive research activities and nutrition competitive research projects can be found in Appendices E -2 and E -3, respectively. Universities and other industry researchers throughout the United Sta tes compet e for these research contracts. The joint Dairy and UDIA Board committee structure provides the framework for DMI program activities. The Dairy Board and UDIA Board Chairs assign their respective board members to the following joint program committees: Research and Insights; Health and Wellness; Export and Ingredients; and Producer Relations and Consumer Confidence. Each committee elects a Chair and Vice -Chair. The joint committees and the DMI staff are responsible for setting program prioriti es, planning activities and proje cts, and evaluating results. During 2011, the Dairy and UDIA Board met jointly six times. In 2011, DMI again hosted dairy director regional planning forums across the country to review and create marketing strategies fo r development of the unified dairy promotion plan. These forums are designed to create one unified dairy promotion plan and allow opportunity for grass roots dairy farmers to ask questions, raise concerns, and offer their thinking on the plan's direction and development. The following information describes Dairy Board and UDIA program activities along with new programs and initiatives implemented in 20 11. National Dairy Council \u00ae The National Dairy Council\u00ae http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org (NDC), the nutrition marketing arm of DMI, has been the leader in dairy nutrition research, education, and communication since 1915. NDC provides timely, scientifically sound nutrition information to the media, physicians, dieticians, nurses, educators, consumers, and other health professionals. Additionally, NDC funds independent research to aid in the ongoing discovery of information about dairy foods' important role in a healthy lifestyle. This research provi des insights to industry for new dairy product innovation. 5 Health professional outreach remained a critical component of NDC and the 3 -Every -Day program. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Dieteti c Association, the National Medical Association , the School Nutrition Association, and the National Hispanic Medical Association all continued their support and partnership with DMI and 3- Every -Day . By working with key health professional partners like these, DMI continued to provide a clear, practical message to the public on the importance of consuming three daily servings of low -fat and fat -free dairy . Combined, these organizations represent more than 250,000 health professionals nationwide. As an extension of its online engagement of health professionals, NDC continued its blog , \"The Dairy nutritionists , and c ommunication experts, as well as guest experts. Through the blog, NDC provides the latest news, analysis , and opinion on nutrition and health research related to dairy. Child Nutrition and Fitness Initiative The Child Nutrition and Fitness Initiative (CNFI) is a platform of health and wellness initiatives designed to improve the health and wellness of the nation's youth, many of whom are overweight and undernourished. CNFI's initiatives are focused on reaching youth in schools and builds on existing programs, including New Look of School Milk and Expanding Breakfast . The programs use youth-focused messaging to educate and motivate children to consume a healthy diet that includes milk and dairy products and achieve daily physical activity. Additional ly, CNFI's priorities align with the strategies of the Health and Wellness Committee of the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy . Fuel Up to Play 60 Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP60) is the centerpiece of CNFI. This in-school program combines the nutrition expertise of NDC and the fitness expertise and star power of the NFL to combat childhood obesity and provide youth with resources necessary to improve their personal health and school environment. FU TP60 is based on the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Am ericans that recommend the consumption of more fruits, vegetables, low -fat and fat -free dairy foods, and whole grains , and getting 60 minutes of daily physical activity . FUTP60 reached more than 3 8 million students in more than 7 3,000 schools during the 2011/2012 school year. Students and schools joined the program by signing up at www.fueluptoplay60.com . Each enrolled school received a School Wellness Kit that contained in-school promotional materials and a \"Playbook\" containing healthy eating and physical activity strategies, or \"plays.\" Each of the plays could be tailored to individual school health and wellness needs . Students were encouraged to form teams, with supervision from an adult program advisor, to carry out the plays and generate excitement for making healthy changes throughout the student body. 6 In July, FUTP60 recognized students' commitments to making healthy changes by hosting a Student Ambassador Summit in Washington, D.C. Thirty -one student leaders were chosen from thousands of applicants to attend the summit to collaborate on in -school solutions to the childhood obesity epidemic. Student ambassadors, along with their program advisors, participated in leadership training sessions, s hared success stories and tips, and provided feedback on the program. The event featured a healthy cooking demonstration by Top Chef Carla Hall and an NFL fitness session with St. Louis Rams quarterback Sam Bradford. Let's Move! In December 2011, Fir st Lady Michelle Obama and FUTP60 announced a collaboration to strengthen each program's efforts and improve the overall health of the nation's youth. Let's Move! , First Lady Michelle Obama's initiative , is dedicated to solving c hildhood obesity in a gene ration . FUTP60, Let's Move! , and the Ad Council produced a public service announcement featuring Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, encouraging youth to join the FUTP60 movement. FUTP60 and Let 's Mov e! started the 2011/2012 school year with new tools and resources for students to take control of their own health and access fun ways to achieve active lifestyles. FUTP60 and Let's Move! also encourage schools to meet USDA's Healthier U.S. School Challenge through participating in FUTP60. Additionally, both programs promote the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition's Presidential Active Lifestyle Award, given to students who perform 60 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week for 6 weeks and practice healthy eating habits. Gen YOUth Fou ndation The Gen YOUth Foundation (Foundation) was launched in 2011 by NDC as a non -profit organization whose mission is to create a movement that will inspire youth to change their behavior. The Foundation will work with schools, communities, and busines s partners to develop and support programs that create lasting changes in the child health and wellness arena, including FUTP60. The Foundation is governed and managed by a board of directors that covers multiple fields of expertise, including agriculture, health and nutrition, sports and fitness, media, education, and the culinary arts. The Foundation B oard meet s twice a year to identify sustainable solutions to the childhood obesity epidemic. Partnerships Domino's DMI continued its partnership wi th Domino's Pizza in 2011 through continued collaboration to increase the availability of Smart Slice . Domino's Smart Slice is a line of kid -approved pizzas that use light and reduced- sodium mozzarella cheese in addition to other reduced- fat and reduced -sodium ingredients. Domino's Smart Slice is available in more than 400 U.S. schools. 7 McDonald's DMI also continued its partnership with McDonald's in 2011. According to DMI, the partnership has led to more than 1.7 billion pounds of additional dairy sales between 2009 and 2011. Through the checkoff, six employees provide technical assistance, support, and dairy expertise to McDonald's. Export and Dry Ingredients DMI's export enhancement program is implemented by the U.S. Dairy Export Council (USDEC) , supported through the checkoff program. USDEC receives primary funding from three sources: DMI's checkoff program, USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and membership dues from dairy cooperatives, processors, exporters and suppliers. In 2011, U SDEC received $15.5 million from DMI; $6 million from USDA's Market Access Program, Foreign Market Development Program, and other FAS programs that support commodity groups in promotion of their commodities in foreign markets; $920,000 from membership dues ; and $658,000 from other sources. USDEC began its 16th year of operation in 2011, and its total annual budget was approximately $23 million. USDEC has offices in Washington, D.C.; Mexico City, Mexico; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Hong Kong, Taipei, and Shanghai, China; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ; Bangkok, Thailand; Beirut, Lebanon; Oxford, England; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (Figure 1-1). In 2011, USDEC embarked on a \"strategic evolution\" to reexamine its focus to ensure that it maximizes resources t o align with a shifting global business environment and more committed U.S. dairy exporters. While USDEC's early goal was to help the U.S. industry to familiarize itself with export sales and introduce dairy products to overseas markets, the next level of programming aims to solidify the United States as a consistent global supplier. Getting into markets, staying in them, and providing members the tools to meet and compete for customer need s is the goal of the USDEC 3- year business plan. USDEC will ad dress the evolving business needs of the industry through greater emphasis in market access and regulatory affairs, more actionable strategic insights and research, and shift promotional assistance to markets and segments with better growth and cost/benefit op portunities. Export data confirms that U.S. dairy product export value reached $4.8 billion while volume reached 3.2 billion pounds in 2011 (Figure 1-2). In 2011, 13.3 percent of total U.S. milk solids were exported, while imports represented 2.9 percent . For comparison, in 2010, exports represented 12.8 percent of U.S. milk solids production and imports remained the same at 2.9 percent (Figure 1 -3). Exports represented 49 percent of the nonfat dry milk (NDM) and skimmed milk powder (SMP) produced in the United States in 2011, 55 percent of the whey prote ins, 69 percent of the lactose, 8 Figure 1 -1.

Sourc e: USDEC, NMPF, USDA 7.6 percent of the butter, and 4.7 percent of the cheese. The NDM/SMP and cheese percentages were all -time highs. Mexico ($1.1 billion, the first time in which sales exceeded a billion dollars ), Southeast Asia ($963 million) and Cana da ($496 million) remained the largest destinations for U.S. dairy products. USDEC, with the support of the dairy checkoff , continued working to improve the global (export and U.S.) ingredient capabilities of domestic dairy companies by providing up-to -date information on market conditions, global trade trends, and regulatory requirements for export. USDEC continued the use of the Web site www.innovatewithdairy.com to help increase demand for U.S. dairy in gredients by promoting how dairy adds the difference in taste, functionality, and convenience. The ingredient program supports dairy product and nutrition research, ingredient applications, development and technical assistance for the dairy, food and beve rage industries. Dairy, food, and beverage manufacturers use this program to find know -how, laboratory, and professional resources to help develop or improve foods using dairy ingredients. Publications that support the innovation and ingredients progr am include: (1) Dairy Council Digest -published six times per year and focuses on the latest dairy nutrition research relevant to dairy, food and beverage manufacturers , and health professionals; (2) Ingredient Specification Sheets -cover technical basics o f a variety of dairy ingredients and are updated as new data is available; (3) Dairy Herald -reports periodically on how food formulators and markets can take 10 advantage of taste, cost, functional, and nutritional appeal of dairy ingredients; (4) Application Monographs -published as necessary, provide a comprehensive look at how whey protein and other dairy ingredients can be used in foods and beverages for different functionality needs; (5) Tools for Innovation-a periodic supplement from DMI and Dairy Foods magazine that covers dairy product trends and research; (6) Innovations in Dairy -a technical bulletin, published two to three times a year on specific topics in dairy products, ingredients, processing, and packaging; and (7) Dairy Business View -an e- newsletter published bi -monthly with Dairy Foods magazine that covers dairy industry news, new technologies, business trends, innovation, and research. Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy Dairy producers, processors , and manufacturers announced an unprecedented agreement in 2008 to collaborate on pre -competitive initiatives through a new Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy (Innovation Center). The goal of the agreement is to accelerate industry innovation throughout the supply chain to increase sales in an incr easingly competitive consumer marketplace. The Innovation Center was established by dairy farmers through DMI. It is the first organization of its kind to bring together milk producers, processors , and manufacturers under one organization to collaborate on major issues affecting the industry. The Innovation Center provides a forum for the entire dairy industry to work together to offer consumers the products they want \u2014when and where they want them \u2014and increase dairy sales through pre -competitive collabora tion. It combines the collective resources of the industry to provide consumers with nutritious dairy products and foster industry innovation for healthy people, healthy products , and a healthy planet. The Board of Directors for the Innovation Center represents leaders from across the dairy value chain, including produce rs and chief executives of the N ation's leading processors, manufacturers and brands. The Innovation Center is supported and staffed by DMI . The Innovation Center will move forward its priorities through enlisting cross -industry operational c ommittees charged with developing action plans. These committees and purposes include: Health and Wellness Committee - to i ncrease category sales and demand for dairy products by identifying and meet ing the health and wellness needs and desires of consumers ; Research and Insights Committee - to act as the steward of the pre -competitive innovation assets and resources of the industry; Globalization - to provide a strategic analysis of the global dairy landscape and a common understanding of the challenges, opportunities , and threats posed by increasing globalization to the U.S. dairy industry ; Sustainability - to provide consumers with the nutritious dairy products they want in a way that is economicall y viable, environmentally sound, and socially responsible ; and Food Safety - to improve food safety practices and to protect trust in dairy . 11 Sustainability In 2011, Dairy leaders continued their industry -wide commitment and action plan to reduce th e dairy industry's carbon footprint while increasing busines s value from farm to consumer. The action plan was an outcome of the industry's June 2008 Sustainability Summit for U.S. Dairy, a gathering of 250 leaders representing producers, processors, non- governmental organizations, university researchers , and government agencies , held in Rogers, Arkansas. The plan focuses on operational efficiencies and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring financial viability and industry growth. T he dairy industry has committed to a goal to reduce the carbon footprint of fluid milk by 25 percent by the year 2020 \u2014 equivalent to taking more than 1.25 million cars off the road every year. The industry will reduce greenhouse gas emissions throug hout the entire dairy value chain - from production of feed for dairy cows through retail. Based on goals from the Sustainability Summit, 12 prototype projects are being tested to determine their real -world viability as ways to reduce greenhouse gas emis sions. 1. Farm SMART - Provides dairy producers with their farm's environmental footprint. It also allows them to compare energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions , and water use against regional and national averages compiled by the U.S. dairy industry's Comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment for Fluid Milk. 2.

In 2011, the Innovation Center and Dairy Research Ins titute launched a new awards program, the U.S. Dairy Sustainability Awards, to recognize dairy farms, businesses and collaborative partnership efforts that deliver economic, environmental , and/or social benefit and help advance the sustainability of the da iry industry. The awards are divided into three categories: dairy farm, dairy processing/manufacturing and energy, and energy conservation/generation. Nominations will be evaluated based on the program's or project's results and by triple bottom -line su ccess - economic, environmental, and social. Judges will also consider the potential for adoption of the 12 idea by the dairy industry. The judging panel will be comprised of the dairy supply chain, academia, government, media, business, and nongovernmental organizations. Award winners will be announced in 2012 at a special awards ceremony. Food Safety In 2011, the Food Safety Task Force was chartered as a standing operating committee . The Food Safety C ommittee was created to improve manufacturing condit ions in all dairy processing facilities to prevent food safety recalls that could compromise the reputation of the dairy industry across all plants in the United States. Specifically, the committee focuses on four action platforms: pathogen control, veri fication via auditing, supply chain, and regulatory. In July 2011, the Food Safety Committee, through the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Innovation Center, offered a new training program to educate dairy processors on best practice s and techniques for in- plant pathogen control to better meet food safety regulations. The workshop was developed by food safety experts from 10 dairy processors, cooperatives, manufacturers, and IDFA. Pathogen -control guidelines, principles, techniques and approaches for the dairy plant will be the main focus for the workshop, along with food- safety fundamentals on sanitation, sanitary design, development of standard operating procedures, environmental monitoring techniques, and case studies. Food safety experts from several industry companies will deliver the training, which provides hands -on experience for immediate implementation when participants return to their plants. Dairy Research Institute The Dairy Research Institute (DRI) was created by DMI in 2010 to conduct research on behalf of the Innovation Center, the National Dairy Council, and other sponsors, by building on the dairy promotion program's investment in research. The nonprofit organization works with and through industry, academic, gove rnment and commercial partners to increase pre- competitive, technical research in nutrition, products and sustainability. DRI is the first organization of its kind to provide an industry wide approach to technical research for the dairy industry. The Innovation Center board of directors identifies pre -competitive priorities that address industry research issues and opportunities. DRI then defines an industry wide research plan and identifies funding. DRI research priorities are categorized into fou r areas. Nutrition Research includes blood pressure, dairy protein, digestive health, milk fat/cheese, obesity, metabolic, health, body composition and performance, and relationship of food and beverage nutrient density to climate impact. Product research includes applications and technical support, cheese, fluid milk/cultured products, milk ingredients/fractions, partnerships, and whey/co- products. Sustainability research projects include greenhouse gas reduction opportunities and lifecycle assessments. Finally, planning/partnership/regulatory research includes business development strategy, planning and partnerships, and regulatory affairs guidance. 13 During 2011, DRI launched a monthly e -newsletter, Dairy Research Insights, to provide updates on recen t technical research to dairy industry stakeholders. The e -newsletter features summaries of published research related to DRI's nutrition, product , and sustainability priority areas. The e - newsletter also provides a list of upcoming events, such as confe rences, short courses , and workshops. Industry and Image Relations Each year, fewer consumers are connected to food production and receive mixed messages through the media about the agriculture industry . As part of an effort to help protect the image of dairy producers and the dairy industry among the public, DMI continued its Web site, www.dairyfarmingtoday.org . The site educates the public about how today's dairy producers care for their animals, p rotect the land, and produce safe, wholesome milk. To help dairy producers directly communicate with consumers about dairy farming practices, DMI continued its \"Telling Your Story\" (TYS) program. TYS provides dairy producers with public relations, pres entation, and media training to build and maintain consumers' confidence in the dairy industry's production practices and products. DMI continued the social media component of its TYS program, which utilizes Facebook, YouTube, blogs , and other social medi a. The goal of myDairy is to develop a network of social media -savvy dairy advocates who use online communication to tell the dairy industry's story, reinforce and build its positive image, and counter inaccurate or uninformed online commentary about dair y farming practices. Dairy producers and industry representatives are provided with an online toolkit of social media and dairy resources that can be used to tell dairy's story through blogs, social networking sites, and positive dairy videos and photos. DMI also worked to inform dairy farmers about how their assessment dollars were being used. The organization continued to communicate to dairy producers and other industry audiences through the TYS program, publications (such as the annual report, joint newsletters with Qualified Programs, and dairy cooperative check inserts), dairy industry events (including major trade shows and producer meetings) , and media relations (including press releases, feature placement, and farm broadcast interviews). DMI continued its Issues Management and Crisis Readiness programs. DMI staff and related dairy industry representatives work to monitor and identify current and potential issues where the safety, benefit , or reputation of dairy producers or dairy products may be publicly called into question. As needed, the network of representatives respond to media requests, train dairy spokespeople, build third -party relationships within the agricultural industry , and distribute media alerts with key mess ages to maintain c onsistent industry -wide responses. Primary areas of focus include animal welfare, environment, sustainability, food safety, child nutrition, and modern farming practices. The Crisis Readiness program continued to develop a strong network of dairy indus try and agricultural representatives. Through this coordinated effort, a communication plan was developed to communicate quickly, accurately , and effectively in the event of a crisis , such as 14 disease outbreak, product contamination, or food- borne illness. The checkoff led three regional crisis drills in 201 1 that engaged many sectors of the industry, focusing on hypothetical scenarios ranging from animal disease outbreaks to the international tampering of dairy products. These drills help to maintain the industry's state of readiness and reinforce the critical nature of steps taken within the first 24 hours of a crisis. DMI continued its support for butter through cooperation and public relations activities with the American Butter Institute, includin g the Web site www.butterisbest.com , a consumer resource center with current cooking trends and ideas, butter recipes, and links to other butter -related Web sites. DMI also continued to work with Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board to execute co -funded retail butter promotion activities. The national effort helped to drive incremental retail butter sales in select markets across the United States. Qualified Dairy Product Promotion, Research, or Nutrition Education Programs The Secretary annually certifies Qualified Programs. To receive certification , the Qualified Program must: 1) conduct activities that are intended to increase human consumption of milk and dairy products generally; 2) have been active and ongoing before passage of the Dairy Act, except for programs operated under the laws of t he United States or any State; 3) be primarily financed by producers, either individually or thr ough cooperative associations; 4) not use a private brand or trade name in its advertising and promotion of dairy products (unless approved by the Dairy Board and USDA); and 5) not use program funds for the purpose of influencing governmental policy or action (7 CFR \u00a71150.153). A list of the Qualified Programs is provided in Appendix F. The aggregate revenue from the producers' 15- cent per hundredweight assessment directed to the Qualified Programs in 201 1 was $1 84 million (approximately 10 cents out of the 15- cent assessment). See Appendix B -7 and Appendix B -8 for aggregate income and expenditure data of the Qualified Programs. In 2011, as a part of the final rule that amended the Dairy Order and established a dairy import assessment program, three new Qualified Programs were certified by USDA. The Puerto Rico Milk Industry Development Fund was certified as a qualified producer promotion program, and the Cheese Importers Association of America and Global Dairy Platform were certified as qualified importer promotion programs. Dairy importers may designate 2.5 cents per hundr edweight to a Qualified Program. If the importer does not specify a Qualified Program, the entire 7.5 cents per hundredweight will be retained by the Dairy Board for use by the national program. Some of these Qualified Programs participate in coopera tive efforts conducted and coordinated by other Qualified Programs and/or other organizations such as DMI, the Dairy Board, and UDIA. Their goal in combining funding and coordinating projects is more effective and efficient management of producers' promot ion dollars through larger, broad- based projects. For example, to support the unified marketing plan, UDIA coordinates nationally through DMI the programs and resources of 19 federation members and their affiliated units. 15 National Fluid Milk Processor Pr omotion Board The National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board (Fluid Milk Board) as authorized in the Fluid Milk Act administers a fluid milk promotion and consumer education program that is funded by fluid milk processors. The program is designed to educate Americans about the benefits of milk, increase fluid milk consumption, and maintain and expand markets and uses for fluid milk products in the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia. The fluid milk marketing programs are research based and message focused for the purpose of positively changing the attitudes and purchase behavior of Americans regarding fluid milk. The Secretary appoints 20 members to the Fluid Milk Board. Fifteen members are fluid milk processors who each represent a separate geographical region, and five are at -large members. Of the five at -large members, at least three must be fluid milk processors and at least one must be from the general public. Four fluid milk processors and one public member serve as at -large members on the current Fluid Milk Board. The members of the Fluid Milk Board serve 3 -year terms and are eligible to be appointed to two consecutive terms. The Fluid Milk Promotion Order (Fluid Milk Order) provides that no company shall be represented on t he Board by more than three representatives. Current Fluid Milk Board members are listed in Appendix A -2. A map of the Fluid Milk Board regions is shown in Appendix H -2. The Fluid Milk Board elects four officers: Chair, Vice -Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer. Fluid Milk Board members are assigned by the Chair to the Fluid Milk Board's target -focused program committees (Moms, Teens, Hispanics, and Business Development and Research) to address the Fluid Milk Board's concern that it provide the best possible oversight of program spending. The program committees are responsible for setting program priorities, planning activities and projects, and evaluating results. The Fluid Milk Board maintained the Finance Committee that reviews all program authorizatio n requests for funding sufficiency, the Fluid Milk Board's independent financial audit, and the work of the Board's accounting firm. The Fluid Milk Board met three times during 20 11. The National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program (MilkPEP) is funde d by a 20 -cent per hundredweight assessment on fluid milk products processed and marketed commercially in consumer -type packages in the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia. The program exempts from assessment those processors who process and market 3 million pounds or less of fluid milk products each month, excluding fluid milk products delivered to the residence of a consumer. Assessments generated $ 104.6 million in 2011. The Fluid Milk Order requires the Fluid Milk Board to return 80 perc ent of the funds received from California processors to the California Milk Processor Board. The amount returned to California from 2011 assessments was $9.8 million. The California fluid milk processor promotion program uses the funds to conduct its pro motion activities which include the \"got milk? \u00ae\" advertising campaign. The actual income and expenses for 2010- 2011 are provided in Appendix B -4. The Fluid Milk Board's administrative expenses continued to be within the 5- percent -of-assessments limitatio n required by the Fluid Milk Order. USDA's oversight and evaluation expenses for 2011 are 16 detailed in Appendix B -5. Appendix B -6 contains the Fluid Milk Board's approved budget for 2011. Appendix C -2 contains an independent auditor's reports for the pe riod of January 1 through December 31, 2011. Medical and Scientific Activities The Fluid Milk Board's Medical Advisory Board (MAB), comprised of academic, medical, and health care professionals with expertise relevant to the health b enefits of fluid milk, met twice in 2011. The MAB provides guidance to the Fluid Milk Board's development of key nutritional and health messages for consumers and health professionals. As in previous years, the MAB members assisted the Fluid Milk Board in continuing relationships with health and health professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Dietetic Association, and the American Heart Association. They also continued to appear as medical professionals in the m edia, providing science -based statements supporting the health benefits of milk. The medical and scientific activities of the Fluid Milk Board also included preparing press materials and acting as spokespersons on breaking research with relevance to fluid milk. The MAB worked over the past year to inform others in the scientific community of research that showed that consuming milk after exercise can aid in muscle recovery and rehydration. Additionally, the MAB continued to increase awareness about the nutritional benefits of serving both flavored and non -flavored white milk to children in schools. These communications and activities continue to highlight milk's nutritional profile that includes nine essential vitamins and minerals. National Fluid Milk Programs In 2011, the fluid milk marketing plans were designed to conduct marketing and promotional activities emphasizing milk's role in building strong families. Additionally, fluid milk continued promoting the importance of refueling after exercis e with chocolate milk. Many communication media were used to accomplish these objectives, including television and print advertising, press releases, promotions, Internet, and others. The program's target audiences included women and moms, teens, and His panics. The got milk? \u00ae/Milk Mustache advertising campaign, continued to provide the basis for advertising activities and other program delivery methods. A description of the 2011 program activities listed by advertising target area follows. Moms The Fl uid Milk Board advertising campaign for the Moms target in 2011 continued to shift its Moms targeted messaging from \"mom for herself\" to \"mom for her kids and family.\" Pour One More was the initial 2011 campaign, which encouraged moms to pour one more ser ving of milk for herself and her family, 17 highlighting that Americans are not getting all of the essential nutrients they need. The Pour One More campaign included television, print and digital advertising, and was bolstered by public relations and retail promotions. Two new television commercials featuring celebrities Susan Sarandon and Angie Harmon, highlighted the importance of milk in the family diet and the important role moms have in influencing their families' milk drinking behaviors. The print c ampaign images of Sarandon and Harmon can be viewed in Appendix G. Additionally, MilkPEP's grassroots public relations activities allowed local processors the opportunity to engage consumers in the Pour One More effort, and incorporated the Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP60) messaging and featured National Football League players. FUTP60 is a nationwide in- school fitness and nutrition program aimed at combating childhood obesity. Partnerships continued to play a role in MilkPEP activities, as the program promoted the Pour One More platform through an integrated program with OREO \u00ae cookies/Nabisco. The promotion included on- pack placement of the Pour One More message. MilkPEP also partnered with Feeding America to amplify the Pour One More message at a nation al and local level. Appendix G includes thumbnail images of the Fluid Milk Board's promotional activities for moms in 2010. Teens 2011 teen- targeted activities began with the launch of \"The Power of 9\" - a program featuring celebrity spokesperson Julianne Hough and Seventeen Magazine. The program focused on milk's nine essential nutrients, and showed teen girls that making good food choices and drinking low fat and fat free milk can help them look their best on the outside and f eel confident and strong on the inside. During the back -to-school timeframe, the Milk Fits You campaign focused exclusively on tween girls, positioning milk as a must have accessory to complement any personal style, for any occasion. These activities featured p opular teen celebrities Victoria Justice and Disney star Brigit Mendler. The \"Be Strong Challenge\" also focused on teen girls, but instead began to employ the Refuel message while specifically targeting cheerleaders. The program emphasized how low fat chocolate milk can help cheerleaders refuel and replenish after a tough practice or competition, and help them \"Be Strong\" for their next practice or competition. Ashley Tisdale, former television cheerleader and singer, partnered with MilkPEP and American Cheerleader magazine to launch the campaign. To participate, cheerleading squads across the country submitted videos 18 that showcased a chocolate milk refuel message. The winning squad received $5,000 and the opportunity to star in a Milk Mustache advertisement in American Cheerleader magazine. Additionally, the Scholar Athlete Milk Mustache of the Year (SAMMY) program reached its 15 th and final year, and awarded 25 scholarships of $7,500 to student athletes all across the country celebrating thei r athletic and scholastic achievements. As in previous years, each of the 25 winners was inducted into the SAMMY Hall of Fame and featured in a special milk mustache advertisement which appeared in USA Today , Sports Illustrated , and ESPN magazine. DC Comics also partnered with MilkPEP, leveraging the Green Lantern movie release with a print advertisement featuring Ryan Reynolds, who played the Green Lantern in the motion picture. Nine additional advertisements were produced for the teen audience, includ ing Julianne Hough and the cast of Disney's Good Luck Charlie. Refuel with Chocolate Milk As MilkPEP began to gradually shift its refuel focus away from high-school -aged athletes and towards the adult (18- 34) audience, the Refuel with Chocolate Milk mobi le tour was developed. The tour visited popular endurance sporting events, which included marathons, triathlons, bicycle races and soccer tournaments, and leveraged the scientific research on the refue l benefits of chocolate milk. Two Refuel with Chocol ate Milk trucks traversed the country in 2011, attending 125 events to engage athletes, sample chocolate milk, and provide recovery tips and tools on the benefits of chocolate milk in exerci se recovery. Millions of media impressions were garnered through the Refuel tour and local processors were able to engage and participate in the various tour events. The Refuel with Chocolate Milk W eb site and social media campaign was launched as well in 2011, growing the network of Refuel with chocolate milk advoc ates with \"Team Refuel.\" \"Team Refuel\" enabled everyday athletes to compete to receive Refuel gear and sponsorships, which drove W eb site traffic and inspired a grassroots movement to spread the word about chocolate milk's post workout benefits. Low fat chocolate milk offers the right mix of protein and carbohydrates to repair and refuel exhausted muscles, plus fluids and electrolytes to rehydrate and help replenish what is lost in sweat. 19 Hispanic The national Hispanic advertising campaign continued as part of the industry 's outreach to the growing Hispanic population, mirroring the general market programs and activities . Una Mas Cuenta (One More Counts), similar to the general market Pour One More campaign, educated Hispanic consumers and provide d a simple action plan to help improve their family's health and well -being. The campaign also encouraged Hispanic moms to pour one more serving of milk for herself and her family to help close the nutrient gap. Recognizing cultural differences and t o meet the unique needs of this important target audience, MilkPEP launched a new television campaign that used animation to show both the physical and emotional power of adding one more glass of milk to help build a strong family. Former print campaign M ilk Mustache celebrity mom Giselle Blondette was featured in a voice -over in the television advertisement. MilkPEP also sponsored the first -ever Role Modeling Summit to explore the link between mothers, daughters, food, and health. The summit brought tog ether an esteemed panel of moms, daughters, and health experts, including former First Daughter Jenna Bush Hager and Linda Fears, Editor -in-chief of Family Circle . Throughout the year, the Fluid Milk Board continued with their print advertisement campai gn that featured Hispanic celebrities with the famous Milk Mustache. In addition to Victoria Justice, celebrities included Edith G includes thumbnail images of the Fluid Milk Board's promotional activities for Hispanic consumers in 2010. Board Research and Development The Business Development and Research committee (BDR) is a joint effort of the Fluid Milk Board, processors, and suppliers. This ongoing effort was established to address barriers to fluid milk consumption not targeted by the advertising, promotions, and public relations activities. Over the years, BDR, formerly known as the Fluid Milk Strategic Thinking Initiative (FMSTI), has conducted market tests and studies in various business channels to develop proven ways to increase milk sales and subsequently turned these studies into customer -friendly processor materials which may be found at www.milkpep.org . 20 MilkPEP conducted insightful research on breakfast segmentation and Refuel message strategy to lead the new campaign development. Ongoing research initiatives, such as the Consumption Tracker, Attitude and Awareness Tracker, All Channel Tracking, and the An nual School Survey, all help the industry to remain at the forefront of milk consumption trends and market place changes. MilkPEP continued providing processors access to customizable National Programs and related media materials at www.milkpep.org to use in their own public relations efforts. Brochures, news releases, and other information on milk advertising and promotions were made available to consumers through the following Web sites: www.whymilk.com , www.bodybymilk.com , and www.eligeleche.com. Complete reports, studies, executive summaries, and press rel eases for the Fluid Board's ongoing processor initiatives are available for processors on the Web site www.milkpep.org . Customers can also visit www.milkdelivers.org , or call the milk hotline at 1 -800-945-MILK (6455) for copies of presentations, videos, and printed materials. As the Long Range Planning project continues to take root, focus on Breakfast at Home and Refuel in the coming years offer hope to reverse the decline of per capita milk consumption. 21 Chapter 2 USDA Activities The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) Dairy Programs has day -to-day oversight responsibilities for the Dairy Board and the Fluid Milk Board. AMS Dairy Programs ' oversight activities include reviewing and approving the Dairy and Fluid Milk Boards' budgets, budget amendments, contracts, advertising campaigns, and investment plans. Approval of program materials is a major responsibility of AMS Dairy Programs. Program materials are monitored for conformance with provisi ons of the res pective Acts and Orders, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and other legislation such as the Nutri tion Labeling and Education Act. AMS Dairy Programs also uses the \"Guidelines for AMS Oversight of Commodity Research and Promotion Pr ograms\" to govern oversight and facilitate the application of legislative and regulatory provisions of the Acts and the Orders. AMS Dairy Programs continues to : ensure that the collection, accounting, auditing, and expenditure of promotion funds is cons istent with the enabling legislation and orders ; certify Qualified Programs ; and provide for evaluation of the effectiveness of both promotion programs' advertising campaign s. AMS Dairy Programs assists the b oards in their assessment collection, complianc e, and enforcement actions. Other AMS Dairy Programs responsibilities relate to nominating and appointing board members, amending the orders, conducting referenda, and conducting periodic management reviews . AMS Dairy Program s representatives atten d full board and committee meetings, and other meetings of consequence to the program. National Dairy Promotion and Research Board Oversight Nominations and Appointments The Board is composed of 38 members, including 36 domestic dairy producers and 2 dairy importers , who administer the program . Board members serve 3 -year terms, with no member serving more than two consecutive terms. Board members must be active dairy producers or dairy importers. Dairy producer members are selected by the Secretary from nominations submitted by producer organizations, general farm organizations representing dairy producers, Qualified Programs, or other interested parties. Dairy importer members are selected by the Secretary from nominations submitted by individual import ers of dairy products or by organizations representing dairy importers. A list of Dairy Board members appears in Appendix A -1. Appendix H -1 is a map depicting the 12 geographic regions under the Dairy Promotion and Research Order (Dairy Order). Organi c Exemption Effective February 14, 2005, any persons producing and marketing solely 100 percent organic products were exempted from paying assessments to any research and promotion program administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (70 FR 2743, published January 14, 2005). 22 The final rule amended Section 1150.157 of the Dairy Order. In States that have mandatory assessment laws, dairy producers are exempt only from the Federal assessment. Producers are still responsible for remittance of State a ssessments. In 2011, approximate ly 1,010 dairy producers were granted exemptions , representing approximately 1 .6 billion pounds of production. The Dairy Order requires producers to re -apply annually to continue to receive the exemption. Amendment to the Dairy Act Section 781 of the Dairy Act was amended in 2005 to allow the Dairy Board to obligate and expend funds for any activity to improve the environment and public health, and required the Secretary to review the impact of any such expenditure and i nclude the review in the annual report to Congress. The Dairy Board authoriz ed the expenditure of up to $6 million during 2006 to fund a portion of the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The NAEMS is a multi- year research effort to collec t air emission data and create tools that all dairies can use, whether they are participating in the Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality Compliance Agreement (Consent Agreement) or not, to determine whether their air emission levels are in excess of the Clean Air Act thresholds and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act reporting requirements. The Consent Agreement was developed to offer protection to operations while research is conducted to determine the size and type of farms that may have regulatory responsibilities. Currently, little air emissions data exists for dairy operations. Data collection for the study was completed during the first half of 2010, an d Purdue University and principal investigators completed an initial summary of the data that was transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA will have up to 18 months to complete its data interpretation. The Dairy Board owns t he eq uipment used to c onduct the study, and at a May 2010 meeting, the Dairy Board passed a motion to donate the equipment to universities to be used for further research. Additionally, the Dairy Board will use $100,000 of the remaining NAEMS money to fund an interpretive summary that will compare the NAEMS data with previous studies, identify future research needs, create an outreach document, evaluate the NAEMS data quality in terms of completeness and representativeness, and determine relationships of other measured variables on farm emissions. Foreign Agricultural Service The Secretary of Agriculture has delegated oversight responsibility for all foreign market development activities outside the United States to the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) (7 CFR 2.43(a)(24)). FAS reviews the USDEC foreign market development plan and related contracts. AMS Dairy Programs also reviews USDEC contracts to ensure conformance with the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (Dairy Act), Dairy Order, and with established USDA policies. AMS Dairy Programs reviewed 52 USDEC contracts during 2011. 23 Contracts The Dairy Act and Dairy Order require that all contracts expending assessment funds be approved by the Secretar y (7 CFR 1150.140). During 2011, D airy Pr ograms reviewed and approved 283 Dairy Board and Dairy Management Inc. (DMI) agreements, amendments, and annual plans. Appendix D -1 lists the contractors and corresponding board initiatives approved by USDA. Contractor Audits In 2011, DMI retain ed the certified public accounting firm of Ernst & Young to audit the records of the following contractors: American -Mexican Marketing (export activities), North Carolina State University (product research), Symphony IRI Group, Inc. ( market research), Team Services (strategic consulting), and Universal McCann Worldwide, Inc. (lactose free public relations). Collections The Dairy Act specifies that each person making payments to a producer for milk produced in the United States and purchased from the producer shall, in the manner prescribed by the order, collect an assessment based upon the number of hundredweights of milk for commercial use handled for the account of the producer and remit the assessment to the Dairy Board. The current rate of assess ment is 15 cents per hundredweight of milk for commercial use or the equivalent thereof as determined by the Secretary. The Dairy Act provides that dairy farmers can direct up to 10 cents of their 15- cent per hundredweight assessment to Qualified Programs . During 2011, the D airy Board received about 5.04 cents per hundredweight of the 15 -cent assessment. Compliance Compliance by responsible persons in filing reports and remitting assessments continues in a timely manner and at a high rate. No signifi cant differences were discovered when comparing the audit results to what was reported by the responsible persons. The Dairy Board verifies that the credits claimed by responsible persons are actually sent to Qualified Programs. This verification is done by contract with each Qualified Program. When noncompliance exists, the Dairy Board takes initial action on the matter. If the Dairy Board is unsuccessful in resolving the violation, the matter is referred to USDA for further action. Qualified Program s In 2011, Dairy Programs reviewed applications fo r continued qualification from 66 Qualified Programs. A list of the active Qualified Programs is provided in Appendix F. Consistent with its responsibility for monitoring the Qualified Programs, Dairy Pr ograms obtained and reviewed income and expenditure data from each of the programs. The data reported from the Qualified Programs are included in aggregate form for 2011 in Appendix B -7 and Appendix B-8. 24 National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board Overs ight Nominations and Appointments The 20 members of the Fluid Milk Board serve 3 -year terms, with no member serving more than two consecutive terms. The Fluid Milk Promotion Order (Fluid Order) provides that no company shall be represented on the board by more than three representatives. Fluid Milk Board members who fill vacancies with a term of 18 months or less are permitted to serve 2 additional 3-year terms. Fluid Milk Board members are selected by the Secretary from nominations submitted by fluid milk processors, interested parties, and eligible organizations. A list of current Fluid Milk Board members appears in Appendix A -2. Appendix H -2 shows a map depicting the 15 geographic regions under the Fluid Milk Order. Program Development The Fluid M ilk Board contracted directly with Deutsch Worldwide; Draftfcb; Weber Shandwick; and Siboney, U.S.A., to develop its mom and teen advertising, promotions, consumer education/public relations, and Hispanic advertising/public relations, respectively. Contractor Audits The Fluid Milk Board retained the certified public accounting firm of Snyder, Cohn, Collyer, Hamilton & Associates, P.C., in 2011 to audit the records of Draftfcb, Inc., for the periods of January 1 through December 31, 2009; November 2010, Mar ch 2011, and August 2011 to determine if the agency had conformed to the financial compliance requirements specified in its agreement with the Board. The Board continues to enhance its internal contract control system in order to ensure that the amounts invoiced to the Board are in compliance with established contracts and procedures. Additionally, the Board has determined that it will begin to conduct audits of specified periods on all of its primary contractors each year. Compliance Compliance by fl uid milk processors in filing reports and remitting assessments continues in a timely manner and at a high rate. 25 Chapter 3 Quantitative Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Marketing and Promotion Activities by the Milk Processor Education Program, Dairy Management, Inc., and Qualified Programs The Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (Dairy Act) and Fluid Milk Promotion Act of 1990 (Fluid Act) require an annual independent analysis of the advertising and promotion programs that operate to increase consumer awareness and sales of fluid milk and dairy products . Texas A&M University researchers were awarded a competitive contract to complete the study. Chapter 3 summarizes the quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the dairy and fluid milk checkoff programs , specifically the marketing and promotion programs. Objectives of the Evaluation Study The effectiveness of dairy promotion is evaluated with the following two key questions in mind: 1. Have the demand -enhancing activities conducted by dairy producer s, dairy importers, and fluid milk processors actually increased the demand for fluid milk and dairy products? 2. Is the dairy industry better off as a result of the marketing and promotion programs initiated by Dairy Management Inc. (DMI) , the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program, commonly referred to as the Milk Processor Education Program (MilkPEP) and the Qualified Dairy Product Promotion, Research, or Nutrition Education Programs (QPs)? In other w ords, have these marketing and promotion programs generated sufficient additional dairy industry revenues to more than cover their associated costs? Historically, the effectiveness of the dairy promotion programs ha ve been measured through econometric studies focusing on the relationship between the consumption of dairy products and dairy checkoff promotion expenditures, controlling for all other factors (models of demand for dairy products). E conomic returns to dairy producers , dairy importers, and fluid milk processors as a result of the changes in consumption generated by marketing and promotion activities are calculated using the parameters obtained from the demand models. The summary indicator of economic returns on investment is a benefit -cost ratio. This study, similar to previous studies (e.g., Kaiser, 2010), is based on econometric modeling and measures the impact of the checkoff program s with return -on-investment fig ures. The structural models of consumer demand proceed in a similar direction to prior studies, but are different in several important ways : 1) T he structural model of consumption provides detail on individual dairy products as well as the aggregate of fluid milk and dairy products ; 2) T he effectiveness of promotion expenditures on U.S. dairy exports ; and 3) T he marketing strategies involving industry partnerships are evaluated in this report. 26 Checkoff Expenditures Made by DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs Data on nominal checkoff expenditures between 1995 and 2011 were acquired from DMI, MilkPEP , and QPs . While the three entities are administratively distinct, they have similar objectives for enhancing dairy demand. Following other researchers, most notably Schmit and Kaiser (2004), we aggregate the demand -enhancing expenditures from all three entities . The dairy checkoff program s use a variety of methods to reach consumers. A dvertising dollars are directed to media outlets, namely television, out door, print, radio, and the internet . Market ing activities other than advertising are directed at the retail level of the marketing channel or at intermediaries. These n on-advertising marketing expenditures include health and nutrition education programs , public relations , food service and manufacturing programs , sales promotion programs , school milk programs , school marketing activities , retail programs , child nutrition and fitness in itiatives , and single -serve milk promotion. Non -advertising market expenditures not directed at the retail level of the marketing channel include crisis management, trade service communications, and strategic research activities . Programs for e xport development or promotion are included in the expenditure classifications as demand- enhancing activities. Export promotion was not explicitly considered in previous evaluations. Finally, a portion of the DMI, MilkPEP, and QP expenditures are classified as non- demand - enhancing activities. T hese expenditures are excluded from the estimation of the impact of marketing and promotion expenditures on consumption. The non- demand -enhancing expen ditures are for overhead, technical support, industry relations, and corporate technology . Annual checkoff expenditures made by DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs over the period 1995 to 2011 are depicted in Table 3 -1. A pictorial view of annual checkoff expenditures made by DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs from 1995 to 2011 is presented in Figure 3- 1. On average, approximately $350 million was spent annua lly by the respective entities. All of these checkoff dollars combined are very large compared to those of other commodities' promotion and research programs . 3 Median DMI expenditures were close to $90 million, ranging from $65.3 million to $99.7 million. M edian MilkPEP expenditures were about $95 million, rang ing from $38.7 million to $101.9 million. Finally, median expenditures made by QPs were $170 million, nearly double the expenditures made by DMI and MilkPEP individually. The data associated with the demand -enhancing activities initiated by DMI and MilkPEP are also available on a quarterly basis. The same is not true for the programmatic activities associated with the QPs. Consequently, to place the marketing and promotion expenditures made by DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs on a quarterly basis, interpolations of the QP data were necessary. The details of this interpolation process are described in the full technical document. The depiction of these data on a quarterly basis is important in allowing for more observations for the econometric analysis of demand for dairy products. 3 To illustrate, expenditures associated with the cotton checkoff program are about $80 million (Williams et al. , 2011) and expenditures associated with the soybean checko ff program are about $100 million (Williams, 1999; and Williams, Capps, and Bessler, 2009). 27 Table 3- 1. Annual Checkoff Expenditures from DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs , on demand- non- demand enhancing activities. 2 Projected. Source: DMI, MilkPEP, USDA Importantly, the QP expenditures are disaggregated into fluid milk, cheese, and butter to allow the impact of these expenditures on the demand for these products. These expenditures include not only advertising and sales promotion but also dairy foods and nutrition research, nutrition education, and market and economic research. Wit h this measure, we obtain a depiction of demand -enhancing activities conducted by QPs. QP expenditures from the unified marketing plan are not included as these go to DMI to fund the national program. In this way, double counting is avoided. Nominal seasonally -adjusted demand -enhancing expenditures from DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs on a quarterly basis from 1995 to 2011 are exhibited in Figure 3- 2. These demand- enhancing expenditures varied from $51.0 million to $96.7 million per quarter, averaging $67.5 million per quarter. Nominal seasonally -adjusted demand -enhancing expenditures for fluid milk from DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs on a quarterly basis from 1995 to 2011 are exhibited in Figure 3- 3. From 1995 to 2006, nominal seasonally -adjusted quarterly ma rketing and promotion- expenditures for fluid milk ranged from roughly $24.2 million to $62.9 million per quarter. After 2006, marketing and promotion expenditures for fluid milk fell noticeably, ranging from $23.8 million to $32.1 million per quarter. On average, over the period of 1995- 2011, nominal seasonally - adjusted demand enhancing expenditures for fluid milk were $27.9 million per quarter. As exhibited in Figure 3- 4, nominal seasonally -adjusted demand -enhancing expenditures for cheese ranged from $ 12.9 million to $27.3 million from 1995 to 2004, averaging $21.5 million 28 Figure 3- 1. Annual Checkoff Expenditures Made by DMI, MilkPEP, and Q Ps, 1995 to 2011 Source: DMI, MilkPEP , USDA per quarter. From 2005 to the third quarter of 2008, marketing and promotion expenditures associated with cheese were much smaller compared to the period from 1995 to 2004. On average, expenditures on marketing and cheese promotion were $12.0 million during the period. Owing to partnerships with the pizza industry, notably Domino's Pizza, expenditures on cheese increased from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the end of 2011. Figure 3 -2.

Marketing and promotion ex penditures for butter were roughly 2.7 percent of comparable expenditures for fluid milk and 5.4 percent of comparable expenditures for cheese. Beginning in 2006, DMI moved from featuring milk, cheese, and butter in product specific promotions to broader campaigns that relate to a number of dairy products . Examples of broader campaigns include the Child Nutrition and Fitness Initiative , Fuel Up to Play 60, and Action for Healthy Kids. The U.S. has the potential to compete favorably in global dairy markets owing to its large and efficient production and processing industries . The export promotion programs of the U .S are indicative of determination to maintain and to possibly increase its market share in global dairy markets. As shown in Figure 3- 6a, nominal seasonally adjusted DMI expenditures directed to dairy exports on a quarterly basis ranged from just under $800 to close to $5 million. The trend in these DMI expenditures has been upward over the period of 1995 to 2011, averaging close to $1.9 million per quarter over this period. As exhibited in Figure 3- 6b, nominal seasonally - adjusted USDA FAS expenditures directed to exports of dairy products on a quarterly basis varied from just under $310,000 to about $1.8 million over the period of 1997 to 2011. On average, USDA FAS expenditures were roughly $985,000 per quarter. As presented in Figure 3-6c, nominal seasonally -adjusted DMI as well as USDA FAS expenditures ranged from $763 to $6.1 million per quarter, averaging $2.76 million on a quarterly basis over the period of 1995 to 2011.

Trends in Domestic Consumption On average, over the 1995 to 2011 period, quarterly per capita commercial disappearances (consumption) of butter, cheese, and fluid milk were 1.2 pounds, 7.8 pounds, and 48 pounds respectively. The range of quarterly consumption for butter was from 0.9 pounds to 1.7 pounds, for cheese from 6.5 pounds to 9.1 pounds, and for fluid milk from 41.8 pounds to 53.3 pounds. As exhibited in Figure 3- 7, quarterly per capita consumption of fluid milk exhibits a definitive downward trend as well as a definitive seasonal pattern. Over the time period 1995 to 2011, the range of commercial disappearance of fluid milk on a per capita basis was from 42 pounds per quarter to 54 pounds per quarter, averaging roughly 48 pounds. Given the conversion of 8.6 pounds per gallon of for milk, the per capita consumption of fluid milk wa s about 5.5 gallons per quarter on average. As depicted in Figure 3- 8, quarterly per capita consumption of cheese exhibits a definitive upward trend as well as a definitive seasonal pattern. Over the time period 1995 to 2011, the range of commercial disappearance of cheese on a per capi ta basis was from 6.5 pounds per quarter to 9.1 pounds per quarter, averaging about 7.8 pounds. 01,000,0002,000,0003,000,0004,000,0005,000,0006,000,0007,000,000 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010DMI_USDA_EXPORT_EXP_SADollars 33 Figure 3 -7: Per Capita Consumption of Fluid Milk, 1995.1 to 2011.4 Source: U SDA As exhibited in Figure 3- 9, quarterly per capita consumption of butter exhibits a definitive upward trend as well as a definitive seasonal pattern. Over the time period 1995 to 2011, the range of commercial disappearance of butter on a per capita basis was from 0.9 pounds per quarter to 1.7 pounds per quarter, averaging close to 1.2 pounds.

The per capita consumption measures yield quite different descriptive statistics. On average, on a fat basis, the commercial disappearance of all dairy products amounted to 148 pounds per quarter, ranging from 136 pounds to 160 pounds per quarter. On a skim solids basis, on average, the commercial disappearance of all dairy products amounted to 138 pounds per quarter, ranging from 131 pounds to 145 pounds per quarter. The correlation of these two measures, although positive, is only 0.34. Trends in Dairy Exports To maintain consistency with the data used in the analysis of the consumption of fluid milk and dairy products, data from USDA are used for analysis of dairy exports on a fat basis and on a skim solids basis. These data correspond to estimates of commercial exports. An examination of the dairy export data suggests that the growth in total U.S. dairy exports over the 1995 to 2011 period was the result, in large part, of strong growth in exports of low -fat dairy products like nonfat dry milk. On a milk equivalent skim solids basis, the data show that the growth in U.S. dairy exports has been manifestly exponential from an average 1.6 billion pounds per quarter in 1995 to just over an average of 8.5 billion pounds per quarter in 2011 ( Figure 3- 12). Over the same period, however, measured on a milk equivalent fat basis, average quarterly U.S. dairy exports followed a positive but more linear and much less robust trend from a quarterly average of 887 million pounds in 1995 to ne arly 2.4 billion pounds in 2011 (Figure 3-12).

U.S. Dairy Commercial Exports on a Milk Equivalent Fat Basis and Skim Solids Basis, 1995.1 to 2011.4 Methodology for A nalysis of Demand Relationships The primary objective of advertising and non- advertising marketing activities conducted by MilkPEP, DMI, and QPs over the years has been to shift out the demand curve for fluid milk and manufactured dairy products. The first relevant question , then , is whether marketing activities actually shift out the demand for fluid milk and manufactured dairy products. If the answer to this question is yes, then the second question is whether or not the rightward shift in the demand for fluid milk and manufactured dairy products has benefited the fluid milk processors , dairy producers , and dairy importers who pay for the program. If the answer to the first questi on is \"no,\" then the answer to the second question is \"no\" as well. If the answer to the first question is \"yes,\" the answer to the second question is not necessarily \"yes\" because any consequent increase in revenues to processors producers may or may not be sufficient to cover the costs of the programmatic activities associated with MilkPEP , DMI, and QPs. The model c oncentrat es on the retail lev el of the marketing chain for the following reasons: 1) consumers are the recipients of the advertising and promotion messages, and it is necessary to understand how their behavior changes in response to those messages; 2) data are plentiful and relative ly free of major structural changes so as to allow a rigorous analysis of the demand for fluid milk and manufactured dairy products; and 3) this analysis yields a current picture of the impacts of programmatic activities of MilkPEP, DMI, and QPs on the demand for fluid milk and manufactured dairy products. Demand for Fluid Milk Dairy checkoff program expenditures take place within a challenging competitive marketplace where consumers choose among a variety of foods and beverages in various purchase locations. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Million Pounds Skim Solids Basis Fat Basis 37 The idea is to control for variables that may affect demand, thereby isolati ng the impact of marketing efforts alone on fluid milk consumption. The marginal or incremental effects of program expenditures over time on fluid milk consumption are then obtained . Of particular interest is the percentage change in consumption due to unit percentage changes in marketing and promotion expenditures . All factors must be accounted for in a quantitative analysis of market demand to accurately isolate (or to minimize confounding) the impact of advertising and non- advertising marketing activities. The market demand function of fluid milk incorporates the following factors: 1. The retail price of fluid milk 2. The retail prices of substitute/complementary products, in particular the prices of other non-alcoholic beverages (bottled water, fruit juice , and soy beverage ); 3. Disposable personal income 4. Inflation 5. Population 6. Changes in demographics or population dynamics, specifically in regard to proportion of the population of children 0 to 4, 5 to 13, and 14 to 17 years of age 7. The generic demand -enhancing expenditures for fluid milk made by MilkPEP and DMI; 8. Advertising or promotional expenditures associated with competing beverage manufacturers, notably bottled water, fruit juice , and soy beverage 9. food expenditures in the away from home market 10. Branded fluid milk advertising expenditures 11. Seasonality . Through this demand specification, we filter out the effects of other factors and directly quantify the net impact of advertising and non -advertising marketing activities in conjunction with the programs of MilkPEP, DMI, and QPs on the retail consumption of fluid milk. Retail level prices of fluid milk products capture own- price effects of consumption. Holding all factors invariant, as retail prices of fluid milk change, consumption of fluid milk is expected to change in the opposite direction. As economic theory suggests, prices of competing or complementary products as well as disposable personal incomes of consumers also may affect the consumption of fluid milk. In recent times, disposable personal incomes of consumers have been negatively im pacted by the downturn or sluggish growth in the economy. Over the past decade, the proportion of pre -school aged children in the population has declined. We also consider the impact of the proportion of the population of children 5 to 13 years of age a nd 14 to 17 years of age on the demand for fluid milk. In addition, we must address the potential impact of marketing activities of competing beverages. The realization is that MilkPEP, DMI, and QPs are not the o nly groups engaged in generic marketing programs. Indeed, both dairy farmers and fluid milk processors initiated generic marketing programs to combat marketing activities from other beverage manufacturers. We must account as well for away from home eati ng and drinking trends given that roughly half of the share of the consumer dollar spent on food and beverages occurs away from home. Fluid milk consumption may be negatively impacted by the lack of varieties of fluid milk products in away from home est ablishments as well as by the expanding availability of fluid milk alternatives in the away from home market. Finally, generic marketing 38 and promotion effects of fluid milk processors , dairy producers , dairy importers, and the QPs are expected to increase the consumption of fluid milk, holding all other factors constant. Branded fluid milk advertising expenditures also may positively impact fluid milk consumption. The generic fluid milk marketing activities, including fluid milk advertising and non -advertising marketing activities, include all media activities such as television, print, radio, outdoor, and Internet advertising by MilkPEP and DMI , as well as health and nutrition educational programs, public relations, school milk programs, food service programs, retail programs, trade service communications, and other miscellaneous activities. The advertising and non- adverti sing marketing efforts represent demand -enhancing activities of MilkPEP, DMI, and the QPs. The own- price elasticity for fluid milk was estimated to be - 0.0619, meaning that for every 10 .0 percent change in the price of fluid milk relative to the price of non -alcoholic beverages, per capita fluid milk consumption changes by 0.619 percent in the opposite direction. The demand for fluid milk is inelastic, that is, relatively unresponsive to price changes. This re sult is consistent with economic theory and with existing literature. For example, Kaiser (2010) estimated the own -price elasticity of fluid milk to be - 0.126 based on quarterly data from 1995 to 2009. Cakir and Balagtas (2010) estimated the own- price elasticity of fluid milk to be much higher (in absolute value) at - 0.769. The cross -price elasticity for fluid milk with respect to cheese was estimated to be positive at 0.0115, in accordance with our expectations. However , this cross -price elasticity is not statistically different from zero. Cakir and Balagtas (2010) also found this substitution relationship between cheese and fluid milk. Additionally, Davis, Dong, Blayney, and Owens (2010) found the existence of substitu tion relationships among dairy product categories. The percentages of the population of children of various age classifications were key determinants affecting fluid milk consumption. A 1.0 percent rise in the proportion of children under five years of age results in a 1.15 percent increase in fluid milk consumption. The impact of school -age pre -adolescent children on demand is slightly less. A one percent change in the proportion of children between 5 and 13 years of age results in a 0.95 percent change in fluid milk consumption. The proportion of children between 14 and 17 years of age are likewise positively associated with milk consumption. The percent change in demand is 0.95 percent for a 1.0 percent change in the proportion of children between 14 and 17 years of age , almost precisely the same as for school age pre- adolescent children. Clearly, econometric evidence exists to demonstrate that pre -school, pre -adolescent, and adolescent children are important drivers of fluid milk consumption. Per capita disposable income was a positive but not a statistically significant factor associated with per capita fluid milk consumption. Income elasti city was estimated to be 0.0469. Thus, we find evidence to support the contention that fluid milk is a necessary good, economically speaking. Kaiser (2010), estimated the income elasticity of demand for fluid milk to be 0.13. Alviola and Capps (2010) estimated the income elasticity of fluid milk to be - 0.0136. Also, we provide evidence that the percentage of total food and beverage expenditures associated with away from home eating was not a statistically significant factor affecting per capita fluid 39 milk consumption. Kaiser (2010) found that this factor was a notable determinant, with the elasticity estimated to be -0.685. Our elasticity estimate of - 0.1911 was not statistically different from zero. In regard to seasonality, per capita fluid milk consumption was highest in the fourth quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter, per capita consumption of fluid milk was lower by 2.0 percent in the first quarter, 6 .0 percent in the second quarter, and 5.0 percent in the third quarter. The impacts of advertising for fruit juice , soy beverage , and bottled water were negative, as expected, on per capita consumption of fluid milk. The short -run elasticity of advertising for fruit juice was estimated to be - 0.00457, while the cumulative or long- run elasticity was estimated to be -0.08371. The optimal cumulative e ffects of advertising on fruit juice were over a period of eight quarters. Similarly, the short- run elasticity of advertising for soy beverage was calculated to be - 0.00080, while the long -run elast icity was calculated to be - 0.01469. The optimal cumulative effect of advertising on soy beverage was over a period of eight quarters as well. The short -run elasticity of advertising associated with bottled water was estimated to be - 0.00038, while the long -run elasticity of advertising for bottled water was calculated to be - 0.00350. The optimal cumulative effect of advertising for bottled water was over a period of five quarters. Demand for Cheese The market demand function for cheese incorporates the following factors: 1. Retail price of cheese 2. Retail prices of substitute/complementary products, in particular, the price of bakery products, the price of wine, and the price of whole milk 3. Disposable personal income 4. Inflation 5. Population 6. Demand -enhancing marketing expenditures for cheese from DMI and the QPs 7. Seasonality. The retail price of cheese captures own -price effects of consumption. Holding all factors constant, as the retail price of cheese changes, consumption of cheese is expected to change in the opposite direction. As economic theory suggests, prices of competing or complementary products as well as disposable personal incomes of consumers also may affect the consumption of cheese. Further, generic marketing and non- marketing efforts of cheese are expected to increase the consumption of cheese, holding all factors invariant. The demand -enhancing activities pertaining to cheese from 2009 to 2011 largely have been geared to partnerships in the pizza industry . The own -price elasticity for cheese is estimated to be - 0.1051, meaning that for a 10.0 percent change in the price of cheese, per capita che ese consumption changes by 1.051 percent in the opposite direction. Similar to the case for fluid milk, the demand for cheese is inelastic, that is, relatively unresponsive to price changes. This result is consistent with economic theory and with 40 existing literature. Cakir and Balagtas (2010) estimated the own- price elasticity of cheese to be -0.426, which is much larger than our estimated figure. The cross -price elasticity for cheese with respect to bakery products is estimated to be 0.4016, indicating that cheese and bakery products are substitutes. This result is at odds with the expectation of a complementary relationship between bakery products and cheese. The cross - price elasticity of cheese with respect to wine was estimated to be - 0.7168, indicating that cheese and wine are complements. This result is in accord ance with the expectations. Additionally, these cross -price elasticities are much larger than the own -price elasticity for cheese. Consequently, evidence exists to indicate that cheese consumption is more sensitive to changes in the price of bakery products and to changes in the price of wine than to the price of cheese itself . Moreover, the cross -price elasticity of cheese with respect to fluid milk is - 0.1113, indicating that cheese and fluid milk are complements. This result is at odds with Cakir and Balagtas (2010), who estimated the cross -price elasticity between cheese and fluid milk to be 0.349. Per capita disposable income was a positive and statistically significant factor on per capita cheese consumption. The income elasticity of demand for c heese was estimated to be 0.5559 . Thus, we find evidence to support the contention that cheese is a necessary good in economic parlance. In regard to seasonality, per capita cheese consumption was highest in the fourth quarter. Relative t o the fourth quarter, per capita consumption of cheese was lower by 7.0 percent in the first quarter, 5 .0 percent in the second quarter, and 4.0 percent in the third quarter. Deman d for Butter The market demand function for butter incorporates the following factors: 1. Retail price of butter 2. Retail prices of substitute/complementary products, in particular the price of margarine and the price of bakery products 3. Disposable personal income 4. Inflation 5. Population 6. Food expenditures spent in away -from -home outlets 7. Generic expenditures for butter from DMI and the QPs 8. Seasonality. The own- price elasticity for bu tter was estimated to be - 0.0993, meaning that for a 10.0 percent change in the price of butter, per capita b utter consumption changes by 0.99 percent in the opposite direction. Similar to the situation for fluid milk and cheese, the demand for butter is inelastic, that is, relatively unresponsive to price changes. This result is consistent with economic theory and with the existing literature. Cakir and Balagtas (2010) estimated the own- price elasticity of butter to be - 0.037, which is much smaller than our estimate. 41 The cross -price elasticity for butter with respect to margarine was estimated to be 0.8663, indicating that butter and margarine, as expected, are substitutes. The cross -price elasticity of butter with respect to bakery p roducts was estimated to be - 0.6877, indicating that butter and bakery products, as expected, are complements. These respective cross -price elasticities are 7 to 10 times as large as the own -price elasticity for butter. Hence, evidence exists to indicate that butter consumpti on is far more responsive to changes in the price of margarine and to changes in the price of bakery products than to changes in the price of butter. Per capita disposable income was a positive and statistically significant factor on per capita butter co nsumption. The income elasticity of demand for butter was estimated to be 2.173, indicating that butter is a luxury good in economic parlance. The percentage of total expenditures for food away -from -home was a negative and statistically significant facto r on per capita butter consumption. The associated elasticity for this determinant of butter consumption was estimated to be - 1.227. Per capita butter consumption is quite sensitive to changes in real per capita income and to changes in the percentage of t otal food and beverage expenditures in the away -from -home market. In regard to seasonality, per capita butter consumption was highest in the fourth quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter, per capita consumption of butter was lower by nearly 27 percent i n the first quarter, 32 percent in the second quarter, and 20 percent in the third quarter. Demand for All Dairy Products Similar to the previous evaluation of the MilkPEP and Dairy Program conducted by Kaiser (2010), we also develop and estimate the aggregate demand function for all dairy products and dairy ingredients. Besides the domestic demand -enhancing expenditures of DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs, factors hypothesized to influence per capita all dairy products demand included seasonality, the CPI for all dairy products, and per capita disposable income. Similar to the aforementioned demand models for fluid milk, cheese, and butter, the all -dairy products models on a skim solids basis and on a fat basis were estimated on a per capita basis to control for the influence of population. To account for the impact of inflation, all variables were deflated by the CPI for all items. On a skim solids basis, the own- price elasticity of demand was estimated to be between - 0.1655, but on a fat basis, the own- price elasticity was estimated to be - 0.0553. Our own -price elast icity on a skim solids basis and our own- price elasticity on a fat basis were at odds with Kaiser (2010), who estimated these elasticities to be close to - 0.30 on a skim solids basis and - 0.22 on a fat basis . Our income elasticities were estimated to be 0.30 on a skim solids basis and 0.42 on a fat basis. However, these income elasticities are quite different from Kaiser (2010). His elasticities ranged from 0.17 on a skim solids basis to 0.95 on a fat basis. Seasonality was evident in the U.S. per capita consumption of all dairy products on a skim solids basis and on a fat basis. Relative to the fourth quarter, per capita consumption of all dairy products on a skim solids basis was higher in the second quarter by slightly more than 1 percent and higher in the third quarter by 2 percent. No statistically signific ant differences between the first quarter and the fourth quarter were found for per capita consumption of all dairy products on 42 a skim solids basis. On a fat basis, relative to the fourth quarter, per capita consumption of all dairy products was lower by nearly 7 percent in the first quarter and lower by nearly 2 percent in the second quarter. No significant differences were evident for the third quarter relative to the fourth quarter for per capita consumption of all dairy products on a fat basis. U.S. Da iry Commercial Export Demand To measure the effects of DMI export promotion enhancement expenditures on U.S. dairy expor ts, we specify and estimate two U.S. dai ry export demand models using two different measures of dairy exports : 1) the USDA measure of dairy exports on mi lk equivalent skim solids basis; and 2) the USDA measure of dairy exports on a milk equivalent fat basis . Drivers of demand included lags of the ratio of the Oceania export butter price to the U.S. butter price on a fat basis; lags o f the ratio of the Oceania export price for skim milk powder to the U.S. nonfat dry milk price on a skim solids basis; lags of the measure of world income calculated as the trade weighted, real gross domestic products of major export regions; and inertia or stickiness of dairy exports in world markets. Simply put, when U.S. prices are low (high) relative to Oceania export prices, more (less) is exported. Butter prices are used as proxies for prices of exports on a milk fat basis, and nonfat dry milk and s kim milk powder prices are used as proxies for prices on a skim solids basis. The own- price elasticity of the ratio of the skim milk powder Oceania export price to the price of non-fat dry milk U.S. price lagged one quarter was estimated to be - 0.3238. T he own- price elasticity of the ratio of the Oceania export butter price to the U.S. price of butter lagged one quarter was estimated to be - 0.2030. This set of findings suggests that dairy exports are not very sensitive to changes in the respective ratios of prices. However, dairy exports are sensitive to world income with a one -quarter lag. The elasticity with respect to world income was estimated to be 1.097 on a skim solids basis and 1.024 on a fat basis. Owing to the significance of the one quarter lag of exports on a skim solids basis as well as on a fat basis, inertia of dairy exports in world markets was substantiated. Impacts of Marketing and Promotion Activities on Demand for Dairy Products The econometric evidence indicates a significant association between consumer demand and checkoff program expenditures, for all dairy products in the aggregate and for individual product categories. Expenditures have a modest effect on demand during the quarter in which it is made. The longer term cumulative impact is measurably larger than the contemporaneous effect. The cumulative effects vary across the specific product type. The key indicator of the impact of marketing and promotion expenditure s on demand, and the elasticity with respect to these demand enhancing activities is reported. This elasticity corresponds to the percentage change in consumption given a 1.0 percent change in marketing and promotion expenditures, while holding all other variables constant. 43 Fluid Milk The checkoff expenditures from milk processors, dairy producers , dairy importers, and QPs indeed boosted per capita consumption of fluid milk. The short -run elasticity of demand with respect to the demand enhancing activities of was estimated to be 0.002, while the long run elasticity was estimated to be 0.058. In other words, for a 10 percent increase in the demand enhancing expenditure, cumulatively the demand for milk rose by 0.58 percent. The cumulative effect of the fluid milk demand enhancing activities was over a period of twelve quarters. Kaiser (2010) estimated the elasticity for generic milk marketing and promotion activities conducted to be 0.037. Schmit and Kaiser (2004) and Cakir and Balagtas (2010) found statistically significant advertising elasticities of 0.040 and 0.093 for fluid milk. Differences in elasticities may be attributed to differences in deman d enhancing activities. Cheese The short run elasticity of cheese demand with respect to demand enhancing activities was estimated to be 0.00091, while the long run elasticity was 0.028. Hence a 10 percent change in expenditures on cheese promot ion is expected to have an impact on consumption of nearly 0.30 percent. The optimal cumulative effect of these demand enhancing acti vities was over a period of 11 quarters. Our results are consistent with Schmit and Kaiser (2004), who estimated the advertising elasticity of cheese to be statistically significant and about 0.013. Cakir and Balagtas (2010) estimated this elasticity to be 0.046, albeit not statistically different from zero. Butte r The short run demand enhancing elasticity of demand for butter was estimated to be 0.0015, while the long run elas ticity was estimated to be 0.013. Thus a 10 percent increase in promotion spending is associated with a cumulative or long -run rise of consumption by 0.13 percent. The optimal cumulative effect of these demand enhancing act ivities was over a period of six quarters. Our result is lower than that found by Cakir and Balagtas (2010), who estimated the advertising elasticity of butter to be 0.209. All Dairy Products The aggregation of dairy products into a single quantitative model of demand response requires that the unlike goods be measured on a common unit basis. Dairy products can be measured on a skim solids basis or on a fat basis. The estimation results for both measures are similar to each other, but not identical, and both are reported for completeness. With either quantity indicator, checkoff program expenditures have a significant influence on demand in both the short run and the long run. Hence the combined efforts of milk processors, dairy farmers, dairy importers, and QPs boosted per capita consumption of all dairy products. The short run elasticity associated with demand enhancing activities was estimated to be 0.00040 on a skim solids basis and 0.00252 on a fat basis. The long run elasticity associated with demand enhancing activities was estimated to be 0.02294 on a skim solids basis and 0.02351 on a fat basis. The optimal cumulative effect of demand enhancing activities was over 16 quarters on a 44 skim solids basis and 5 quarters on a fat basis. Kaiser (2010) provided separate estimates of elasticities for generic dairy advertising expenditures (0.036 on a skim solids basis and 0.056 on a fat basis) and for generic dairy non- advertising marketing expenditures (0.016 on a skim solids basis and 0.017 on a fat basis). Dairy Exports The cumulative impact of USDEC expenditures on dairy exports was statistically significant on a skim solids basis and on a fat basis. The elasticity associated with USDEC export promotion expenditures was estimated to be 0.03112 for dairy exports on a ski m solids basis and 0.06075 on a fat basis . The optimal lag of the cumulative impacts of these expenditures was 5 quarters for dairy exports on a skim solids basis and 6 quarters on a fat basis. Benefit -Cost Ratios To calculate retail benefit -cost ratios (BCR) , similar to Capps, Bessler, and Williams (2004), Williams and Capps (2006), Williams, Capps, and Palma (2008), and Williams, Capps, and Dang (2010), we use the demand enhancing relationships for fluid milk, cheese, butter, and all dairy products attributed to the checkoff program to derive an estimate of the change in consumption. The efforts of the checkoff programs via the demand enhancing advertising and non-advertising marketing activities increased the commercial disappearance, all other factors invariant. Over the period 1995 to 2011, the incremental commercial disappearance was calculated to be 54.3 billion pounds for fluid milk; 4.3 billion pounds for cheese; 0.3 billion pounds for butter; betwee n 62.7 billion pounds for all dairy products on a skim solids basis; and 68.9 billion pounds for all dairy products on a fat basis. The incremental commercial consumption of fluid milk amounts to 5.8 percent of the total cumulative consumption of fluid m ilk over the 1995 to 2011 period. Put another way, the efforts of DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs led to a 5.8 percent increase in fluid milk consumption, more than it would have been over the period 1995 to 2011. Similarly, the demand enhancing marketing activi ties of DMI and QPs resulted in a 2.8 percent incremental increase in cheese consumption and a 1.4 percent incremental increase in butter consumption, all other factors held constant, from 1995 to 2011. Finally, the efforts of DMI, MilkPEP, and QPs led to a 2.3 percent incremental increase in all dairy products on a skim solids basis and a 2.4 percent incremental increase in all dairy products on a fat basis over the period 1995 to 2011. These benefits are calculated at the retail level. An important question is how much of the increased revenues generated at the retail level actually reaches program funders. To calculate the BCR for milk processors and dairy producers, we multiply USDA estimates of the farm share of the retail dollar for fluid milk, cheese, butter, and all dairy products by the corresponding retail BCRs. On average, the farm shar e of the retail dollar over the period 2000 to 2010 was 50.27 percent for fluid milk, 30.82 percent for cheese, 41.73 percent for butter; and 29.55 percent for all dairy products. Therefore, the subsequent BCRs at the far m level were calculated to be 3.95 for fluid milk; 4.43 for cheese; 6.26 for butter; 12.81 for all dairy products on a skim solids basis; and 14.14 for all dairy products on a fat basis. A summary of the farm -level benefit -cost ratios is exhibited in Table 3- 2. 45 Table 3 -2: Calculated Farm -Level Benefit -Cost Ratios, 1995- 2011 Farm Level All Dairy (skim solids) 12.81 All Dairy (fat basis) 14.14 Fluid milk 3.95 Cheese 4.43 Butter 6.26 Note: The ratios are dollars of revenue generated per checkoff dollar spent on demand enhancing activities. Our farm level BCR for fluid milk (3.95) was lower than the corresponding BCR of 8.88 calculated by Kaiser (2010). On the other hand, our farm -level BCRs for all dairy products, 14.14 (fat basis) and 12.81 (skim solids basis), were higher than the corresponding BCRs of 6.20 on a skim solids basis and 9.85 on a fat bas is calculated by Kaiser (2010). The BCRs calculated by Kaiser (2010) were for the period 1995 to 2009. Kaiser (2010) did not calculate any BCRs for cheese and butter. Importantly, our BCRs are calculated based upon expenditures made only for demand enhancing activities. The empirical results from the dairy export demand model provide s strong statistical evidence that the USDEC promotion enhancement expenditures have shifted out the world demand for U.S. dairy exports. A critical question, however, is whether the benefit of the increase in exports achieved is greater than the cost of the promotion over the years. O f course, not all the benefits from the additional dairy exports generated by the export promotion expend itures have accrued to dairy producers over the years. Others also have benefited including exporters, milk processors, dairy product manufacturers, and others along the supply chain. When using export data measured on a milk equivalent skim sol ids basis and a milk equivalent fat basis, the return to producers was calculated to be $15.90 and $8.12 per dollar spent on export promotion. Thus, the USDEC dairy export promotion program added more to producer revenues in its effects on low fat dairy product exports than on higher fat content export products. The relatively high BCRs for export promotion are consistent with those found for other export promotion programs (see, for example, Williams, 2012; Williams, Capps, and and Rosson, Hammig, and Jones, 1986). In general, the return to export promotion per dollar often is found to be higher than for domestic prom otion. Our results support this pattern for dairy exports on a skim solids basis but not on a fat basis. In the DMI partnership activities funds are provided to firms that use dairy ingredients in their products or to retailing outlets that position and market dairy products. Pizza restaurants have been heavily involved in partnerships in recent years. Because the partnership programs have a short history and quantitative data specifically for the partner firms is not available, a BCR of the type presented previous ly in this report is not available. However, a related ratio can be estimated. The fact that 25 percent of cheese consumed in the U .S. is on pizza provides relevance for the use of the demand model for cheese as an approach to obtain, albeit indirectly, a benefit -cost of the partnership. 46 To investigate whether there was an associated change in the BCR, we examined the demand model for cheese over the period 1995- 2011 compared to the period 1995- 2008. In terms of the responsiveness of the quantity of cheese consumed with respect to DMI expenditures, there was no significant difference in the advertising elasticity of promotion e xpenditures. Because of the stability in the market structure, it is reasonable to apply the advertising elasticity in a calculation of a BCR to sub- periods, before and after the partnerships. During 2009- 2011, the resulting BCR was calculated to be 7 .7 to 1, a notable increase compared to a BCR of 3.9 to 1 during 1995- 2008 before the partnerships were in place. Partnership s with the Dairy Industry and Retailers Our approach to evaluation is to engage a specific partnership in detail, providing a firm level analysis to the extent possible. Marketing and advertising firms often provide client companies with measures of the impact of a campaign; however those studies are typically confidential and have not been provided to us. Information about sa les, volume of dairy products used, and the nature of the promotion messages have been provided and analyzed. DMI's strategic partner firms operate within the gene ral business environment - a challenge in recent years due to the economic downturn. DMI has undertaken strategic partnerships with retailers and manufacturers , with the retail partners coming from both the restaurant channel and supermarket channel. In each partnership, DMI's expenditure is matched several times over by resources invested by the private sector partner. Specific examples of the partnerships are as follows. The partnership activities with manufacturers include a strategic partnership in 2009 with H.P. Hood to develop a low fat milk product and to create innovative lactose -free products. With General Mills in 2009, the Yoplait Frozen Smoothies line was developed and launched with the assistance of DMI. The leading partnership activity involving supermarket retailers was the Dairy Aisle Reinvention. This category management program aimed at increasing overall sales of dairy products; this project was conducted over a four -year period from 2006 to 2009. Although the Reinvent ion partnership changed assortments and store shelf arrangements for various retailers, the funding originated from manufacturers, notably the Dannon Company, Kraft Foods, Shamrock Farms, and Nestle. This program intended to support the introduction of innovative dairy products, reduce clutter and enhance traffic flow in the supermarket dairy aisle, increase shopper engagement , and as a result , to increase total dairy category sales. More specifically, dairy products were arranged based on meal occasion t o increase the time shoppers spent in the dairy section, to enhance purchase frequency and to increase category sales. As a result of this program, space allocated in the aisle was expanded and the benefits of dairy products were communicated to the consumer. Also, different ways to use dairy products were explained and recipes were made available to encourage purchases. Restaurant businesses involved with the DMI partnerships are mainly quick- serve restaurants and nationally known brands. The Dom ino's Pizza activity is assessed in depth in this study. Also within the pizza industry, a partnership with Pizza Hut in 2002 led to the \"Summer of 47 Cheese\" promotion program. A three -year partnership with McDonald's supported menu development in coffee b everages, Angus cheese burgers, and single -serve milk in resealable plastic containers. Additionally, McDonald's developed McCafe, a specialty coffee line, which uses up to 80 percent milk in the product. A partnership with Starbucks to help develop and launch the line of Vivanno Smoothies featured the use of dairy ingredients, accounting for more than 3.7 million pounds of whey protein annually. Most of the partnership resources have been targeted at the restaurant channel. The highly competitive quick -serve restaurant companies regularly promote new items and features, so it stands to reason that there is great potential for funds from dairy producers to be leveraged well if they are used in developing an innovation that is promoted on national media and sold in nationwide outlets. When the partnerships began, U.S. national income was growing, along with consumer expenditures on eating away from home. However, the economic downturn of 2008 may have interrupted this trend as income constraints led to households eating out less, thus affecting the restaurant channel more than the rest of the food industry. Since the aforementioned strategic partnership programs started and ended in a relatively narrow time frame, a case study approach is utilized, with quantitative as well as qualitative dimensions, to shed light on the effectiveness of DMI's strategic partnerships to enhance consumption of fluid milk and manufactured dairy products. For the 2012 evaluation, we have chosen to analyze the Domino's Pizza partnership, and we provide analysis of the impact of the business cycle on the restaurant channel. Pizza accounts for 25 percent of all cheese consumption in the United States ( U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2011). Given the importance of pizza as a vehicle for cheese consumption, it is reasonable to feature this product line in a promotion effort. Since 2009, DMI has engaged in a partnership with Domino's, whose market share of the quick- serve pizza industry is roughly 10 percent. DMI spent over $35 million over three years in partnership act ivities with Domino's . The Domino's relationship accounted for nearly three -quarters of DMI's overall promotion expenditures in the cheese category over the 2009 to 2011 period. Timeline of the Domino's Partnership Activities Domino's has partnered with DMI since early 2009 using dairy farmer dollars to develop and to promote Domino's pizza offerings. In February 2009, Domino's launched the American Legends line of pizza. This line featured regional specialties such as the Honolulu Hawaiian, the Cali Chicken Bacon Ranch, the Pacific Veggie, the Buffalo Chicken, the Philly Cheese Steak, and the Memphis BBQ Chicken, and was advertised as having 40 percent more cheese than Domino's typical pizza s. Cheese also was used on the crust. Later, Domino's expanded the line from six to eight different pizzas, adding the Fiery Hawaiian and the Wisconsin 6 Cheese. According to Patrick Doyle, President and CEO of Domino's Pizza, \"DMI support has allowed us to focus some advertising dollars on areas we would not have considered otherwise. The Wisconsin 6 Cheese pizza has twice the cheese of a regular pizza, but we had neither developed nor advertised such a product. DMI helped fund the research and media to launch this product\" (Dickrell, 2011). 48 Soon after the new Legends line was promoted, Domino's featured a reduced price Carry -Out Special for a large extra cheese pizza with one topping. This price -reducing strategy was not part of DMI activities associa ted with the partnership. In 2010, Domino's overall same -store sales increased noticeably due primarily to the promotion of the new Legends line and the Carry -Out Special feature. In 2010 and later, there was a modest difference in the focus on cheese. T he predominant message reflected the newly reformulated (\"New and Inspired\") pizza, where the sauce and the crust received promotion attention along with cheese. Coinciding with the launch of the newly reformulated pizza, for those ordering a cheese -only pizza, 50 percent more cheese was used. The Carry -Out Special offers were changed to feature large two -topping pizzas, which did not automatically carry extra cheese. However, Domino's reported that customer research indicated that this change ultimately w ould sell more pizza and therefore more cheese, in line with the objectives of the DMI partnership. Domino's Cheese Volume During the DMI Partnership Volume associated with cheese in the Carry -Out Specials rose by several million additional pounds in 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, when the Carry -Out Special was on, the volume of cheese Domino's purchased for its pizza grew at a faster rate than the growth rate of Domino's revenue. In the category of pizza cheese, there was a significant increase in the volume used by Domino's. The first Carry -Out Special increased pizza cheese volume markedly, and the second Carry -Out Special increased pizza cheese volume by double digits. In 2010, the third and fourth Carry -Out Specials increased cheese use even further. Compared even to the growth given by the first two Carry -Out Specials, these increases were significant. The trend of increases continued in 2011 with the advent of more Carry -Out Specials. The gains in cheese volume represented both an increase in total pizzas sold and an increase in the amount of cheese on certain pizzas, resulting in notable growth in total cheese used at Domino's. In 2010, Domino's added the Wisconsin 6 Cheese pizza to the American Legends line. This recipe contained more cheese than a traditional one -topping pizza. In the five -week promotion period following this pizza's release , coupled with continued momentum from the \"New and Inspired\" re -launch, Domino's cheese volume was greater than the same period in 2009 by a considerable margin, and the uplift persisted several weeks into the launch. In 2011, Domino's released a new line, Stuffed Cheesy Bread, with three varieties. Containing as much cheese as a medium pizza, this item featured twice the amount of che ese than the previous cheese bread sold by Domino's. With the introduction of the American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, Domino's also began to feature certain new specialty cheeses in addition to pizza cheese. The use of these new cheese varieties was low in volume compared to mozzarella , but may have increased consumer awareness of varieties that they might return to or use as complementary to their current cheese purchases. Concluding Remarks This summary provides the independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the dairy industry marketing and promotion programs for 2011. The quantitative analysis covers the period 1995 - 2011. With regard to methodology, the structural econometric models that are pres ented in this 49 report are statistically valid and largely consistent with prior studies in the literature on evaluation of gen eric commodity promotion. The demand models for cheese and butter and the demand models for dairy exports that w ere developed for this study as well as the assessment of DMI's strategic partnerships with industry are unique contributions to the research base on the evaluation of generic dairy promotion programs. Some of the key findings of the economic analysis of the dairy product market that are relevant to future demand enhancing promotion efforts are as follows: Dairy promotion programs were successful in increasing U.S. consumption of dairy products in aggregate, and specifically for fluid milk, cheese, and butter. The incremental cons umption per dollar spent was 2.6 gallons for fluid milk, 3.5 pounds for cheese, and 5.2 pounds for butter. Put another way, due to the dairy promotion programs, fluid milk consumption was 5.8 percent higher than it otherwise would have been over the study period. Similarly, the promotion a ctivities of DMI resulted in 2.8 percent more cheese consumptio n and 1.4 percent more butter consumption than otherwise would have occurred over the same period. The gains in revenue at the farm level were far larger than the costs of the checkoff program. The BCRs for fluid milk were calc ulated to be $3.95 for every dollar invested; for cheese $4 .43 for every dollar invested; and for butter $6.26 for every dollar invested. The BCRs were calculated to be 12.81 on a skims solids basis and 14.14 for all dairy product s on a fat basis. Own prices of fluid milk, cheese, butter, and all dairy products were s ignificant drivers of consumer demand for the various dairy products . Income was a significant driver of the consumption of cheese, butter, and all dairy products, but not for fluid milk. Income is positively associated with the consumption of fluid milk , cheese, butter, and all dairy products. Fluid milk consumption was affected negatively by advertising from other beverage manufacturers, namely fruit juice, soy beverages, and bottled water. USDEC d airy export promotion expenditures increased f oreign d emand for U.S. dairy products, both on a fat basis and on a skim solids basis. DMI allocations to export enhancement represented almost 70 percent of USDEC exports promotion funding over the study period. On a skim solids ba sis, the export promotion programs carried out by the USDEC yielded 3.1 percent more dairy exports, and on a fat basis , 6.1 percent more dairy expor ts. The increase in revenue generated from dairy export promotion was far greater than the promotion expenditures; importantly, the effectiveness was greater for low fat dairy products (on a milk equivalent skim solids basis) than for high fat content dairy products (on a milk equivalent fat basis). The BCR to dairy producers measured in te rms of BCRs for exports on a skim solids basis was calculated to 15.90, while the BCR to dairy producers for exports on a fat basis was calculated to be 8.12. 50 The BCR for dairy export promotion e xceeded that of d omestic dairy product promotion on a skim solids basis but not on a fat basis . This finding suggests that reallocation of expenditures to export promotion programs might not necessarily result in net benefits in terms of total industry revenues and dairy producer profits . This finding also suggests that there may be some benefit to shifting resources to promoting exports of low fat dairy products. The DMI strategic partnership programs have engaged food retailers in the dairy indust ry checkoff program in a variety of ways. This report provides an overview of the partnership activities with supermarket and restaurant retailers and manufacturers since 2002. A case study of the partnership with Domino's from 2009 to 2011 was t he basis for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the partnerships. Findings of the case study were: The promotional activities with Domino's included new product lines, use of more cheese than had been provided on similar items in the Domino's chain before the partnership, and the introduction of specialty cheeses into the company's recipes. In short, the assistance of dairy dollars was instrumental in positively affecting the pizza category, a category that is very important to the dairy industry. The competitive structure of the quic k serve pizza industry led other companies to imitate the product lines that used more cheese, generating positive spillover to the entire category. The partner company also undertook a price discounting strategy along with product development, which enhanced the volume of cheese sold because more pizza was sold. DMI's expenditures on the Domino's partnership accounted for three -fourths of the promotion expenditure on cheese during 2009- 2011. The same period is associated with a higher BCR for cheese promotion than was the case prior to the partnership. It is not possible to conclude that the partnership alone drove the improved effectiveness, but this finding is suggestive of success in promotion of the cheese category. 51 National Dairy Promotion and Research Board Member Listing Region 1 (Oregon and Washington) George E.
