When buying body care products, [make the best choices for your budget and body that align with your values](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) and, in the process, rediscover a healthier, interdependent relationship with nature. Or \u2014 better yet \u2014 make your own. (Some ingredients in the recipes below you can grow yourself too.) David Suzuki often says \"What we do to nature, we do to ourselves.\" The reverse is also true. What you put in or on your body affects the world around you. How can you best honour that relationship? Practise responsible reciprocity: take care of what takes care of you. Essential oils Essential oils are great for aromatherapy, body care and cleaning.

Pour mixture into large bowl or tub big enough to soak both feet! Top with warm water and add essential oil. Stir and soak. Cocoa butter lotion Solid at room temperature, cocoa butter will melt with your body heat. Shelf life: three months. - 60 ml (4 tbsp) cocoa butter - 60 ml (4 tbsp) sweet almond oil - 60 ml (4 tbsp) grated beeswax Optional: - 10 drops of an essential oil of your choice Melt ingredients together over a double boiler. Pour into an airtight container and cool. Add essential oils last. Did you know? Sweet almond oil is easily absorbed by the body, revives the skin and won't clog pores. Hand sanitizer Shelf life: shouldn't expire - 60 ml (4 tbsp) pure aloe gel - 125 ml (1/2 cup) grain alcohol (e.g., vodka) or rubbing alcohol - 5-8 drops tea tree or thyme essential oil Optional: add 30 ml (2 tbsp) vegetable glycerin to combat the alcohol's drying effect. Mix and store in a squeeze bottle. Note: Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers work in a pinch, washing hands with soap and water is more effective. For COVID-19, health authorities recommend using hand sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol \u2014 but even that won't work well on visibly dirty hands. Boost this recipe by reducing aloe to 30 ml (2 tbsp) and choosing rubbing alcohol. We each have a responsibility and role to steward the lands and waters. When we honour our ability to create with our hands, this changes our mindset and the choices we make. It can lead us back to the garden where we can grow some of the plant ingredients we need.
