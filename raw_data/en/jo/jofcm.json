Lymph nodes: A rounded mass of lymphatic tissue that is surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Lymph nodes filter lymph, store white blood cells and help the immune system fight disease. Lymphatic system: The tissues and organs that produce, store and carry white blood cells that fight infections and other diseases. The system includes the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels (a network of thin tubes that carry lymph and white blood cells). Like blood vessels, lymphatic vessels branch into all the tissues of the body. Lynch syndrome: An inherited disorder also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. In addition to being at higher than average risk for colon cancer, a woman has a higher-than-normal chance of developing ovarian and uterine cancer, often before the age of 50, if she has Lynch syndrome.

Metastasis: The spread of cancer cells from one part of the body to another, often by way of the lymph system or bloodstream. A tumor formed by cells that have spread is called a secondary tumor and contain cells that are like those in the original tumor. It is also called a \"metastatic tumor\" or a \"metastasis.\" Metastasize: To spread from one part of the body to another. When cancer cells metastasize and form secondary tumors, the cells in the metastatic tumor are like those in the original (primary) tumor.

[Ovarian cancer](https://ocrahope.org/get-the-facts/about-ovarian-cancer/): Cancer that forms in the tissues of the ovary (one of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed). There are three types of ovarian cancer-epithelial, germ cell, and stromal cell. Epithelial ovarian is the most common. It accounts for more than 85 percent of ovarian cancers. It begins in the cells on the surface of the ovary. Germ cell cancers start in cells that form eggs in the ovary. Stromal cell tumors start in the supporting connective tissue that holds the ovary together. Ovarian germ cell tumor: Ovarian germ cell tumors start in the cells that produce individual eggs in the ovary. This type of tumor is rare, usually occurring in teenage girls or women younger than age 20. Many germ cell tumors are noncancerous. Ovary: One of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed. The ovaries are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus.

Pleural cavity: A space enclosed by the pleura (thin tissue covering the lungs and lining the interior wall of the chest cavity). It is bound by thin membranes. Pleural effusion: An abnormal collection of fluid between the thin layers of tissue (pleura) lining the lung and the wall of the chest cavity. Pre-clinical trial: Research using animals to find out if a new drug, procedure or treatment is likely to be useful. Preclinical studies take place before any testing in humans is done. Primary therapy: Initial treatment used to reduce ovarian cancer. Primary treatment is followed by other treatments, such as chemotherapy, to get rid of cancer that remains. Prognosis: The likely outcome or course of a disease; the chance of recovery or recurrence. Progression-free survival: The length of time during and after the treatment of cancer that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. Protocol: A detailed plan of a scientific experiment, treatment, or procedure. In clinical trials, it says what the study will do, how it will be done, and why it is being done. It also details how many people will be in the study, who is eligible to take part in it, what tests will be done and how often, and what information will be collected. Quality of life: The overall enjoyment of life. Many clinical trials assess the effects of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life. These studies measure an individual's sense of well-being and ability to carry out normal life activities. Radiation therapy: Treatment with high-energy radiation from x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, protons, and other sources, to kill cancer cells or shrink a tumor. Randomized trial: A study in which the participants in a clinical trial are assigned by chance to separate groups that compare different treatments. Neither the researchers nor the participants can choose which group. Recurrence: Cancer that has recurred (come back) usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. The cancer could come back to the same place as the original tumor or to another place in the body. Also called recurrent cancer. Refractory cancer: This describes a disease or condition that does not respond to treatment. Regional cancer: Refers to cancer that has grown beyond the original tumor to nearby lymph nodes or organs and tissues. Remission: Complete or partial disappearance of the signs and symptoms of cancer in response to treatment. A remission may not be a cure. In complete remission, all signs and symptoms of cancer have disappeared, although cancer still may be in the body. Salpingo-oophorectomy: Removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries. Scan: A look at structures within the body. Scans often used in diagnosing, staging, and monitoring disease include CAT scans and MRI scans. Second-look surgery: Surgery performed after primary treatment to determine whether tumor cells remain. Side effects: Unwanted effects of treatment that can include hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores, and neuropathy (nerve damage). Stable disease: Cancer that is neither growing nor shrinking. [Stage](https://ocrahope.org/get-the-facts/staging/): The extent of a cancer in the body. Staging is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread from the other site to other parts of the body, and whether lymph nodes contain cancer. Ovarian cancer is divided into four stages by the location of the tumor cells at the time of the initial diagnosis. Stromal cell tumors: These tumors start in the supporting connective tissue that holds the ovary together. The female hormones estrogen and progesterone are made in the stromal cells. The tumors can occur in women of any age, but they are uncommon. Systemic: Affecting the entire body. Systemic chemotherapy employs drugs that travel through the bloodstream to cells all over the body. Targeted therapy: A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted agents tend to have fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapy drugs. Taxol: Trade name for the drug paclitaxel.

Topotecan: Generic name for the drug Hycamtin. Used to treat recurrent ovarian cancer. Transfusion: A procedure in which a person is given an infusion of donated blood. Transvaginal ultrasound: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and bladder. An instrument is inserted into the vagina that causes sound waves to bounce off organs inside the pelvis. These sound waves create ultrasound echoes that are sent to a computer, which creates a picture (a sonogram). Transvaginal ultrasound is also referred to as transvaginal sonography and TVS. Tumor: A lump or mass of cancerous or noncancerous cells. Unresectable: Unable to be removed with surgery. Uterus: The small, hollow, pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis.
