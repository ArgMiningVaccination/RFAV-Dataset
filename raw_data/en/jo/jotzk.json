Around this time of year, I know my sinuses need special attention and support. While allopathic medicine suggests antibiotics and steroid shots to the derri\u00e8re for sinus issues, I thankfully have found natural remedies to be much less painful and very effective at maintaining sinus health. Here are three holistic remedies to support your sinuses: 1. Nasal Rinse with a Neti Pot Neti pots are a tried and true sinus savior! They are inexpensive and widely available for purchase online and in health food stores. I suggest using a ceramic or glass pot like the one pictured. You'll be using warm water so avoid using a plastic neti pot, which can leach harmful toxins. The saline solution is used to thin mucus from nasal passages, and it can be easily made at home. [[1]](#_ftn1) Make your neti pot solution: To make the solution, mix \u00bd teaspoon of kosher (not table) salt and two cups of warm (not hot... trust me on this one!) filtered water. Be sure to use filtered water when nasal rinsing\u2014you don't want any unwanted pathogens entering your sinus cavity! One-quarter teaspoon of baking soda can also be added to the solution. Stir the solution well and add to the neti pot. Now is the moment of truth! I admit that using a neti pot feels a little awkward the first time, but you'll quickly get the hang of it. Using your neti pot to nasal rinse: Standing over a sink, bend over and down, turn your right ear towards the drain, and place the neti pot over your left nostril. Let the solution drain through your left nostril and out of your right nostril. Alternate sides until the solution is gone and repeat twice daily until you feel better. Make sure and sterilize your neti pot after each use. Photo by Shelby Webb. 2. Get to Know Your Oil of Oregano Oregano Origanum vulgare (L.) essential oil is very cleansing, purifying, and a great wellness support. I have found one drop of oregano O. vulgare essential oil blended with one tablespoon of carrier oil (such as olive oil) to be most effective in promoting normal nasal mucus. If you don't mind the taste of oregano oil (note that this option is not for the faint of heart!), one to two drops of the diluted oil can be taken directly by mouth. Note that this is NOT the pure [essential oil, but oregano essential oil](https://achs.edu/blog/2021/08/12/essential-oil-chemotypes-herbs-part-1/) diluted with a carrier. Do not take undiluted oregano essential oil internally. 3. Try Turmeric Tea As if we needed another reason to love turmeric Curcuma longa (L.)! This amazing herb's properties, when combined with ginger in tea, can help promote normal mucus in the nasal passages. To make the tea, combine eight ounces hot water, one-inch piece of grated fresh ginger Zingiber officinale (Roscoe), and one teaspoon of turmeric C. longa, and steep for five minutes. Add honey to taste. A Few More Tips... Of course, whenever you're filling a little \"full\" in the face and sinuses, stay true to your holistic principles of everyday wellness. Keep hydrated by drinking plenty of filtered water and healthy fluids. Hydration helps your body regulate the mucous and pressure in your sinuses and nasal passages. [[2]](#_ftn2) Photo by Shelby Webb. Use a humidifier, especially at night. During the dry winter months, using a humidifier replaces and maintains the moisture in the air, which helps keep your nasal passages moist. You can experiment by adding a few drops of essential oils like peppermint Mentha \u00d7piperita (L.) or eucalyptus Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) to your humidifier. Maintain your holistic nutrition. Eat whole, real foods, preferably ones that contain vitamin C (like kale, strawberries, and of course, citrus) and zinc (like spinach, pumpkin seeds, and cashews). As usual, load up on lots of fruits and veggies! Have you tried any of these remedies? What holistic sinus remedies do you use? Let me know in the comments!
