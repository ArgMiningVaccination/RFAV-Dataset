This study sought to assess and identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine short-term side effects among health-care workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 654 Ghanaian healthcare workers between 16th March and 5th May 2021. The study included health-care workers in registered health settings, who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 and consented to participate in the survey. Descriptive statistics, binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were executed using SPSS version 22 at p < .05. The findings revealed that, 528 (80.7%) of the participants experienced adverse reactions, which lasted between 0 and 2 days among, 347 (53.1%) of the study participants. The most reported adverse reactions were general body weakness, 434 (32.0%), headache 371 (27.3%), and fever, 257 (19.1%). Health workers aged 35-39 and 40-44 years had lower odds of adverse reactions compared with those aged 25-29 years (aOR: 0.34, 0.201,0.890, p = .023). Taking analgesics before vaccination decreased the likelihood of adverse reactions (aOR: 0.28, 95% C.I. 0.185,0.427, p < .001). High prevalence of adverse reactions was found among the healthcare workers, however short-lived. The most reported systemic adverse reactions were general body weakness, headache, and fever. We recommend intensification of campaigns on COVID-19 vaccines and their associated adverse effects to avoid the negative implication on uptake among the healthcare workers and the general population.
