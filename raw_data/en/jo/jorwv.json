Introduction The immune system is composed of an organs network and cells and molecules that maintain the body's homeostasis.Factors that compromise the functionality of the immunesystemcanmakesimpleinfectionsspreadbecomingfatal[1]. The major innate immunity cells that reach the site of injury are neutrophils and macrophages. These cells exert phagocytic activity, releasing highly destructive substances like enzymes that digest proteins, generating reactive chem-icals products. When these cells fail to control infection,lymphocytesareactivatedandincorporatetheadaptationandmemoryfunctions,allowingtheimmunesystemtoelaborateincreasinglyspecificresponses[2]. The first defense of the organism to tissue damage is the inflammatoryresponse,acomplexbiologicalprocessinvolv-ing vascular and cellular components, and a diversity ofsoluble substances, which presents as characteristic clinicalsigns:flushing,heat,edema,pain,andfunctionalimpairment[3]. The purpose of this process is to remove the inducingstim ulusfromtheresponseandinitia telocaltissuereco very .During inflammation, several biochemical systems are acti-vated, such as complement and coagulation cascades, aiding intheestablishment,evolution,andresolutionoftheprocess. Inaddition,solublesubstancesofshorthalf-lifearereleased, develop their action, and then are degraded. In general,successful removal of triggering stimulus leads to the end ofacuteresponseandtissuerepair[4]. 2. Inflammation and Tissue Repair Wound healing is a complex event that develops in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling (Fig- ure 1). These phases are distinct in function and histologicalcharacteristics. However, they depend on interaction of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and chemical medi- atorsfromcellstoperformregulatoryevents[5,6].

(b) In the proliferation occurs (3) angiogenesis; (4) reepithelization (epithelial cell mitosis and fibroblasts transformation into myofibroblasts), and granulation tissue injury, vasoconstric- tion occurs with the substances release, such as serotonin,thromboxane A2, and prostacyclin by cell membranes, inordertopreventbloodleakage.Theexposedcollagensignalsthe activation of coagulation cascade and in a coordinatedway the platelets adhere to damaged blood vessels, initiatinghemostasis, with the buffer formation composed of fibrinand thrombin. This buffer will have main functions, suchas to prevent the cellular elements loss; to serve as physicalbarrier to microorganisms' entry; and to act as provisionalmatrix, cytokines' deposit and growth factors that will befundamentalformaintenanceofotherhealingphases[4]. The inflammatory response begins with vasodilation, stimulated by soluble factors release such as nitric oxide,bradykinin,histamine,andEandIseriesprostaglandins.Theincrease in vascular permeability with consequent fluid lossleads to slow blood flow, allowing leukocytes, mainly neu-trophils, to interact with endothelium in an events sequenceinvolving margination (free leukocytes capture in the vas-cular lumen); transmigration (leukocyte pas- sage through endothelial cells), and, finally, the targeting of leukocytes to focus of lesion under influence of several inflammatorymediatorswithchemotacticactivityandalter- ationsofvascularendothelialmembraneproteins[7]. To achieve extravascular space towards the injured tis- leukocytes depend on adhesion molecules expressionsuch as recruit- ment of leukocytes along the endothelial cells followed by the actions of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 molecules to reduce leukocyte rolling velocity and allow its strong adhesion to endothelium[9]. Inthefirstfewhoursafterinjury,neutrophilsarerecruited and mediate tissue damage through the release of proteases,cytokines, and other factors contained in cytoplasmic gran- ules [10]. These cells generate antimicrobial proteases (cathepsins, defensins, lactoferrin, and lysozyme) with the function of destroying potentially pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, they release enzymes such as collagenases and elastases that aid devitalized tissues digestion, essential for tissue renewal in followingrepairphases[11]. Neutrophils also produce various types of membrane metalloproteinases(MMPs),havingasmainsubtypesMMP-8, which cleaves fibrillar collagen, and MMP-2/MMP-9, which cleave collagen IV (among other substrates), both involved in the extracellular matrix degradation. The MMPs activity is inhibited by a molecules class called tissue inhibitorsofmetalloproteinases(TIMPs)producedbyacells variety on skin. If the proteases activity and their inhibitors are not strictly regulated the granulation tissue formation may be impaired [12]. Thus, uncontrolled neutrophil migra-tion generates a cycle of recruitment and activation of these cells leading to excessive ROS and proteases produc- tion,causingundesiredextracellularmatrixdegradationand additional tissue damage, which may progress to chronic inflammationwithconsequentdefectivecollagendeposition, reducedtissueresistance,andlatereepithelialization,limiting healing [13]. Moreover, they release cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ), interleukin- (IL-) 1 (IL-1), a n dI L - 6 ,w h i c ha m p l i fyt h ei n fl a m m a t o ryr e s p o n s eb ya c t i -vating more neutrophils and cells such as macrophages, and which, although essential for the repair cells activation, can generate deleterious effects when exacerbated release occurs [5]. In intact skin, macrophages are the most abundant cell typesperformingsentinelandhomeostaticfunction.Inskinlesioncase,themonocytesmigratefromvascularcirculationto wound. Both infiltrating and resident macrophages on skin are activated by local signals and develop into several subpopulations defined by their different functional pheno- types[14].Pathogen-associatedmolecularpatterns(PAMPs)expressed by microbes and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) produced cell stress activate macrophagesinclassicform,typeM1,thatactashostdefense, producingproinflammatorymediatorssuchasIL-1,IL-6,IL- 12,TNF-,andinduciblenitricoxidesynthase(iNOS),aswell mediators as into apoptosis initiating the consists of four fundamental stages: reepithelization, angio- genesis, granulation tissue formation, and collagen deposi- tion. This phase is characterized by intense cellular activity aiming to repair the connective tissue and to form granula- tiontissueandepithelium[18]. During reepithelialization, the keratinocytes migration fromwoundandepithelialattachmentsstimulatedbygrowth factorsreleasearemainlyresponsibleformitosesincreaseand epithelialhyperplasia[19].Fibroblastsmigratetoprovisional matrix to degrade it, proliferating and producing MMPs. They also produce collagen, proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, glycosaminoglycans, and fibronectin to form granulation tissue, which fills the wound space and provides support for cell adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation during woundrepair[20]. Angiogenesis is essential for nutrition and oxygenation of new tissue being formed. The formation of new blood vessels is initiated by growth factors, such as VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and basic fibroblast growthfactor(bFGF).Aftersecretingproteolyticenzymestodissolvethebasallamina,endothelialcellsescapefromexistingbloodvessels, proliferate and migrate to the source of angiogenicstimulus, and providing oxygen for maintenance of cellularfunctions[21]. Collagen production starts from time of granulation tissue formation through production, deposition, digestion,and reorganization steps. Initially, the collagen fibers are deposited in disorganized form, following a fibronectin model. Subsequently, in the attempt to organize these, they undergo digestion through enzymes of action produced by neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts [18]. Next, new fibers will be produced and deposited in more organized way, following the adjacent connective tissue, initiating the remodelingphase[22]. The remodeling phase occurs most expressively at the endofgranulationtissueformationstep.Tissuedevelopment, increasedmechanicalstressandcytokineexpression,suchasTGF- , stimulate fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibrob- lasts, which express a smooth muscle actin with contractile4 InternationalJournalofInflammation function, favoring the locomotion of these cells from edges tolesioncenterforwoundcontraction[23].Atthisstage,thecollagen III produced rapidly in the extracellular matrix isreplaced by collagen I, which has a higher tensile strength,but takes more time to deposit [22]. The new collagen willbe composed of larger fibers with greater fibrils number and with significant amount of cross-links between them, characterizing an increase in fiber diameter and tensilestrengthacquiredbyscar[24]. 3. Regulatory Factors Involved in Inflammation and Healing Wound healing is strongly regulated by a large number ofcytokines andgrowthfactors, actingas arethemostdescribed,differinginthewaythey are activated and function: IL-1 into a biolog- ically active protein and IL-1 is translated as a propeptide that requires processing by caspase-1 enzyme in the inflam-masome [7, 26]. IL-1 is a key interleukin of antimicrobial response by inflammatory response amplification; it stimu-latesleukocyterecruitment,theacutephaseproteinsrelease,and the increase of blood vessels permeability, as well asstimulating Cox II expression and, as a consequence, theprostanoidsformationandrelease[27-29]. Prostanoids have a central role in inflammation, blood coagulation,angiogenesis,woundhealing,vasculartone,andimmune responses, among others [30, 31], and the suppres-sion of their actions has been one of the main therapeutictargetsforanti-inflammatorydrugsdevelopment[32]. TNF-is pleiotropic cytokine produced by a cell types variety,includingkeratinocytes,macrophages,andmastcells.Itactsonseveralstagesofleukocyterecruitmentmechanism,mainlyneutrophils,inducingmolecularadhesionregulation,chemokine production, and metalloproteinases matrix, aswellastissueinhibitorsofmetalloproteinases.TNF- mayact in a beneficial or deleterious way in wound healing and its elevation leads to decrease in granulation tissue production whileitsreductionpromotesabettercollagenfibersarrange-ment. Another function of this factor is to suppress TGF- inthestimulationofextracellularmatrix(ECM)production,butontheotherhanditindirectlyactsonreepithelializationbyinducingkeratinocytegrowthfactorproduction,togetherwithIL-1[25,33]. The keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) or fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) is an important member of FGFfamily involved in wound repair. The injured epitheliumrepairalsodependsonthemitogenicpotencyofKGF,whichis produced by dermal fibroblasts and acts IFN- (interferon-gamma) [10]. The main action of IL-8 is great migratory motivation forimmune system cells, mainly neutrophils, also determininganincreaseintheexpressionofadhesionmoleculesbyendo-thelialcells[11]. Migrationandcellproliferationaregrowthfactordepen- dent mechanisms.

The VEGF family proteins act as angiogenesis regulators during cellular development [38]. In response to hypoxiac a u s e db yi n j u r y ,V E G Fi sr e l e a s e db ym a c r o p h a g e s ,fi b r o b -lasts, and epithelial cells, resulting in increased nitric oxideandendothelialprogenitorcellsmobilization[21].Angiogen-esis,formationofnewbloodvesselsfrompreexistingvessels,is an important phenomenon for the cicatrization prolifer-ative phase by temporarily increasing the vessels number atlesionsite,favoringoxygenandnutrientsflow,toxinremoval,cell migration, and signal transduction [39], contributingfundamentallytotissuesgrowthandregeneration.However,whenuncontrolled,italsocontributestopathologiesprogres-sion such as arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer, being regulatedby numerous pro- and antiangiogenic factors which are inequilibriumundernormalconditions[39-41]. However, situations such as wound healing, growth- relatedhypoxia,andinflammationcauseimbalance,inducing several proangiogenic factors activation, such as cytokines, lipidmediators,andgrowthfactors.Skinregenerationduring thewoundhealingprocessandboneregenerationareexam- ples that an increase in angiogenesis level can accelerate and improvetheoutcomewhileavoidingnecrosis[42]. One of the most important proangiogenic mediators is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by stimulatingtheendothelialcellfunctionsnecessaryfornewbloodvessels formation, as well as for tissue proliferation, migration, dif- ferentiation, and survival, contributing to both angiogenesisand influencing wound repair and closure, and granulation tissueformation[43]. VEGF is produced in response to lesions by a cells vari- ety, including keratinocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts, developingvariousrolesinthehealingprocess.Acutely,theyincreasevascularpermeability,adhesioncellsexpression,andselectins,recruitinginflammatorycellssuchasmacrophagesandmastcells,importantinseveralstagesofhealing[44-46].Intheproliferativephase,itwasverifiedthatVEGFregulatesseveralaspects,includingepidermalrepairanddermisbarri-ers,actingdirectlyonkeratinocytesandmacrophageswhichalsoexpressreceptors(VEGFRs),whosecellularactivitiesarealso favored by oxygen and nutrients carried by new bloodvessels[47,48]. It is believed that VEGF levels present in wound can have a healing impact. Insufficient vascularization has been associatedwithabnormallylowlevelsofactiveVEGFproteinInternationalJournalofInflammation 5 in individuals with wound closure difficulties, reduction in granulation tissue reepithelialization, and formation com- monlyindiabeticpatients[49,50].Inaddition,drugsusedtoblock VEGF activity, as in cancer treatment cases, represent a significant risk for tissue repair process [51]. After topical treatment with recombinant VEGF or via viral vector orliposome mediated gene transfer, there was acceleration inwoundclosure,granulationtissueincreasing,andimprovingtheresistancetowoundrupture,influencingdepositedcolla-genproductionorarrangement[50,52-54].

Once the endothelial cells (ECs) are primed by hypoxia and activated by VEGF during the proliferative phase, thereare probably several redundant intracellular negative feed-back mechanisms protecting ECs from VEGF overstimula-tion during the postproliferative and remodeling phases ofhealing which help to guide them into regression [59, 60]. Itappears that the postproliferative wound [61]. Interestingly, the proangiogenic mediator VEGF may be one of factors responsible for vessel regression initiation in postproliferative phase. Studies have found that ECs activa- tion by VEGF simultaneously marks these cells for death by inductionofdeathreceptorFas,alsoknownasCD95,whichinitiatesapoptoticsignalingpathways[59,60],makingthemlessresistanttodeathbyapoptosis-promotingsignals. Finally,differentfibroblastsubpopulationsmayplayarole in determining the fibroblast's areangiorestrictive, presumably because of nonsoluble factorssuchassecretedECMcomposition.Atthewoundresolutionphaseonset,fibroblastsmayswitchtoanantiangiogenicphe-notypeduetocontactinhibitionandnormalizingoxygenlev-els to regulate ECM remodeling, indirectly mediating vessel regression[62].Besidesthesolubleandmatricellularfactors,an essential class of antiangiogenic molecules are thosederived from ECM components, generated when cleave large ECM proteins into bioactivepeptides[63]. Severalantiangiogenesisfactorsactindifferentsignaling pathwaystoregulateendothelialcellproliferation,migration,and survival as well as help limit excessive angiogenesisduringwoundhealing,inflammation,anddiseaseprocesses: (1) Inhibits the migration and/or proliferation (TIMP) inhibits remodeling which is necessary forefficientendothelialcellsmigrationandproliferation [70, 71]; endostatin, was found to inhibit the migra- tion, but not the proliferation, of endothelial cells in vitro and disrupt tumor vascularization and growth inmice[72];thrombospondin-1inhibitsangiogenesisthrough direct effects on endothelial migration and survival through indirect effects on growth factor mobilization[73] (2) Induces apoptotic death of endothelial cells: inter- NF-B, PPAR , and p53 mediated processes while inhibitingtheirproliferationandmigration[77-79] angiogenesis activators: interferons(, ,and of VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1) with high affinity for VEGF- A has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis through the regulation of VEGFR2 activation and inhibition of downstream mitogenic activities EC proliferation VEGF signaling and initiating apoptosis [89].

IL-10isaregulatorycytokineproducedbydifferentcells, Th1 cells, natural killercells, and M1 macrophages, but stimulates M2 to produce VEGF, aiding in increased angiogenesis [91, 92]. It can also inhibit the production of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- ,I L - IL-6 [91]. In addition toitspotentanti-inflammatoryeffects,IL-10hasbeenshown toregulatefibrogeniccytokines,suchastransforminggrowth factor-(TGF- ),as a part of its role in the regulation o f tissue remodeling [93]. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that rhIL-10-treated rat incisions healed with decreased inflammation, better scar histology, and better6 InternationalJournalofInflammation macroscopic scar appearance. RhIL-10-treated human inci- sions at low concentrations healed with better macroscopic scarappearanceandlessredscars[94]. 4. MicroRNA and Wound Healing MicroRNAs(miRs)areapproximately22nucleotides(nt)not encoding RNAs that bind to the 3-untranslated regions (3- UTR) of target messenger RNA (mRNA) and result in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression [95] and have beenfoundtoregulateavarietyofcellularandphysiological functionsinheathanddisease.ThemiRsexpressionderegu- lationhasbeenshowntobeassociatedwithvariousdiseases. During wound healing, microRNAs play versatile roles but their functions are not yet understood [96]. The ability to therapeutically manipulate the miRs expression through administration of inducers and/or inhibitors showed excite- mentaboutthetherapeuticpotentialofmiRsfornonhealing wounds[97]. MicroRNAs are present in all tissue types and regulate a wide variety of processes at the cellular level, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [98]. The miRs a c ta sa g o n i s t sa n da n t a g o n i s t si nt h ep r o c e s so fr e s t o r i n g skinbarrierfunction.ChangesinthespecificmiRsexpression during different phases may be associated with abnormal woundhealing[99]. SeveralpiecesofevidencesupportthatmiRsregulatesig- nalsinwoundhealingphases.(1)Intheinflammatoryphase, macrophagesareregulatedbymiR-146aandmiR-155,which promote cytokines and growth on programmed cell-death protein 4(PDCD4)expression[102].miR-146a,miR-155,andmiR-21 a r er e p o r t e dt ob el i n k e dt ow o u n dh e a l i n gp r o c e s s e s[ 1 0 3 , 104]. While miRs promote and induce inflammation, they also downregulate and terminate the phase [101]. (2) In the proliferation phase, new blood vessels begin to form to promptly provide the healing area with abundant oxygen andnutrientsthroughangiogenesis/neovascularization[105].SeveralstudieshaveidentifiedmiRsintheregulationofvari- ousaspectsoftheangiogenicresponsetovariouspathophys- iological stimuli. For example, the miR- 23-miR-27-miR-24 cluster promote proangiogenic activity [106-112].Furthermore,keratinocytesmigratefromtheedge of the wound to the wound site and begin to proliferate and differentiate to restore skin integrity, a process that can be inhibited by several miRs, including miR-198, miR -203, and miR-483-3p [113-115]. (3) The remodeling phase beginswhenwoundisclosed[103].miR-29aregulatesdermalfibroblastsbytheircontractilitycontrolthroughTABL1[116].miR-192/215 increases E-cadherin expression by repressedtranslationofZEB2[117],whileE-cadherinplaysarolerestor-ing the skin barrier integrity. The discovery of several miRsinvolved in the remodeling phase regulation still requires furtherinvestigation. MicroRNA 26a (miR-26a) has been reported to partici- pate in normal development, metabolic process, and wound response [118]. Furthermore, miR-26a also regulates the growth of endothelial cells during physiological and patho- logical angiogenesis by targeting BMP/SMAD1 signaling [119].AlsoaroleformiR-26ainregulationofdiabeticwound healing progression was identified. miR-26a expression is induced in diabetic mice wounds and its neutralization promotewoundclosurethroughincreasedgranulationtissue, induction of SMAD1 signaling in ECs, and enhanced angio- genesis. These findings indicate miR-26a therapeutic inhi- bition as promising treatment for diabetic subjects with impaireddermalwoundhealing[96]. Though miRs could be new potential therapeutic target forwoundhealing,itisstillfarfrombeingarealapplication, andfurtherstudiesareneededtoidentifythemiRsinvolved ineachwoundhealingphase. 5. Toll-Like Receptors in Wound Healing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a group of pattern recogni-tion receptors (PRRs) highly conserved that indicate the presence of several pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to cellular constituents of the immune system.After binding to different biochemical components of pro- tozoa,bacteria,andviruses,TLRsviaNF- damage-associated they are inaccessible to the immune systemunderphysiologicalconditionsorundergochangesin responsetoinjury,leadingtorecognitionbyPRRs.Following tissue injury, these patterns are unmasked or released from damaged cells and subsequently trigger inflammation viaTLRsandotherPRRs.Consequently,TLRscanbeconsidered asmastersafeguardsoftissuestructuralintegrity:activatedby molecularindicatorsofinfectionorinjurythatplayakeyrole intheinitiationofwoundrepair[120]. TLRactivationinwoundhealingappearstobemediated by two classes of ligands. (1) In organs such as the gut, skin, and liver that are in direct contact with microbial products,tissue lesions lead to a protective barriers breakdown and consequently activation of TLR by bacteria PAMPs. (2) In m a n yo r g a n s ,s u c ha st h el i v e r ,h e a r t ,a n dk i d n e y ,t h et i s s u e injury leads to DAMPs release from dead cells, resulting in TLRsactivation.TheendogenousTLRligandsreleaseoccurspredominantly after tissue damage, especially in situations whereasignificantportionofcellsundergonecrosis,suchas ischemia-reperfusioninjury[121-123]. According to their biological actions, the TLRs were implicated in different phases of wound healing: TLRs acti- vation modifies tissue injury in positive or negative way by recruitinginflammatorycellsthatreleasecytotoxicmediatorsInternationalJournalofInflammation 7 or by activating cytoprotective signals, enhances fibrogenic responsesinfibroblasts,andpromotesregenerativeresponses [124,125]. Several lines of evidence support that TLRs regulate sig- nalsinwoundhealing.(1)TopicalapplicationofTLR3agonist poly-(I:C) for wound closure in mice promotes reepithe- lialization,granulation,andneovascularization.Remarkably, topicalapplicationofpoly-(I:C)inpatientswithlaserplastic s u r g e rya c c e l e r a t e sw o u n dc l o s u r e[ 1 2 6 ] .O nth eo th e rh a n d , mice without TLR3 exhibit delayed wound healing parame- ters, as neovascularization, granulation formation, acids, (IFN). or TLR9, or deficiency of MyD88 and TLR7, inhibits type I IFN production. The presence of dendritic cells and production of type I IFN are required for reepithelialization [128].TLR9knockoutmiceexhibitageneraldelayinwound healing.Furthermore,administrationoftheTLR9CpGODN agonist promotes influx of macrophages to the wound site a n di n c r ea se sth ep r od u cti o no fv a scul a re n d o th e l i algr o w th factor, accelerating neovascularization of the wound in mice [129] and wound closure in nonhuman primates [130]. (3) Excisional skin wounds in MyD88 /mice heal by slower rate than wounds in wild-type MyD88+/+,s h o w i n gd e l a y e d contraction, diminished and delayed granulation tissue, and reduced density of fresh blood vessels [131]. (4) In vitro and in vivo data has showed that TLR4 becomes upregulatedwithin the first 12-24 hours following injury and slowly decreasesat10daysandismainlyconcentratedinepidermal keratinocytes.Thesamestudyevidencedsignificantdeterio- ration of wound healing in TLR4 deficient mice at days 1-5, and no difference shown from wild-type at 10 days [132].Another study also observed impairment in wound healing in TLR2 and TLR4 deficient mice on days 3 and 7 [133]. The TLR4andTLR2activationappearstohaveabeneficialeffect on wound healing in the early stages following acute injury [134]. (5) The TLRs stimulation plays an important role inpromoting normal wound healing, but that excessive TLR signalingcontributestomaladaptiveorhypertrophicwound healingandfibrosis[135]. Evidences suggest that TLRs have important roles in w o u n dh e a l i n ga n dm o d u l a t et h ei n n a t ei m m u n er e s p o n s e . Nevertheless,theydifferintheirexpressionpattern,signaling pathways, cellular localization, and physiological outcomeson wound healing. It will be important to identify the TLRs impact on healing and innate immune responses [135]. This will improve the therapeutic strategies for the treatment of woundhealing. 6. Healing Disturbances The factors that influence tissue repair can be classified as systemic or local [136]. By approaching factors that affecthealinglocally,itisimportanttonotethatoxygenationmod- ulationisveryimportantforrepairofcellmaintenanceactiv- ities by stimulating cellular metabolism, especially energy production by means of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and is critical for almost all wound healing processes, acting to prevent infections, increasing microenvironment at cicatrizationbeginninghasagreaterneedforoxygenation.At thistime,lowoxygenflow(hypoxia)istemporarilyimportant for healing, but if prolonged, as in some pathologies, it canmakethewoundchronicanddifficulttoheal[138].Hypoxia can induce cytokines expression and production of growth factors released by macrophages, keratinocytes, and fibrob- lasts. Cytokines that are produced in response to hypoxia include PDGF, TGF- ,V E G F ,T N F - , and endothelin-1, whicharepromotersofcellproliferation,migration,chemo-taxis,andangiogenesis[139]. A factor that may negatively affect wound healing is infectionspresence,whichmayresultininflammatoryphase prolongation and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 andTNF- ,inducedbybothbacteriaandendotoxinspresent onsite.Ifinfectiondoesnotresolve,thewoundmaybecomechronic with persistent inflammation. The bacteria presence in the lesion may also be associated with bacterial biofilm formation, which creates a resistance microenvironment to medicationsaction,makinghealingevenmoredifficult[140]. Systemic factors that may interfere with healing may be age-related. It has been observed that elderly healing is associated with modified inflammatory responses, such as cells late infiltration in wound area, chemokine production changes, phagocytes reduction, delayed reepithelialization, andimpairedcollagenization[141]. Sexalsoinfluenceshealingthroughhormonalregulation on a variety of genes associated with regeneration, matrix production,regeneration,epidermalfunction[142],andpro- tease inhibition [143] and genes associated primarily with inflammation [144]. It has been found that topical 17 - estradiol enhances mRNA and procollagen type 1 proteinexpression significantly in Expressions of TGF- 1andTGF- TNF-1neutralizingantibodyinhibits17 -estradiolinduced procollagen synthesis in cultured fibroblasts. Topical estra-diolalsoincreasedthekeratinocytesproliferationandepider- mal thickness in aged human skin, also observing the same effects in young skin [145]. In addition, the elderly estrogen deficiencyisalsoassociatedwithhealingdifficulty[146].

In addition, GCs influence8 InternationalJournalofInflammation immune cells by suppressing and prolifera- tion,regulatinggenetranscription,andreducingtheexpres- sion of cell adhesion molecules [148]. Stress has toreduceTcellproliferationandTcelldependentantibodiesproduction [149], besides increasing the phagocytic abilities ofcells,andthenumberofneutrophilsinthewoundareaof micesubjectedtostressrestriction[150]. Diabetes also interferes negatively in the wound healing thepoorwoundhealingabilityofdiabeticpatients,including hyperglycemic thy,andabnormalneuropeptidesignaling[151-153].

Thisoccursbothexogenously(infood)andendogenously(in humans) with concentrations found in older adults [154, 155]. These end-products reduce the solubility of the extracellular matrix and perpetuate the inflammatory alter-ations observed in diabetes [156, 157]. The AGEs also stim- ulatetheproinflammatorymoleculesrelease,suchasTNF- andMMPs,whichlimitwoundclosure.Inaddition,theAGE-RAGE (AGE receptor) interaction in fibroblasts may cause reduction of collagen deposition, further compromising thenormalhealingprocess[158].

During healing, its expression is increased. However, dia- betic patients show overall decreased levels of Disturbed physiologic functions of epidermal keratino- cytes also have been found to play an important role in the poor healing ability of diabetic wounds [168]. Factors involving keratinocytes that may contribute to the dysfunc-tional wound healing process in diabetes include impaired keratinocytemigrationandproliferation,gapjunctionabnor- malities, chronic inflammation, chronic infections, reduced angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and abnormal expression of MMPs[153,169-171]. Some drugs that interfere with clot formation or platelet function, or inflammatory responses and cell proliferation, havetheabilitytoaffectwoundhealing.Systemicglucocorti- coids,frequentlyused,caninhibittissuerepairbysuppressingimmune cells, complicating cell signaling that compromises the other healing stages, such as fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. Systemic steroids cause scarring, incom- plete granulation tissue, and wound contraction reduction [172]. Nonsteroidalanti-inflammatorydrugs(NSAIDs),suchas ibuprofen, are widely used for inflammation and pain treat- ment and rheumatoid arthritis. Low-dose aspirin, because of its antiplatelet function, is commonly used as a preven- tive therapy for cardiovascular disease, but not as an anti- inflammatory [173]. However, it is important to be cautiouswiththeuseofthesedrugsduringhealing,astheymayaffect theinflammatoryphase,makinghemostasisandclotforma- tiondifficultattheprocessbeginning[24]. Chemotherapeutic drugs also negatively interfere in w o u n dh e a l i n g ,s i n c et h e ya r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t hd e l a y e dc e l l migration, extracellular matrix formation impairment, col- lagen production, fibroblast proliferation, and inhibition ofwound contraction [174]. Other factors such as alcoholism [175], smoke [176], and precarious nutrition [177], as well diseases [179], and metabolic syn-drome[180]arealsoassociatedwithhealingdamage. Disordersofwoundhealinghavebeenfoundtobemore frequentintheinflammationand/orproliferationphasesanddepend on the interactions between different cell types andextracellular matrix, predominantly synthesized by fibrob- lasts[18]. Wounds may have vascular, traumatic, inflammatory, infectious,ormalignantlesions.Acutescarringoccursalong a coordinate biochemical cascade; however, a wound may becomechroniciftheinflammatoryandproliferativephasesoft he cascade suffer some imbalance. Chronic wounds areInternationalJournalofInflammation 9 prevalent and cause substantial morbidity, mortality, and increasedhealthcosts[181].

Pharmacological Interventions The skin wounds treatment is dynamic and depends oft h eh e a l i n gp h a s e se v o l u t i o n .Th e r ea r en u m e r o u sc u r a t i v e optionsonthemarketthatareintherangeofsimplestcover- age,suchashygieneandantisepsissolutions,ointments,gels, growth factors, and even the most complex dressings types called\"smartdressings\"or\"bioactive\"[183]. To direct the choosing process of which therapy to use, Das and Baker (2016) [201] emphasized that an accurate lesionassessmentisessential,carefullyidentifyingthehealing p r o c e s ss t a g e .I na d d i t i o n ,t h eb e n e fi t sa n dc o s t se v a l u a t i o n are some of the aspects to be considered when choosing the treatment type, which should be appropriate to the nature, location, and size of the wound. Although there are a wide variety of dressings, a single type does not meet the require- mentstobeappliedtoallcutaneouswoundstypes. AccordingtoSibbaldetal.(2015)[183],theusedtherapies forhealingcanbeclassifiedasfollows: (A) Resources intended to skin protect against mechani- calorchemicalaggressionandinfectionprevention (B) Hygieneandantisepsisproducts (C) Products for chemical, enzymatic, autolytic, or mechanicaldebridement (D) Primary covers (come in direct contact with wound bed)orsecondary(theyservetofixprimarycovers) (E) Productsforfasteningcoversandaccessories(bands, bandages) (F) Topicalagents. collage- are topical options that act selectivelypromotingasmoothenzymaticdigestionondevi- talized tissues but present low efficacy in chronic injuries treatment [202]. Dressings with hydrocolloids are also used, which aid in autolytic debridement and stimulate angiogen- esis but may adjacent tissue, like cal- ciumalginate,activatedcharcoal,andhydropolymeradhesive dressing,indicatedforexudativewoundsandcontraindicated fordrywounds[4]. Molecules directly involved in the physiological healing process have also been studied as potential therapeutic targets, since ulcers that are difficult to heal are related to lower expression of these factors. Examples of molecules are PDGF (REGRANEX/_0053) and VEGF, in addition to proteases anddegradingagents[32],butthehighcostofthesetherapies makesaccesstothemdifficultforthepopulation.The traditional therapies used in healing have also been strongly practiced, since medicinal plants have historically proven their value as molecules source with therapeuticpotentialandnowadaysstillrepresentanimportanttargetfornewdrugsidentification[203].Themedicinalplantsscientificevidenceonwoundhealingindicatesbeneficialeffectsindif- ferentlesionstreatment[204-207].Thegoodmanufacturing practices development and regulatory legislation also playsa key role in stimulating the traditional therapies used bycliniciansandpromotetheirintegrationintonationalhealthsystem,sincethereiswidespreadacceptancebypopulation. In this sense, it is important to remember that Brazilian Ministry of Health has stimulated the insertion of com-plementary care practices in the health system. The imple-mentation of the National Policy of Medicinal Plants andPhytotherapy (PNPMF, in Portuguese) [208] and NationalPolicyonIntegrativeandComplementaryPractices(PNPIC,in Portuguese) [209], which aim to stimulate access tocomplementarypracticesandmedicinalplantsforhealthcareinaneffectiveandsafeway,isworthnoting. Another important publication is National Relation of MedicinalPlantsofinteresttoUnifiedHealthSystem(SUS,inPortuguese)launchedin2009,containing71medicinalplantsthat should be object of research and implementation of theB r a z i l i a np u b l i ch e a l t hs e c t o r sa n ds e r v i c e s[ 2 1 0 ] .Th eC o l -legiate Board of Directors Resolution (DRC, in Portuguese)number 10, of the year 2010 (a and b), lists 66 medicinal plants with proven actions in human health. Among these, several species are indicated for the cicatrization process,which implies a great advance in the Brazilian public health t h a tb e g i n st ov a l u et h eu s eo fn e wt h e r a p i e sb a s e do n medicinalplants,apracticesowidespreadaroundtheworld andgenerations. Thechemicalcompoundspresentinplantsareinvolvedin a variety of steps in healing, ranging from the inflammatory processcontroltothegranulationtissueformation,increase of the lesion contraction, and collagen deposition [211]. Pereira and B \u00b4artolo (2016) [212] described a review of some traditional therapies most used in healing of cutaneousinjuries,whichcanbeseeninT able1. It is noted that the pharmacological effects on healing observed in the plants described in the table may be relatedtosecondarymetabolitespresencefoundintheseplantmate-rials, since several studies have shown that mainly tannins[213], flavonoids [214], triterpenes [215], and essential oils[216]maybeassociatedwithsuchactivity. In view of the tissue repair response complexity, it is perceived that the treatment with a single factor or cellularcomponent reaches limited effectiveness in the healing of chronic wounds. The challenge lies in the combined ther- apeutic approaches development or preferably in the prod-ucts development having more than one biologically activecompound, such as a product that stimulates both angio-genesis and matrix deposition, and epithelial migration [5].So, researchers' attention to factors that delay or acceleratewound healing is important in order to increase the thera- peuticarsenalandmakewoundhealingmoreeffective.10 InternationalJournalofInflammation gram- marrevision.References [1] P.
