Allergic reactions may be serious and occur during or following administration of monoclonal antibodies (see [5. What should I know while using EVUSHELD?](#s5) and serious side effects table below). Cardiac (heart) and blood clot events: serious cardiac and blood clot adverse events have happened, but were not common in the clinical trial studying preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of COVID-19. In people with risk factors for cardiac events (including a history of heart attack), more people who received EVUSHELD experienced serious cardiac events than people who did not receive EVUSHELD. More people who received EVUSHELD experienced blood clot events than people who did not receive EVUSHELD. One event of blood clot in a major blood vessel was reported 6 days after EVUSHELD was given to an individual. The CT scan of the abdominal and groin region at the time of the event showed pre-existing deposits in the blood vessels. A possible relationship between this event and the treatment with EVUSHELD cannot be ruled out. Overall, it is not known if these cardiac and blood clot events are related to EVUSHELD or underlying medical conditions. Contact your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any symptoms of cardiac events, including pain, pressure, or discomfort in the chest, arms, neck, back,stomach or jaw, as well as shortness of breath, feeling tired or weak (fatigue), feeling sick (nausea), or swelling in your ankles or lower legs.
