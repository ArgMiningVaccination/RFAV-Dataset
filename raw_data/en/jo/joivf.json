This 14-minute guided meditation is for cultivating the attitude required for experiencing peace with the full spectrum of your emotions. If you want to never feel 'negative' emotions and only feel 'positive' emotions, then this is not the meditation you are looking for. It is for people who are at a point in their personal development journey that want to heal their relationship with emotions. This is the key to emotional freedom because emotions become problematic if there is resistance to experiencing certain ones or any attachment to only experiencing the ones that we've been taught are positive. By healing your relationship with your emotions you are learning there is no need to try to fix, change or improve them. This comes from knowing you are not your temporary emotions, that emotions are not caused by the external life events that you believe are making you feel bad, but by feeling your thinking about life. That peace is not the absence of emotions but instead, peace is what the awareness that's aware of all of your emotions feels like, and ultimately, the more emotions the better. "}
