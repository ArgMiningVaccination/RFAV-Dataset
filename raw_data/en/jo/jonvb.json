Contact Dr. Gimpel Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Topics NBOMEosteopathic \"What is Osteopathic Medicine,\" was thoughtfully written and quite timely. Dr. Loveless rightly calls for the need to come together on a unified definition of who we are and how we practice. Indeed, without defining ourselves, we run the risk of being defined by others, and the status of distinction that we enjoy as the osteopathic medical profession will devolve to extinction. Our patients are counting on us. We at the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME), along with the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) have been working on this very issue for more than three years. In 2019, we held the third United States Osteopathic Medical Regulatory Summit with a group of osteopathic medical students, residents, physicians and members of the licensing, accreditation, graduate medical education (GME) and undergraduate medical education (UME) communities. The 2019 Summit was supported by the three organizations with additional financial support provided by the Osteopathic Heritage Foundations and the Osteopathic Founders Foundation. Some of the main topics discussed at the event include growth in the profession, changes in health care delivery, the role of technologies, professional self-regulation and changing demographics within the profession and patient communities, and associated challenges and opportunities for osteopathic medical practice and patients. While we agreed that osteopathic medicine is a distinctive practice that brings unique, added value to patients, the public and the health care community at large, we also agreed that universal definition and common understanding of that distinctiveness was lacking. As a result, we recommended convening a task force of groups represented at the summit to develop a succinct, unified and consistent message defining osteopathic distinctiveness, to align the distinctive elements of osteopathic medical education and professional self-regulation across a continuum, and to advance research on care and educational program outcomes which are critical to the future of the osteopathic medical profession. Immediate follow-up on defining osteopathic distinctive practice ensued through most of 2020, despite the cancellation of our fourth summit in April 2020 due to COVID-19. Considerable input from DOs and learners and other advocates for the profession, including patients and public members, continued, with hundreds of individual contributors. Thank you to all of the student and resident leaders, DO faculty members and deans, residency program directors and educators, representatives from the accreditation and licensure communities, and others for their contributions to this work. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic emergency not only required cancellation of the 2020 Summit but the need for the organizations involved to immediately shift priorities to caring for patients, keeping health care workers safe and supporting learners, as appropriate. A current draft of the definition was shared with the AOA Board of Trustees and leaders from osteopathic affiliate groups at their midyear meeting in February. While this draft has not yet been finalized by the former task force or any of the organizations involved in the summit, the urgency for our profession unifying in how to define itself, in my opinion, requires moving this forward for additional public commentary. A 2022 draft definition of the distinctive practice of osteopathic medicine \"Doctors of osteopathic medicine (DOs) are fully licensed physicians in the United States and other countries. Their patient care approach aligns with their distinctive training in comprehensive, evidence-based medical care, summarized as the interconnected 'body, mind and spirit' approach to finding, restoring and maintaining health. \"The distinctive osteopathic medical philosophy keeps the patient in charge of their own health and the whole person as the focus of every patient-doctor encounter, such that patient and family goals and beliefs remain at the forefront of medical decision-making and empathy and compassion are imbued throughout. DOs learn specialized skills in hands-on physical diagnosis, the musculoskeletal system and osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), which aid in their understanding of the complexities and interconnectedness of the whole patient and guard against reductionist approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Modern treatment approaches common to DOs often emphasize lifestyle and behavioral approaches and avoiding the harms inherent in overtesting and polypharmacy. \"For well over a century, the osteopathic medical model of formation of its physicians has contributed to a physician workforce aligned to the needs of society, helping to address health care disparities. DOs practice in every medical and surgical specialty, though the profession continues to build from strong roots in primary care and emphasize health care delivery models that are primary care-centered. The longstanding emphasis in the osteopathic medical profession on the social determinants of health and significant outreach to rural and underserved regions and populations remain key drivers for the growth of and positive patient care experiences with osteopathic medical care nationally and around the globe.\" Who is the audience? People often ask, who is the audience for this definition? Is it patients? Potential DO students? Legislators? Faculty? The answer is, it is for ourselves. Many organizations across the profession have continued their own initiatives in defining and branding exercises for differing purposes, most now including the consensus language of \"body, mind and spirit\" somewhere in their work. But across the osteopathic medical profession, we must come together to support our communities and our patients in body, mind and spirit in the manner that we are known for. Disclaimer: John R.
