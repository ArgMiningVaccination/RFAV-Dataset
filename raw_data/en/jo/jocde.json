Do I have a dosha imbalance? Or do I feel pretty balanced? Each [dosha](https://ayurvedapractice.com/doshas/) has its qualities so the simplest way to gauge a dosha imbalance is to see which of these qualities is getting increased for you. For example, your skin is feeling too dry and rough. These are qualities of [vata](https://ayurvedapractice.com/watch-the-wind/) and mean vata has risen too [high](https://ayurvedapractice.com/constitution-imbalance/). You are feeling hot all the time which shows [pitta](https://ayurvedapractice.com/summer/) is high as hot is one of pitta's qualities.
