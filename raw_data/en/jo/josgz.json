The primary goal of this training and participant guide is to teach skills to better self-manage chronic physical health conditions, and mental illnesses and addictions \u2014 known as \"behavioral health\" \u2014 to achieve whole health. In the context of this training, whole health is defined as having a healthy mind and body. A foundation of self-management in this training is peer support. In the United States, peer support traces back to as early as 1772 when Native Americans began forming social support groups to help people recover from al-cohol use problems. With insight into the healing power of mutual support that shares lived experiences of hope and strength, they formed the first alcoholism recovery support groups. Group participants organized and solved their own issues, a process known as \"self-management.\" 1 Research in the field of physical health shows the considerable impact of peer support. For example, a Stanford Medical School study on breast cancer found that women who engaged in a weekly peer support group lived on average twice as long as the women who did not. 2 What is the WHAM training and how does it leverage peer support? Let's say a person decides to go to a health center. Upon arrival, there are two entrances. The sign over Entrance A reads \u2014 \"Enter here and we will explore with you all of the unhealthy aspects of your current lifestyle. Then we will help you identify the 3-4 unhealthy habits you have developed that have the most negative impact on your overall health. Once those are identified, we will work with you to create an action plan to change or break these unhealthy habits. You will have the opportunity to meet weekly with trained health professionals who will support you in this.\" The sign over Entrance B reads \u2014 \"Enter here and we will explore with you your strengths, likes, interests, and what you see as possible in regard to creating and self-managing a healthier lifestyle. Then we will help you identify the healthy habits you would like to add in your life. And we will work with you to create an action plan, using your strengths, to develop new healthy habits. You will have the opportunity to meet weekly in a support group with your peers who are also working to improve and self-manage their whole health.\" How would most people enter \u2014 through Entrance A or Entrance B?

D30180TrainingManual.indd 3 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide4There are two major components to the WHAM 2-day, 10-session training. The first component follows this Participant Guide and uses a person-centered planning process in 10 health and resiliency factors to help you create a concise whole health goal to begin the self-management process. The Participant Guide also provides learning skills to enhance self-management, including 8 weeks of WHAM peer support groups and a weekly action plan to create new health habits. The WHAM training also focuses on developing mind-body resiliency to promote self-management skills. The 10 health and resiliency factors included in the training are recommended by the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind-Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, renowned for decades of research on promoting resiliency through stress reduction using the Relaxation Response. This training teaches the Relaxation Response as an essential resiliency self-management skill with research demonstrating that it is as predictable as medication in immediately reversing the stress-induced flight-or-fight response. Mind-body resiliency skills and engagement in the healing relationships of peer support are also essential because of the growing awareness of the impact of trauma, especially childhood trauma, on all dimensions of health. For financial sustainability, this training is also designed to teach participants skills to write a whole health goal in a concise format that could be added to a treatment plan. Let's begin the journey through the WHAM Peer Support Training.Partici Pation in the training means you agree to: m Work on a whole health goal. m Engage in peer support to reach your whole health goal. m Participate in a WHAM peer support group that meets weekly for at least 8 weeks. Note: Much of this Peer Support Training has been adapted from SAMHSA-funded Transformation Transfer Initiative Grants awarded to New Jersey and Georgia in 2009. D30180TrainingManual.indd 4 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide5How to Use the WHAM Participant Guide The WHAM participant guide is intended to help WHAM training participants set a concise whole health goal, learn skills for whole health self-management, and understand the \"5 Keys to Success\" (see page 6) for creating new health habits with a focus on facilitating a weekly WHAM peer support group. The guide is designed to engage participants in a process known as \"person-centered planning.\" Person-centered planning is defined, in this training, as a process to support a peer in planning a whole health goal and reaching that goal with the intent of increasing self-management and independence. The person-centered planning process looks at current patterns, interests, and strengths in each of 10 health and resiliency factors. There are four parts to the WHAM participant guide: 1. Session 1: Welcome and Overview 2. Sessions 2-6: Person-Centered Planning Process in 10 Whole Health and Resiliency Factors 3. Session 7: Health Risk, Screening, and Shared Decision Making 4. Sessions 8-10: 5 Keys to Success The material in sessions 2-6 is designed like a workbook and can be presented in a variety of ways based on work- ing as a group or one-to-one. If in a group setting, participants can take turns volunteering to read the content aloud to progress through the sessions, or the major points can be \"lectured\" by a WHAM Peer Support Group Leader. Regardless of the presentation format, there needs to be discussion about how each whole health and resiliency factor affects your physical and behavioral health. Also, each area of health and resiliency outlined in this guide has a number of structured questions to help explore each area in relation to your lived experience. Those questions can be processed in a variety of ways: m Each group member can write down their answers and then the leader can facilitate sharing those with the group. m The group can work in pairs to share answers. m The peer leader can practice one-to-one with a peer who may have writing challenges, asking the ques- tions and then recording the answers for him or her. Regardless of how the questions are processed, it is important to answer all the questions on pages 46-47.

It is estimated that 60-80% of visits to healthcare providers in the U.S. are related to stress and its manifestations.3 The prevention and treatment of the harmful effects of stress is a vital feature of health integration. The body converts psychological stress into cellular stress that adversely affects the physical makeup of cells. This cellular stress is what uncovers our disease vulnerabilities.4 Rosalynn Carter, in her book, Within Our Reach, says, \"When a person is under severe stress, the brain has to work very hard to maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, among other things... If a person experiences multiple, continuous stressors, he starts losing the battle. If the stress remains overwhelming or persistent, it will take its toll on a person's health \u2014 either physically, mentally, or both.\"5 It is important to note that stressors occur in many ways across the spec- trum of a person's life, but there is growing awareness of the particular impact of trauma, especially childhood trauma, on all dimensions of whole health. Not only does stress lead to physical illness, but prolonged stress often precipitates relapse for persons with men- tal illnesses and addictions. The ability to reduce and/or counter the negative impact of stress is very important for relapse prevention. How has or does stress impact your mental health, addiction, and overall health and wellness? 3. Lee R. The SuperStress Solution, Random House, 2010. 4. Fricchione GL.

D30180TrainingManual.indd 10 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide11The Stress Response Research has shown that prolonged stress has an adverse effect on one's health. In order to understand this, it is necessary to understand three things: 1) Metabolism 2) Stressors 3) The Stress Response Metabolism is the body's chemical process of breaking down organic matter (food) into nutrients and energy that the body can use. Stressors are events or thoughts that communicate danger to a person's security, threaten the sense of wellbe- ing, or communicate loss of control. The Stress Response, also known as the \"Flight-or-fight Response,\" is the body preparing to deal with the im- pending danger or stressor. As a person enters the Stress Response, the body experiences the following to get more energy to the large muscles and vital organs of the body: m Metabolism increases m Breathing speeds up m Heart beats faster m Blood pressure increases m Blood vessels constrict m Stress hormones like cortisol increase If a person's stressor is a saber-tooth tiger and that person flees to safety or fights to victory, the danger no longer exists. A person has burned most, if not all, of the energy that the body has produced and the body goes into a relaxation mode, which means: m Metabolism decreases m Breathing slows down m Heartbeat slows down m Blood pressure decreases m Blood vessels open up m Stress hormones like cortisol decrease D30180TrainingManual.indd 11 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide12But what if the stressor is not a saber-tooth tiger? What if the stressor is workplace demands that don't go away? What happens then? The body continues to produce extra energy because it thinks energy is needed to survive and expects the energy to burn up. What happens to all the energy that is not burned off by fleeing or fighting? Much of the energy is held in the stress hormone called cortisol, which deposits fat deep in the abdomen. This type of fat is known as visceral fat, or the non-pinchable \"belly fat,\" which is not attributable to poor diet or lack of exercise, but rather to the effect of stress hormones on the body. 6 Research shows that visceral fat can be dangerous and is associated with increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some forms of cancer, and also affects the function of the liver and weakens the immune system. is there a Way to counter or stop the stress response When We are not able to flee or fight the danger? There is, and it is called \"The Relaxation Response.\" 6. Glenville M. Mastering Cortisol \u2014 Stop Your Body's Stress Hormone From Making You Fat Around the Middle, Ulysses Press, 2006. D30180TrainingManual.indd 12 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide13The Relaxation Response The Relaxation Response is a state of deep rest that changes the physical and emotional responses to stress and decreases heart rate, blood pressure, rate of breathing, and muscle tension. When the Relaxation Response is elicited: m Metabolism decreases m Breathing slows down m Heartbeat slows down m Blood pressure decreases m Blood vessels open up m Stress hormones decrease If practiced regularly, it can have lasting effects. The founder of the Benson-Henry Institute (BHI) is Dr. Herbert Benson, a Harvard Medical School trained cardi-ologist. His work, started in the late 1960s, pioneered mind-body medicine by linking stress to physical health after observing that his patients had elevated blood pressure during regular check-ups. Dr. Benson's research found that by changing thought patterns subjects experienced decreases in their metabolism, rate of breathing and heart rate, and had slower brain waves. These changes appeared to be the opposite of the commonly known \"fight-or-flight\" or \"stress response.\" 7 Dr. Benson labeled it the \"Relaxation Response,\" which is the foundation of mind-body medicine practiced at BHI. How does one elici T THe Relaxa Tion Response? To elicit the Relaxation Response, there are two essential steps: m Repetition of a word, sound, phrase, or muscular activity. m Passive disregard of everyday thoughts that inevitably come to mind and a return to repetition. 7.

In the WHAM training, these are referred to as \"Healthy Eating,\" \"Physical Activity,\" and \"Restful Sleep.\" Healthy Eating Most people seem to know what foods are healthy \u2014 fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, lean meat, whole grain breads, wild and brown rice, skim or 1% milk, etc. Baked and broiled foods are healthier than fried. People should drink a lot of water and less coffee and soft drinks. Small portions for breakfast, lunch and dinner with a snack in the morning and afternoon are healthier than three larger meals. Stay away from processed foods. While not everyone may follow it, most know what a healthy diet looks like. The federal government has made it easier for Americans to remember \u2014 they have released the \"MyPlate,\" which is split into four sections for fruit, vegetables, grains and protein; a smaller circle sits beside the plate for dairy products. You can access the MyPlate at www.ChooseMyPlate.gov. Physical Activity It seems like a new book is published every day that touts the merits of a particular exercise program. However, there are many simple ways to increase activity level during the day without having to suit up and go to the gym. For example, walking can be a great, low-impact exercise with numerous health benefits. A person could choose to walk a pet, walk around the block, or through the apartment complex when checking the mail. A person can also get involved in active and fun recreational activities like hiking, bike riding, gardening, dancing, etc. Take a walk while on the cordless phone, take the stairs instead of the elevator, get off the bus a stop early and walk the rest of the way, or park farther away in the parking lot. A pedometer can count steps and help increase the number of steps taken each week. Or go to the local community center gym \u2014 it can feel empowering and motivating to join others in a setting that promotes optimum physical health. Restful Sleep Restful sleep is another important health issue. While many articles and new reports point to the increased inci-dence of sleep deprivation, not all people know how to counteract it. It is unhealthy to go without needed sleep. Sleep deprivation significantly affects health. Long term untreated sleep deprivation is associated with many illnesses, including high blood pressure, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, obesity, and mental health problems. What role has healthy eating, physical activity, and restful sleep played in your mental health, addiction, and overall health and wellness?

Dr. Gregory Fricchione, di- rector of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind-Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, speaks of these two being one \u2014 or the flip side of the same coin. He states that humans need connectedness to survive. This connectedness is at the core of why peer support and self-help are so effective, proving essential to recovery from trauma, especially trauma associated with abuse and neglect that can result in fear and isolation. There is a healing power in knowing you are not alone. Many people talk about this as part of their recovery story. Dr. Dean Ornish is a cardiologist who places a lot of importance on the healing power of loving relationships. In his best-selling book, Love and Intimacy, he states, \"anything that promotes feelings of love and intimacy is healing; anything that promotes isolation, separation, loneliness, loss, hostility, anger, cynicism, depression, alienation, and related feelings often leads to suffering, disease, and premature death from all causes. When you feel loved, nurtured, cared for, supported and intimate you are much more likely to be happier and healthier. You have a much lower risk of getting sick and, if you do, a much greater chance of surviving.\" 8 In his book, Dr. Ornish references research that shows people with the strongest social ties had dramatically lower rates of disease and premature death than those who felt isolated and alone, and those who lacked regular par- ticipation in organized social groups had a fourfold increased risk of dying six months after open heart surgery. Living in isolation not only increases wear and tear at the cellular level, but is also a highway to super stress. Everyone needs a supportive person or two with whom to share good times and bad. Being able to vent, cry, or just have someone listen is often enough to help put a very stressful situation into perspective. In fact, most scientific studies cite social support as the number one determinant of how people handle a stressful situation. In any surgical waiting room, there are usually several supportive \"waiters\" for every patient being operated on. Belonging to a community \u2014 whether it's a knitting circle, a sports league, cat fancier's club, or a monthly dinner group with friends \u2014 is an important strategy to handle stress. Support groups and service to others play a major role in initiating and sustaining recovery in the lives of people with mental illness and addiction. How has service to others and having a support network helped you relative to your mental health, addiction, and overall health and wellness? 8. Ornish D. Love and Survival, Harper Perennial, 1999.

The first has to do with attitude toward the future and the second with attitude toward oneself. Essential to the strength-based recovery movement for mental illness and addiction is a sense of personal hope that one's life can be better and growing awareness that peer support can foster hope. Hope supports maintain-ing a positive attitude, and emerging research demonstrates its impact on whole health and resiliency. In a Duke University study of 2,800 heart patients, those with optimistic expectations about their recovery were found 30% less likely to die over the next 15 years than patients with less optimistic expectations, regardless of the severity of their heart disease.9 Charles Swindoll, in his article on attitude, states, \"The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people say or do. It is more important than appearances, giftedness, or skills. It will make or break a company... a church... a home... I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it.\" You've probably heard quotes such as, \"Attitude is everything,\" \"Your attitude determines your altitude,\" or Henry Ford's famous one, \"Whether you think you can or can't, you are probably right.\" These sentiments refer to the human ability to be consciously hopeful or optimistic about the future to avoid or shift away from negative think-ing about oneself and one's situation. Health consultant and writer Martha Beck states, \"Your situation may endanger your life and limbs, but only your thoughts can endanger your happiness.\" 10 Happiness involves having gratitude for the past, enjoying the present, and being optimistic about the future. Telling a miserable story about one's situation creates suffering. Telling oneself a more positive and grateful story increases happiness. How does your attitude about the future and your attitude about yourself affect your life relative to your mental health, addiction, and overall health and wellness? 9. Barefoot J et al.

CArol'S STory Carol awoke and realized she had overslept. \"Oh no! I am going be late for work! I said I wanted to get up every morning and go for a walk. I should have known that I wasn't serious. I always have great plans, but I never fol-low through. When am I going to grow up and start taking some responsibility for my life? I am such a failure!\" As Carol went to the kitchen, she caught a glimpse of herself in the hall mirror. \"I shouldn't wear this skirt. It is too tight. If I bend over, I will burst the seams. I have really put on a lot of weight lately. I am so fat and ugly.\" As Carol was opening the door of the refrigerator, she said to herself, \"What am I doing? I shouldn't eat breakfast. I really need to skip a few meals; then my clothes may fit a little better. I probably need to not eat for a week! No, I've changed my mind. Why don't I eat everything in the fridge? I am a great example of a person who doesn't care how fat and ugly she gets. I am really hopeless.\" Carol left the house almost in tears. She got on the bus for work. When she sat in her seat she looked at her reflec- tion in the window. She realized that she had forgotten to comb her hair. \"My hair looks horrible. I am so ugly. I ought to shave my head and wear a wig. Nobody could ever like a person who looks like me!\" When Carol got to work she remembered that she had not finished a report that was due that day. As she sat at her computer and got to work, her boss walked by. Carol said to herself, \"He is going to think that I just started working on this report, and it is due today. He won't expect it to be very good. I am sure that he will give it to someone more capable to rewrite. I am probably not going to have this job much longer. He will probably fire me soon. What will I do then? I am a fat, ugly failure that no one could ever like. I wish I was dead!\" Reflection on Carol's Story Something usually occurs to prompt our negative self-talk. There are four events that \"jump-started\" Carol's self-talk that turned negative: she overslept; she saw in the mirror that her skirt was tight; she forgot to comb her hair; she had not finished a report that was due that day. Each time her self-talk quickly moved from stating the fact(s) to telling herself a story that was not based on facts. \"I over slept, I am such a failure.\" \"My skirt is too tight. I am so fat and ugly.\" \"I forgot to comb my hair. Nobody could ever like a person who looks like me.\" \"I haven't finished the report. I will be fired soon.\" In each paragraph, when does her self-talk shift from fact to story? D30180TrainingManual.indd 28 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Training Participant Guide29Catch it! Check it! Change it! Everyone has negative thoughts and engages in negative self-talk. That is not the problem. The problem is when it spirals downward and people end up defining themselves in absolute and permanent negative language. These three steps help alter attitudes: 1) Catch it early on. This involves knowing when thoughts are moving from fact to story. 2) Check it over against what is actually going on \u2014 stick with the facts. 3) Change it to more appropriately reflect reality. m Where could Carol have caught her self-talk moving from fact to story? m How could she have checked her self-talk so that it was more based on facts? m What could she have changed in regard to her self-talk so that it more appropriately reflected the reality of her situation? m If she had done this, how might her day have been different?

For many people, spirituality, meaning, and purpose cannot be separated. For them, spirituality is the road to meaning and purpose. Spirituality may include belief in a power that created and controls all of life. It may include a belief in the inter- relatedness of all living creatures. It may be a feeling of unity or connection with nature. For some, spirituality and spiritual beliefs may be very clear and concrete and spiritual practices may center around specific religious rites, rituals, and ceremonies. For others, spirituality and spiritual beliefs may be more vague and mysterious and held in experiences like the following \u2014 \"At that moment I realized that I was not alone. My pain was the same pain that everyone else in the room had experienced. My shame was their shame. Their shame was my shame. My anger was their anger. Their anger was my anger. I was not alone.

People living with mental illnesses and addictions are at greater risk than the general population for dying early or experiencing life-altering conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The Medical Directors Council of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors released a report in October 2006 that states \"People with serious mental illness served by the public mental health system die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population.\" The report, Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness, says that increased morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) are largely due to preventable conditions such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Preventable health risk factors include: obesity, smoking, substance abuse, and inadequate access to medical care. The report also states that some psychiatric medications contribute to the risk. For Participants to Complete 1) Why is it important to self check or seek health screenings to monitor health risk factors? 2) What self-management strategies or health risk screenings are important to prevent untimely death? 3) When was the last time you completed a health risk screening? What tests were done? D30180TrainingManual.indd 36 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide37Health Risk Screening To better understand Health Risk Screenings let's first define a medical term know as Metabolic Syndrome. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel defines Metabolic Syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following health risk indicators: m High blood pressure m Abnormally low \"good\" cholesterol (HDL) m Elevated triglycerides (fatty acid) m High blood sugar m Abdominal visceral fat (waist circumference) Each of the indicators above adds some risk for disease. The more the indicators experienced by an individual, the higher the risk for developing type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The following are the screenings for the risk indicators above: m High blood pressure (hypertension) is the measurement of the increased blood pressure against the walls of the blood vessels as blood flows through the body. Resistance to the blood flow that increases blood pressure could result from rigid vessels, narrowed vessels, vessels blocked with fatty plaque (cho-lesterol), or other serious cardiovascular problems. If blood pressure remains high, it can lead to heart attack, stroke (brain attack), kidney failure, heart failure, or blindness. You can have high blood pres-sure and not know it, which is why it is important to track your blood pressure. A simple blood pressure measuring device is a cuff that inflates with a pressure gauge. Blood pressure is given in two numbers. The top number is your systolic pressure, which is the force of blood on your blood vessels when your heart beats, and the bottom number is your diastolic pressure, which is the force of blood as your heart relaxes between beats. CATEGORIES FOR BLOOD PRESSURE LEVELS IN ADULTS (measured in millimeters of mercury) Category Systolic (top number) Diastolic (bottom number) Normal Less than 120 Less than 80 Pre-hypertension 120-139 80-89 High blood pressure Stage 1 140-159 90-99 Stage 2 160 or higher 100 or higher D30180TrainingManual.indd 37 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide38For Participants to Complete My blood pressure is: Systolic ________________________ Diastolic _________________________ If your blood pressure is high it's a good idea to talk to your doctor. High blood pressure can often be self-managed with healthy eating, physical activity, weight loss, reducing salt, and taking medication. m Cholesterols are fatty chemicals that help with cellular, hormone, and other body processes. When cholesterols are increased beyond normal ranges, they initiate and support diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) or \"good\" cholesterol removes excessive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \"bad\" cholesterol from the blood steam. If the HDL is low, then there is not enough to carry away the excess of fatty deposits in the blood vessels. This can restrict blood flow. Screening for the entire cholesterol profile can be done in the doctor's office, clinic, or lab. A blood drop can be examined quickly by a medical professional on a machine with results available in 5 minutes. One advantage to this sort of screening is that results are available immediately. The usual procedure is to take a blood sample from your arm \u2014 usually after fasting overnight \u2014 after which the sample is sent to a lab for analysis. A follow-up appointment with a medical professional is usually made for inter-pretation of the lab analysis, or the results may be provided by phone or mail. Screening for cholesterol is done as a lipid (fat) profile, which checks total cholesterol, high and low cholesterol, triglycerides, and a HDL risk factor. Desirable ranges are: v Total cholesterol = below 200 mg/dl v Triglycerides = below 150 mg/dl v HDL (good) = above 60 v LDL (bad) = 100 mg/dl or below v HDL risk factor = average risk factor is 3.4 m High Blood Glucose is also another important risk factor people can self monitor to prevent or manage diabetes. Blood glucose is the amount of sugar in the blood at the time of testing. Normal range is 80-100 mg. Screening can be done by a finger-stick blood drop measured by a glucometer. To diagnose or man-A1c Tes T sTAndArds m Normal range for the A1c test is between 4% and 6% m Over 6% means that a person has poor blood sugar regulation m The goal for a person with diabetes is to be below 7% m The higher the A1c level, the greater the risk of developing complications of diabetes 11. American Diabetes Association: \"A1C Test.\" Droumaguet, AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide39age diabetes, a medical professional orders a lab test called a Glucose Tolerance Test, which is usually administered in a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital after 8 hours of fasting. Another blood test used to manage diabetes is called Hemoglobin A1c Test, which determines how well diabetes is being managed over a 3-month period. This test can also be done in a doctor's office or clinic with a blood-stick blood drop, which can be analyzed in 5 minutes by a machine, or by having blood drawn from your arm that is then sent to a lab for analysis. See the A1c Test Standards provided in the shaded box on the previous page. OTHER HEALTH RISK SCREENINGS m HIV T est for human immune deficiency virus is a blood screening for the precursor of AIDS. HIV weakens the body's natural defense system against illness. AIDS is the last stage of HIV infection. Blood can be drawn at the doctor's office or clinic, or at the Public Health Department. The blood is then sent to a lab for analysis, after which a medical professional will discuss with an individual the results and any necessary follow-up. The blood tests will be either positive or negative. HIV positive can be treated and managed successfully without ever manifesting AIDS. This virus can be given to another individual through blood contamination from unprotected sex, sharing needles, and other contact with blood. m Hepatitis C Test is a blood screening for a disease of the liver. The blood is usually drawn from the arm at a doctor's office or clinic, or at the Public Health Department. The blood is sent to a lab for analysis, after which a medical professional will discuss the results and any necessary follow-up. The blood tests will be either positive or negative. Hepatitis can be treated and managed successfully.

ROLE PLAYING SHARED DECISION MAKING \u2014 PREPARING FOR YOUR DOCTOR'S MEETING AND HEALTH TESTS An important emerging concept in whole health self-management is \"shared decision making.\" In the WHAM training, shared decision making is defined as \"the collaboration of a medical professional and recipient of whole health services to determine the treatment and self-management actions for maximizing whole health.\" In this collaboration, both the medical professional and recipient of whole health services should be valued as experts. The doctor may be an expert on medications, tests, and treatment, but equally important is the recipient of whole health services who uses skills like person-centered planning and the eliciting of the Relaxation Response as an expert on self-management. A good way to teach skills for shared decision making is through role playing, which can be introduced during this part of the training. D30180TrainingManual.indd 40 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide41Health Screening Resources Primary Care Visits - Most people receive health screenings from their primary care doctor during annual physi- cals. Of course, many people with ongoing health conditions see their doctor more frequently, and the doctor may not set aside a specific visit for an \"annual physical.\" During these meetings, a person should get his or her height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides tested. Many tests are done via blood work, and some people may need to go to a lab in order to get blood taken. Health Fairs - Many hospitals, health communities, schools, and other public health efforts offer health screen- ings in the community. These events often offer limited screening areas and do not typically offer blood tests. Typ- ical screenings related to Metabolic Syndrome include height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Some other kinds of screenings may also be included. While these events may not offer all areas of Metabolic Syndrome testing, they can be a source of information. Many health fairs also offer a variety of health products that can be motivational, such as pedometers and stress balls. Mental Health and Addiction Services can play a role in getting people access to health screening in a variety of ways. m Psychiatrists and other clinicians are increasingly paying attention to weight gain and other physical health factors in their practices. m Mental health and addiction centers may have nursing staff who can take a blood pressure reading or help with other health screenings. m Peer support/self-help groups and facilities can provide health screening access in various ways, such as bringing a nurse in to do screenings, getting members to a health fair, etc. m Self-testing is done by the individual at home. Many of the health products needed to test one's health are becoming more readily available to consumers. These products can often be found at a local health food store or drug store. Scales, measuring tapes, blood pressure machines, and blood glucose monitors can all be purchased at reasonable prices (health insurance may reimburse or discount these items). Other things to consider in helping peers self-monitor their own health and risk factors or engaging them in health risk screenings: m Actions a person can take if findings are outside normal limits, including basic common lifestyle changes (e.g., increase physical activity, dietary changes, or reduction in simple carbohydrate consumption to lower triglycerides, etc.) D30180TrainingManual.indd 41 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide42m Ways to help people deal emotionally with abnormal findings (need for professional retest, treatability of conditions, etc.) m Importance of confidentiality of personal health information m Proper use of personal health records m Safety aspects of finger sticks (e.g., including use of sterile lancets, avoidance of contact with body fluids, and the importance of minimum necessary lancing depth) m A sense of \"abnormal\" test results versus \"critical abnormalities\" (e.g., systolic BP >200 FBG >400) Other resOurces: m Mayo Clinic \u2014 www.mayoclinic.com \u2014 Online health screening guidelines sheet that is interactive and fun to use. m Medline Plus \u2014 www.nlm.nih.gov \u2014 Health screening tests information page. m National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare \u2014 January 2011 \u2014 Staying Well: It's as simple as your ABCs and D&E D30180TrainingManual.indd 42 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide43SESSION 8 Key to Success 1 l Review and Prioritization l Setting a Person-Centered Goal l Applying the IMPACT Criteria D30180TrainingManual.indd 43 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide44Setting and Clarifying Your Whole Health Goal For Participants to Complete Healt H Strengt HS: (Put a check mark by those that you think are your strengths) General Health My blood pressure is within the normal range.

Applying the iMpACt Criteri A A goal is something we want and that we are willing to work for because we want the benefits. It is the poten- tial benefits that motivate us. Therefore, the more you can get the goal statement to incorporate the potential benefits, the more impact the statement will have on the person's motivation and ability to accomplish the goal. Often the initial goal is stated in a way that the support person will not know it has been accomplished without being told that it has. Example - \"I want to feel better.\" Or it may be stated negatively as something a person wants to stop doing, avoid, or eliminate from their life. Example - \"I want to quit smoking.\" Or it may be stated as something a person wants immediately rather than something that requires numerous actions to accomplish. Example \u2014 \"I want to exercise five days a week.\" If the initial goal statement does not meet the IMPACT criteria, it is helpful to relate it to the benefits by asking the following questions \u2014 Why do you want this? What will the benefits be? How will your life be different if you accomplish this goal? If you accomplish this goal, what will you be able to do that you can't, or aren't, doing now? When these questions are asked, the new goal statement gets related to the benefits and leads to actions that the person can take to accomplish the goal.

This action plan needs to answer the following questions: 1. What will you do? 2. How much will you do? 3. How often will you do it? 4. When will you do it? Weekly Action Planning and Personal Log Learning to create a weekly action plan that helps a person reach his or her whole health goal is crucial to suc-cess. The actions must be healthy and such that a person can engage in them multiple times a week. ACTION PLANS FOR GOALS THAT REQUIRE DEVELOPING A NEW BEHAVIOR, HABIT, OR LIFESTYL E While the actions in the weekly action plan may vary from week to week, the actions need to relate to the set goal and consist of healthy behaviors that create a new discipline in one's lifestyle. Remember, the action plan needs to be something that the person wants to do and can expect to do during the next week. The action plan needs to focus on what a person is creating that is new and is helping him or her move in the desired direction, not changing or eliminating what is \"wrong.\" Don't focus on bad habits. That gives these habits power. Remember, whatever you focus your energies on, you give power to; therefore, focus on what you want to create, not on what you want to change. The action plan needs to focus on creating good habits, not getting rid of bad ones. If a per- son wants to create an action plan for eliminating certain things in his or her life, that is OK, but it is best to stay focused on the positive, what the person wants, and the person's strengths. Also, it is helpful if the plan contains actions that the person is able to take multiple times during the week, in order to establish a new discipline in his or her life.

The Confidence Scale is used to increase the likelihood of success. Continued success \u2014 even in small doses \u2014 increases one's self-confidence and the desire to set and accomplish more goals. It works like this: you decide how confident you are about the weekly action plan, using a scale of 0-10 (0 = no confidence and 10 = total confidence). The Confidence Scale score should be 7 or higher. You can increase the number by lessening the actions (the \"how many\" and the \"how much\"), by identifying and removing barriers, and/or by increasing the support. For example, you may initially plan to walk 1 mile a day on 5 days during the next week, but you've selected a score of only 5 on the Confidence Scale. To increase the Confidence Scale score to 7 or above, you could choose to reduce the planned walking distance and/or the number of days you will walk. Or you can choose to ask for certain supports such as asking someone to phone you with a reminder, or to walk with you. A daily/weekly personal log is simply a way of keeping a record of what you actually do each week in relation to your weekly action plan. It is important early on that the peer leader, the peer, and the peer support group work out a simple and doable way of keeping a daily/weekly log to be reported each week at the support group. For your convenience there is a space provided in the Weekly Action Plan Pocket Guide to log your daily/weekly progress.Sample action plan m Week ........................................................................................................................................... m Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide55SESSION 10 Keys to Success 4 & 5 l One-to-One Peer Support l Peer Support Group D30180TrainingManual.indd 55 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide56One-to-One Peer Support and the Weekly Peer Support Group Supporting peers outside of the support group is very important. Ideally, this is contact that occurs between the weekly support group meetings. There are two ways this can be done. The first involves the peer leader who is leading the support group to contact each participant between meetings. The second occurs during the support group meeting when each peer selects a peer to be the support person for the next week and make contact be-tween meetings. The first procedure is recommended for the first few weeks of the group meetings. However the peer support is structured, the peer supporter makes arrangements to contact his or her peer 2-4 days after the support group meets. This can be in person or by phone. The peer supporter asks how the other person is doing in relation to the action plan and log. If the other person is doing OK, the peer supporter expresses appreciation and encouragement to attend the next support group meeting. If the other person is not doing well, the peer supporter asks how to help. The weekly peer support group is foundational to the success of the WHAM process. Here are suggested guidelines for conducting a group: 1) All group participants should be working on a health goal and have agreed to use the 5 Keys to Success. 2) The group can be facilitated by any one of its members. If it is facilitated by a peer leader, the peer leader must meet the criteria of guideline #1 above. 3) During the first group meeting a \"comfort contract\" that group members agree on should be created to serve as the group's rules of conduct. (Please note: a sample comfort contract is provided as a training handout.) 4) The meeting follows this format: a. The leader welcomes everyone, opens with a short Relaxation Response exercise, and leads the discus- sion for that week. b. The leader shares his or her weekly action plan and the associated activities from the past week using the personal log as a reference. If the action plan was accomplished, the group celebrates the accomplishment(s) and moves to the next person. If the action plan was not accomplished, a group member asks what the barriers were and what could be done next week to help succeed, and if the person wants suggestions from group members who have struggled with the same situation. D30180TrainingManual.indd 56 10/16/12 5:23 AMWhole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant Guide57 After brainstorming suggestions, recommend that the person choose what may be helpful to be used next week. c. Move to the next person and repeat the above process. d. After everyone has had a chance to share, the focus shifts to the next week. Starting again with the leader, each person shares his or her action plan for the next week. Using the Confidence Scale each person states his or her confidence in relation to accomplishing the actions. If a person's Confidence Scale ranking is seven or above, move to the next person. If it is less than seven, the group works with the person to get the Confidence Scale ranking to a score of seven or higher. Decide who will be the support peer for that person for the next week. e. After everyone has had a chance to participate, check to see if someone would like to share anything else in closing. Remember that this is a whole health support group and that should be the focus. Other issues and concerns can be dealt with after the group meeting is over .

Difficulty digesting food, or reduced sexual response, may be examples of negative impact stress response. Negative Thinking /Pessimistic: Thinking based on the expectation that desired outcomes are not going to happen or are more likely not to happen. Negative self-talk is reminding oneself of these negative thoughts/expectations. Noradrenalin (or norepinephrine): A hormone (a chemical in the body) primarily secreted by the adrenal gland. Noradrenalin also serves as a neurotransmitter (a chemical in the brain used to \"talk\" between cells). It is part of the \"fight or flight\" response. Nonessential organs: Systems of cells in the body that may or may not carry out a function, but that the body can function without if needed. An example is the spleen.

Nutrients: Substances taken in by the body that are needed for cells to function well and repair themselves. Normal cell regeneration: The cell is the smallest basic building block of every living organism. Human cells are organized into organs (collections of cells to carry out a specific purpose), and many organs have multiple specialized types of cells. As cells die, there is a physiologic process for new ones to be created or \"regenerated.\" Optimism based on positive expectations: Thinking based on expectations for good outcomes \u2014 the expectation that good things are going to happen or are more likely to happen. Peer support: All of the ways in which a person gets help from someone who is like them, whether friend, trained peer worker, fellow support group member, or other \u2014 as opposed to professional support, where the person helping them is doing so on the basis of a formal credentialing and/or training. Peer support operates from knowing that the individual has shared a similar experience and can be a model for others willing to learn and grow. Peers come together with the intention of changing unhelpful patterns, getting out of difficult places, and building relationships that are respectful. Person-centered planning: Delivery of medical, mental health, sub- stance abuse, or rehabilitation services on an individualized (versus standardized) basis, with the person's expressed wants, strengths, and needs serving as the basis for how services are delivered. Perspective: Your way of uniquely viewing people, places, and situations. Physical activity: Anything a person does to keep moving and exert themselves. Bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. It includes both intentional exercise (when you exercise for your health), and normal activity as you work, take care of your home and family, etc. Physical inactivity: Low levels of moving around. Low levels of energy expenditure. Fourth leading risk factor for early death according to the World Health Organization. Pre-hypertension: Blood pressure in either the systolic or diastolic measurement that is higher than recommended ranges, but not so high that it creates significant risk. Premature death: A life that ends younger than otherwise might be expected. Psychosocial treatment: Services or treatments other than medication that can help a person pursue recovery. These could include psychotherapy, employment and other rehabilitation services, peer support services, or specialized services that may be aimed at helping a person live successfully in the community, pursue education, employment or other valued goals, or fulfill valued life roles. Psychological: Of or related to the mind including thoughts, thought processes, and emotions.

Typical sources are conflict, frustration, pressure, loss, and threat. Relapse: Any re-occurrence or rise in symptoms. A person can have a relapse of poison ivy due to insufficient cleaning of linens that came in contact with their previous skin outbreak or a relapse of migraine headaches due to a lot of stress. Relapse of symptoms can occur for people living with mental illnesses and addictions. Restful sleep: Sleep that gives our bodies and brains the chance to relax and rebuild. Self-testing: Health measurement (e.g., weighing yourself every week), and tests that can be done at home using specialized equipment or chemical setups that otherwise would be done in a healthcare setting/clinical laboratory. Examples include blood glucose monitoring, lipid profiles, home blood pressure monitoring, and many others. Strength-based: Moving away from seeing a person as a set of problems, deficits, or challenges that need to be 'fixed,' to recognizing talents, skills and supports which he or she uses \u2014 with or without professional assistance \u2014 to lead a full and satisfying life. Stroke: Occurs when a clot blocks the blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in or around the brain bursts. Causes parts of the brain to become damaged or die.

Support network: People a person can rely on for support, companionship, and to help deal with life challenges. Can include \"natural supports\" such as friends, family, peers, co-workers, and church members, and \"paid supports\" such as peer specialists, job coaches, personal trainers, therapists, doctors, etc. Systolic: The blood pressure measured at the point of highest compression. Type II diabetes mellitus: A disease where the body is not able to create or use enough of the hormone insulin to keep blood glucose at safe levels. Vent: The opportunity to share feelings and emotions. Visceral fat: Fat in the body inside the abdominal cavity packed around the stomach intestines, kidneys, and liver. Vital organs: Collections of cells in the body that carry out a function that is essential and cannot be taken over by another organ.
