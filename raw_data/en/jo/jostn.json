InJanuar y 2020, the pathogen causing this outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus 2019. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. On 12 February 2020, the virus was officiall y named as severe acute re spiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2), and the WHO officiall y named the disease caused b y SARS -CoV -2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). On 11 March 2020, the WHO upgraded the status of the COVID- 19 outbreak from epidemic to pandemic, which co ntinues to spread globall y at high speed. Based on Phase 2/3 safety, immunogenicit y, and efficacy data, BNT162b2 was shown to be effective and has been authorized for temporary or emergency usein multiple countries . The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID-19 v accine (also referred to as BNT162b2) is administered intramuscularl y as a 2 -dose series spaced 21 day s apart at a dose of 30 g each. Study C4591001 (NCT04368728) is an ongoing Phase 1/2/3 trial in ~44,000 participants designed to generate safet y, tolerability ,immunogenicit y, and efficacy data from a novel RNA -based vaccine candidate. The trial is being conducted in a heterogeneous study population: eligible participants 12years of age, healthy participants, including those participants with stable chronic m edical conditions, including HIV -, HCV -, and HBV -positive participants. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify the preferred vaccine candidate (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2) and dose level (10 \u00b5g, or \u00b5g [for BNT162b1]); Phase 2/3: a n expanded -cohort and efficacy part for the selected vaccine candidate (BNT162b2). BNT162b2 was selected from the Phase 1 part of this study based on the overall safety , tolerability, and immunogenicity .Vaccine efficacy from Phase 2/3 for the primary endpoint against confirmed COVID -19 occurring at least 7 day s after the second dose was 95% with 8COVID -19 cases in the active vaccine group compared to 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. Data from approximately 38,000 participants randomized 1:1 wit h a median of 2months of follow -up after the second dose of vaccine showed a favorable safet y profile at a dose of 30 g in participants 16 y ears of age and older. To optimize storage and distribution of this vaccine on a wide scale ,a lyophilized or alte rnate formulation that will be stable at standard refrigerator or freezer temperatures isrequired. Therefore, this study will compare the safety andtolerability of lyophilized BNT162b2 presented in SDV sto those of frozen -liquid BNT162b2 in MDV sand de termine whether the immune response is nonin ferior .Separatel y, the study will also describe the safet y and immunogenicit y of frozen -liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification and RTU BNT162b2 (the immediate manufacturing precursor to the ly ophilate) . PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 10The primary immunogenicity analy sis demonstrated that the immune response elicited by the lyophilized formulation did not meet the noninferiority criteria compared to the frozen -liquid formulation of BNT162b2 . As a result, for the benefit of participants, all study participants who received 2 doses of the ly ophilized formulation will be offered an additional vaccine dose, using the 30-\u00b5g dose of frozen-liquid formulation ary demonstrate immune response induced by lyophilized BNT162b2 in SDVs isnoninferior to the immune response induced by frozen -liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs in participants without evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection during the studyIn participants complying with the key protocol criteria (evaluable participants): GMR of lyophilized formulation in SDVs to frozen -liquid formulation in MDVs 1 month after Dose 2Full-length S -binding IgG levels Prim ary Safety To evaluate the safety of BNT162b2 when administered on a 2 -dose schedule in healthy adults 18 through 55 years of ageIn participants receiving at least 1dose of study intervention from each vaccine group, the percentage of participants reporting: Local reactions for up to 7 days following each dose Systemic events for up to 7 days following each dose AEs and SAEs from Dose 1 through 1month after Dose 2Local reactions (pain at the injection site, redness, and swelling) Systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or w orsened joint pain) AEs SAEs Secondary Immunogenicity To describe the immune responses induced by lyophilized BNT162b2 in SDVs and frozen -liquid participants from each vaccine group: GMCs at baseline (before Dose 1) and 1 month after Dose 2 GMFR from baseline (before Dose 1) to 1 month after Dose 2Full-length S -binding IgG levels Exploratory To describe the immune responses induced by frozen - liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification and RTU BNT162b2 in participants without evidence of SARS -CoV- 2 the -liquid BNT162b2 with LNP end of specification to frozen -liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs 1 month after Dose 2Full-length SARS RNA -Based COVID Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 11Obje ctives Estimands Endpoints To describe the immune responses induced by frozen - liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification and RTU BNT162b2In evaluable participants from each vaccine group: GMCs and/or GMTs at baseline (before Dose 1) and 1 month after Dose 2 GMFR from baseline (before Dose 1) to1 month after Dose 2Full-length S -binding IgG levels and/or SARS -CoV- 2 neutralizing titers To describe the safety profile of frozen -liquid BNT162b2 formulation when given as a third dose to participants who originally received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation of BNT162 b2In participants who originally received 2-dose series of the ly ophilized formulation of BNT162b2 : Local reactions for up to 7 days following third dose Systemic events for up to 7 days following third dose AEs from Dose 3to 1 m onth after Dose3 SAEs from Dose 3to 1month after Dose3Local reactions (pain at the injection site, redness, and swelling) Systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or w orsened joint pain) AEs SAEs To describe the immune response elicited by frozen -liquid BNT162b2 formulation when given as a third dose following a primary series of lyophilized BNT162b2In evaluable participants who originally received a 2-dose series of the lyophilized formulation o f BNT162b2 GMFR from prior to Dose 3 to 1month after Dose 3 GMCs and/or GM Ts at baseline, at 1 month after Dose 2,prior to Dose 3 ,and 1 month after Dose 3Full-length S -binding IgG levels and/or SARS RNA -Based COVID Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 12Overall Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, observer- blind study to evaluate the safet y, tolerability , and immunogenicit y of multiple formulation sof BNT162b2, an RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine, administered on a 2 -dose schedule in healthy adults 18 through 55 y ears of age . In Part 1, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2groups (l yophilized SDV Separatel in Part 2,participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 groups ( frozen -liquid BNT162b2 with L NP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2 ). The duration of the stud y for each participant will be approximately 2 months. The study will be conducted in the US with potential to expand to other countries. Updates as part of protocol amendment 2: All participants who originally received 2 doses of the ly ophilized formulation of BNT162b2 will be offered the opportunity to receive a third dose with the current frozen -liquid formulation of BNT162b2. Those participants who acc ept the offer of receiving a third dose will have 2additional visit s. The study duration will be extended for 1 additional month for those participants who accept the offer of receiving a third dose. Number of Participants Approximately 550participants will be randoml y assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ly ophilized SDV or frozen -liquid ;separatel y, approximately 60participant swill be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either frozen -liquid BNT162b2 with L NP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2 , for a total of approximately 610 randomized participants .It is expected that approximately 488 evaluable participants will complete the study , based on a 20% nonevaluable rate. Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight Committee : Yes This study will use a DMC. The DMC is independent of the study team and includes external members. The DMC charter describes the role of the DMC in more detail. The DMC will be responsible for ongoi ng monitoring of the safety of participants in the study according to the charter.

BNT162 b2 received first regulatory conditional marketing authori zation approval in Switzerland on 19 December 2020 and is currently conditionall y approved in 40 countries. 2.1.Study Rationale The purpose of this stud y is to demonstrate that the immune response induc ed by the refrigerator -stable ly ophilized formulation of BNT162b2 is noninferior to the frozen -liquid formulation of BNT162b2 in MDVs, and to describe the safety and tolerability of these different vaccine formulations in healthy adults, there bysupporting refrigerated storage and distribution at commercial scale. The study will also descri be the safet y and immunogenicit y of frozen- liquid BNT162b2 with L NP size at the upper end of specification and RTU BNT162b2 . Current clinical and EUA specifications for LNP size for the frozen -liquid formulation are40 to 180 nm and 40 to 120 nm, respectivel y.Clinical experience ,however, is limited to LNP size in the range 59 to 74 nm , based on lots used in the clinic al studies already conducted. Hence ,an exploratory study arm is being included to better understand the impact of LNP size, using a lot with LNP size close to the upper specification boundary (without any significant impact onother quality attributes ). The immediate manufacturing precursor of the ly ophilized formulation is the RTU . An exploratory study arm is included to describe the safet y and immunogenicity of the RTU (ie ,precursor prior to the ly ophilization step ). The primary immuno genicity analy sis demonstrated that the immune response elicited by the lyophilized formulation did not meet the noninferiority criteria compared to the frozen -liquid formulation of BNT1 62b2 . As a result, for the benefit of the participants , all study participants who received 2 doses of the l yophilized formulation will be offered an additional vaccine dose, using the 30-\u00b5g dose of the frozen- liquid formulation of BNT162b2. 2.2.Background In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China. InJanuary 2020, it became clear that a novel coronaviru s (2019- nCoV) was the underl ying cause. Later in January , the genetic sequence of the 2019 -nCoV became available to the WHO and the public (MN908947.3), and the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus subfamily . By sequence anal ysis, the phy logeneti c tree revealed a closer relationship to SARS virus isolates than to another coronavirus infecting humans, the MERS virus.1,2 The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30January 2020.3 On 12 February 2020, the virus was officiall y named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2), and the WHO officially named the disease caused b y SARS -CoV -2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19).3 SARS -CoV - 2 PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 19infections and the resulting disease, COVID -19, have spread globall y and on 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized the COVID -19 outbreak as a pandemic.4 On 08 January 2021, The Center for S ystems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reported more than 88million cases globall y, with over 1. 9million deaths from 1 91 countries. The United States has reported more than 21.6 million cases and over 366,000 deaths.5 Since fall of 2020, the incidence of COVID -19 illnesses is increasing dramatically in many northern hemisphere countries, including the United States, France, Germany , Italy, and the United Kingdom, raising the specter that as temperatures have fallen a nd the \"respiratory virus season\" has started, cases may dramaticall y increase, potentiall y overwhelming healthcare infrastructures. This possibility highlights the importance of developing a COVID -19 vaccine as quickly as possible while ensuring that all safet y measures are met. A proph ylactic, RNA -based SARS -CoV -2 vaccine provides one of the most flexible and fastest approaches available to immunize against the emerging virus.6,7In an attempt to prevent the spread of disease and to control the pandemic , numerous COVID -19 vaccine candidates are in development. The development of an RNA -based vaccine encoding a viral antigen, which is then expressed by the vaccine recipient as a protein capable of eliciting protective immune responses, provides significan t advantages over more traditional vaccine approaches. Unlike live attenuated vaccines, RNA vaccines do not carry the risks associated with infection and may be given to people who cannot be administered live virus (eg, pregnant women and immunocompromise d persons). RNA -based vaccines are manufactured via a cell- free invitro transcription process, which allows an easy and rapid production and the prospect of producing high numbers of vaccination doses within a shorter time period than achieved with traditional vaccine approaches. This capability is pivotal to enable the most effective response in outbreak scenarios.6,7 BNT162b2 is a SARS -CoV -2-RNA - LNP vaccine based on a platform of modRNA with blunted innate immune sensor -activating capacit y and augmented expression encoding P2 S. 2.2.1. Clinical Overview Study C4591001 (NCT04368728) is an ongoing Phase 1 /2/3 trial in ~44,000 particip ants designed to generate safety , tolerabilit y, immunogenicity, and efficacy data from a novel RNA -based vaccine candidate.8 The trial is being conducted in a heterogeneous study population: eligible participants 12years of age, healthy participants, including those participants with stable chronic medical conditions, including HIV -, HCV -, and HBV -positive participants. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify the preferred vaccine candidate (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2) and dose level (10 \u00b5g, 20 100 \u00b5g [for BNT162b1]); Phase 2/3: an expanded- cohort and efficacy part for the selected vaccine candidate (BNT162b2). BNT162b2 was selected from the Phase 1 part of this study based on the overall safet y, tolerability , and immunogenicity .In of 36,621 participants randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo who were included in the per-protocol efficacy analy sis population of participants without evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection prior to 7 day s after completion of the vaccination schedule , efficacy in preventing PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 20confirmed COVID -19 occurring at least 7 day s after the second dose of vaccine was 95.0%, with 8 COVI D-19 cases in the active vaccine group and 162 COVID -19 cases in the placebo group. Subgroup anal yses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across age groups, sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of s evere COVID -19. Secondary efficacy anal yses suggested benefit of the vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19, in preventing COVID-19 following the first dose, and in preventing COVID -19 in individuals with prior SARS -CoV -2 infection, although available data for these outcomes did not allow for firm conclusions.9 Safety data from approximately 38,000 participants at least 16 y ears of age randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo with a median of 2 months of follow-up after the second dose suggest a favorable safety profile. Available safet y data from all participants enrolled through the 14 November 2020 data cutoff (N=43,252, which includes late enrollment of additional adolescent and adult participants) w ereconsistent with the safet y profile for the approx imately 38,000 participants with a median follow -up of 2 months and also did not raise specific safet y concerns.9 The most common solicited adverse reactions were i njection site reactions (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), and fever (14.2%); severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0% to 4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Do se 1, and were generall y less frequent in participants 55years of age ( 2.8%) as compared to y ounger participants (4.6%). The frequency of SAE s was low (<0.5%), without meaningful imbalances between stud y arms. Among nonserious unsolicited AEs, there was a numerical imbalance of 4 cases of Bell's pals y in the active vaccine group com pared with no cases in the placebo group, though the 4cases in the active vaccine group do not represent a frequency above that expected in the general population. Otherw ise, there were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between vaccine groups for specific categories of nonserious AEs (including other neurologic, neuroinflammatory , and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to BNT162b2. With the exception of more frequent, generall y mild to moderate reactogenicit y in participants <55 years of age, the safet y profile of BNT162b2 was generally similar across age groups, sexe s, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without medical comorbidities, and participants with or without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection at enrollment .9 In the C4591001 stud y, the Phase 1 population included health y participants 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years of age. Enrollment in Phase 1 is complete and, although follow -up continues, the available safet y data from Phase 1 participants show that BNT162b2 reactogenicity , AEs, and laboratory results were consistent with those commonly associated with vaccination. The observed reactogenicity was generall y mild or moderate (primarily pain at the injection site) and short-lived. The local reactions tended to be more frequent after the second dose. There was no redness or swelling reported b y participants in the 65-through 85 -year age group who received BNT162b2.10 Regarding s ystemic events, 17% of the 18 -through 55 -year age group and 8% of those in the 65-through 85 -year age group reported fever ( 38.0\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C) after the second dose of PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 2130\u00b5g of BNT162b2. Severe s ystemic events (fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, and joint pain) were reported in small numbers of y ounger recipients of this vaccine candidate, but no severe s ystemic events were reported in older recipients, and there were no Grade 4 systemic events reported.10 No unexpected AEs or SAEs were reported. Through 1 month after receipt of the second vaccination, AEs that were considered b y investigators to be related to the study intervention were reported in 25% of participants 18 through 55 y ears of age who received 30 \u00b5g of BNT162b2; no AEs were reported b y the old er population who received the same dose.10 The available immunogenicity data from Phase 1 participants show that BNT162b2 induced a robust IgG -binding response to S1 and a SARS- CoV -2-neutralizing response. Immunogenicit y substantially increased following the second dose of vaccine. BNT162b2 induces a strong antigen -specific Th 1 -skewed CD4+ response and a strong antigen-specific CD8+ response. Based on the safety ,tolerability , and immunogenicity data generated from Phase 1, the vaccine candidate selected for the Phase 2/3 part of the study was BNT162b2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g. This phase of the study is currentl y ongoing and is evaluating the efficacy of the study intervention . The Phase 2/3 portion of C4591001 was initiated in 18- through 85 -year-old adults but was amended in September 2020 to include participants 16 y ears of age. It is intended that a minimum of 40% of participants will be in the >55 -year stratum. A further protocol amendment in October 2020 added a stratum of 2000 participants (1000 active vaccine) 12through 15 years of age. The first 360 participants in the Phase 2/3 part of the study will be considered the Phase 2 segment but will also contrib ute to the efficacy endpoint. There are 2 primary efficacy endpoints in the Phase 2/3 part of the study. The first is to evaluate the efficacy of prophy lactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID- 19 in participants without evidence of infection before vaccina tion and the second is to evaluate the efficacy of prophy lactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID -19 in participants regardless of evidence of infection before vaccination. Cases of COVID -19 are defined b y the presence of specified symptoms plus anNAAT for SARS -CoV -2 at least 7 day s following the second dose of vaccine. Effectiveness in 12 -to 15 -year-old participants will be inferred b y immune noninferiority to that in 16-to 25 -year-old participants based on SARS -CoV -2-neutralizing GMT s. The primary safety objective include sdefinition of the safet y profile of prophylactic BNT162b2 in the first 360 participants in the Phase 2 population, in all participants randomized in Phase 2/3, and in 12- to 15 -year-old participants. Reactogenicity will be assessed b y e-diary in all participants in Phase 1, in at least 6000 participants in Phase 2/3, and in all participants 12 through 15 years of age. The scale of the BNT162b2 manufacturing has been increased to support future supply . Therefore, in the C4591001 Phase 2/3 phase of the study , BNT162b2 generated using the PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 22manufacturing process supporting an increased supply (\"Process 2\") was administered to approximately 250 participants 16 through 55 years of age, per lot. The currently available safet y and immunogenicity data are presented in the BNT162 IB.11 2.3.Benefit/Risk Assessment There is an ongoing global pandemic of COVID -19 and, based on the data available from the C4591001 study ,multiple temporary or em ergency use authorizations and conditional marketing authorizations have been granted for BNT162b2. The available safet y and immunogenicit ydata from the ongoing Pfizer/BioNTech clinical trial combined with available nonclinical data with BNT162 vac cines, and data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials with the same or related RNA components, or antigens, support a favorable benefit/risk profile and support continued clinical development of BNT162b2. In the C4591001 stud y, BNT 162b2 has been sho wn to elicit increased local and sy stemic adverse reactions as compared to those in the placebo arm, usuall y lasting a few days. The most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site reactions (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle p ain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), and fever (14.2%).9Adverse reactions characterized as reactogenicity were generall y mild to moderate. The number of participant s reporting hy persensitivity -related AEs was numericall y higher in the active vacc ine group compared with the placebo group (137 [0.63%] vs 111 [0.51%]). Severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0 % to 4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, and were generall y less frequent in older adults (>55 years of age) (<2.8%) as compared to younger participants (4.6%). Among reported unsolicited AE s, lymphadenopathy occurred much more frequentl y in the active vaccine group than the placebo group and is plausibly related to vaccination. SAEs, while uncommon (<1.0%) , represented medical events that occur in the general population at similar frequency as observed in the study .9 No specific safet y concerns were identified in subgroup anal yses by age, race, ethnicit y, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Although participants 16 through 17years of age were enrolled in the P hase 3 trial, safet y data for this age group arelimited. However, available data are consistent with the safety profile in the adult population, and it is biologicall y reasonable to extrapolate the greater safet y experience in adults, in particular younger adults, to the oldest pediatric age group of 16 through 17 years. The potentia l risks are based on the observed safet y profile to date, which shows mostly mild reactogenicity , low incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically concerning safet y observations. The preponderance of severe cases of COVID -19 in the placebo gro up relative to the BNT162b2 group (9 of 10) suggests no evidence of VAED.9Continued clinical investigation is justified given: the urgent need to optimize storage and distribution of aCOVID -19 vaccine on a wide scale using a lyophilized formulation that will be stable at standard refrigerator temperatures , PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 23the threat posed b y the increasing number of globally distributed outbreaks of SARS -CoV -2 infection, the potential of the BioNTech platform of RNA -based vaccines to rapidl y deliver high numbers of vaccine doses in a single production campaign. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y expected AEs of BNT162b2 may be found in the IB, which is the SRSD for this study .

Risk Assessment Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Study Intervention: BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID- 19 Vaccine Local and systemic reactions to the vaccine may occur (injection site redness, injection site swelling, and injection site pain, fever, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, and joint pain) following vaccination.These are common adverse reactions seen with other vaccines as well as the COVID -19 vaccine. The most common events reported in Study C4591001 w ere mild to moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue ,and headache.The study employs the use of a reactogenicity e-diary to monitor local reactions and systemic even ts in real time. All study participants will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Safety profile of a novel vaccine not yet fully characterized. Adverse reactions (risks) identified from the postauthorization safety data include: Anaphylaxis, angioedema), extremity (injected arm) .Data available from Study C4591001 show ed low incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically concerning safety observatio ns across the safety population and within demographic subgroups based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, country, and baseline SARS -CoV -2 status. Postauthorization safety data surveillance has confirmed the safety profile observed in C4591001 and has resulted i n identification of some additional adverse reactions (risks) as noted in this table.Collection of AE and SAE reports from signing of the ICD t hrough 1month after the second dose of vaccine. DMC throughout the study to review all safety data. All participants will be observed for at least 30minutes after vaccination. Potential for COVID -19 enhancement. Disease enhancement has been seen following vaccination with RSV, feline coronavirus, and Dengue virus vaccines. No evidence of disease enhanceme nt has been seen in large- scale clinical study of BNT162b2 in humans or in postauthorization surveillance.Eligibility criteria will exclude any participants who have had a previous clinical (signs/symptoms only) or microbiological (signs/symptoms and posi tive SARS -CoV- 2 NAAT result) diagnosis of COVID -19.This will minimize the low risk of potential disease enhancement and ensure that the immune response evaluated in the study is not impacted by serological changes due to previous COVID -19 disease.

The study will include m onitoring for cases of COVID -19 developing during the study, which will be reported as AES Is. Venipuncture will be performed during the study. There is the risk of bleeding, bruising, hematoma formation, and infection at the venipuncture site.Only appropriately qualified personnel will obtain the blood draw . Very rare cases of anaphylaxis, myocarditis, and pericarditis have been reported after EUA in recipients of BNT162b2Anaphylaxis: The estimated rate is 5.0 per million doses administered. Myocarditis and pericarditis: Very rare cases of myocarditis and per icarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. Typically, the secases have occurred more often in younger men and after the second dose of the vaccine and within 14 days after vaccination. These are generally mild cases and individuals tend to recover w ithin a short time following standard treatment and rest. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis in vaccine recipients.Specific reference to these risks is made within the ICD, with instruction to contact a healthcare professional if a case is suspected. For anaphylaxis, there is an on -site observation period of 30 -minute after vaccination. Instructions for handling suspected cases o f myocarditis and pericarditis are found in Section 8.13.

In Part 1,participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 groups (lyophilized SDV or frozen- liquid MDV control for l yophilized SDV). Separately, in Part 2,participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 groups (frozen -liquid BNT162b2 with L NP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2). The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 2 months. Approximately 550 participants will be randoml y assigned to either ly ophilized SDV or frozen- liquid MDV control for lyophilized SDV; separately , approximately 60 participant s will be randomly assigned to receive either frozen -liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2 , for a total of approximately 610 randomized participants. It is expected that approximately 488 evaluable participants will complete the study , based on a 20% nonevaluable rate. Updates as part of protocol amendment 2: All participants who originally received 2 doses of the ly ophilized formulation of BNT162b2 will be offered the opportunity to recei ve a third dose with the current frozen -liquid formulation of BNT162b2. Those participants who accept the offer of receiving third dose will have 2additional visits as described in Section 1.3.1 .The study duration will be extended for 1 additional month for those participants who accept the offer of receiving a third dose. 4.2.Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study contains assessments that could be considered standard for a vaccine noninfe riority study . Blood samples taken for immunogenicit y will establish the level of immune response elicited by each formulation to provide the necessary data to meet the primary endpoint of the study . Immunogenicit y will be assessed b y the full -length S -binding IgG assay . To establish if a participant has as ymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection, nasal swabs for SARS -CoV -2 nucleic acid amplification testing (ie, NAAT) and blood samples to measure N-binding antibody levels will be taken. A positive result on either test will result in the immunogenicity data from that participant being excluded from the evaluable portion of the study population. All reactogenicity and safety assessments are standard for a study of this nature. This study will not include a placebo, as the aim and design of this study are not to demonstrate efficacy . Human reproductive safety data are not available for BNT162b2, but there is no suspicion of human teratogenicit y bas ed on the intended mechanism of action of the compound. Therefore, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required (see Appendix 4 ). PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 294.3.Justification for Dose Based on data from the Phase 1 component of clinica l trial C4591001 and available nonclinical data , the modRNA BNT162b2 vaccine candidate was selected at a dose of 30 \u00b5g for Phase 2/3 evaluation of safet y, immunogenicity, and efficacy. This is the dose that has shown to be effective and has been authorize d for temporary or emergency use. Update based on protocol amendment 2: The primary immunogenicity analy sisdemonstrated that the immune response elicited by the lyophilized formulation did not meet the nonin feriority criteria compared to the frozen -liquid formulation. Therefore, all study participants who received 2 doses of the ly ophilized formulation will be offered an additional 30 -ug dose of the frozen- liquid formulation. 4.4.End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study , including the last visit. The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study. 5.STUDY POPULATION This study can fulfi ll its objectives only if appropriate participant s are enrolled.

Participants who o riginally received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation of BNT162b2 will be offered the opportunity to receive an additional dose of thefrozen -liquid formulation of BNT162b2 at least 90 day safter Dose 2. Study intervention should be administered intram uscularl y into the deltoid muscle, preferabl y of the nondominant arm, by an unblinded administrator. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 34Standard vaccination practices must be observed and vaccine must not be injected into blood vessels. Appropriate medication and other supportive measures for management of an acute hypersensitivity reaction should be available in accordance with local guidelines for standard immunization practices. Administration of study interventions should be performed b y an appropriately qualified, GCP -trained, and vacc ine-experienced member of the study staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or medical assistant) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. Study intervention administration details will be recorded on the CRF. 6.2.Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study interventions received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved b efore use of the study intervention. 2.Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The temperature of all locations where study intervention is stored at a clinical site must be monitored continuously . At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking day s must indicate the minimum and maximum temperatures since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business. 3.Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery along with an y actions taken. The site should activel y pursue options for returning the stud y intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permiss ion to use the study intervention. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the I P manual. 4.Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the label. 5.Study interventions should be stored in their original containers. 6.See the IP manual for storage conditions of the study intervention. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 357. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical insti tution (where applicable) is responsible for stud y intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records), such as the IPAL or sponsor -approved equivalent. All study interventions w ill be accounted for using a study intervention accountabilit y form/record. 8.Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the I P manual. All destruction must be adequately documented. If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any special instructions provided b y Pfizer. Upon ide ntification of a product complaint, notify the sponsor within 1 business day of discovery as described in the I P manual. 6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing See the IP manual for instructions on how to prepare the stud y intervention for administration. Study inter vention should be prepared and dispensed b y an appropriatel y qualified and experienced member of the stud y staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, phy sician's assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. A second staff member will verify the preparation and dispensing. Study intervention will be prepared by qualified unblinded site personnel according to the IP manual. The stud y intervention will be administered in such a way as to ensure the participants remain blinded. Requirements for site personnel to be blinded for the Dose 3 preparation arenot applica ble. 6.3.Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 6.3.1. Allocation to Study Intervention Allocation (randomization) of par ticipants to vaccine groups will proceed through the use of an IRT s ystem (I WR). The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user's I D and password, the prot ocol number, and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a vaccine assignment and randomization number. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and study intervention allocation assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site's files. The study -specific I RT reference manual and I P manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 366.3.2. B linding of Site Person nel In this observer -blinded study , the study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the stud y interventions will be unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and participant s, will be blinded to study intervention assignments. I n particular, the individuals who evaluate participant safet y will be blinded. The PIwill assign the responsibility of the unblinded dispensers/administrators to persons who will not participate in t he evaluation of an y study participant . To ensure adequate coverage, at least 2 unblinded dispensers/administrators will be assigned per site. Members of the study site staff or clinic pharmacy should fulfill these roles. Contact between the unblinded dispensers and study participants shoul d be kept to a minimum. The investigator, study coordinator, and any site staff other than the unblinded dispensers/administrators must not be allowed to know the study intervention assigned to an y study participant and must not be allowed to see the study intervention container contents. Once the study intervention has been prepared, there is no difference in the ph ysical appearance of the BNT162b2 formulations. In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinde d study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done accurately. Update based on protocol amendment 2: After the complete data through 1 month after Dose 2 for Part 1 participant swere available, the database for Part 1 was released and unblinded for the study team to perform the statistical analy ses specified for P art 1. Additionally ,site staff and study participants were also unblinded to participant s'vaccine allocation. 6.3.3. Blinding of the Sponsor The majority of sponsor staff will be blinded to study intervention allocation. All laboratory testing personnel performing serology assay s will remain blinded to study intervention assigned/received throughout the study . The following sponsor staff, who will have n o part in the blinded conduct of the study , will be unblinded (further details will be provided in a data blinding plan): Those study team members who are involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for study intervention preparation, handling, allocation, and administration are fulfilled at the site will be unblinded for the duration of the study (eg, unblinded study manager, unblinded clinical research associate). Unblinded clinician(s) who are not direct members of the study team and will not partici pate in an y other study -related activities will review unblinded protocol deviations. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 37After the complete data through 1 month after Dose 2 for Part 1 participants were available, the database for Part 1 was released and unblinded for the study team to perform the statistical analy ses specified for Part 1. 6.3.4. Breaking the Blind All study participants will receive BNT162b2; blinding refers onl y to which vaccine formulation the participant will receive. The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. I n case of an emergency , the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant's study intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safet y must alway s be the first consideration in making such a de termination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant's vaccine assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant. If a participant's vaccine assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and CRF. The study -specific I RT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from the investigator or desig nee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the CRF. The dose of stud y intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the stud y site staff other than the person administering the study intervention. 6.5. Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant medications and vaccinations will be recorded in the CRF: All vaccinations received from 28 day s prior t o study enrollment until the 1- month follow -up visit (Visit 3). Additionally , for all participants receiving Dose 3, all vaccinations received from 28days prior to Visit 101 (Dose 3) until the 1- month follow -up visit ( Visit 102). Prohibited medications listed in Section 6.5.1 will be recorded, to include start and stop dates, name of the medication, dose, unit, route, and freq uency . 6.5.1. Prohibited During the Study Receipt of the following vaccines and medications during the time periods listed below may exclude a participant from the per -protocol anal ysis from that point onward and may require vaccinations to be discontinued in tha t participant; however, it is anticipated that the participant would not be withdrawn from the study (see Section 7). Medications sh ould not be withheld if required for a participant's medical care. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 38Unless considered medically necessary , no vaccines other than study intervention should be administered within 28 day s before and 28 day s after each study vaccination. One exception to thi s is that seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine can be given at least 14 day s after, or at least 14 day s prior to, the administration of study intervention. Receipt of chronic s ystemic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications, or radiotherap y, within 60 day s before enrollment through conclusion of the study . Receipt of s ystemic corticosteroids ( 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for 14days is prohibited from 28 day s prior to enrollment through Visit 3 orVisit 102 for those partici pants receiving Dose 3 . Receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within 60 day s before enrollment through conclusion of the study . Receipt of an y other (nonstudy ) coronavirus vaccine at an y time prior to or during study participation is prohibited. Receipt of proph ylactic medications intended to prevent symptoms associated with COVID -19. However, if a participant is taking a medication for another condition, even if it may have such properties, it should not be withheld prior to study vaccination. Prophy lactic antipy retics and other pain medication to prevent symptoms associated with study intervention administration are not permitted. However, if a participant is taking a medication for another condition, even if it may have antipy retic or pain- relieving properties, it should not be withheld prior to study vaccination. 6.5.2. Permitted During the Study The use of antip yretics and other pain medication to treat symptoms associated with study intervention administration or ongoing conditions is permitted. Medication other than that described as prohibited in Section 6.5.1 required for treatment of preexisting stable conditions is permitted. Inhaled, topical, or localized injections of corticosteroids (eg, intra -articular or intrabursal administration) are permitted. 6.6. Dose Modification Not applicable for this study . 6.7.Intervention After the End of the Study No intervention will be provided to study participants at the end of the study . PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 397.DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AN D PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL 7.1.Discontinuation of Study Intervention In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanentl y discontin ue study intervention (definitive discontinuation). Reasons for definitive discontinuation of study intervention include the following: AEs; participant request; investigator request; pregnancy; protocol deviation (including no longer meeting all the inclusion criteria, or meeting 1 or more exclusion criteria *). I n general, unless the investigator considers it unsafe to administer the second dose, or the participant does not wish to receive it, it is preferred that the second dose be administered. *A posi tive SARS -CoV -2 NAAT result without symptoms a COVID -19 diagnosis (signs/s ymptoms only or signs/symptoms and a positive SARS -CoV -2 NAAT result) should not result in discontinuation of study intervention. If study intervention (Dose 2) has been delay ed per Section 5.5, because of febrile or other acute illness (I tem 1 in the list in Section 5.5), and the investigator later diagnoses the signs and s ymptoms as COVID -19 (with or without a positive SARS -CoV - 2 NAAT result), the participant should not be discontinued from an y further doses of study intervention. Note that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study . Per the study estimands, if study intervention is de finitively discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for safet y and immunogenicit y. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow -up for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt of stud y intervention or also from s tudy procedures, postvaccination study follow -up, and/or future collection of additional information. 7.2.Participant Discontinuation/ Withdrawal F rom the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request. Reasons for discontin uation from the study include the following: Refused further follow -up; Lost to follow -up; terminated by Participant RNA -Based COVID Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 40Investigator request; Protocol deviation. If a participant does not return for a scheduled visit, ever y effort should be made to contact the participant. All attempts to contact the participant and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the participant's source document. I n any circumstance, every effort should be made to document participant outcome, if possible. The investigator or his or her designee should capture the reason for withdrawal in the CRF for all participants. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples take n and not tested, and the investigator must document any such requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly . If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1) for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before su ch withdrawal of consent. Lack of completion of all or an y of the withdrawal/earl y termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant's safet y was preserved. 7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow - up procedures. The onl y exception to this is when a participant specificall y withdraws consent for any further contact with h im or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow- up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or postvaccination study follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicl y available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. 7.3.Lost to Fol low-up A participant will be considered lost to follow- up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to attend a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 41assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should c ontinue in the study ; Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant's medical record; Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 8.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PRO CEDURES The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and dated ICD before performing an y stud y-specific procedures. The full date of birth will be collected to criticall y evaluate the immun e response and safet y profile b y age. Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA . Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Safety issues should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for stud y conduct. All screeni ng evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the inv estigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. I n these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well-being of the participant. When a protocol- required test cannot be performed, the investigator will doc ument the reason for the missed test and an y corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For sample s being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study . PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 42The total blood sampling volume for individual participan ts in this study is approximately 40mL. Additional blood samples may be taken for safet y assessments at times specified b y Pfizer, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during an y period of 60 consecutive day s. Per protocol amendment 2, those participants who accept the offer to receive Dose 3 will have an additional approximately 20-mL blood sample collected for immunogenicity assessments at each visit . 8.1.Efficacy and/or Immunogenicity Assessments Serum samples will be obtained for immunogenicity testing at the visits specified in the SoA. The test to be performed will be the SARS -CoV -2 full -length S that all will be base d upon samples anal yzed at the central laboratory . Nasal (midturbinate) swabs at the visits specified in the SoA will be obtained as one of the determinations for participants to be included in the evaluable immunogenicity anal ysis. These samples will be tested at the central laboratory using an RT -PCR test (Cepheid, an NAAT; FDA approved under EUA) to detect SARS -CoV -2. Another determination for participants to be included in the evaluable immunogenicity anal ysis is the N -binding antibody assay . Blood samples will be taken at visits specified in the SoA and anal yzed at the central laboratory . A positive result on either test will result in the immunogenicity data from that participant being excluded from the evaluable portion of the study population. However, administration of study intervention is not dependent on these test results, which will be available only after the study has ended. 8.1.1. Biological Samples Blood and nasal swab samples will be used only forscientific research. Each sample will be labeled with a code so that the laboratory personnel testing the samples will not know the participant's identity . Samples that remain after performing assay s outlined in the protocol may be stored by Pfizer. Unless a time limitation is required b y local regulations or ethical requirements, the samples will be stored for up to 15 y ears after the end of the study and then destroy ed. If allowed by the I CD, stored samples may be used for additional testing to bette r understand the immune responses to the vaccine(s) under stud y in this protocol, to inform the development of other products, and/or for vaccine- related assay work supporting vaccine programs. No testing of the participant's genetic material will be perf ormed. The participant may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroy ed at any time; however, an y data alread y collected from those samples will still be used for this research. The biological samples may be shared with other resea rchers as long as confidentiality is maintained and no testing of the participant's genetic material is performed. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 438.2.Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the stud y to assess any perceived safety issues. A clinical assessment, including medical history , will be performed on all participants at their first visit to establish a b aseline. Significant medical history and observations from any physical examination, if performed, will be documented in the CRF. AEs and SAEs are collected, recorded, and reported as defined in Section 8.3. Acute reactions within the first 30 minutes after administration of the study intervention will be assessed and documented in the AE CRF. The safet y parameters also include reactogenicit y e -diary reports of local reactions, sy stemic events (including fever), and use of antip yretic medication that occur in the 7 day s after administration of the study intervention. These prospectivel y self -collected occurrences of local reactions and s ystemic events are graded as described in Section 8.2.2 . 8.2.1. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Clinical safety laboratory assessments will not be collected in this study . See Section 10.5, Appendix 5, for suggested actions and follow-up assessments in the event of potential DILI. 8.2.2. Electronic Diary Participants will be required to complete a reactogenicity e-diary through an application installed on a provisioned device or on the participant' s own personal device. All participants will be asked to monitor and record local reactions, sy stemic events, and antipy retic medication usage for 7 days from the day of administration of the study intervention. The reactogenicity e-diary allows recordin g of these assessments only within a fixed time window, thus providing the accurate representation of the participant's experience at that time. Data on local reactions and systemic events reported in the reactogenicit y e-diary will be transferred electro nically to a third- party vendor, where they will be available for review b y investigators and the Pfizer clinicians at all times via an internet -based portal. At intervals agreed to b y the vendor and Pfizer, these data will be transferred electronicall y into Pfizer's database for anal ysis and reporting. These data do not need to be reported by the investigator in the CRF as AEs. Investigators (or designee) will be required to review the reactogenicity e-diary data online at frequent intervals as part of th e ongoing safet y review. The investigator or designee must obtain stop dates from the participant for any ongoing local reactions, sy stemic events, or use of antipyretic medication on the last day that the PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 44reactogenicity e-diary was completed. The stop da tes should be documented in the source documents and the information entered in the CRF. 8.2.2.1. Grading Scales The grading scales used in this study to assess local reactions and systemic events as described below are derived from the FDA CBER guidelines on toxic ity grading scales for healthy adult volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials.12 8.2.2.2. Local Reactions During the reactogenicit y e-diary reporting period, participants will be asked to assess redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site and to record the s ymptoms in the reactogenicity e-diary . If a local reaction persists bey ond the end of the reactogenicity e-diary period following vaccination, the participant will be requested to report that information. The investigator will enter this a dditional information in the CRF. Redness and swelling will be measured and recorded in measuring device units (range: 1to21) and then categorized during anal ysis as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the grading scale in Table 1. Measuring device units can be converted to centimeters according to the following formula: 1 measuring device unit = 0.5 cm. Pain at the injection site will be asse ssed by the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading scale in Table 1. If a Grade 3 local reaction is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary , a telephone contact should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. Onl y an investigator or medicall y qualified person is able to classify a participant's local reaction as Gra de4. If a participant experiences a confirmed Grade 4 local reaction, the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention, further vaccinations will be discontinued i n that participant.

Systemic Events During the reactogenicit y e-diary reporting period, participants will be asked to assess vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain and to record the s ymptoms in the reactogenicit y e-diary . The symptoms will be assessed b y the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading scale in Table 2. If a Grade 3 s ystemic event is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary , a telephone contact should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. Onl y an investigator or medicall y qualified person is able to classify a participant 's systemic event as Grade 4. If a participant experiences a confirmed Grade 4 systemic event, the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention, further vaccination s will be discontinued in that participant.

During the 7 days following each vaccination, potential COVID -19 symptoms that overlap with solicited sy stemic events (ie, fever, chills, new or increased muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting) should be assessed by the investigator. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 46If, in the investigator's opinion, the sy mptoms are considered more likely to be vaccine reactogenicity , but a participant is required to demonstrate that he or she is SARS -CoV -2-negative, a local SARS -CoV -2 test may be performed: if positive, the symptoms should be recorded as an AE rather than as sy stemic events in the reactogenicity e -diary . 8.2.2.4. Fever In order to record information on fever, a thermometer will be given to participants with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home. Temperature will be collected in the reactogenicit y e-diary in the evening dail y during the reactogenicit y e-diary reporting period. It will also be collected at an y time during the reactogenicit y e-diary data collection periods when fever is suspected. Fever is defined as an oral temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). The highest temperature for each day will be recorded in the reactogenicit y e-diary . Temperature will be measured and recorded to 1 decimal place. Temperatures recorded in degrees Fahrenheit will be programmatically converted to degrees Celsius and then categorized according to the scale shown i n Table 3during anal ysis. If a fever of 39.0\u00b0C (102.1\u00b0F) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary , a telephone contact should occur to ascertain furt her details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. Onl y an investigator or medicall y qualified person is able to confirm a participant's fever as >40.0\u00b0C (>104.0\u00b0F). If a participant experiences a confirmed fever >40.0\u00b0C (>104.0\u00b0F), the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention, further vaccinations will be discontinued in that participant. Table 3. Scale for Fever yretic medication to treat s ymptoms associated with study intervention administration will be recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary daily during the reporting period (Day 1 through Day 7). 8.2.3. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy tests may be urine or serum tests, but must have a sensitivity of at least 25mIU/mL. Pregnancy tests will be performed in WOCBP at the times l isted in the SoA , immediately before the administration of each vaccine dose. A negative pregnancy test result will be required prior to the participant's receiving the study intervention. Pregnancy tests PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 47may also be repeated if re quested b y IRBs/ECs or if required b y local regulations. I n the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the participant will be withdrawn from administration of study intervention but may remain in the study . 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3 . AEs will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legall y authorized representative). The inves tigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess wheth er the event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7.1). Each participant will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner. In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safet y to obtain specific follow - up information in an expedited fashion. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for C ollecting AE and SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (\"active collection period\") for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant's participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including Visit 3 (1- month follow -up). In addition, an y AEs occurring up to 48 hours after the blood draw and nasal swab collection at Visit 3 reported by the participant must be recorded in the CRF .SAEs will be collected from the time the participant provides informed consent through approximately 1month after the last dose of study intervention (Visit 3). For all participants receiving Dose 3 , AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time the participant provides informed consent for the receipt of Dose 3 at Visit 101 through Visit 102. Follow -up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when s creen failure status is determined. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 48If a participant definitively discontinues or temporarily discontinues study intervention because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs after the participant has concluded stud y participation . However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has completed the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. 8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in Section 8.3.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form immediatel y upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 8.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant d uring the active collection period, which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1 ,will be recorded on the AE section of the CRF. The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported AEs and SAEs reported by the participant. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurr ences. 8.3.3. Follow - up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolut ion, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3). In general, follow - up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality . An y information relevant to the event, such as concomit ant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 49Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the saf ety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authorit y, IRBs/ECs, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives SUSARs or other specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the study and wi ll notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the study interventio nunder stud y during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are repor table to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy An EDP occurs if: A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention. A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception. A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy : A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact. A male famil y member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception. The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator's awareness, irrespective of wh ether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 50should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant's partner, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form and an EDP Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the pregnancy will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 1 month after th e last dose of study intervention. If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form and EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pe rtain to the participant enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the I SF. Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus shou ld be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be re ported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be hand led on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partne r. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 518.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if: A female partic ipant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention. A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact. The investigator must report exposure during breastfeedi ng to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator's awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environme ntal exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a cop y of the completed Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the I SF. An exposure during breast feeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specificall y approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. Such persons may include healthcare providers, famil y members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant's care. The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator's awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed Vaccine S AE Reporting Form is maintained in the I SF. 8.3.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events Not applicable. 8.3.7. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs Not applicable.

Adverse Events of Special Interest This section provides information on AESI s that may be detected during the study : Confirmed COVID -19 diagnosis (clinical signs/s ymptoms and positive SARS -CoV -2 NAAT test) A confirmed diagnosis of my ocarditis or pericarditis. See Section 8.13 for additional procedures for monitoring of potential my ocarditis or pericarditis. All AESI s must be reported as an AE or SAE following the procedures described in Section 8.3.1 through Section 8.3.4. An AESI is to be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. I n addition, an AESI that is also an SAE must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. 8.3.8.1. Lack of Efficacy Lack of efficacy is reportable to Pfizer Safet y only if ass ociated with an SAE. 8.3.9. Medical Device Deficiencies Not applicable. 8.3.10. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the study intervention by the wrong participant , or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Exposures to the study intervention under stud y may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness Medication errors All (regardless of whether associated with an AE)Only if associated with an SAE Medication errors include: Medication errors involving participant exposure to the study intervention; Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in th e protocol that do or do not involve the study participant; The administration of expired study intervention; The administration of an incorrect study intervention; The administration of an incorrect dosage; PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 53The administration of study intervention that ha s undergone temperature excursion from the specified storage range, unless it is determined by the sponsor that the study intervention under question is acceptable for use. Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the m edication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified within 24 hours . Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on theAE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a Vaccine SAE Report ingForm only when associated with an SAE . 8.4.Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of study intervention greater than 1 dose of study intervention within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. Pfizer does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1.Contact the medical monitor within 24 hours. 2.Closely monitor the participant for an y AEs/SAEs. 3.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the CRF. 4.Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with an SAE . Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be mad e by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.5.Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 8.6.Pharmacodynamics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated i n this study . 8.7.Genetics Genetics (specified anal yses) are not evaluated in this study .

Health Economics Health e conomics/ medical resource utilization and health e conomics parameters are not evaluated in this study . 8.11. Study Procedures 8.11.1. Visit 1 - Vaccination 1 (Day 1) Before enrollment and before an y stud y -related procedures are performed, voluntary , written, study -specific informed consent will be obtained from the participant. Each signature on the ICD must be personall y dated b y the signatory. The investigator or his or her designee will also sign the ICD. A copy of the signed and dated I CD must be given to the participant. The source data must reflect that the informed consent was obtained before participation in the study . It is anticipated that the procedures below will be conducted in a stepwise manner. The visit may be conducted across 2 consecutive day s; if so, all steps from assessing the inclusion and exclusion criteria onward must be conducted on the same day . Assign a single partici pant number using the IRT sy stem. Obtain the participant's demograph y (including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity). The full date of birth will be collected to criticall y evaluate the immune response and safet y profile b y age. Obtain an y medical hi story of clinical significance. Perform a clinical assessment. If the clinical assessment indicates that a phy sical examination is necessary to comprehensivel y evaluate the participant, perform a physical examination and record any findings in the source documents and, if clinically significant, record on the medical history CRF. Measure the participant's height and weight. Ensure and document that all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met. Measure the participant's body temperature. Perform urine pregnancy test on WOCBP as described in Section 8.2.3. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 55Discuss contraceptive use as described in Section 5.3.1 . Record n onstudy vaccinations as described in Section 6.5. Collect a blood sample of approximately 20 mL for immunogenicit y testing and to test for prior COVID -19. Please refer to the ISF for further instructions. Obtain a nasal (midturbinate) sw ab (collected by site staff) for determination of current SARS -CoV -2 status. Please refer to the ISF for further instructions. A blinded site staff member obtains the randomization number using the IRT sy stem. An unblinded site staff member then enters t he participant number (SSI D) and randomization number to assign the stud y intervention allocation number. Unblinded site staff member(s) will dispense/administer 1 dose of study intervention into the deltoid muscle of the (preferably )nondominant arm. Ple ase refer to the I P manual for further instruction on this process. Blinded site staff must observe the participant for at least 30 minutes after study intervention administration for an y acute reactions. Record an y acute reactions (including time of onse t) in the participant's source documents and on the AE page of the CRF, and on an SAE form as applicable. Explain the e -diary technologies available for this study (Section 8.2.2), and assist the participant in downloading the stud y application onto the participant's own device or issue a provisioned device if required. Provide instructions on reactogenicity e -diary completion and ask the participant to complete the reactogenicity e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7, with Day 1 being the day of vaccination. Ask the participant to contact the site staff or investigator immediatel y if the participant experiences any of the following from Day 1 through Day 7 after vaccination (where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) to determine if an unscheduled reactogenicity visit is required: Fever 39.0\u00b0C (102.1\u00b0F).

The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their anal yses will also be ref lected in a protocol amendment. 9.1.Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses 9.1.1. Estimands The estimands corresponding to each primary and secondary objective are described in the table in Section 3. The estimands to evaluat e the immunogenicity objectives are based on the evaluable immunogenicit y population ( Section 9.3). These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical settings where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. The estimands address the objective of estimating the maximum potential difference between 2 groups, since the impact of noncompliance is likely to diminish the observed difference between the 2 groups. Missing antibody results will not be imputed. Immunogenicit y results that are below the LLOQ will be set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ in the anal ysis; this may be adjusted once additional data on the assay characteristics become available. In the primary safet y objective evaluations, missing reactogenicity e -diary data will not be imputed. Missing AE start dates will be imputed according to Pfizer safet y rules. No other missing information will be imputed in the safet y analysis. 9.1.2. Statistical Hypothesis The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the noninferiorit y of the immune response induced b y lyophilized SDV compared to frozen -liquid MDV BNT162b2. The null 0) is -ln( 2) ln( where ln( 0.67) corresponds to a 1.5- fold margin for noninferiorit y and ln( 1) is the natural log of the geometric mean of full -length S -binding IgG levels measured 1 month after Dose 2 from participants receiving l yophilized SDV BNT162b2 ; PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 65ln( 2) is the natural log of the geometric mean of full- length S -binding IgG levels measured 1 month after Dose 2 from participants receiving frozen -liquid MDV BNT162b2 control for l yophilized SDV Noninferiorit y will be declared if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% CIfor the GMR of lyophilized SDV relative to frozen -liquid control is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold immunogenicity endpoint, and within -group descriptive summaries will be provided for the secondary immunogenicity endpoint. Consequently ,no multiplicity adjustment s areapplied . 9.2.Sample Size Determination The sample size in Part 1 of the study is based on the noninferiorit y evaluation for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, full -length S -binding IgG levels 1 month after Dose 2, using a 1.5 -fold noninferiority margin for the comparison between ly ophilized S DV BNT162b2 relative to frozen- liquid MDV BNT162b2. The second part of the study for assessing the immu ne responses induced by frozen - liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification orRTU BNT162b2 isfordescriptive purpose s;thus, sample size for this part is not based on statistical consideration s. Common assay standard deviations from each group are assumed to be 0.6456 based on results from Phase 1 of Study C4591001 (BNT162b2 30 \u00b5g , 18- to 55 -year age group). With th isstandard deviation and the observed GMT difference assumed in the power analy sis below, a sample size of 220evaluable participants per group in Part 1 of the study will provide a power of 9 0.1% to decla renoninferiority of lyophilized BNT162b2 to (Table4). Assuming a nonevaluable rate 20%, the stud y will randomize approximately 275participants toeach group in Part 1 of the study to achieve the required number of evaluable participants. Table4.

Data Quality Assurance All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for verify ing that data entries are accurate and c orrect by physically or electronically signing the CRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the CRF. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 75The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securel y stored at the study site in encry pted electronic and/or paper form and are password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access b y unauthorized third parties. The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. This verification may also occur after study completion. I t is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspecti ons and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk -based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management and mitigation strategies and analytical r isk-based monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on -site monitoring) ,are provided in the monitoring plan. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this s tudy,including quality checking of the data. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, I CH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including s igned IC Ds, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained b y the investigator for 15years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroy ed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for aslong as t hey are maintained. When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such data are promptly and irrevocabl y deleted from all systems. The investigator(s) will notify thesponsor or its agents immediately of any regul atory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with the sponsor or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow the sponsor or its agent, whenever feasible, to be prese nt during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the participant's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection fin dings to the sponsor or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide the sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to an y such findings.

Source Documents Source docum ents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrit y of the data collected. Source document s are filed at the investigator site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained . The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study . Also, current medical records must be available. Definition of what co nstitutes source data can be found in the study monitoring plan . Description of the use of computerized sy stem is documented in the data management plan. 10.1.8. Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of participants. The first act of recruitment is the date of the first participant's first visit and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for a ny reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a stud y-site closure visit has been performed. Theinvestigator may initiate study -site closure at any time upon notification to the sponsor or designee if requested to do so by the responsible I RB/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants . Reasons for the earl y closure of a stud y site b y the sponsor may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines; Inadequate recruitm ent of participants by the investigator; Discontinuation of further study intervention development . If the stud y is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO (s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 77Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement. If there is any conflict between the contract and this protocol ,the contract will control as to termination rights. 10.1.9. Publication Policy The results of this study may be published or present ed at scientific meetings b y the investigator after publication of the overall study results or 1 y ear after the end of the study (or study termination), whichever comes first. The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent p ublications such as secondary manuscripts, and submits all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 30days before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments and the investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for an y stud y-or Pfizer intervention - related information necessary for the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. For all publications relati ng to the stud y, the investigator will compl y with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of the overall study results covering all investigator sites. I n accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. I n this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. Authorship of publications for the overall study results will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with I nternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. If publication is addressed in the clinical study agreement, the publication policy set out in this section will not apply. 10.1.10. Sponsor's Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study documentation or other electronic s ystem. To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical questions or problems, participant s are provided with a contact card at the time of informed consent . The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and study intervention identifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant 's participation in the study . The contact nu mber can also be used b y investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 78problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team are not avail able. I t is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y. The contact number is not int ended for use b y the participant directl y, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 10.2. Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests A pregnancy test will be performed at times defined in the SoA section of this protocol: Visit 1 (Vaccination 1/Day 1) and Visit 2 (Vaccination 2/19 -23 day s after Visit 1) as well as at Visit 101 for participants receiving Dose 3. Pregnancy test ( -hCG): Local urine testing will be standard for the protocol u nless serum testing is required by local regulation or IRB/EC for female participants of childbearing potential. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess an y perceived safet y issues. Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safet y report. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 7910.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting 10.3.1. Definition of AE AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the stud y intervention. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator Any abnormal laboratory test results that meet an y of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE: Is associated with accompany ing s ymptoms . Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention . Leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation f rom the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diag nosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overd ose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequela e. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 80Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant's condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or co ndition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term \"life-threatening \"in the definition of \"serious\" refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \"hospitalization\" occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 81Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a su bstantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accident al trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Suspected transmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered serious. The event may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a Pfizer product. The terms \"suspected transmission\" and \"transmission\" are considered s ynon ymous. These cases are considered unexp ected and handled as serious expedited cases by pharmacovigilance personnel. Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 8210.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow -up of AE sand/or SAE s AE and SAE Recording /Reporting The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF and for reporting serious adverse events on the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm to Pfizer Safety . These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonseri ous adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. It should be noted that the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm for re porting of SAE information. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness SAE All All Nonserious AE All None Exposure to the study intervention under stud y during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll AEs/SAEs associated with exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding Occupational exposure is not recorded.All (and EDP supplemental form for EDP) Note: I nclude all SAEs associated with exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Include all AEs/SAEs associated with occupational exposure. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant's medical reco rds to Pfizer Safety in lieu of completion of the Vaccine SAE Report ing Form /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y Pfizer Safety . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 83exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. When ever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, or LIFE- THREATENING to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency , these intensity grades are d efined as follows: 1 MILD Does not interfere with participant 's usual function. 2 MODERATE Interferes to some extent with participant 's usual function. 3 SEVERE Interferes significantl y with participant 's usual function. 4 LIFE -THREATENING Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 84Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A \"reasonable possibility\" of a relationship convey s that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration, will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product i nformation, for mar keted products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a nSAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. If the investigator does not know whether or not the study intervention caused the event, then the event will be handled as \"related to study intervention \" for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor . In addition, if the investigator d etermines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm and in accordance wit h the SAE reporting requirements. PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 85Follow -up of AEs and SAEs The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare providers . If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide Pfizer Safet y with a cop y of any postmortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via Vaccine SAE Report ingForm Facsimile transmission of the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm is the preferred method to transmit this information to Pfizer Safety . In circumstances when the fac simile is not working , notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm sent b y overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the Vaccine SAE Report ingForm pages within the designated reporting time frames.

Woman of Childbearing Potential A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanentl y sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the foll owing categories are not considered WOCBP: 1.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: Documented h ysterectomy ; Documented bilateral salpingectomy ; Documented bilateral oophorectom y. For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry . Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel's review of the partici pant's medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant's medical record for the stud y. 2.Postmenopausal female : A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 month s without an alternative medical cause. In addition, a high FSH level in the postmenopausal range must be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women under 60 years of age and not using hormonal contraception or HRT. Female on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status bef ore stud y enrollment.

Contracepti onMethods Contraceptive use b y men or women should be consistent with local availability /regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical trials. 1.Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception partner is a highl y effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The s permatogenesis cy cle is 90days. 6.Comb Oral; Injectable . 8.Sexua l abstinence : Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifest yle of the participant.

Male or female condom with or without spermicide . 11. Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide. 12. A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double -barrier methods) .

Appendix 5: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow -up Assessments Potential Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed \"tolerators,\" while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed \"adaptors.\" In some participant s, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participant s fail to adapt and therefore are \"susceptible\" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonl y referred to as DILI. Participant s who experi ence a transaminase elevation above 3 \u00d7ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an \"adaptor\" or are \"susceptible.\" LFTs are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this study . However, should an investigator deem it necessary to assess LFTs because a participant presents with clinical signs/s ymptoms, such LFT results should be managed and followed as described below. In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede TBili elevations (>2 \u00d7ULN) b y several day s or weeks. The increase in TBili ty pically occurs while AST/AL T is/are still elevated above 3 \u00d7ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab oratory sample). In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy 's law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the participant 's individual baseline values and underly ing conditions. Participant s who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy's law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Participant s with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 \u00d7ULN AND a TBili value >2\u00d7 ULN hemol an alkaline phosphatase value <2\u00d7ULN or not availabl e. For participant s with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 \u00d7ULN; or >8 \u00d7ULN (whichever is smaller). PF-07302048 (BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine) Protocol C4591020 Final Protocol Amendment 2, 13Sep 2021 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 91Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 \u00d7 ULN orif the value reaches >3\u00d7ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy's law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests , detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili for suspected cases of Hy's law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, acid s, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous anal yses at the time of the recognized initial abno rmalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen /paracetamol (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample s for acetaminophen/paracetamol drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy 's law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy's law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities . A potential DILI (Hy 's law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
