Biotechnica licenses the rights to use its genetically modified T. vulgaris megasuavis plants to petrochemical companies like [SovOil](/wiki/SovOil) and [Petrochem](/wiki/Petrochem). [[2]](#cite_note-Report3-2) [[3]](#cite_note-3) Besides the utilizing the licensing rights of CHOOH2 to other corporations, Biotechnica has a multitude of [Bioware](/wiki/Bioware) products on the market. Overview[ ] When the fuel crisis began to affect the industrialized community in the late [1990s](/wiki/1990s), Biotechnica, then a small firm with only one office, came up with the answer: [CHOOH2](/wiki/CHOOH2) (pronounced 'chew two'). CHOOH2 (not its actual chemical formula) is a complex grain alcohol produced by genetically engineered yeasts and wheat strains created by Biotechnica. [[4]](#cite_note-World-4) The potential of CHOOH2 was realized almost immediately after it was introduced, and within a few years all fuel burning vehicles and power plants had converted to the new fuel. Despite holding global patents, Biotechnica lacked the production facilities to meet global demand, forcing it to license production to several large agribusinesses and petro-corporations. These transactions made Biotechnica a very wealthy, but still small, company. Companies such as [SovOil](/wiki/SovOil) and [Petrochem](/wiki/Petrochem) have the exclusive rights into producing the fuel. [[5]](#cite_note-CP2020-5) Its labs have provided much of the tech that enabled the [Pacifica Confederation](/wiki/Pacifica_Confederation) to develop new bio-engineered \"replacement species,\" and Biotechnica is active in restoring both animals and habitat throughout the blighted environments of this era. [[6]](#cite_note-CPRED-6) In 2020, it is looking into more breakthroughs and is constantly expanding. Biotechnica holds facilities in [Italy](/wiki/Italy), ] 1990s[ ] Biotechnica started as a small corporation based out of Rome, [Italy](/wiki/Italy). However, in [1991](/wiki/1991), amidst an energy crisis, Biotechnica developed a substitute for fossil fuel that would end up being called [CHOOH2](/wiki/CHOOH2), changing the world forever. They weren't a big corporation and weren't able to keep up with the supply and demand the world would need. As a result, they sold the exclusive license for the production and distribution of the product to [Petrochem](/wiki/Petrochem). CHOOH2 became the standard fuel around the world. Capitalizing on its success, the board of directors sold the license to 14 other manufacturers around the world, However, Petrochem was still responsible for 60% of the world's supply [[2]](#cite_note-Report3-2) with the largest amount of soil to grow the yeast needed for production. Biotechnica's products raised their capital by a huge margin and gave them the status of a megacorporation. Biotechnica started making deals with [Arasaka](/wiki/Arasaka), and settled on a mutual beneficial agreement, providing troops in exchange for exclusive biological weapons. [2000s](/wiki/2000s)[ ] Their second discovery was kept secret due to it being illegal in the majority of countries. In [2004](/wiki/2004), Francis Young was successful in human cloning experiments, however it wasn't until 16 years later in 2020 that he succeeded in producing the first self-aware fully functional human clone by implanting a construct personality. Initially, this development was artificial, but soon enough they began experimenting to insert natural digitized personalities in clones using something similar in tech to the [Soulkiller](/wiki/Soulkiller). The main R&D cloning facility of Biotechnica located in [Night City](/wiki/Night_City) had a staff of about 200 scientists and security. The biggest goal for Biotechnica was to bring back the flora and the fauna that changed significantly in the 1990s due to climate changes. They hold facilities worldwide specializing in this field, slowly trying to rebuild the environment. In the [2020s](/wiki/2020s) they created a natural park in Night City known as [Lake Park](/wiki/Lake_Park). They also cloned animals in an attempt to preserve them and sell to people for a high profit margin. [2022](/wiki/2022)[ ] The [Fourth Corporate War](/wiki/Fourth_Corporate_War) saw Biotechnica remain as neutral as it possibly could, allowing them to get through the war without many problems. They supplied [Militech](/wiki/Militech) and [Arasaka](/wiki/Arasaka) with weapons and other biological equipment. However due to their previous deals with Arasaka and their continued protection support from the company, Arasaka got many exclusive devices behind the scenes. [2077](/wiki/2077)[ ] In the [2070s](/wiki/2070s), Biotechnica has been working towards rebuilding the environment, including restoration of forests and bioengineering previously extinct animal species across the world. The corporation has also participated in researching various vaccines and future medicine products as the effects of climate change take its toll on humans. [[7]](#cite_note-CP2077-7) On the South side of the [Badlands](/wiki/Badlands) of Night City, Biotechnica has many [protein farms](/wiki/Protein_Farm) that has made the landscape more livable than the rest. These immense, tent-like structures on the outskirts are but a few of the many farms Biotechnica manages worldwide, producing synthetic protein derivatives on a massive scale. [[8]](#cite_note-8) The Biotechnica protein farms are also the base product for much of Night City's [food](/wiki/Food) source. Biotechnica offers its employees up to six paid vacation days a year. In 2077, the corporation is considered the third biggest and best place to work for in Night City. [[9]](#cite_note-9) In 2077, [Saul Bright](/wiki/Saul_Bright), leader of an [Aldecaldos](/wiki/Aldecaldos) clan outside of Night City, was negotiating with Biotechnica to have his clan work for them in exchange for reverse transpiration xerophytes, i.e., equipment to help his clan grow crops in the Badlands and thereby be more self-sufficient. [[10]](#cite_note-10) Although Saul sought to enter his clan into a more permanent working relationship with Biotechnica in order to provide his people with a steady income, this notion was very unpopular among his followers and, thus, never came to fruition. [[11]](#cite_note-11) [[12]](#cite_note-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) Despite the company's apparently positive contribution to society, Biotechnica regional director for tech and development Dr. [Joanne Koch](/wiki/Joanne_Koch), aided by colleagues [Alex Pushkin](/wiki/Alex_Pushkin) [[14]](#cite_note-14) and Diana [[15]](#cite_note-15), was responsible unscrupolous capture of [Nomads](/wiki/Nomad) of the [Red Ocher](/wiki/Red_Ocher) clan. Using them as test subjects for a project called \"Nightingale\" resulted in the deaths of 70 clan members. [[16]](#cite_note-16) [[17]](#cite_note-notes-17) To prevent a leak of the affair, Dr. Koch also ordered Biotechnica security to have her colleague Emilia Morton killed. [[18]](#cite_note-18) [[19]](#cite_note-19) [[20]](#cite_note-20) Media Manuel Mendoza who started investigating project Nightingale befell a similar fate. [[17]](#cite_note-notes-17) [[21]](#cite_note-21) Equipment & Resources 2020[ ] Biotechnica is a rich corporation from Europe and has a heap of resources at their disposal. - 10 [AV-4](/wiki/AV-4)Assault Vehicles - 5 Corporate Jets - 3 Osprey II Aircraft - One [Boeing C-25](/wiki/Boeing_C-25_Cargo_Aircraft)Heavy Cargo Jet In addition, each office maintains two helicopters and a surgery capable infirmary. Due to the worldwide importance of its developments, Biotechnica has a fair amount of power in the political community, and it can usually obtain whatever military equipment it needs, although some items may take more time to procure than others. Biotechnica has one orbital research workstation. [[5]](#cite_note-CP2020-5) Key Facilities[ ] American Station](/wiki/Biotechnica_Mono-clonal_Research_Station) Database Entry (2077)[ ] Biotechnica is a corporation specializing in genetic engineering and biotechnical, pharmaceutical and microbiological research. It was in Biotechnica's labs that the world's leading specialists first made the breakthrough discovery that brought the world back from the brink of a fuel crisis. The discovery? CHOOH2, a fuel based on synthetic alcohol obtained from genetically modified wheat. This patent made the corporation a major player on the market. To this day, Biotechnica retains exclusive rights to the product - and complete control over the fuel market. Its other major field of business is food production: large companies such as All Foods also fall under the Biotechnica umbrella. [[7]](#cite_note-CP2077-7) Products[ W.
