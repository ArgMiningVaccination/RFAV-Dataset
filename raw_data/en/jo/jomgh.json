The public's responses suggest that hearing more information about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, and that they produce no, few or mild side effects, is likely to lead more people to be willing to get vaccinated. | | What is the biggest concern you had/have, if any, about getting a COVID-19 vaccine? \"I am scared that the vaccine is not going to do my body well. I think that it will give me some problems.\" \"Had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine so I am very concerned that it could happen with the COVID vaccine\" \"Potential side effects and no research on long term effects\" \"I don't believe the FDA is telling the truth. The vaccine is not ready yet and people I know who have taken it are having serious side effects and doctors are covering it up.\" - 42 year old, female, black, independent, North Carolina, \"definitely not\" When asked to name a person who could make them more likely to get vaccinated, the most common response was friends and family, highlighting how one's social network may affect people's decisions.
