In our experience, studyi ng traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines inevitably leads to ac- cusations of partiality: one is blamed either for taking sides in f avor of bio- medicine and against alternative healing systems, or for advocati ng alterna- tive healing systems without pointing out the alleged risks they imply. In presenting papers on the topic, we have often felt that our audience tended to prick up their ears on hearing what they feared, expecting us to take sides in either promoting or condemning biomedicine or alternative medicine. This experience, which reinforced our desire to approach this topic from an unbi- ased perspective, is one reason why this publication is so important to us. This collection has benefitted from the support of many people. La ura Feldt und Gregory Alles shared our interest in not subjecting any kind of healing system to value judgements, and their comments helped us to im- prove the consistency of our arguments. We are also grateful to Joh annes Quack for feedback on our initial drafts. Our sincerest thanks g o to Robert Parkin for his linguistic proof-reading; his flexibility, patience, a nd feeling for language were of invaluable value. Julia Swoboda and Mirjam Aesc h- bach undertook the task of formatting and formal ly proof-reading the manu- script. Our heartfelt thanks go to them both for their academic expertise and their invariable good spirits in having to cope with complex formatting r ules. Finally, we thank all of our authors.

Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf, Zurich / Tuebingen, July 2018 Introduction Observing the Entanglement of Medicine, Religion, and Spirituality through the Lens of Differentiation Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf In the history of religions, tasks such as curing bodily ailments, treat ing the sick, and dealing with dying were often assigned to religious expert s. Con- cepts such as the body, illness, and health were anchored in the world views and practices of the respective religious traditions. As Pamela Klassen (2016: 401) writes: \"Medical knowledge and techniques have often emerged di- rectly from religious traditions, making the line between these two admit- tedly unstable categories\u2014religion and medicine\u2014particularly hard to draw with any certainty.\" In historical contexts, the disentangling of medicine, re- ligion, and spirituality is seemingly impossible. With regard to c ontemporary societies, one may take Klassen's observation a step further and a sk whether it is at all possible to draw a clear line between \"religi on\" and \"medicine.\" Research in medical anthropology tends to emphasize that on the emi c level, actors often do not distinguish between religion and medicine.1 Besides, de- bates on secularization theory discuss the question of whether and in what ways the functional differentiation of modern societies that is observed in Europe and North America, including the differentiation of religion and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 In case s of medical pluralism, Krause et al. (2012: 17 -18), for example, refer to the work of Murray Last and David Parkin, who argue ag ainst th e concept of \"medical systems\" and point out that actors often make use of a va riety of medical (and religious) traditions without differentiating betwe en \"medical\" and \"reli- gious\" practices and knowledge. 10 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf medicine, can also be countries 2018). Taking up these reflections, we raise the questions of whether i t makes sense to refer to \"religion\" and \"medicine\" as two different r ealms, and whether it is acceptable for etic academic research to mak e use of concepts (or differentiations) that do not reflect self-perceptions and c oncepts on the emic level. 1 DOES IT MAKE SENSE T O DIF FERENTIATE BETWEEN RELIGION AND MEDICINE? In contrast to the considerations sketched out above, we argue that i t is im- portant to maintain the paradigm of differentiating between \"religi on\" and \"medicine,\" at least in contemporary societies, for the following reasons. 1.1 The Contemporary Differentiation between \"Religion\" and \"Medicine\": A Global Paradigm Social differentiation is a characteristic of modern societi es, including the social systems denoted by \"religion\" and \"medicine,\" though to diffe rent de- grees. In the following, we argue that, thanks to the specific e volution of modern academic medicine (cp. L\u00fcddeckens)2 and the worldwide spread of biomedicine, differentiating \"religion\" and \"medicine\" has become a global paradigm. Nevertheless, there are many cases of non-differenti ation or of the entangling of religion and medicine. When we talk about the entangling or de-differentiation of \"religion\" and \"medicine\", we are not referring to cases in which religious and medical ac- tors or actions coexist, as, for example, in a hospital where ph ysicians deal with the physical needs of their patients and chaplains deal wit h their spiritual needs. Nor are we dealing with cases where a physician talks with his or her patient first about an impending operation and afterwards about the pat ient's fear of dying. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2 All ref erences without a year designation refer to contributions in this volume. Introduction | 11 Such cases are in line with the global development of social differ entia- tion. Our interest is rather directed at practices and concepts that involve medical and religious arguments and aims at the same time, that take medical as well as religious concepts into account, or that deal with b oth the physical and the transcendent aspects, including transcendent entities, thus pursuing medical and religious goals within one and the same framework. The entangling of \"medicine\" and \"religion\" may therefore be observe d in cases where religious concepts, such as spiritual development, are guiding principles for medical treatment, as in a n anthroposophical hospital (cp. Zeugin et al.), or where, as in Transpersonal Psychology, religious expe ri- ence is induced on purpose in order to support therapeutic aims (cp. Gripen- trog), to name but two examples. These de-differentiated entanglements can be observed especially a t the margins of either \"religion\" or \"medicine,\" as we will outlin e below. Such cases of entanglement rather confirm the global character of the paradigm of differentiated religion and medicine: even when actors do not differe ntiate, they often relate to this paradigm and are judged accordingly. These pro- cesses are particularly visible in the ways in which therapeutic practic es and knowledge are labeled. 1.1.1 Differentiation in the Mainstream, Entanglement at the Margins? Many scholars have discussed the differentiation of \"religion\" a nd \"medi- cine\" in the context of their respective institutions and profes sions, including their knowledge and techniques, with 2011). On the one hand, modern academic medicine, also called biomedi- cine, 3 does not accept religious concepts and practices as part of its biomed- ical framework. Due to the global spread of this kind of medicine, the disen- tangling of biomedicine and religion can be observed far beyond so- called Western societies, although in different ways and to different degree s. For example, in Japan and Tanzania, public health care supports primarily bio- medical institutions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 Similar terms include \"conventional medicine, mainst ream medicine, Western medicine, orthodox medi cine,\" \" \"12 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf However, even in modern societies, biomedicine is only one healing sys- tem among others. In many countries, officially recognized medicine a lso includes more or less \"secularized\" (and re-invented) forms of pre-modern medicine, often labeled \"traditional medicine,\" in which religious and me di- cal concepts are intertwined with therapeutic practices such as Siddha medi- cine (cp. Rageth), Ayurveda, and Unani in India, or kanp medicine in Japan. In other cases, modern medical innovations in the field of Comple mentary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), such as anthroposophic medicine4 or ho- meopathy, are officially acknowledged, as in the Swiss health- care system. While the religious connections or aspects of these healing systems a re dis- puted, they often claim to be \"holistic,\" in contrast to biomedicine. Ma ny medical professionals trained in these therapeutic practices c laim not only to address the physical and mental aspects of their patients' i llnesses but also to take care of their spiritual needs. On the other hand, religious actors, institutions, and communities that consider themselves as belonging to the \"mainstream\" religions often display a ready acceptance of the differentiation between religion and medici ne, even though this deprives their institutions of an important social function t hat they have formerly fulfilled. By accepting biomedicine and its cla ims to med- ical authority and by refraining from raising their own claims of the rapeutic competence beyond religious support, these religious actors and insti tutions present themselves as modern and as compatible with modern soc ieties. This is the case with the European mainstream churches as well a s with interna- tionally or nationally acknowledged Islamic institutions such as the Al Azhar University in Cairo or the healthcare system in Saudi Arabia (c p. Khalil et al. 2018). To quote Steve Bruce: \"Now only the fringes of religion \u2014New Agers employing Amerindian cures, Jeho- vah's Witnesses rejecting blood transfusion in favor of prayer, US television evange- lists claiming that HIV/AIDS is divi ne punishment for homosexuality \u2014practice or reject medicine. The mainstream \u2014primarily political response \u2014can be seen in the Church of England's response to HIV/AIDS: it recomme nds that the government in- vest more in scientific research. \" (2016: 640) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4 Anthroposophi c medicine perceives itself as \"integrated medicine\" . Introduction | 13 Bruce's observation that the tendency to engage in healing pract ices occurs rather on the institutional margins or in non-mainstream segments of reli- gious traditions is supported by studies of Sufi Islam (cp. Selim 2015) , and charismatic Christianity (cp. Brown 2011).5 In these cases, religious actors emphasize the superiority of religious authority over medical author ity in dealing with cases of illness. Another example in the context of New Age spirituality is the intertwining of spiritual and psychotherapeutical goals (cp. Gripentrog). 1.1.2 The Paradigm of Differentiation as a Frame of Reference Even though in cases of traditional medicine, faith healing, and so forth, the assumption that medicine and reliion are separate realms or systems t hat can be differentiated from each other seems absurd, this does not mean that the notion of differentiation is irrelevant. The notions of differentiat ion and of the subsequent hegemony of biomedicine strongly affect contemporary dis- courses and techniques related to the curing of illness globally. Propone nts of diverse forms of medical knowledge and therapeutic practices def ine their own positions within this diversity by referring to the differentia tion between religion and (scientific) medicine, or to the alleged authority of bi omedicine, whether in affirmative, critical, or integrative ways. They rea ct to the pre- sumed hegemonic status of biomedicine in the society concerned and ar e judged accordingly. As Schrimpf shows, for example, a contemporary Japanese Buddhist priest\u2014that is, a religious actor\u2014explains the medical effects of Buddhist practice by drawing analogies with scientific studies and referri ng to Transpersonal Psychology (cp. Schrimpf). Here, reference to a particular \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5 The distinctio n between mainstream religion and its margins as applied her e refers only to the level of institutionalized, official religion. As Mer edith McGuire has shown in her study on \"lived religion\" in the USA, in dividual religious practices and beliefs do not necessarily coincide with officially acknowled ged religious knowledge and practice. Her s and other studies have analyzed cases in which members of Christian \"mainstream\" communities engage in n on-Christian spir- itual practices, some of which are attributed wit h healing effects (cp. , for example, McGuire 2008:6 -10; for Germany, cp. al. 2009). 14 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf image of medicine as scientific is applied to legitimize claim s regarding the therapeutic authority of religion. Whereas some practitioners of C AM like Ayurveda emphasize the spiritual aspects of their therapies in order to dis- tinguish their practice from biomedicine, others de-emphasize th e metaphy s- ical dimensions of their therapies because they want them to be acknowl- edged as equal to biomedical treatments. As a consequence, the notion of differentiation and the hegemony of an allegedly non-religious biomedicine is reproduced not only by those who support it, but also by those who deny it or who claim their own superiori ty over it. This is often done by criticizing biomedicine as non-holistic, as lack- ing any spiritual or religious dimension, and as dealing only superfi cially with symptoms, instead of curing the (spiritual) causes of illnes ses. This re- production leads to a circular process, being reflected in dis courses, termi- nologies, regulations, professions, social structures, and so on, which simul - taneously condition forms of self-positioning and are shaped by them . In this sense, the differentiation between \"religion\" and \"medicine\" ca n be de- scribed as a social reality that is constantly negotiated, that is, produced a nd dissolved by the actors involved. 1.1.3 The Power of Words Labeling is an important strategy in pursuing such negotiations. Terms such as faith healing, traditional medicine, CAM, biomedicine, and Weste rn med- icine are used in academic publications, as well as in emic discourses. These terms are closely interrelated, and their emergence reflects not only me dical diversity, but also a hierarchical order within this diversity. Ac cording to Klassen (2016: 404), \"[b]iomedicine's overwhelming social, political, and economic authority\u2014and many would argue, its bodily efficacy\u2014is what transforms other, non-biomedical therapeutic approaches into 'alterna tive' or 'complementary' therapies.\" All these terms are controversial, their meaning being conteste d both etically and emically. In environments that display medical divers ity, in which representatives of various therapeutic practices and for ms of knowledge compete for medical authority and claims to power, they take on specific meanings and functions. For example, whereas the label \"faith heal- ing\" may exclude religious therapeutic practices from national health- care systems, \"traditional medicine\" and even \"complementary\" or \"i ntegrative Introduction | 15 medicine\" may allow their inclusion. In this sense, again, the par adigm of differentiated \"medicine\" and \"religion\" conditions strategies of labeling which simultaneously contribute to consolidating this paradigm. Power struggles over medical care are strongly influenced by politic al, legal, or economic structures. As Walter Bruchhausen demonstrates for the concept of \"traditional medicine\" in Tanzania, local, national, a nd interna- tional institutions, such as medical training institutions, health ministri es, or the World Health Organization, provide official definitions of the t erms men- tioned above. These definitions impact upon the legal and economic condi- tions in which therapeutic practices are engaged, as well as upon t heir acces- sibility (cp. Bruchhausen). The possibility of offering therapies that do not comply with the biomedical paradigm of abstaining from religious c laims and interpretations depends upon these basic conditions and their s tructural constraints. Concrete examples of how these terms are applied a nd interre- lated in order to (re-)configure a plurality of medical practice s from different perspectives and to be able to position oneself in relation to this plurali ty are discussed for India, Tanzania, Japan, and Europe in this volume. 1.2 Recogni zing Power Relations and Self -Positionings through the Lens of Differentiation As explained above, the global spread of this differentiation implies that the de-differentiation and entanglement of concepts and practices can be ob- served within the frame of \"differentiated religion and medicine.\" T hus, we can analyze, for example, strategies of self-positioning within the entangle- ment of religion and medicine. This includes actors in medical inst itutions like an anthroposophical hospital or conventional palliative-care war ds, who aim to extend their fields of competence and increase their a gency by includ- ing spiritual-religious concepts and practices (such as spiritual devel opment or aroma therapy) in their medical work (cp. L\u00fcddeckens; Zeugin et al. ). These actors frequently disguise the religious aspects of thera peutic practices by using the label \"spiritual\" in order to avoid possibly negative i mages of religion within a medical context. Another example of de-emphasizing the religious aspects of medical practices is political actors in Tanzania, whose definitions of \" traditional medicine\" aim to re-establish pre-modern medical practices de void of their religious interpretations and ritual elements (cp. Bruchhausen). Sim ilarly, 16 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika practitioners of Ayurveda describe their activities as \"spir itual\" or \"medical,\" depending on the legal conditions of health policies and the needs of p atients (cp. Pattathu). In contrast, religious actors in established traditions may call their ther a- peutic knowledge and practices \"traditional medicine\" in order impl icitly to advocate the pre-differentiation state of entangled religion and medicine, a s is observable, for example, in contemporary Japanese Buddhism (cp. Schrimpf). For the same reason, \"hereditary\" Siddha practitioners oppose the professionalization of their medical tradition (cp. Rageth). Obvious ly, the phrase \"traditional medicine\" can be used to support strategies to both con- solidate and counteract the entanglements of religion and medicine, depend- ing on the respective social and political contexts. Not all strate gies, how- ever, refer to the labeling or use of terms; others may aim to create a specific relationship between religious and medical authority. We will conclude with some general reflections on the second question raised in the beginning: is it acceptable for etic academic re search to make use of concepts (or differentiations) that do not reflect self- perceptions and concepts on the emic level? 2 ETIC APPROACHES TO E MIC PERSPECTIVES: REPRODUCING OR ANALY ZING? At the IAHR conference in Erfurt in 2015 we organized three panels on \"In- novation and Tradition in the Field of Entangled Religion and Medicine .\" These panels were accompanied by heated discussions over the questi on of whether etic academic terminology needs to be aligned with the conceptual - izations and perceptions of the actual actors in the field. One argument in favor of such an alignment can be found in a working paper by Krause et al. (2012) on medical diversity, mentioned above. In it , the authors argue that talking of systems (of medical traditions) obstructs the view of emic conceptions that are characterized by overlapping , mutual in- fluences, etc., and of activities that are guided by the appropriation of various practices to individual needs without distinguishing between religious or medical therapies (ibid: 17-18). In contrast, we argue that it is important to maintain a distin ction between etic and emic perspectives. Academic research should not stop at describing Introduction | 17 emic self -perceptions in the field but should also provide analytical etic sec- ond- and third order observations (cp. Luhmann 1990b). 6 One question at stake is whether it is acceptable to label concepts and practi ces \"religious\" in cases where the respective actors disagree with this classif ication? Is it not the responsibility of the researcher to acknowledge this self-posit ioning and take the emic perspective seriously? 2.1 Emic However, what does \"taking the emic perspective seriously\" mean? Every self-perception is conditioned by particular contexts, for ins tance by economic aspects: for example, health insurance covers the cost of medi- cal treatments, but not religious ones. Some political contexts support self- labeling as non-religious, for example, as part of the public educ ation system, whereas others support self-labeling as religious, for example, to obtain the benefits granted to religious institutions. Besides, prestige is an issue: what does it mean to be viewed as religious in a particular societ y or social milieu, and is it advantageous or not? Also, what kind of positioning does it entail ? Depending on the social milieu, being \"spiritual,\" for example, can have a higher value than being \"religious.\" Therefore, self-perceptions teach us a lot about the contexts in which the respective actors are engaged. Besides, the dependence of self-perc eptions on these conditions illustrates their relativity\u2014that is, percept ions may vary according to the contextual conditions of different actors. In our opinion, this is one reason why the academic perspective of the Study of Religion should not be expected to merely reproduce emic views and self-perceptions. Apart from the relativity of emic pers pectives men- tioned above, which perception should be considered authoritative, that of the specialists or those of ordinary people? For the specialists , a healing prac- tice may be imbued with \"spiritual\" aspects, whereas patie nts may perceive the same practice as purely \"medical\" (cp. Pattathu). Further more, the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6 In many cases we find scholarly reflection in the fi eld itself, fo r example, anthro- posophic medicine, or scientific research on the effects of kanp medicine or Ayurveda by their respective practitioners. 18 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf researcher must be careful not to slip into a paternalistic habitus by portray- ing him- or herself as a spokesperson for the \"emic voice\". 7 2.2 Etic Perspectives The same plurality characterizes etic academic perspecti ves, which are also determined by the specific contextual conditions and frames of ref erence pro- vided by their respective academic disciplines. For example, academ ics make use of reflective concepts that produce specific different iations, such as that between \"religion\" and \"medicine.\" The Study of Religion depends upon such abstract analytical concepts in order to make statements about its topic and be able to conduct comparative research. The relevance of comparison as a basic research m ethod in the Study of Religion has been emphasized from the beginnings of the disc ipline (cp. Wach 1924) to the present day (cp. Freiberger 2018). Only on the basis of comparison can generalized concepts8 be developed and constantly re- vised (or \"rectified\" in Freiberger's terms) in order to make non-exemplary statements about religions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7 This habitus is also a critical topic in various fem inist discourses. For example, Kawahashi and Kobayashi critici ze a patronizing attitude towards women in con- temporary Japanese religions: \"Another issue is the attitude sho wn by some schol- ars of taking non -Western women under their wing, as though somehow ac ting as those women's patron, and there is a danger that suc h attitudes may in effect con- stitute complicity in maintaining patriarchal religi ous structures.\" (Kawahashi and Kobayashi 2017: 3) On the other hand, there are vario us examples of joint author- ship on the basis of a dialogical relationship, cp. L\u00fc ddeckens and Karanjia 2011, and Ari and Jebens 2015. 8 As Mohn explains, when we use the term \"generalized co ncepts, \" we must be aware that \"[u]niversality is always a cultural, linguistic, an d socially constructed claim on 'the general' that can be raised differe ntly even by speakers of a shared cultural And, given the diversity of compared cases, it is impossible to find general terms on a meta -level that correspond to each individual case. Introduction | 19 Another disciplinary framework in the Study of Religion results from the process in which religion as the object of its research is produced. 9 Besides, academic perspectives are strongly influenced by the respective poli tical conditions in which research is conducted: some fields of research are bet ter funded than others, and these trends are constantly changing. All these con- ditions provide framings for academic positions that are quite different fr om those on the emic level. Etic perspectives are therefore deter mined by partic- ular contextual conditions differently from emic perspectives. H ence it is consistent to acknowledge the difference in perspectives without ascribing a higher value to one over the other. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ari, Alex Yapua/Jebens, Holger (2015): Storibuk Pairundu.

Medi calized Healing in Eas t Africa The Separation of Medicine and Religion by Politics and Science Walter Bruchhausen ABSTRACT For centuries, foreign notions of religion and medic ine have divided African forms of healing into religious and medical aspects. This distinction develope d into an institu- tional separation, which has proved problematic for African patients, who expect the previous unity of religious and medical aspects from their healers but are increasingly offered a medicalized, i.e. secular version of \"traditional medicine\" instead. There are different factors contributing to this discrepancy. For orthodox Mus lims, Christian missionaries, and colonial doctors, while the use of herbs was acceptable, rituals con- trolling or addressing spirits mostly was not. Following the Worl d Health Organiza- tion and the concept of \"alternative medicine,\" substances a nd experts came to be regulated by the state or scientifically researched in accordance with \"biomedical \" notions of efficacy and safety. Thus, elements that could be cla ssified as religious by both functionalist and non -functionalist theories of religion were increasingly ex- cluded, first in external perceptions and research, and later in legislation and social reality. 24 | Walter Bruchhausen 1 INTRODUCTION Healing services referring to African traditions are in great demand in sub- Saharan Africa, and national as well as international bodies are trying to reg- ulate and promote the field. This poses the question of whether the demands of the local population and activities on a political level truly r efer to the same thing. The evidence presented in this article suggests that what sick people and their relatives are mostly looking for from such servic es, which they do not find in government health facilities, is related to wha t could be called \"religious\" in most notions of the term. However, interna tional and governmental health policies and scientific activities are domina ted by tendencies to minimize or even exclude precisely such aspects. C oncepts of religion, whose \"use\" here is clarified below, can be regarded a s one of the central criteria in distinguishing between local and national or international views of what African traditions have to offer in treating illness. The fact that internationally and locally organized religion, especia lly \"enchanted Christianity\" in Pentecostalism and charismatic Cat holicism (Gifford 2015: 13-68; 107-124), has taken over much healing in Africa is well known and has been intensively researched. Whereas my previous stud- ies on East Africa have concentrated on the influence of local religious prac- tices and of Christian missions on the development of traditional forms of healing (Bruchhausen 2009), the present contribution will mainly consider the national and international political factors that have change d and even created \"traditional medicine\" as a mainly medical activity, i nstead of the previous practice in which the medical and religious aspects we re fused. The focus will therefore be much more on the \"medicalization\" of hea ling than on its religious reformulation. In a global perspective, the focus on medical- ization is also justified by the fact that, in both national a nd international politics, there were far more forces turning African healing into medicine than into religion. Thus, this article offers a fresh and substantia ted look at the forces that are driving the religious aspects out of the pr actice of \"tradi- tional healers,\" seeking to go beyond the master narrative of an alle gedly irresistible secularization in dealing with disease. This difference between local hopes and practices involving the r eligious aspects on the one hand and the political or scientific interest in minimizing such aspects on the other constitutes the starting point for this st udy. The argument will be substantiated through limited reference to ethnograp hic Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 25 findings in order to illustrate the religious functions in this context and through an extended analysis of documents from different periods and or- ganizations in order to show the various ways in which these functions have been excluded. After an introduction to the terms, methods and materials used, I will summarize the present practice of consulting non-biomedical experts in the region of my ethnographic fieldwork in south-eastern Tanzania. In the following, the difference between the local and the (inter)national will be demonstrated and explained in several ways, since m onocausal views must be dismissed as outdated accounts of complex social processes. In my first explanation I will refer to comparable issues surrounding non-biomedi- cal practices in Europe. For comparison and self-reflection, and to i nduce an awareness of interaction in the sense of an entangled history, curre nt Euro- pean attitudes towards such practices are briefly sketched and rel ated to the situation in East Africa. A second way of explaining the difference between local demand and the political neglect of the religious dimension in healing is to provide a historical account of how European intrusions altered percep- tions and practices during colonial rule. There are different pathw ays to ac- count for the impact of foreign approaches on African healing, scientific re- search, international health policies, and territorial legislation respe ctively. Before political independence, colonial administrators and academ ic re- searchers in both the natural and the social sciences increas ingly noticed and also practiced a distinction between herbal medicine and spiritual prac tices. After Tanzania's independence in 1960, two different new approaches emerged to regulating the development of \"traditional medicine\": the poli- cies of the World Health Organization (WHO) internationally, a nd Tanza- nian national legislation on health professions and \"traditional m edicine\". Thus, studying the influences on healing practices in East Africa m ust in- clude colonial and current legislation, international and national health poli- cies, scientific research and neoliberal commodification. Although these globalized and globalizing influences point towards the increasing f unctional differentiation of such distinct systems as medicine, law, scienc e, education, politics, and religion (Luhmann 1999), these influences have encountered lo- cal resistance, often inspired by global movements, against the st rict func- tional separation of healing and religion, l ike mystical Sufism in Islam and Pentecostalism and other charismatic movements within the mai nstream Christian churches. 26 | Walter Bruchhausen The final section before the conclusion returns to the present, to t he re- cent Traditional and Alternative Medicines Act in Tanzania, an d its impact on the religious aspects of healing. 2 CONCEPTS, METHODS AND DATA Applying terms of European origin and highly contested meanings such as \"religion\" or \"medicine\" to African social phenomena is a ma jor challenge that has long been debated in anthropology, theology, and missionary studies (Dilger et al. 2004). This is especially the case where the impact of c omplex European terms, in this case religion and medicine, constitutes the object of study, as in this article. The only meaningful solution to this epistemic prob- lem seems to be an understanding informed by social constructivism: medi - cine and religion are what they are for the participants in the particular social construction of reality. This implies that, before the introduct ion of te rms expressing the Muslim distinction between tiba and dini (two Swahili words of Arabic origin) or the European distinction between \"medicine\" and \"reli- gion,\" there might not have been anything like such differences for the i n- habitants of the East African coast. However, it would excessi vely ethnocen- tric and arrogant to deny that Africans had what European observe rs called religion and medicine, as in the work of certain theological and scient ific authors in the early colonial period (Bruchhausen/Roelcke 2000), before the debates emerged over concepts like \"primitive religion\" (Evans -Pritchard 1965) and \"primitive medicine\" (Ackerknecht 1942). The dilemma is obvi- ous: subjecting African practices to European definitions could ultimat ely lead to one endorsing the neo-colonialist statement that they do not have such institutions, whereas using only the terms of the particular tra dition would make translation and, especially, cooperation between the representatives of different societies or cultural traditions impossible. Therefore , the path to more shared, globally applicable definitions must be taken, even though i t always risks introducing distinctions not yet known to the society i n question. The debates between universalism and particularism, between l iberalism and communitarianism, in political and moral philosophy revolve precise ly around this dilemma. One of the solutions to this dilemma is to use notions that carry as broad a meaning as possible in the case in question. Thus, in such contexts Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 27 \"medicine\" is not only defined by what medical doctors or the prac tice taught at university does, for which the term \"biomedicine\" has been introduced in anthropology (Bruchhausen 2011a)\u2014it may also refer to any activity t hat deals explicitly or mainly with preventing, diagnosing, and treating illne ss. Although food, physical and mental exercises, and a clean environment might be even more important in preventing illness or recovering from it, they are not regarded as medical in this sense, but rather as related to \"health\". First of all, whether practices like those of East African ritual ex- perts are called \"medicine\" or not depends on the broadness or nar rowness of the definition of \"medicine,\" but in the long run the definition it self may have effects on these practices. For mere reasons of convenience, rather than to emphasize any claim to supposedly proven efficacy, any foundation in biology or any static notion of tradition, the conventional, broadly estab- lished terms \"medicine,\" \"biomedicine,\" and \"traditional medici ne\" and their adjectives will be used in this article. We must be aware, however, that \"med- icine\" and today also \"traditional medicine\" are used by the res pective pro- ponents of these categories and the clients and politicians involved them- selves, whereas \"biomedicine\" mostly remains a term used by externa l aca- demic observers. What is meant by \"traditional medicine\" in the diff erent discourses will remain one of the central questions. \"Healing\" is also occa- sionally used as a term indicating the broader functions of origina lly African activities. Concerning the term \"religion,\" taking a similar approach would mean that some of the classical debates between, for example, funct ionalist and non-functionalist theories (Stausberg 2009; Luhmann 1992: 9-71) or be- tween definitions of religion as personal conviction, faith or experience and as social institution and doctrine (Taylor 2002), are left aside as f ar as possi- ble. In some beliefs and practices in African healing, relating to the s pirits is a subjective experience, as well as a social event and instituti on. Even if deal- ing with disease\u2014the fundamental task of medical systems in funct ionalist definitions\u2014were the primary concern or function of a practice, the tasks of assisting the patient to cope with contingency and of reassuring hi m or her of the existence of a meaningful, trustworthy world could fulfill the function- alist criteria for religion. It could, of course, be argued that any medical prac- tice, including secular biomedicine, entails coping with contingency and re- assures by means of rituals and symbols (such as white coats or stetho- scopes), as several proponents of medical anthropology do indeed argue 28 | Walter Bruchhausen (Helman 2007: 227). Yet these practices lack the open reference to a trans- cendent dimension which is a basic aspect of the concept of re ligion as ap- plied in this article. Contacting invisible personal forces, pra ying for their assistance and making sacrifices to them, as established in mos t kinds of Af- rican healing (Magesa 1998: 188-198), would constitute religious activities in the understanding of most scholars of religion and probably most peo ple in the world. The fact that early Christian missionaries and s cholars called some African practices \"magic,\" \"witchcraft,\" \"superstitio n,\" or \"paganism,\" and thus denied them the status of religion, no longer prevents the present- day use of the term \"religion:\" indeed \"African religion\" is a well-established concept (Mbiti 1969). Nevertheless, such phenomena as sorcery, divination or spirit possession might still, by definition, be excluded from the term \"re- ligion\" by some monotheistic theologians. In African theology (Magesa 1998: 13-35) and religious studies, however, a less dogmatic and narrow notion of what belongs to religion seems to be common. It is precisely this notion that will be applied here. The article starts with a very condensed account of my findings f rom three years (2000-2003) spent studying the situation of medical pluralism in south-east Tanzania ethnographically, which I have described in deta il 2006: 143-295). Interviews and participant obser va- tion in consultations and rituals were conducted in the premises of a bout ninety \"traditional healers\" identified for me by personal recom mendation, the registration lists of the district office and the healers' associati on, the list of participating healers in the workshops of a mission hospital, and finally by inquiring in villages. The same methods were also followed in four gov- ernment and three mission hospitals, as well as some health centers and dis - pensaries. Focus-group discussions in a hospital and on a healer's prem ises and a final survey of more than a hundred households validated the findings. The major research questions were how the experts and patients unde rstood these services and where they saw their strengths and those of others, includ- ing possible reference to other experts. Ethnography forms a suitabl e starting point in attempts to understand all the forces that determine the religious and medical aspects of healing in East Africa. This descriptive approac h, which aims at establishing the \"emic\" understanding, takes into account t he fact that classification into either medical or religious traits is, f rom a certain perspec- tive, a European categorical obsession rather than an identificati on of ele- ments in an ontological sense (Krause, Alex/Parkin 2012). Looking at ac tual Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 29 practices provides an understanding of the local interests and f oreign influ- ences that make possible a deeper study of the dynamics that produce and determine the present situation. It allows us to ask why such clos e relation- ships between needs classified as religious and medical res pectively were deeply changed by the encounter with the overwhelming secularizing mo- dernity of the Global North. Studying international and national impacts on African healing is differ- ent in kind. Doing so has involved the analysis of recent research literature and documents produced by political and administrative authorities, includ- ing the relevant public records in archives in Dar es Salaam, Oxf ord, Kew Gardens (London), and Berlin, as well as contemporary medical and sci en- tific journals and international organizations, especially the WHO. 3 MEDICAL AND RELIGIOU S TRAITS OF HEALING IN CONTEMPORARY TANZ ANIA: ETHNOGRAPH IC FINDINGS The social reality of health-related behavior, probably in most of sub- Sa- haran Africa, and certainly in south-east Tanzania, consists in an enormous variety of options. The majority of experts who can be consulted outside bi- omedicine are referred to as waganga wa jadi in Swahili. Waganga derives from a Bantu verb originally meaning \"connecting,\" but here denoting the performance of special rituals for positive outcomes. The funct ions of the priest in offering sacrifices and relating to invisible personal pow ers, of the magician in divining and protecting against evil forces, and of the healer in caring for the sick were not separated in this concept, which is comm on to large parts of Bantu-speaking Africa and beyond. Today the term waganga on its own can be used for practitioners of both \"traditional\" and \"m odern\" medicine, that is, healers on the one hand and doctors, nurses or ot her bio- medical specialists on the other. Waganga wa jadi refers to the \"traditional sector\" only and is usually translated as \"traditional healer,\" as wa jadi means literally \"of yesterday\" the past\" more generally.1 In particular, as waganga is also used for biomedical practitioners, it has taken on the medical meaning of \"healer.\" The abstract noun uganga still refers to the previous \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 A word like destur i would rather have the connotations of \"tradition\" or \"custom.\" 30 | Walter Bruchhausen broad range of functions. The Arabic term tiba is used for \"medicine\" in a narrow, rather European sense. Tiba ya asili , \"medicine of the origin\" or \"of used for \"mod- ern medicine,\" that is, \"biomedicine\". Thus, if one demands to speak to a mganga [singular of waganga ] wa jadi, one will be probably taken to somebody who practices a type of heal ing. Yet the variety of experts that fall under this name is broad. Some of them, all male, behave in several ways similar to a biomedical doc tor, wearing a white coat, using a stethoscope, and selling pharmaceuticals, although the ir diagnostics do not follow the principles of a clinical examination and labor- atory tests. If these waganga use herbal medicine, it tends to be already pul- verized and issued in small bottles originally used for injections or large con- tainers for tablets, a further reference to biomedicine. Such preparations can also be bought in small shops in towns, where long lists of dis eases and other misfortunes, like problems in marriage, at school or in business, pr omise remedies against them. However, the majority of the waganga wa jadi in southeast Tanzania are female spirit mediums, who, through an initial illness, have been c alled by their spirit(s) to serve, especially in healing. With this type of healer , the use of roots and herbs is embedded in contact with spirits: the spir it gives the diagnosis and shows which remedies are the correct ones. Often these healers become leaders in a kind of religious group in which variations of the tradi- tional night-long drum dances are performed as major rituals intended to sat- isfy the spirit(s). These groups may exhibit different cultural or religious characteristics, some of which, like half-naked dress, the colors of red and black, drum rhythms, songs, and the names of spirits, belong to the African heritage. Under the influence of Islam, others resemble Sufi br otherhoods, with full white dress ( galabia and head scarf), a flag of the prophet, a Koran, dhikr (rhythmic breathing) as incantation, songs without drumming, and sac- rifices without alcohol. The reference to Islamic spirits suppos edly renders the originally \"pagan\" practice lawful for Muslim healers, al though for or- thodox Muslims any dealing with spirits is shirk , religiously forbidden. In the mostly Christian regions, the function of such groups has been taken ov er by independent African churches in which the prophets are healers who also lead long rituals with dancing, trances and glossolalia. Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 31 Rega rdless of religious affiliation\u2014whether originally African, Isla m- ized or Christianized\u2014these consultations and rituals obviously functi on both as religious services in the sense of contact with spiritual for ces and as medical treatment by concentrating simultaneously on health problems. Y et what health problems do they address? At the end of my field resea rch in southeast Tanzania, a questionnaire I had circulated, answered by a hundre d households, clearly revealed local perceptions of the strengths and w eak- nesses of the different services. The results indicated an informal but fa ctual division of labor between biomedicine and \"traditional medicine,\" t he former being more appropriate to the somatic aspect, especially through the im pact of chemical substances and surgery, the latter to the more ps ychic aspect. Yet interestingly enough, scientific and political support for \"traditional medi- cine\" points in a quite different direction that favors the bioact ive substances of medicinal herbs, not coping or healing through rituals. In order to explain this tendency, we must first look at non-biomedical practices of healing in a global and historical perspective. 4 \"TRADITIONAL\" AND \"C OMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE\" MEDICIN E: AFRICA AND THE GLOBAL NORTH 4.1 Non-biomedical H ealing in Africa and Europe Equating African healing with European \"folk medicine\" or \"naturopa thy,\" as various discourses have done since the late nineteenth century, produc ed ambiguous results regarding the religious dimension. The obvious reaso n is that it repeats the variety of Europe's reactions and interpretat ions concern- ing its own healing traditions (Ernst 2000). Conceptions of the foreign m irror one's own preoccupations, in this case negotiating the relationship bet ween religion and medicine in the Global North (Bruchhausen 2011b). The broad current interest in \"traditional medicine\" in Africa would have been quite a surprise to Western observers in previous times. When Europe- ans' descriptions of African health care reached Europe during the colonial period, the general direction of medicine in Europe seemed to be inevitable, a matter of course, to many of the educated: medical science would increas- ingly govern peoples' health-related behavior, as older practices came to be 32 | Walter Bruchhausen regarded as \"medical superstitions\" or existed only in new fringe areas suc h as naturopathy and spiritual healing, in opposition to the sort of medic ine represented in the universities (J\u00fctte 1996). Thus, African healing practices were categorized similarly, that is, as an irrational way of dealing with dis- ease that would soon disappear, or, in some more sympathetic minds, as a possibly more natural and less materialistic way of healing (Bru ch- hausen/Roelcke 2000). Yet in Africa as in Europe, the biomedical approach, despite its undeni- able successes in many areas, did not conquer all areas of health c are equally. The partitioning of the domain of biomedical practitioners and other f orms of medical treatment and their experts, called \"traditional\" for countri es out- side Europe and \"alternative\" for Europe, seems to have converged i n most parts of the world: the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of severe infec- tious diseases, as well as major surgery, are mostly pursued in hospitals and pharmacies; patients with chronic or psychosomatic conditions quit e often prefer to consult practitioners with a less scientific reputation. Given the numbers of patients and the gravity of the health problems c on- cerned, \"traditional medicine\" in African countries is a far more important issue than \"complementary and alternative medicine\" (CAM), as it tends to be called today in the industrialized nations (Moeti 2015). Due to its central role in African societies and to the longer tradition of ethnographic work on non-European situations, academic interest in the non-scientific aspec ts of healing developed in Africa much earlier and more widely than inte rest in the \"folk healing\" of Europe. But in asking how formal state control i nflu- ences non-biomedical practices, industrialized societies, with th eir fully im- plemented administrative structures, may offer some fruitful entr y points to the study of regulatory activities in a globalized world. The term CAM itself \u2014despite its reference to \"medicine\"\u2014does not necessarily imply a preference for either secular notions of scientifi cally ex- plainable effects or a utilization of religious elements such as r eference to a \"spiritual world\". As governmental recognition of CAM is a concessi on to that variously large and heterogeneous part of the population that doe s not accept biomedical monopolism, the academic debate on CAM asks quite dif- ferent questions (Sharma 1992). Is it rather a sign of post-modern \"anything goes\", of disappointment at the unfulfilled promises of biomedicine, of t he \"re-enchantment\" of a secularized world, of the new consumer sovereignty, or of the increasing market-place ideology of health care? All these factors, Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 33 of course, play their role to different degrees. Although the dimensions that refer to spiritual or psychological needs i.e. those discourses t hat address questions of ultimate causation and meaning of illness, will be at the cent er of this study the more economic and political factors underlying the popular- ity of CAM must also be considered. On the whole, these fact ors create an opportunity for interpretations of CAM in terms of both secular me thods based on nature and religious activities. Under the umbrella term C AM, we find anatomy-based practices like osteopathy, the pharmaceutically sophisti- cated system of homeopathy, the \"neo-pagan\" rituals of Wicca, and the Cath- olic approaches to healing of the mediaeval nun Hildegard of Bingen. Dis - satisfaction and liberalization can lead in quite opposite direct ions. On the part of the patients or consumers, there does not seem to be a strong need to distinguish or even separate the material and spiritual components of CAM practices, i.e. the scientifically proven biological effects of substances and procedures on the one hand and the mobilization of healing forces beyond the causality of the sciences. A major aspect of a secular notion, however, is the growing demand for scientific research into CAM's effects that is being sponsore d currently by pharmaceutical enterprises specialized in phytotherapy, foundations de voted to such therapies, and even public sick funds and private health i nsurance companies. Despite its much lower funding compared to research int o other pharmaceuticals or into molecular and cell biology, such studies are a pub- licly visible part of medical research. The economic interest in traditional medicine and CAM is quite obvious and no longer concealed by reference to public service alone, as in earlier WHO documents and ethnographic st udies. On the relevant WHO fact sheet for 2008, one of five \"key facts\" a bout \"tra- form of tra- ditional medicine, generating billions of dollars in revenue\" (WHO 2008). The explanation given later in the text is: \"Herbal treatment s are the most popular form of traditional medicine and are highly lucrative in the inter na- tional marketplace. Annual revenues in Western Europe reached US$ 5 bil- lion in 2003-2004. In China, sales of products totaled US$ 14 billion in 2005. Herbal medicine revenue in Brazil was US$ 160 million in 2007.\" Bef ore the WHO turned its emphasis in this way from saving to making money from \"traditional medicine,\" already in the 1990s in the United State s the Eisen- berg studies showed the high percentage of out-of-pocket expenditure flow- ing into so-called unconventional or alternative medicine (Eisenberg 1993 , 34 | Walter Bruchhausen 1998). National and international bodies, like the European Union or the WHO, try to regulate the production, distribution, and application of herbal remedies. Yet so far, no African international organization, and only a single African state, Ghana, has joined the WHO's organization in this project, the International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines (WHO 2010). There is no WHO collaboration center for traditional medicine in sub-Sa- haran Africa, the only one on the continent being in Khartoum. New na tional legislation for traditional medicine is growing in several Afric an countries, and its effect on healing practices will be studied at the end of this art icle. The overall effect of equating African healing with CAM in industri al- ized nations as implied by, for example, the WHO unit for Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Geneva is its construction and classification a s herbal medicine. Even when \"traditional\" health-related practic es that do not involve substances are studied in clinical trials, African practices are not in- cluded. Whereas acupuncture from the Chinese tradition, yoga from the Ayurveda, the mindfulness exercises of Buddhism, or even trances in sham- anism and Caribbean cults are investigated for their impacts on health, mak- ing a scientific distinction between potentially useful plants a nd rituals not worth clinical study seems to be general when it comes to Afri can healing. The religious or spiritual functions of African healing, such as th e integration of experiences into an overall world view, the resulting motivations to serve others and accept misfortune, are not emphasized by its internati onal and na- tional supporters. Having looked at contemporary situations and tendencies in the non-bi- omedical healing practices of Africa and Europe, we now need t o see how they can be explained by reference to the various historical influe nces which used to favor a biomedical interpretation and the suppression of the reli gious aspects and functions. 4.2 The Impact of Colonialism on the Practice and Perception of African H ealing 4.2.1 The D istinction between the Physical and the Spiritual or Religiou s Aspects of Healing The way healing practices develop in our case\u2014whether they are tie d to or are removed from religion\u2014is, of course, largely determined by the so cial Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 35 institutions that control the field. Both before and during early colonial rule, these institutions worked more closely to the traditions of t he local popula- tion than under the later nation state. Control was exerted in condensed se t- tlements among ethnic or social groups where functional differentiation was low, even in places where centralized kingdoms, colonial administrations or national governments exerted some political control over a larger territory. Before the colonial and later the independent state attempted to assume the regulation of healing\u2014and in many instances long after this, even up until today\u2014communities both large and small ruled such issues. They decided how ill-health had to be approached, what standards of health were accepta- ble or unacceptable, and which kinds of healing should be chosen. Religious features such as contacts with spirits, sacrifices, and reconcil iation were in- dispensable aspects of such healing practices (Sempebwa 1983). The modern state, both colonial and independent, did not feel responsible for African healing traditions in the same way as it did for biom edical ser- vices. This left traditional health expertise in a peculiar s ituation, with less control but also less recognition. But the colonial conquest, accompanied as it was by more Christian missions, ethnographic studies, and preventive as well as c urative medical activities, had changed African healing by introduc- ing fundamental European distinctions: science versus humanities, natur al versus supernatural. Some practices, especially the use of he rbs, were re- garded as acceptable by Christian theology and by doctors, while others w ere denounced as mere \"belief\" or as \"superstition.\" In doing so, the encounter with Europe established a marked difference between those aspect s of Afri- can healing practices that are researched in socio-cultura l studies like anthro- pology and those aspects that are evaluated by scientific investigati on. This distinction affected politics and administration, criminal law, and the popu- lation concerned in both early and more recent settings. Thus, this dif ference must be considered central to all the discourses being examine d here, even though\u2014or perhaps because\u2014it is certainly a product of colonial categor i- zation. This distinction between the physical and spiritual or religious aspects is also essential for a nuanced assessment of present-day claims in Tanzania that \"traditional medicine\" had been forbidden under colonial rule but has now been legalized. This prompts us to ask which parts and aspect s had been opposed then but are being promoted today, a differentiation in which th e separation between the physically effective and more religious constituents 36 | Walter Bruchhausen of African healing has the central function. The common view of semi- offi- cial statements and published opinion is that it is only since 1968 tha t \"tradi- tional medicine\" has been politically accepted in Tanzania, th at it had been suppressed earlier, and that official recognition of the potentia l of \"traditional medicine\" is a necessary compensation for colonial injustice (Goergen et al. 2001: 4). This poses the question of how much of this generalizing st atement is due to the African nationalist rhetoric that has dominated p ublic discourses for several decades, and how much of it can be substantiated by evi dence. What did colonial rule want to do, and what did it do to African ways of healing? Here the definition of what counts as \"traditional me dicine\" be- comes crucial. If one takes the broad meaning of an anthropological approach\u2014that is, attempts to arrive at an \"emic\" view referring to the notions and functions of the tradition al experts in their own society\u2014colonial rule has been certainly disastrous for the African population's ability to cope with all kinds of afflic- tion, including ill-health. The role of these experts went far beyond private problems: they also judged certain general developments within their com- munity to be dangerous and initiated counter-measures, such as the exc lusion or reconciliation of allegedly harmful individuals (\"witches\") and even up- risings against the colonial rulers in cases of unbearable colonial burdens like new taxes or other orders. Motivating or even leading resistance by m eans of prophetic messages such as liberation from the evil of coloniali sm with the assistance of spiritual forces, especially in the Maji Maji w ar, brought these ritual experts into violent conflict with the colonial rulers and l ed to their persecution, including even their execution by hanging (Beez 2005). How and how deeply colonial agents and actions destroyed the traditional ways of preserving and restoring health have been demonstrated by Steven Fei erman (1986: 206-210) with interesting examples showing that many health- related functions of the pre-colonial authorities among the Shambalaa-speaki ng peo- ple in northeast Tanganyika were forcibly brought to an end without rel evant substitutes being made available. If, however, one starts from the much narrower, biomedical notion of \"traditional medicine\" that most African politicians and offi cials also refer to today, the extent of the colonial-era destruction must necessar ily be judged differently. In this perspective on the treatment and preventio n of disease, one would have to distinguish\u2014as both colonial and modern legislation does\u2014therapeutic practices related to medicinal plants from the use of spirits Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 37 and the fighting of \"witchcraft,\" as colonial discourses constructed practic es of controlling 2011: 46-57; 2007). In this per- post-colonial impacts on the spiritual- psychother- apeutic and herbalist aspects of the healers' activities were both qui te differ- ent. When waganga were banned and persecuted, it was their function as political or religious authorities that was the issue of conc ern, especially their social, moral, and religious importance as experts in the manageme nt of af- fliction by detecting the guilty; that is, by \"witch-finding,\" which wa s for- bidden by the Witchcraft Ordinance of 1928, still in force today (Mes aki 2009, Tanzania 1998). Yet how did the Witchcraft Ordinance affect tr adi- tional healing? Was it meant to suppress all \"supernatural\" a ctivities indis- criminately, or was it applied to troubles only? At least in southeast Tanganyika, the British administration trie d to apply the Witchcraft Ordinance in accordance with local public opinion. Ini tially, it did not feel that punishing witch-finders was absolutely necessary in ord er to prevent the exploitation of what they regarded as a credulous populat ion. Some years later, in the 1930s, and contrary to the wording of the Witchcraft Ordinance (Cole/Denison 1964: 254-255), the Provincial Commissioners were inclined to distinguish between \"benevolent witchcraft\" or the \"b enev- olent removal of witchcraft\" on the one hand and \"uchawi\" as \"black art\" on the other (Guise Williams 1933; Kitching 1937). In 1933 a n Assistant District Officer in Liwale requested that th erapeutically acting \"witch doctors\" should not be imprisoned, even if a lethal outcome could be attributed to their practice, as long as they did not cause any socia l trouble (Beck 1970: 140). Some years later, even the Colonial Office in L ondon raised the necessity of distinguishing between allegedly benevolent a nd de- structive \"witchcraft\" (Keith 1938: 2). This attitude seems to have become the prevailing British policy in the south of Tanganyika, as can be seen in the recently published autobiography of a former district officer in Lindi and Masasi in the late 1950s. He notes major differences between the wording of the ordinance and the local administrative practice of its application: \"The offici al view of witchcraft was embodied in the Witchcraft Or dinance; I do not recollect whether it was the law itself or the practica l interpretation thereof which was curiously ambiguous and liberal, but it was one or the ot her. White magic or uganga , in effect \"traditional medicine\" employing herbal remedies and psychology, tended to be beneficial and therapeutic even though accompanied by a great deal of mumbo -38 | Walter Bruchhausen jumbo and theatre, and was acceptable. [Then he gives examples of its use by British officers, inclu ding the famous police investigations by Nguvumali.] Witchcraft or uchawi however was another matter, and anyone who purported to practice it or who maliciously accused others of doing so, was liable t o severe penalties in addition to almost certain banish ment to a remote part of the country; such w as the strength of superstition \u2014or belief.\" (Barton 2004: 142) Concerning the restricted European or biomedical notion of \"medicine,\" ac- cording to which \"medicine\" comprises measures intended for the good of an individual only, the British administration was guided by the approbation of the local population and tolerated the practice of \"employing herbal re m- edies and psychology.\" However, when it came to the much broader Afr ican concept of what ritual experts are responsible for, which includes accusing and fighting witches, local support for counter-magic was not recognized by the representatives of the colonial state. Therefore, it can be c oncluded that the general destruction of \"traditional medicine\" had obviously not been the intention of colonial officers who had to enforce the Witchcraft O rdinance in the south of Tanganyika: it was only directed against witch-finding, not against the treatment of the sick. Nevertheless, this ordinance has certainly destroyed much of what anthropologists would consider the previous cultura l or social system related to health. It marked the transition fr om a pre-colonial system in which traditional authorities fought all those who were percei ved as threatening the well-being of the community to a colonial s ystem that made distinctions according to the functional systems of modern We stern societies, here \"law\" and \"medicine\". Given this separation of the \"medical\" aspect from the other pr evious functions of ritual experts, it could be argued that the effect s of the Witchcraft Ordinances did not destroy \"traditional medicine\" but actually cre ated it by medicalizing it. Rituals for treating the sick were acceptabl e to the admin- istration, but rituals leading to accusations against others wer e not. Beyond the administration's acceptance of herbal medicine, the applic ation of the Witchcraft Ordinances declared even rituals referring to the \"supernatural\" lawful as long as the purpose was restoring or preserving health\u2014and doing so without causing social conflict. At least some of the religious functions of traditional healing, like placating sacrifices and incantations to angry ance s- tors or other spirits, although not previous practices like fighting evil human beings, could be allowed to survive in the eyes of the colonial rulers. Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 39 4.2.2 The Impact of Scientific Interest in the Tanzanian Context Regarding those activities of waganga wa jadi , the \"traditional healers,\" that the Tanzanian state seeks to promote and legalize today, mainly the appl ica- tion of herbal knowledge, there have never been any government attempts to prohibit them. This is even one area where the institutions importe d from Europe showed more than just tolerance for African healing, one whe re herbal medicines were also actively promoted, reflecting a mar ked prefer- ence for the material over the spiritual aspects. During and after Ger man co- lonial rule such knowledge was investigated with government support and regarded as potentially valuable (Bruchhausen/Roelcke 2000: 78-83). As fa r back as 1895, the director of health services in German East Afric a, Dr Al- exander Becker, had called on his widely dispersed medical officer s to study native healing methods, including \"devil dances,\" but mainly for them to send in specimens of medicinal plants (Becker 1896: 647-48). In 1969, in a similar circular to the Regional Medical Officers, the Tanzania n Chief Med- ical Officer in the Ministry of Health requested \"research into indigenous methods of therapeutics\" to be conducted (Institute of Traditional Medicine ca. 2002: 2), thus following the model of his first colonial predecess or, prob- ably without realizing it. Only an initiative of the medical fac ulty of the na- tional university five years later led to the permanent instit utionalization of such research through the establishment of a Traditional Medicine Research Unit divided into the five sections of botany, chemistry, pharmacology, so- cial anthropology, and clinical evaluation. As can be seen from the lab els for these sections, the major tasks of this institution were the collection and s ci- entific or medical investigation of medicinal plants and the study of other functions of \"traditional healers\". Whereas, after the unit's pro motion to an institute in 1991, \"Botany and Agronomy,\" \"Pharmacology and Toxicol- ogy,\" and \"Chemistry of Natural Products\" became departments of the ir own, social anthropology remained something of an appendix. The scientific reason for this focus seemed obvious in the East African dis course, as one Kenyan pharmacist succinctly expressed it: \"Traditional medicine , whether involving the supernatural or not, depends very much on the use of plants\" (Tessema 1980: 48-54). The WHO African Regional Office in Congo Braz- zaville is especially keen on reformulating African healing as h erbal medi- cine within the WHO's Traditional Medicine Strategy. 40 | Walter Bruchhausen Whereas national research and the promotion of \"traditional medi cine\" both focus on herbal medicine, the ritual dimension did not remain com - pletely unconsidered. Here, however, the main approach was to define this area as involving a cultural, and neither a medical nor a reli gious heritage. Thus, at the beginning of the 1980s the Tanzanian Ministry of Culture pro- moted the relevant drumming rituals in public by organizing competiti ons and studying songs and dances (Janzen 1992: 25). This was facilitated by the fact that the drum dances overlap to a certain degree, whethe r for pleasure, celebrations, or protection and healing. Not only do they have the gene ral name of ngoma in common, which can be qualified by adding phrases like ya majini (for spirits) or ya kutibu (for healing) as religious or medical. The kind of music and dance and the musicians involved can also be regarded as largely similar and/or even as the same. The only elements spec ific to healing were the shape of the drums, the costumes, and other symbols, and of course the texts and the individual melodies and rhythms. Yet not only ngoma , but also waganga were in principle officially assigned to the government's cul- tural sector instead of to medicine or religion. Up until the recent legal change, their registration was with the District Cultural Of ficer ( Afisa utuma- Afisa afya ), or else they were registered as religious congregations. Until 2002, too, it was the Cultural O ffice that issued permits to practice as a mganga after payment of the obligatory annual fee. Summing up our findings on the influence of colonial as well as post- colonial administration and research, what today the WHO and nationa l pol- iticians call \"traditional medicine\"\u2014mostly a kind of naturopathy\u2014has not been administratively suppressed in East African countries, but in light of public demand it has been tolerated and even promoted. Yet, regarded as a whole, the precolonial sociocultural and religious function of healing has cer- tainly been disrupted, especially by the activities of colonial state s and Chris- tian missions against those ritual experts who acted as politi cal leaders, witch -finders or traditional priests. The difference between spea king of a whole social institution, such as the public protection of well-being, a nd looking at different kinds of healing practices is decisive in judging t he de- structive effects of the clash between African societies and the colonial state. The pre-colonial social system, where notions of the common good (includ- ing health and good relations with spirits) were widely shared between the general population and the authorities, had to give way to the rule of a Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 41 government with functional systems (including public health and medicine) whose experts tried to convince people of the validity of their releva nt mes- sages and institutions. Thus, this transition from a purely African, often et h- nically restricted healing and health maintenance system, which was an in- separable part of a religiously constituted social order and world view, to the situation in the colonial and independent state characterized by massive Eu- ropean influence was not just a matter of a change in the r uling elite. Regu- lating healing experts and health was no longer just a local ma tter of clans, villages or ethnic groups\u2014it acquired a geographically and socially much wider, though more focused dimension which had to deal with nationwide or even global functional systems like science, medicine, and law . The national and international agendas on health entered local choices and decision-mak- ing even in a field such as this that touched on questions of cultural and reli- gious identity. 4.3 The Impact of International and N ational Health P olicies 4.3.1 WHO Policies on Traditional Healers and M edicine: Using Healers or Integrating Indigenous K nowledge? Whereas for the colonial and post-colonial state the main reason for t olerat- ing African healing, including its religious components, had been politi cal expediency\u2014namely respecting the wishes of the population\u2014 the WHO had a different motivation that resulted in yet another concept of \"tr aditional medicine.\" And, as in the case of the questionable colonial suppressi on of \"traditional medicine,\" the usual narrative concerning the WHO's relation- ship with \"traditional medicine\" must also be questioned, or at le ast distin- guished. This common view of the WHO's policy on \"traditional medicine\" seems to be that, since the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978 proclai ming \"Health for all\u2014by the Year 2000\" (WHO and UNICEF 1978), \"traditiona l medicine\" should be integrated into national programs of primary health c are (PHC). A closer reading of the declaration, however, tells a different story, as it speaks of the use of \"traditional practitioners\" within biomedica lly con- ceived programs only, not of the use of \"traditional medicine\" as a potential healing resource. While the first suggests complete subjection to 42 | Walter Bruchhausen biomedicine, the second could entail religious functions such as the incanta- tion of personal invisible forces as well. The only section in the Declaration of Alma Ata that mentions the tradi- tional sector argues that \"traditional medical practitioners a nd birth attend- ants\" should be recruited as \"important allies\" even as \"com munity health workers\" through \"training\" (WHO and UNICEF 1978: 63). It ex- plicitly argues the \"high standing\" and \"considerable local influ- ence\" of these persons\u2014that is, the esteem they enjoy among the general public\u2014could be used in PHC. This was in accordance with a previous re s- olution of the World Health Assembly (WHA) of 1976, which encoura ged \"the development of health teams trained to meet the health n eeds of popu- lations, including health workers for primary health care, and taking into ac- count, where appropriate, the manpower reserve constituted by t hose prac- ticing traditional medicine\" (WHA 1976). Related to this medical attempt to integrate healers are some studies in medical anthropology that tri ed to dis- tinguish two types of healing (Foster/Anderson 1978: 53-65; Young 1983). One, the \"internalizing\" or \"naturalistic\" type that recognized t he relevant pathological processes within the body and treated them accordingly\u2014for example, with herbal medicines\u2014was judged compatible with state m edi- cine. The other, the \"externalizing\" or \"personalistic\" type, id entified evil forces outside the individual as causing the illness and sought to counter them by means of magical objects, rituals and prayers. The practitio ners of such forms of healing were to be left outside the governmental healt hcare system, as their world view did not recommend them for co-operation. In anthropol- ogy, it could still be debated whether pure examples of each type exist at a ll, but the distinction as such was certainly influential\u2014not only in health poli- cies\u2014and it contributed to the dichotomy between medicine and religion in academic, political, and public perceptions. As the anthropologist Robert Pool noted, this anthropological conceptualization was part of a major shift from religion to medicine: the same experts, rituals, and object s that had ear- lier been studied by the anthropology of religion were now often investigate d by medical anthropologists (Dilger et al. 2004). However, the attempt to use traditional practitioners as mainl y preventive health-workers without government pay proved illusory. These plans on the part of the biomedical experts who dominated the Alma Ata Declara tion mostly failed since communities were not ready to respect and pay healers for biomedically designed preventive medicine, and in any case the maj ority Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 43 of healers rejected being placed at the bottom of a hierarchical national healthcare system in place of their former independent authority a nd w ere thus saved from being incorporated into a completely medicalized se tting. Such incorporation would have probably meant the end of any ritual acti vity, whereas avoiding close supervision by biomedical functionaries preserve d spaces for religious functions. At about the same time, politicians from countries with strong poli tical concepts and institutions of \"traditional medicine\" that entered into their na- tional identities, especially China and India, convinced the WHO to adopt a policy on \"traditional medicine\" itself. This policy was not related to he alth policies in general, nor to other health programs, and therefore the impor tant spiritual or religious dimension could have been accepted. However, the op- posite tendency became quite influential instead, that is, the de finition of tra- ditional medicine as the administration of substances. The fi rst relevant doc- ument of the WHA on traditional medicine, dated 1978, focused on m edici- nal plants (WHA 31.33). In 1989, another resolution on \"traditional medi- cine\" elaborated research into medicinal plants and their regulati on (WHA 1989). Two years later, the WHA demanded a \"substantial increase in na- tional and international funding and support [...] to enable 'traditional med- icine' to take its rightful place in health care,\" as well as \"the use of s cientif- ically proven, safe and effective traditional remedies to reduce nationa l drug costs\" (WHA 1991). Medicinal plants were at the heart of the strategy on \"traditional medicine.\" When, in the mid-1990s, the two strands, namely the use of traditional healers in a strongly preventive biomedical healthcare system and the u se of \"traditional medicine\" as a curative resource, merged, the role of herbal med- icine in programs was strengthened further. The revitalization of training schedules for \"traditional practitioners,\" promoted by the WHO in the 1990s and still referring to their use as \"primary health care worker s\" (WHO 1991), demonstrates a characteristic shift in the curriculum: those aspec ts that refer directly to traditional herbal medicine, such as the secure identifi cation and hygienic storage of herbal remedies, receive attention first. A ctions such as referral to hospital or supervising the construction and use of latrines\u2014that is, the classic tasks of the village h ealth -worker\u2014come last in the list of sub- jects on training courses (WHO 1995: 64-65). In the WHO's \"traditi onal medicine strategy 2002-2005\" (WHO 2005), it was the aim of promoting 44 | Walter Bruchhausen \"traditional medicine\" as a therapeutic resource for natural r emedies, not of using its manpower in PHC, that received the most visible expression. Thus, it can be said that the turn to the PHC policy since the 1970s cer- tainly did not promote African healing in all its aspects, as it favored those elements that were regarded as compatible with science-based medic ine and ignored those others that were regarded as depending on thinking attributed to the realm of religion. Therefore, medical development experts e ven warned that integration into the national healthcare system would lead to the \"destruction of traditional medicine\" (Diesfeld 1989: 90-91). If one w anted to save African healing from losing its overall importance for the population, the option of leaving \"traditional medicine\" as far as possible o ut of the ad- ministrative and judicial system and trusting local mechanisms o f social con- trol instead had much to commend it. 4.3.2 East African Legislation: Local and National Control of \"Traditional M edicine\" Given the importance of local criteria for local practice, the way the colonial and later the independent state regulated African healing combined c ontrol at the local and governmental levels. In doing so, at least in theory, the inter- est of the population in services close to their own religious traditions could be made compatible with the obligation of the state to protect its citizens against harmful practices. Following the example of Western countri es from medieval or early modern times, government responsibility for health was especially a matter of the legal status of health practit ioners.2 The relevant measures were introduced in the British mandated territory in 1937 with the Medical Practitioners and Dentist Ordinance Act, the first l egal regulation of the health professions, modelled after European legislation. This Ac t forbade any medical practice without registration or license, but explicitly exempted such persons whose expertise in healing was acknowledged by their respec- tive communities and whose healing activities were confined to their com- munities (Tanganyika Territory 1937: 409). Thus, the Act did not qualify th e method of healing as natural or \"supernatural,\" but took the assessm ent of the local community as the decisive criterion regarding the qualif ication of practitioners. In 1963, the legislation of the independent state did not alter \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2 For the same aspect in the context of India see Rageth, this volume. Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 45 the section on local medicine and merely changed the reference t o colonial institutions such as \"the Crown,\" \"Director of professionals\" (Tanganyika 1963). Yet there is s ubstantial reason to doubt whether this official \"restriction on traditional healing,\" which confined it to a local practice, had been enforced in all the dec ades that followed up until new legislation was passed in 2002 (Harrington 1999: 226). In 1976 the regional Africa office of the WHO in Brazzaville als o defined a traditional healer as \"a person who is recognized by the communi ty in which he lives as competent to provide health care by using vegetable, ani- mal and mineral substances and certain other methods based on the social, cultural and religious background\" (WHO 1978: 9). The reference to prac- tices that do not rely on substances and physical intervention is remarkable but remained without consequence for WHO policies on Africa. The special legal arrangement for \"a system of therapeutics according to l ocal methods [...] in a bona fide practice\" was also set out in Tanzania's Pha rmaceutical and Poisons Act of 1978 (Tanzania 1978, Part VI, 68 [1]). The following regulation, however, emphasized explicitly that it does not give pe rmission to produce and/or distribute substances to persons outside the respect ive community, to sell or supply lethal quantities or preparations, or to add self- manufactured substances to any preparations of other systems of t reatment. Thus, the goal was still that traditional remedies should only be accept ed as local practices subject to the immediate judgement of local civil soci ety. Only after the launch of these WHO programs for \"traditional medici ne\" (WHO 1987: 149-51) did this rather defensive legislative approach change slightly, culminating in Tanzania's Traditional and Alternative Medicines Act of 2002, which paved the way to the active promotion and regulation of \"traditional medicine.\" The old rule that there has to be a relationship with a local public was partly maintained in as much as under this new law a \"tra- ditional health practitioner\" is defined as \"a person who is reco gnized by the community in which he lives as competent to provide health care\" ( Tanzania 2002: 3). This also allows such practitioners to practice religious ways of healing if the community regards this as adequate. However, the old re- striction on practicing healing in one's own community alone is now o mitted as long as the other regulations are respected. For like the so-ca lled \"alterna- tive health practitioner\" (with formal training in the res pective therapeutic system), now the \"traditional health practitioner\" is also al lowed (i.e. without 46 | Walter Bruchhausen formally recognized training) to practice country-wide and in all groups , pro- vided the appropriate official permission has been granted (Tanzani a 2002: 21). Where there are strong ties to local religion\u2014perhaps in the f orms of ethnically bound spirits\u2014shrines fixed to a grave or prayers in a loc al lan- guage, these forms are likely to disappear in cases of healing far from hom e. The old practice of healing outside one's own ethnic and religious group, which rapidly increased with urbanization and growing mobility, is now en- couraged even by law. The official governmental view, as expressed by the person responsibl e in the Ministry of Health, is that the new law of 2002 has taken the \"tradi- tional healer\" and visits to him or her out of the \"underground,\" from being \"most [...] an illegal thing\" (Langwick 2011: 74). In contrast thi s the local population's experience\u2014as a subaltern perspe c- tive\u2014was somewhat different, as even before the new Act heale rs' activities and consultations had been quite public, especially for those who had p aid their registration fee to the district office, but also for most others, far from the feeling of doing anything illegal. Especially in the case of drum ming and dancing performed as a group in order to please certain spirits as pa rt of heal- ing rituals, there is no evidence that it was ever felt to be illegal. In addition to legalizing the existing tendencies towards even more spa- tial mobility within traditional medicine, the legal and adminis trative regula- tion of \"traditional medicine\" also continues changes that had alr eady been taking place for some decades. The aspect of biomedicalization has been already dealt with. Profession- alization is the final topic to be discussed here. As Feier man (1986: 205-6, 210-12) noted, the professionalization of \"traditional medicine\" strengthens the importance of such healers, who mainly treat strangers for ma terial gain as a business, while at the same time reducing the role of those \"care-givers\" for \"altruistic healing,\" who mostly treat relatives and neighbor s free of charge as a kind of religious service and who used to carry out t he greatest part of health care. In southeast Tanzania, the composition of the members of the healers' association, CHAWATIATA (Chama cha Waganga wa Tiba Asilia Tanzania ), according to a list of 1053 names, does not at all reflect the actual care given (Nampyali, 16. 11. 2001 ).3 Thus, the wagariba , the experts \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 Interview with B. M. Nampyali, Secretary of CHAWATIATA (Chama cha Waganga wa Tiba Asilia Tanzania ). Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 47 in circumcision who themselves say that they do not heal and are not sought for healing, form a considerable proportion of the members' list, whe reas female spirit mediums, who are more than 80% of those who are call ed waganga wa jadi or waganga wa kienyeji by the people, are found in the list less often. Unregistered healers of this sort who have a rather spiritual focus will increasingly be excluded from any informal network of healers, as \u00a7 36 (1) of the Act says that registered traditional health practitioner s must not \"allow, associate or otherwise cause a person who is not registered as such to practice as traditional or alternative health practitioner\" (apart fr om aides). Thereby, the once common referral of patients to those experts who are r egarded as better or even exclusively suited to a specific problem, such as posse ssion of the patient by a certain spirit, is no longer allowed if these he alers are not registered. At this point, the national public interest that the democ ratically elected government claims to represent is at odds with a religi ous practice approved by local publics in the interests of the individuals concerned. Th e orderly professionalization of healing is not compatible with the motivati on and practice of most spirit mediums who regard their call by a spirit, their initiation into rituals and secrets involving spirits, as well as their service to a community believing in these spirits, rather in religious terms. Finally, it can be asked how the recent Tanzanian Traditional and Alter- native Medicines Act of 2002 should be qualified\u2014as accepting all aspec ts of healing, including the religious dimension, or as a further medicali zation of it? Here the role of the market becomes central. As the Tanzanian Minister of Health, Anna Margareth Abdallah, mentioned in her 2002/2003 budget speech, the health sector reforms of the 1990s had among thei r goals \"pub- lic/private mix reforms such as encouragement of private sector to comple- ment public health services\" (Abdallah 2002). There was no hint in the offi- cial texts at that time that \"traditional medicine\" should be one of the se pri- vate services complementing the public sector, yet the new climate was ce r- tainly favorable to the idea of greater freedoms for traditional healers. Some expected that legal acknowledgement would give such healers great er inde- pendence from biomedicine, which could provide opportunities to increase the visibility of the religious dimension in healing. The actual development, however, seems to point in another direction, namely towards even greater similarity with biomedical practitioners. There is the desire that in East Af- rica traditional healers should be given professional biomedical pri vileges 48 | Walter Bruchhausen that non-biomedical practitioners in other regions have already ac hieved, such as being financed by private health insurance and sometimes even by public sick funds, as in some European countries, or being able to certify the need for sick leave, as in South Africa. It would be the mater ial rather than the symbolic power that would be strengthened by such achievements. This new status of \"traditional medicine\" as a modern privat e practice rather than a traditional public service certainly also changes the heal er's re- lationship with his or her patients and the spirit world. Moreover, it has an impact on the less professionalized ways of and experts in tradit ional healing who still practice without substantial financial gain and withi n the commu- nity of a quasi-religious cult group. At this point, the approach that tre ats \"traditional healers\" as a liberal profession might come into c onflict with other, quite different arguments in favor of traditional healing. For, on the other side of the dialectics of \"glocalization,\" those who advoca te traditional healing as part of an African revival\u2014as a constituent of a tr uly African iden- tity\u2014are usually not in favor of neoliberal globalization but emphasize rather the local, social and cultural integration of healing, not its autonomy fr om public administration. For such \"traditionalists,\" the new professi onal oppor- tunities for \"traditional medicine\" may further loosen their l ast ties with a former understanding of healing that saw illness often caused by invisible personal forces and treatment as negotiation with these forces. Both these approaches to enhancing the \"traditional\" by giving it profes- sional autonomy, as well as through its social (re-)integration, ret urns us to the question of the social practices separating those functions that are cov- ered by the two functional systems of medicine and religion in more func- tionally differentiated societies. How should healing be approach ed le- gally\u2014by applying the criterion of scientific and professional knowledge , or by referring to pure consumer choice? In fact, the public regulation and em- powerment of traditional health practitioners according to the new Tanzanian Act does not go much beyond the colonial legislation, which already left the decisive role to local publics. This kind of social control leaves a space for versions of religious healing within \"traditional medicine.\" Hos pitals built by successful traditional healers for their clients,4 where communal prayers, rituals with the healer or meditation in a holy place occupy the day for the temporary residents, rather resemble or even constitute the s orts of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4 An example fo r such a hospital is that in Mwera, southeast Tanzania. Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 49 congregations or monasteries that are known from old or new religions in several parts of the world. The spirit mediums can combine their roles as cult leaders and healers without much interference from the political administr a- tion. But, as a pure herbalist without any reference to a religious world view falls under the same Act as the keeper of a holy place or a spirit medium of the sort just mentioned, they are all officially labeled \"medical.\" While ear- lier colonial and national legislation merely exempted them all from medical registration, the new legislation requires that they all be r egistered with the medical office. 5 CONCLUSION Practices li ke the incantation of spirits, sacrifices to them or explaining ill- ness with reference to their activities\u2014practices that would b e classified by most observers of today as \"religious\" in other contexts\u2014constitute the prob- ably most important part of what is consulted as \"traditional m edicine\" in present-day Tanzania, but not of what, under this term, is regula ted by na- tional or international health authorities and investigated by scientific re- search. This equivocal use of the term led to the question of how this present relationship between the functions of medicine and religion was s haped by the various influences of encounters with people and powers from outside Africa. Nearly all these influences favored a separation of heali ng practices from their religious contexts and understanding. Doctors and scientists were mainly interested in bioactive substances, colonial and post-independe nce administrators were concerned to suppress possible social unrest arising from ritual practices, and Islamic and Christian experts tried to f ree healing from allegedly \"pagan\" ideas. In this study, two common notions about the foreign treatment of \"tradi- tional medicine\" have been questioned and disproved by means of furthe r differentiation of what is meant by \"traditional medicine\": it s alleged colo- nial suppression, and its supposed acknowledgment in the Declaration of Alma Ata on Primary Health Care of WHO and UNICEF. By distinguishing the social, mental, and religious functions from the physically eff ective means and practices, the commonalities between the attitudes of colonial ad- ministrations, Christian missions, the WHO, and independent governme nts are shown to be more marked than the differences: none of them 50 | Walter Bruchhausen wholeheartedly embraced the ritual and symbolic side of \"tradi tional medi- cine\", but at best tolerated it, whereas they all expressed a much greater in- terest in the bioactive substances of herbal remedies. It was the less orthodox versions of cosmopolitan religion, the S ufi or tariqat traditions of Islam and Pentecostal, Zionist, or charismatic C hristian- ity, that opened up spaces for the adaptive survival of healing practic es re- lated to spirits and the countering of evil forces. Other healing experts orga- nized their adapted rituals without obvious ties to a monotheistic religion. I n either way, local wishes to keep the experience of ill health related to the experience of an invisible world of helpful and hostile beings find thei r sat- isfaction in new groups that have replaced the former ritual co mmunity of clans or settlements. Religious connotations of healing are now also pre sent in many of the more commercialized and individualized encounters betw een healers and clients. But the very facts that all these experts are now registered with the district medical offices in accordance with national l egislation on \"traditional and alternative medicine,\" are being investigate d by scientific researchers interested in herbal medicine and are being contac ted by biomed- ical institutions for cooperation on certain health issues indicat e and strengthen their overriding inclination towards medicine.

Medical Discourses and Practices in Contemporary Japanese Religions Monika Schrimpf ABSTRACT In contemporary Japan, many re ligious actors engage in therapeutic practices with the intention of curing or preventing disease, whether in new religious movements and the Japanese New Age, in folk religion or in \"established religions\" ( kisei shky). Notwithstanding the prominent rol e of Buddhist scriptures, temples, and priests in medical practice and knowledge in premodern Japan, th e introduction of a public healthcare system in the Meiji era (1868 -1912) based on German medicine resulted in a functional and institutional differentiation between medicine a nd religion. There- fore, the question arises how contemporary religious act ors offering therapeutic prac- tices can legitimize their actions and position themselves in Jap anese society. By choosing the example of a Nichiren -Buddhist pri est's concepts of Buddhist medicine and Buddhism as medicine, as well as healing practices in a new religion called Per- fect Liberty Ky dan, two strategies of legitimizing and positioning t herapeutic prac- tices in the religious field will be described: the s cientification of religious practice, and code -switching between the semantic fields of medicine and religion. 1 INTRODUCTION This article explores possible ways in which contemporary religious actors whose religious traditions used to comprise medical or therapeut ical tech- niques, react to a social and political environment in which religions are\u2014 at 58 | Monika Schrimpf least on a political level\u2014deprived of medical authority. How can they legit- imize engaging in therapeutical activities intended to cure or preve nt disease, and how do they position themselves in a society where religion and medi- cine are functionally and institutionally differentiated? More s pecifically, the strategies introduced here illustrate religious responses to the relevance as- signed to science in the process of medicalization,1 i.e., to the replacement of religious views of man, body and illness by scientific models of physiologi- cal processes and conceptualizations of the human body as a multipartite or- ganism. These strategies are not representative of Japanese religions in ge n- eral; rather, they serve to illustrate possible ways in whi ch religious actors make use of the alleged superiority of science-based medicine i n order to legitimize their therapeutical activities and consolidate the social status of their religious community. Although in premodern Japan, medical knowledge and practice were an indispensable part of Japanese Buddhism, public healthcare in contem porary Japan is provided primarily by biomedical institutions and experts w hose sci- entific training and licensing is regulated by secular law. T his medical system rests not only on the development of biomedical knowledge, practices, and institutions since the introduction of German medicine in the Meij i era (1868-1912), it also includes kanp medicine or \"Japanese traditional herbal medicine\", the Japanese adaptation of Chinese medical traditions.2 Whereas in the late Edo (1603-1868) and early Meiji eras kanp medicine was the main seiy ijutsu cp., for example , Conrad 2007; Foucault 1973. Conrad provides a short definition of the term: \" Mecicaliza tion' describes a process by which nonmedical problems become defined and treated as medical problems, usually in terms of illness and disorders.\" (2007: 4). 2 Literally, kanp means \"methods from Han -China\" (206 BC -220 AD). Chinese medicine was introduced to Japan in the fifth centur y in the wake of the spre ad of Buddhism to the country. Kanp medicine developed its specifically Japanese form during the Edo period (1603 -1868), when the number of crude drugs used in decoctions was reduced to approximately 250 herbal plants and formulae, and Yoshimasu Td (170 2-1773) developed a particular abdominal palpation method ( fukushin ) for diagnosis. He also emphasized the practical, symp tom-ori- ented focus of medical practice and de -emphasized the underlying theoretical concepts of the five phases, Yin and Yang etc . (Watanabe et al. 2010). 'Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 59 51), today it has been smoothly integrated into the medical system as a c om- plementary herbal drug treatment.3 Notwithstanding the dominance of biomedicine and its incorporation of kanp, other types of medical techniques, such as acupuncture and moxibus- tion ( shinky) and massage therapy ( anma ), are also acknowledged as part of the public healthcare system and are subject to a training and licen sing sys- tem regulated by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW).4 Outside the realm of officially recognized medical practice s, religious actors, especially in the field of \"new religions\" ( reisei bunka ),5 but also in folk religion or the so- called established religions ( kisei shky), provide alternative explanations for what causes illnesses and offer corresponding practices desig ned to heal6 them. These forms of religious therapeutic knowledge and practice mu st be analyzed against the backdrop of a functionally differentiated s ociety. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 Therefore, a critical juxtaposition of these two as representing (reductionist) Western vs. (holistic) \"traditional\" or indigenous m edicine, as suggested by Mar- garet Lock under the labels \"cosmopolitan medical system\" East Asi an med- ical system\" ( 1980: 3), is questionable for present -day Japan. Still, her study pro- vides valuable insights into medical views and attitudes of contempor ary kanp doctors and patients. 4 For information on the licensing system for acupunct urists, moxibustionists and anma massage therapists, see the website of the Japanese Society for Acupuncture and Moxibustion (JSAM): http://en.jsam.jp/contents.php/020000RNSXjD/ , July 4, 2018. Acupuncture, moxibustion, and anma massage or acupressure therapy are partly covered by national health insurance (http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs /en/d/Jh2943e/9.6.html#Jh2943e.9.6 , July 4, 2018). 5 The term as coined by Shimazono Susumu designates th e New Age culture of Japan as comprising imported elements of Western New Ag e, as well as specifi- cally Japanese notions of spirituality and related activities, n etworks, i.e., the so - as noun, iyasu as verb) as applied in the context of religions and the new s pirituality culture goes beyond the meaning of physical curing. As Yumiyama Tatsuya states with regard to contempor ary Japanese new religions: \"Thus religious people speak not only of d iseases that are cured through faith but of diseases that, uncured, occ asion the realization of the true meaning of life or the perception of erroneous ways of thought.\" (Yu miyama 1995: 269). 60 | Monika Schrimpf Despite the historical relevance of therapeutic services in the Buddhist or new religious traditions, propagating them today requires legitimi zing the religious claims of an authority that is assigned to medical institutions, knowledge and social practices. 2 TERMINOLOGICAL REFLE CTIONS The term biomedicine is applied here to denote a conceptualization of medi- cine based on the principles of the natural sciences, in partic ular biology. Notwithstanding multi-layered criticisms of the term as both a research per - spective and a medical concept (Bruchhausen 2010), I prefer \"biomedicine\" to the alternative terms \"Western medicine\" and \"modern medicine,\" which are often used in literature about Japanese medical history. Not only does \"Western medicine\" disguise the plurality of medical traditions i n Europe and North America, it also ignores the developments that took place in Jap- anese biomedicine after its introduction in the Meiji era. Bes ides, both \"Western medicine\" and \"modern medicine\" are used as counter- terms in the realm of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine, where they denote a symptom-oriented, science-based kind of medicine originating in the \"West\" that does not take the mental and spiritual aspects of illness into account. For example, on the website of the Japanese Society for Integrativ e Medicine, the basic distinction between symptomatic treatment ( taish ryh) and causal treatment ( gen'in ryh) is used to characterize the igaku, sho daitai iry). \"The kind of medicine practised in many medical institutions toda y builds on modern Western medicine with its focus on the treatme nt of symp- toms\" (http://imj.or.jp/intro, July 4, 2018 ).7 In contrast, the concepts of oriental medicine ( ty iry)8, East Asian medicine (Lock 1980), and traditional medicine ( dent igaku ) are often \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7 This and all following English quotations from Japane se sources are my own translations. 8 See, for example, the website of the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine, which is dedicated exclusively to kanp medicine ( http://www.jsom.or.jp/index.html , January 29, 2018 ). Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 61 qualified as representing a holistic, individualistic, and natural approach to health and wellbeing. The Japan Holistic Medical Society explains the ma in principles of holistic medicine ( horisutikku igaku ) (zenteki) kenk kan), reliance on \"the therapeutic powers of nature as the source of healing,\" trust in self-healin g powers, the combining of various medical methods to create the appropriate tre atment for each case, and the conviction that realizing the inherent meani ng of ill- ness contributes to individual self-realization (http://www.holistic- medicine.or.jp/holistic/definition/, July 4, 2018). Traditional medicine is de- scribed by the Japanese Society for Integrative Medicine in ter ms of juxta- posing culture with science: \"There are specific styles based on regional characte ristics such as climate, food, eth- nos, customs etc., and they have evolved as traditional medicine a nd folk medicine. In this sense, traditional medicine is c learly more of a culture than a science, and given this background it can be viewed as a medicine tailored to the patients' and clients' individuality.\" ( http://imj.or.jp/intro/qa , January 29, 2017) However, both societies advocate the combined use of biomedicine, Japa- nese traditional medicine, and CAM (Complementary and Alternative Med- icine). This discourse also provides an important frame for proponents of Buddhist medicine. \u0001 62 | Monika Schrimpf 3 DIFFERENTIATION OF R ELIGION AND MEDICINE IN JAPAN From ancient times, health care in Japan was provided by ei ther officially trained physicians or Buddhist \"priest-doctors\" ( si).9 In ancient Japan, Chi- nese medical literature and the knowledge transmitted by Korean physicians provided the main basis for medical practice. From the ninth cent ury, these writings were complemented by Japanese medical literature, sta rting with and the Ishinp (982-984) (Rosner 1989: 12-33). In addition, Buddhist priests relied upon Chinese (and to a lesser degree I n- dian) medical knowledge as passed on in Buddhist scriptures such as t he Su- tra of Golden Light (Jp. Konkmyky; Skt. Suvaraprabhsottama-stra), the meditation manuals monk Zhiyi (Chigi; 538-597), founder of Tian'tai Buddhism and many more.10 From the Heian era (794-1185), Buddhist temples became places where commoners could find medical help. Paul Demi\u00e9vielle's cla ssification of three types of Buddhist healing practices corresponds to Buddhist medi- cine as practiced throughout Japanese history: Buddhist healing comprise d \"religious therapeutics (good works, and practices of worship, expiat ion; meditation etc.), magical therapeutics (mantras, incantations, e soteric and medical therapeutics proper (dietetics, pharmacy, surgery etc.) . The lines demarcating these fields are not at all distinct\" (D\u00e9mieville 1985: 6) .11 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9 For general overviews of Japanese medical history, c p.

Starting with the arrival of European mis- sionaries in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, both traditions were con- fronted with the gradual spread of European medical thought. With the pub- Book on Anatomy\"), a Japanese translation of the Dutch translation of Jo- hann Adam Kulmus' Anatomische Tabellen (1725),12 European anatomical knowledge became increasingly known in Japan. In the Meiji era, conce pts of the human body as a kind of independent organism gradually started to supersede hitherto prevalent views of the body as being influenced by the flow of ki, the relevance of its balance, and its effects on the internal organs. In the wake of modernization, the new Meiji government installed a sys- tem of public healthcare that shifted responsibility for health from the indi- vidual to the state. Starting in 1874, a standardized system of medical exam- ination was established, and from 1876 anyone aspiring to acquire a licen se as a physician had to study biomedicine as imported from Germany. The first decree issued in 1874 by the Ministry of Education regulated the training a nd licensing examination of physicians and pharmacists, as well as the control of pharmaceuticals (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: 61). It was followed by various regu- lations ) and (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: 61- 62,140). physician and politician G t Shinpei (1857-1929) denounced premodern medical practices, such as kanp or Bud- dhist healing prayers, as useless, obstructing modern medicine, and damag- ing the national body. In addition, in 1874 the Ministry of Doctrine (Kybush) issued an ordinance specifically prohibiting religious healing practices: \"Healing by means of magical rituals and the like a re obstructing the government and are henceforth prohibited.\" (Josephson 2013:129-131, quote 131; Shinmura 2013: 283) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 interpretation in the modern era.

See also Nihonyanagi's study on medicine in e soteric Buddhism (1997) and Shinmura's (2013) overview of Buddhist medical history in Japan. 12 The Ontleedkundige Tafelen or \"Anatomical Tables\", 1734. 64 | Monika Schrimpf The gradual implementation of this policy13 was a blow especially to kanp doctors, who in 1873 made up about eighty percent of Japanese phy- sicians, and to Buddhist temples offering medical services. A West ernization of medicine took p lace, in which medicine was differentiated from religion as a separate sphere, regulated by the state authorities, and conc eptualized as pursuing different goals. As a result of these processes, biomedical institutions and practices h ave become the dominant form of medicine in contemporary Japan. Yet eve r since the revival of kanp medicine in postwar Japan, starting with the foun- dation of the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine ( Nihon ty igakkai ) in 1950, kanp has become an integral part of the contemporary healthcare sys - tem.14 It should be noted, however, that this integrated form of kanp differs substantially from premodern kanp: most conventional physicians do not practice the kanp-specific type of diagnosis ( sh)15 but prescribe herbal drugs on the basis of conventional medical diagnoses. Moreover, most kanp drugs are produced using industrialized techniques in which spray-dried granulate extracts have replaced the former decoction of crude dru gs \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13 Takeda Dsh points out that the implementatio n of the health policy of licensing physicians and hospitals was slow and that the lower social cl asses had limited access to them. For him, the coincidence of this failure of public healthcare with numerous cholera epidemics in the 1880s and 1890s support ed the popularity of religious healing practices offered by new religions suc h as Renmonky (Takeda January 29, ). 14 For a detailed reconstruction of the kanp revival movement in the twentieth cen- tury, cp. and Hattori 2014. See also Marg aret Lock's fieldwork study (1980) of the activities and conceptualizations of kanp doctors and patients in the 1980s. Since 2001, kanp has been included in the curriculum of obligatory medical studies, and conventional physicians are all owed to prescribe kanp drugs, 148 of which are covered by national health insurance (Wat anabe et al. 2011). 15 The typical kanp diagnosis comprises \"[...] investigation of the complaints and symptoms of the patient, including taking their tempe rature, examining sensation, weakness or sweating [...]. The physical examination in cludes abdominal palpa- tion, tongue insp ection and pulse diagnosis.\" (Watanabe et al. 2011, 1.3 \" Back- ground of Kampo\") . Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 65 (Watanabe et al. 2011, 1.2, \"Usage and Integration into Modern Medicine\" ). Notwithstanding these changes, kanp is extremely popular in contemporary Japan.16 \"While Chinese medicine and acupuncture are looked on with doubt by some and there is certainly room for debate as to whether or not th ese therapies are seen by most as viable means of treating serious illness, as an overal l trend, current attitudes to- wards kanp and acupuncture are perhaps more positive than any ti me since the Meiji period.\" (Hattori 2014: 18) Although kanp is based on premodern medical practices which were a full- fledged alternative to biomedicine, today kanp physicians and the Japan So- ciety for Oriental Medicine tend to characterize it as a comple mentary form of medicine which compensates for the limits and deficiencies of biomedi- cine. In doing so, they have adopted the critical stance and semantic s of Com- plementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), emphasizing the holi stic ap- proach and the naturalness of kanp medicine, its reliance on the patient's own self-healing powers, and its effectiveness in cases of chronic diseases (where biomedicine fails) (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: 217-219). Oberl\u00e4nder explains this re-interpretation as resulting from the new educational system estab- lished since the Meiji era, which requires all kanp specialists to be trained doctors of conventional medicine (1995: 219).17 Thus, contemporary kanp is an 1983) which is semanti - cally much closer to CAM than to its Japanese premodern predecessors. Adding to the plurality of medical practices are the healing prac tices of- fered in religious communities and by agents of the \"spiritual wor ld\" (seishin \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16 In 2011, the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine cou nted 2,150 certified kanp specialists practising in the strong stimu lus that postwar Japanese kanp doctors and acupuncturists received from European movements in comple - mentary and alternative medicine. Hattori diligently reconstructs how the mutual visit of a German physician (Heribert Schmidt) studying kanp and acupuncture in Japan, and the subsequent visit of a Japanese kanp doctor (Hiroshi Sakaguchi) to Germany in the 1950s influenced the kanp and acupuncturist movements and the self -perceptions of their supporters in Japan (cp. 2014). 66 | Monika Schrimpf sekai ).18 Whereas healing services provided in networks or so-called \"client religions\" are open to everybody, rituals specific to the new reli gions are usually accessible only to their members. In addition, recent init iatives prop- agate Buddhist places and practices as contributing to individual wel lbeing, such as temple yoga or meditation as a means of stress-reducti on (e.g. http://www.tera-buddha.net/project/spilit_body/, January 29, 2018 ). 4 TWO CASE STUDIES The following two case studies are situated in the contexts of (1) traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine in a Buddhist setting, and (2) reli- gious healing practices in new religions. The examples of the Nichiren Bud- dhist priest Kageyama Ky shun and the new religion Perfect Liberty Ky dan provide insights into two possible legitimation strategies used by contempo- rary religious actors offering therapeutic practices. They were chosen be- cause they illustrate significant ways of relating religious a nd medical or sci- entific authority and not because they represent the main advocates of thera - peutic practices in established Buddhism, TCAM or new religions i n Japan. In accordance with Steve Bruce's observation that nowadays \"only the fringes of religion\" (2016: 640) propagate (or reject) therapeutic practices, both examples illustrate these fringes: Perfect Liberty Ky dan as a new reli- gion and Kageyama Ky shun as a non-mainstream Buddhist priest, as we shall see below. 4.1 Buddhist M edicine: Kageyama Kyshun Despite the long history of Buddhist medical practice in Japan, cont emporary advocates of Buddhism as a medical tradition are comparatively r are. In- stead, Buddhist schools and individuals have recently become actively en- gaged in providing spiritual care or grief care,19 especially for terminally ill \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 18 Cp., Movement and concepts of Buddhi st counseling as devel- oped in Jdo Shinsh (Tomohis a 2010, 2013), Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 67 patients or in the aftermath of the triple disaster in T hoku in 2011.20 In ad- dition, the role of Buddhism in the contemporary Japanese healthcare system was the topic of a research project (1999-2001) headed by the Resear ch In- stitute of Bukky University and entitled \"Contemporary Problems of Mod- View\u2014 (Bukky Daigaku Sg Kenkysho 2013). The research adopted a critical stance towards bio- medicine because of its alleged tendencies towards objectificati on, dehuman- ization, and superficial doctor-patient relations. In contrast, Buddhist medi- cine was advocated as a means to add a holistic and humanistic perspe ctive to contemporary healthcare Buddhist med- icine, Muraoka Kiyoshi, head of the research group, referred to a contempo- rary interpretation of the sixth century meditation manual Maka shikan , men- tioned above, thus contributing to the construction of an \"invented tradition\" of Buddhist medicine.21 The same critical attitude towards biomedicine and the chara cterization of Buddhist medicine in accordance with the rhetoric of CAM i s expressed in a recent publication on \"Medicine and Buddhism\" ( iry to bukky) in the Buddhist journal Samgha Japan (2018). Here, the depiction of Western med- icine ( seiy igaku ), namely kanp, acupuncture, moxibustion, and other ki-based healing techniques, is intertwined with a fundamental cultural critique of \"the values of Europe and America\" (bei no kachikan ) as manifested in materialistic thought and an \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 or.jp/rinbutsuken/index.html , January 29, 2018 ).

In contrast, E astern medicine is described as activating the person's own self-heal ing powers and striving for the harmonization of mind and body (Iry to Bukky 2018: 4- 5). This way of combining the evaluation of different medical traditions with a critique of \"Western\" culture as opposed to conceptualizations of a superior Japanese or Asian culture is also characteristic of the wri tings of Kageyama Kyshun (born 1951), the Nichiren-Buddhist head priest of the temple Shakaji in Kamogawa in Chiba prefecture. Kageyama is a graduate of Nichiren-Buddhist Rissh University (Buddhist Studies) and obtained his Ph.D. in Behavioral Sciences from the California Institute for Human Sci- ence (CIHS)22 with a thesis about the psychological and as- pects of the Chinese manual Ten- dai shshikan . He has completed and guided the severe hundred-day ascetic practice of Nichirensh (aragy), is the vice-director of the Nichirensh Re- search Center on Contemporary Religions (Nichirensh Gendai Shky Kenkysho) and has published several books directed at the public. The fol- lowing analysis is based on three of his publications: Buddhist Body Tech- niques: Relating \"Calming the Mind and Insight\" [Meditation] to Psycho- therapy and Buddhist Medicine (2007), Healing Illness by Prayer (2010), and A Buddhist Life awakening to Spirituality: Contemporary Buddhism as Meditation Techniques (2013).23 Whereas Healing Illness by Prayer is writ- ten in a rather simple style to advocate the healing effects of Buddhist \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22 This institute in Encinitas, California, has been fou nded by Motoyama Hiroshi (1925 -2015), parapsychologist and second head of the religious group Tama- mitsu Jinja. It offers deg ree programs on BA, MA, and PhD level in \" Psychology, Integral Health, Life Physics and Comparative Religion and Philosoph y\". Its ac- ademic interest nt's message\": \"[...] con- ducting research on the applications of subtle energy by i ntegrating sci- ence with spirituality. [...] By experiencing the body -mind -spirit interconnection, as well as integrating science with spirituality, people can gai n a deeper insight into the nature of reality, which will hopefully empower them to contribute to the improvement of society at large.\" ( http://www.cihs.edu/index.php/about - cihs/presidents -message/ , July Motoyama Hiroshi also founded the In- ternational Association for Religion and Parapsychology (IAR P, 1972) . 23 These are my translations of the originally Japanese titles (see Bibliography). Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 69 practices, the other two books combine elaborate depictions of Indian and Chinese medical concepts transmitted in Buddhist writings with physiologi- cal explanations of the effects of Buddhist meditation technique s. In both his temple activities and his publications, Kageyama propagates Buddhis m as a salutogenetic medical tradition and a Buddhist way of living as a guarantor of a healthy life. He argues (1) that Buddhist practice is simul taneously the r- apeutical practice, and (2) that \"traditional\" ). For both arguments, he relies primarily on Zhiyi's meditation manuals, whether with regard to the ir expla- nations of the causes, types, and treatments of diseases, or as t he ultimate authority for East Asian meditation techniques. For reasons of space , I will focus here on his second argument. Kageyama defines Buddhism as meditation techniques ( meis gijutsu ) that enable us \"to live in a healthy way and face death in a hea lthy way\" (2013: 300). In his understanding, meditation includes various forms of reli- gious practice ( shugy), others (Kageyama 2010: 105; 2013: 28). He advocates Buddhist meditation as the appropriate way of overcoming the separation of mind and body as prevalent in modern, com- petitive societies: \"As mentioned before, the main need of soci eties in which \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 24 Buddhist medicine for Kageyama denotes the transmiss ion of Ayurvedic and Chi- nese medicine in Buddhist scriptures and its reception by Japanes e Buddhists such as Nichir (Chin. yangsheng ) denotes \"a broad array of practices aimed at nourish ing and prolonging life, including breathing exercises, dieteti cs (especially abstention from grains), sexual practices, meditation and visualiz ation exercises, or (Drott 2010: 254). Originating in China, yangsheng theories and practices spread in Japan through Chinese medical writings. T hey were adopted and complemented by Buddhist an d other authors, such as My an Eisai (1141 - 1215), Kaibara Ekken (1630 Kissayjki (1211) and Chseiryyh bara Ekken's For Kageyama, yj medicine was transmitted by Bud- dhism, and its core is the medical chapter in Zhiyi's Maka shikan (2013: 169). 70 | Monika Schrimpf mind and body are separated is liberation from stress, and this can be realized by means of meditation techniques which unite mind and body\" (2013: 4). Accordingly, Kageyama calls his temple a Buddhist Meditation Center (Buk- ky meis sent) and offers not only the usual ritual services, but also yoga classes, meditation and consultation sessions. In addition, his wife provides Ayurvedic treatment and macrobiotic meals.26 By means of these services and this self-representation, Kage yama's tem- ple differs from most other Nichiren Buddhist temples. Given his s trong crit- icisms of temple priests who restrict their activities t o funerary rites rather than thinking of ways in which they can be helpful to contemporary Japa- nese,27 one can easily imagine that he is a contested figure in contempor ary temple Buddhism. Therefore, Kageyama could be said to exemplify reli gious advocates of medicine at the margins of mainstream religion. 4.2 Healing in New R eligions: Perfect Liberty (PL) Ky dan Starting with the earliest new religions, such as Tenriky , moto, Konkky etc., healing has been an important element in the practices of Japanese new religions. Nagai Mikiko distinguishes between forms of \"magical heali ng\" (jujutsuteki na iyashi ), which are based on the performance of rituals or rely on supernatural powers, and \"healing ing\" ( shakaiteki iyashi ), which refers to social engagement, i.e., \"[...] to put it in strong terms, what we can see is the intention to heal the maladies of society as a whole\" (Kisala 1995: 112). Like Yumiyama, Nagai empha sizes that healing in this context refers to individual perceptions of being saved, irrespective of whether physical curing has taken place or not (Nagai 1995: 97). Healing practices in the new religion Perfect Liberty Ky dan are an ex- ample of how magical healing and healing by self-cultivation over lap. Its followers are encouraged to engage in guided moral self-cultivation as a means to overcome disease, injuries, and other forms of misfortune. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 26 http://temple.nichiren.or.jp/1031159 -syakazi/ ; http://sunwork.her.jp/ayurveda/in- dex.html , July 4, 2018. 27 Private conversation, September 2016. Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 71 Guidance, however, relies on god's saving powers as transmitted by the head of the group or its religious teachers ( kyshi). Perfect Liberty Ky dan (cp. Schrimpf 2018) has existed in its present form since 1946, but it goes back to the pre-war community of Hitonomichi Kydan (founded by Miki Tokuharu predeces- sor Mikateky kai (founded in 1912, renamed in Shint Tokumintsu Daiky kai in 1917). Already the pre-war religious movements had a strong focus on self-cultivation and healing, centering on the practic e ofurikae as the temporary transference of illness to the hea d of the group (Serikawa 1972: 1-27). Although in Hitonomichi Ky dan veneration of the emperor was strongly emphasized, in 1937 Miki Tokuharu and his son To- kuchika (1900-1983) were accused of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and or- dered to dissolve (Serikawa 1972: 280-281; Kojima 2008). It was refounded as Perfect Liberty Ky dan in 1946 by Miki Tokuchika. PL Kydan has approximately 1.2 million members and is headed by Miki Takahito, the third \"parent of uncle Tokuchika (http://www.perfect-liberty.or.jp/html/name-pl/kyou so .html, January 29, 2018 ). The doctrinal core consists of 21 \"rules of living\" (shoseikun ) as guidelines for the moral conduct of life. As summarized i n the slogan \"Life is Art\" ( jinsei wa geijutsu de aru ), salvation is conceptualized as perfecting moral self-cultivation. With its concepts of divine notices (mishirase ) and divine instructions ( mioshie ) as essential tools of salvation, PL Kydan offers a religious interpretation of illness, and its religious teach- ers direct the believers in overcoming it. Illness, injuries, and misfortune ar e seen as divine notices ( mishirase ) indicating distortions of one's self-expres- sion as manifest in inappropriate habitual behaviour or bad habits ( koko- roguse ) such as greed, obstinacy, arrogance, hurry etc. In order to reveal these distortions, so-called divine instructions ( mioshie ) are granted by god to the head of the group, the oshieoya, as someone who is in a \"purely obj ec- state\" gitsu) (Miki 1979: 118). These two examples differ in type of actor\u2014Kageyama as an individual actor, PL religious teachers as collective actors\u2014and data. In the case of Kageyama, analysis relies mainly on his publications. In the cas e of PL Kydan, the main data are the group's publications and instructions directed at the religious teachers (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkyka 1991). In the following, the focus will be on the level of semantics, that is, on the ways in 72 | Monika Schrimpf which elements of the semantic field of medicine are blended into t he seman- tic field of religion. 5 RELIGION AND MEDICINE AS STRATEGI C ACTION FIELDS28 Strategic action fields are social orders that provide a conceptua l and practi- cal fra me for the interaction of individual or collective actors. This ter m, coined by Neil Fligstein and Douglas McAdam, designates \"a constru cted mesolevel social order in which actors (who can be individual or collective) are attuned to and interact with one another on the basis of share d (which is not to say consensual) understandings about the purposes of the field, r ela- tionships to others in the field (including who has power and why), and the rules governing legitimate action in the field\" (Fligstein/McAd am 2012: 9). The \"shared\" but not necessarily consensual understandings refer t o (1) \"what is going on in the field, i.e. what's at stake\"; (2) the existence of a set of actors possessing more or less power; (3) the nature of the r ules governing possible, legitimate and interpretable actions; and (4) interpreti ve frames ap- actions of others\" (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 10-11 ). In our cases, both types of actors clearly position themselves wi thin a subfield of religion, either Japanese Buddhism or PL Ky dan. Both act ac- cording to their perceptions of the rules governing legitimate action in t heir respective fields. Neither Kageyama's nor PL Ky dan's religious teachers perform medical practices in a technical sense. Kageyama propaga tes reli- gious practices such as meditation techniques, prayers, recitation of the Lotus Sutra or invocation of its title ( namu myh rengeky), as well as moral prac- tice and body practices, such as breathing exercises, physical exercises, die - tetics, hygienic routines etc. (Kageyama 2010: 156-173). PL religious t each- ers guide their believers toward a moral conduct to which they ascribe heal- ing effects. In PL Ky dan, acceptance of the differentiation between the two fields is also manifest in the clear distinction between the pr actice of moral guidance on the one hand and medical activities in the PL Hospital \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 28 I thank Nina Rageth for inspiring me to apply Fligstei n and McAdam's concept of the strategic action field (2012). As a consequence, these authors figure prom- inently in both our articles. Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 73 (http://www.plhospital.or.jp, July 4, 2018) and the health centers in Tokyo (the PL Tokyo Kenk Kanri Sent; http://www.pl-tokyo-kenkan.gr.jp, July 4, 2018) and Osaka on the other hand. These institutions rely completely on biomedical expertise and modern medical technology. Accordingly, reli- gious teachers who accept and forward requests for mioshie are urged to em- phasize that mioshie does not primarily have curing functions but is a means to realize moral conduct in accordance with one's nature (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkyka 1991: 184-185). In sum, since both types of actor propagate religious or moral practi ces based on the authority of their religious status (Buddhist priest, r eligious teacher, head of PL Ky dan) and act in religious spaces (Buddhist temple or PL church), they can be said to position themselves as actors in their respec - tive fields, namely Japanese Buddhism and PL Ky dan, or in the wider field of religion. From this position, however, they claim that their religious or mor al prac- tice has therapeutic effects in a practical, not a metaphoric al sense. In Kageyama's case, this claim is clearly aimed to redefine the purpose of the field of Buddhism and to (re-)establish Buddhism as a medical tr adition, hence integrating medical functions into the religious field. In cont rast, PL Kydan publications emphasize that healing is just a side effect, not the in- tended goal of moral practice. In both cases, however, therapeutic cl aims are supported on the level of semantics. Kageyama's writings and PL Ky dan's communicative practices are both characterized by particular ways of switch- ing between \"religious language\" and \"medical language\", underst ood here as the vocabulary, idioms, or linguistic registers (i.e. ways of talking and writing) of the respective semantic fields of medicine and r eligion. Based on these observations, I will introduce two forms of strategic action that aim to legitimize claims to therapeutic authority: (1) Scientificati on and (2) Code- switching between the religious and medical semantic fields. 5.1 Form s of Strategic Action: Scientification 5.1.1 Kageyama Kyshun Scientification here denotes reference to scientific knowledge , institutions, and practices by religious actors in order to legitimize religious knowledge and practices. This strategy is a main characteristic of Kag eyama Kyshun's 74 | Monika Schrimpf writings. His justification for a scientific explanation of Budd hist practice contains a harsh critique of the forced separation of medicine and Buddhis m in Japan's early Meiji era and of the prevalent mode of knowledge as repre- sented in the academic culture. Due to the Westernization of Japa n in early modern times, he argues, the emotional culture ( kansei no bunka ) of Japan as manifest in premodern medical tradition of \"nourishing li fe\" ( yj iry) has been replaced by the rational culture ( risei no bunka ) of the \"West\" as represented in modern biomedicine. For him, emotional cultures a re char- acterized by a mode of knowledge in which tradition is transmitted via em o- tion: \"How are matters of tradition felt, how are they refle cted in oneself?\" (Kageyama 2007: 24). In constrast, in a rational culture, the dominant mode of knowledge rests on intellectual understanding and explanation, as well as on empirical knowledge (Kageyama 2007: 21-23). As a consequence, alt- hough Buddhist culture represents the original emotional culture of Japa n, nowadays it is perceived as a primarily textual tradition\u2014Buddhi sm has lost its \"physicality\" 2007: 24). Therefore, although Bu- dhist truth can only be grasped through experience, Kageyama must re fer to the language of the sciences in order to explain the essence o f Buddhism (Kageyama 2007: 31). In considering the appropriate science, Kageyama argues that Buddhism was originally not a scholarly tradition, but a form of psychotherapy. \"A t present, Buddhism is approached as philosophy, but considering that Bud- dhism actually aims at resolving people's sorrows and sufferings , it is not philosophy but rather psychotherapy.\" (Kageyama 2013: 19) The psycho- therapeutic and general medical quality he ascribes to Buddhist pra ctice re- sults from the fact that, at its core, Buddhism is practice ( shugy) and expe- rience, rather than a tradition of scholarship. It must therefore be approached through mental and physical experience, that is, by means of sensor y percep- tion and the emotions aroused by it.29 Consequently, a science which pro- vides appropriate tools to explain Buddhist practice must consider both the physical and the intellectual aspects: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 29 \"Emotional cultures such as Buddhism must be approached via a mode of knowledge in which someone knows by experience; by means of one's body, i .e. one's senses, someone knows how he feels and what mood arises\" (K ageyama 2007: 24). dMedical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 75 \"Because in this sense Buddhist practice is the attempt to master (taitoku ) true knowledge by means of mind and body, physiological -psychological researc h into methods of Buddhist practice represents a research a ttitude in accordance with the metaphysical particularities of Buddhist thought.\" ( Kageyama 2007: 35) For example, he introduces Hans Selye's (1907-1982) theory of stress reac- tions and the concept of homeostasis as developed by physiologist Wal ter Bradford Cannon (1871-1945) to clarify the physiological conditions of stress before explaining how the methods of \"calming the mind a amatha and vipayan) impact upon them by calming the body, the mind, and breathing (Kageyama 2013: 28-48). He also compares these meditation techniques to autogenic training as expounde d by psychiatrists Johannes Schultz (1884-1970) and Wolfgang Luthe (1922- 1985) (Kageyama 2013: 93-117). In more concrete terms, Kageyama ex- plains and graphically illustrates the measured correlation of tim e spent in meditation with the frequency of brain waves and heart rates and l inks it to four temporal phases in autogenic training (2013: 118-123). In this argu- ment, the slowing down of the heart rate and brain waves meas ured ten minutes after starting meditation is said to coincide with induce ment of the meditative state of zenna (Skt. dhyna), in which one sits in quiet observation of one's own self- reflection (Kageyama 2013: 156). Finally, the changed self-perception (the expansion of consciousness) in shikan meditation is compared to Stanislav Grof's notion of transpersonal experiences and Abra- ham Maslow's self-actualization (Kageyama 2013: 134-139)30. Similar to Mikael Rothstein's observation concerning how and why new religions emphasize their scientific character, Kageyama's choice of the \"physiological-psychological\" sciences reflects his agenda of supporting re- ligious authority vis-\u00e0-vis scientifically based authority claims in the field of medicine. \"It is, as we shall see, religion, not science, which defines the standards in the interaction between the two systems: Science , in the scien- tific sense of the word, has been largely substituted by a mythol ogical ren- dering of the same concept.\" (Rothstein 2004: 101) Although Kageyama's concept of science is by no means mythological, his choice of scientist s, in- cluding proponents of transpersonal psychology, serves his aim of providing \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 30 See Stephanie Gripentrog's analysis of religious elem ents in Maslow's and Grof's contribution to Transpersonal Psychology in this volume. 76 | Monika Schrimpf scientific proof of the physical, psychological, and ultimately medica l impact of Buddhist practice very well. This interpretation of Buddhism brings Kageyama's concept of \"Bud- dhism as meditation techniques\" close to what Lorne Dawson cal ls \"the new religious consciousness\" (2006: 183)31 as a kind of [...] resource pool\" (Robbins/Bromley as cited in Dawson 2006: 186), parts of which are actualized in different social settings. Similar to this notion of an i ndividual- istic, experience-based religiosity resting on a holistic worldvie w, Kageyama emphasizes experience as the only way of grasping the essence o f Buddhism and advocates Buddhist practice as a means to re-establish the unity of m ind and body. This topos of mind-body unity is a basic concept in the assoc ia- tions of integrative or holistic medicine mentioned above, as well a s in the context of the California Institute for Human Science: its bas ic principles include \"To Understand Human Existence from the Total Perspecti ve of Body, Mind and Spirit\".32 As such, mind-body unity is a modern rhetoric projected back on to premodern forms of medicine. Neither in Buddhist m ed- icine nor in Japanese kanp does the juxtaposition of mind and body play any role. In sum, Kageyama's strategy of scientification serves a double a im: (1) to legitimize his claim that Buddhist practices have medico-therapeutica l ef- fects by expressing them in scientific terms; and (2) as a conse quence, to upgrade Buddhism as a tradition serving not only the religious goal of awak- ening, but also the physical goal of a healthy body and mind. His concept of Buddhism as a religion serving \"this-worldly\" interests, such as a healthy life, creates a counterimage to the negative image of Buddhism in Jap anese the widely used term \"funeral Buddhism\" ( sshiki Bukky) implies that many priests see their main function in providing expensive funerar y \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 31 Dawson describes this kind of contemporary religiosit y as a cultural resource manifest for example in new religious movements, new re ligious networks, client religions etc. To him, it is characterized by religiou s individualism, emphasis on experience, i.e., \"intense experiences of themselves and the sacred\" (2006: 183), authority based on \"skill development\" rather than scriptures or revelation, toler- ance of other religious perspectives, a holistic worldview, (2006: 184). 32 4, 2018. Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 77 rituals to increase their wealth.33 Therefore, the use of scientific language is applied here as a means to advocate and legitimize a new c oncept of Bud- dhism that defies its public image. As noted by Rothstein, it is a ki nd of le- gitimization that no modern religion can avoid: \"No religion of the modern world will successfully be able to claim authority without some kind of sci- entific legitimization.\" (Rothstein 2004: 102) 5.1.2 Perfect Liberty Kydan For the same reason, I argue, the value of science, especially of the medical and natural sciences, is strongly emphasized in the case of Perfe ct Liberty Kydan. As explained in its introductory guidebook for believers, \"the unity of religion and science\" ( shky basic convic- tion propagated in the community. Accordingly, PL Ky dan runs several sci- entific and medical institutions; a General Research Center (PL sg kenkysho), the PL Hospital ( PL byin), and two PL health centers ( PL kenk kanri sent) in Tokyo and Osaka. The tasks of the General Research Center comprise \"analysing psychic sources of injuries and illness, providing a da - tabase concerning doctrines and propagation, [and] rationalizing and in creas- ing the (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkybu 2008: 27). At the same time, its aim to scientifically prove doctrinal statements is emphasized: \"In the field of medicine, we conduct research on the topic of bad habits and illnes s (kokoroguse to by ki), based on the truth of divine notices ( mishirase ) and divine in- structions ( mioshie ); and in the field of education, we conduct research o n the topic of parent -child relations and human relations, based on the teaching th at children are a mirror of their parents.\" (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkybu 2008: 27) As these quotes indicate, scientific institutions and scientific knowledge are highly valued both as a means to support the religious organization and to prove its truth claims, and they are said to rest ultimately on religious trut hs. This linking of religious and scientific truth is also reflected in the short t ext introducing the PL hospital: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 33 For an analysis of the role scholarship has played i n the emergence of the popular image of a corrupt, degenerate temple Buddhism, see Covell 2005: 11 -22. 78 | Monika Schrimpf \"No matter how well we are equipped with excellent techni cal devices, and how much we improve medical techniques, since we are human beings we cannot avoid mistakes. Therefore, those in a position to take care of other peoples' lives cannot but conduct medical treatment with the following praying mind: 'We do our best to make sure, and we d o what is humanly possible, but beyond this we rely on god with all our hearts.'\" (Pfekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkybu 2008: 27) Obviously, in this introductory guidebook, the relationship between scienc e and religion is evaluated from a religious perspective. By addressing a reli- gious audience, emphasizing the superiority of god's actions over human ac- tions, and stressing the scientific truth of their religious doctri nes, the authors are acting in accordance with the rules of legitimate action in the religiou s field. Relating science to religion in this way is a communicat ive strategy with the intention to strengthen the authority of religion by and in relation to science. By means of this strategy, an ambiguous relationship betwe en the two fields is created. On the one hand, the legitimizing power of science is accepted; on the other hand, the superiority of divine action over human ac- tion is claimed, thus reversing the relationship. This strategy is not applied in the context of medical institutions. T he webs ite of the PL Hospital addresses potential patients rather than PL mem- bers or the religious in general. The language of the website conforms to the norms of communication in the field of medicine with regard to both, its contents and its use of medical terminology. As on any other hospit al web- site, the hospital units and their recent activities, the technolo gical equipment they use, their medical services, ethics in dealing with pa tients etc. are de- scribed. The only reference to religious concepts is made in th e section on \"Hospital guidelines,\" where one finds not only an extended version of t he PL motto \"Life is Art\", namely \"Life is Art\u2014So is Medicin e\" and a commit- ment to the ultimate reliance on god when men reach their limits , but also the statement that \"medical treatment rests on PL principles \" (http://www. plhospital.or.jp/contents/gNavi4/hosin.html, July 4, 2018). Although the connection with PL Ky dan as a religious group is clearly stated, the actual meaning of the \"PL principles\" and their relevance for the hospit al remain vague. In this institutional context, the purpose of the medical fiel d is acknowledged and its rules are applied with regard to medical pract ice as well as language use. Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 79 Both cases show that religious actors pursue a strategy of scien tifically validating therapeutical claims, thus supporting Mikael Rothstein's judge- ment, mentioned above, that every modern religion needs scientific le gitimi- zation in order to claim authority for itself. In the case of PL Ky dan, scien- tification as a means of legitimization is complemented by its attempt to es- tablish itself institutionally in the medical field. However, representa tives of these institutions act as medical actors, thus complying with t he semantics of the medical field. 5.2 Forms of Strategic Action: Code -switching between the Religious and Medical Semantic F ields Another strategy I observed among religious actors is a kind of code-swi tch- ing between the semantic fields of religion and medicine in order to create a functional hierarchy. Although linguistically code-switching denotes \"the juxtaposition of elements from languages or dialects\" (McCor- mick 1994: 581), it is used here in a wider sense as switching betw een se- mantic fields. By semantic field, I refer to specific vocabular y, idiomatic ex- pressions, and linguistic registers, such as special terminology, a s well as codified ways of speaking or writing, for example, between doctor and pa - tient, religious expert and believer etc. Semantic fields in this sense are understood as part of the tool kits of the strategic action field of religion or the subfields of Japanes e Buddhism and PL Kydan, and medicine. Tool kits are defined by Ann Swidler (1986) as habits, skills, meanings, linguistic repertoires etc. that are available to actors in their respective social contexts. Individual and collective actor s develop strategies of action by selecting from these cultural repertoi res and by inter- preting their actions in specific ways (Swidler 1986: 281-283). In the two cases discussed here, the question arises why religious actors select from the linguistic tools of the semantic field of medici ne and combine them with elements of their own religious linguistic repertoires . Do they want to position themselves as actors in the medical field? I argue that, rather than positioning themselves in another field, they apply this strategy as a means of strengthen ing the position of their own field in relation to that of medicine. Let us look first at the case of Perfect Liberty Ky dan. The procedures of asking for divine instruction ( mioshie ) concerning a disease, injury or other 80 | Monika Schrimpf physical affliction involve religious semantics as well as medic al semantics. If a member asks for mioshie , he or she hands over a standardized \"plea for mioshie \" to the local church. Beforehand, he or she will have prayed in a ritualized way and promised to apply the contents of the divine instr uction in his or her daily life. The religious teacher who receives this plea inquires diligently about the member's marital status, family member s, job, duration of membership etc., and describes the symptoms and course of the disea se in great detail (Pfekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkyka 1991:183-186, 195-279). This comprehensive information is to the headquarters in Ton- dabayashi, where Miki Takahito, the head of PL Ky dan, or those religious teachers who are able to receive mioshie , write down the specific divine in- struction and send it back to the local church. Again, the member has to pray in formalized words before receiving the envelope with the mioshie from a local religious teacher. After three days of reflecting about the meaning and the individual application of the mioshie , the member visits a religious teacher to ask him for his assessment ( kaisetsu ) and to discuss possible ways of realizing the mioshie in everyday life (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkyka 1991: 186-189). Notwithstanding the ritualistic language register manifest in prayers an d formalized phrases when receiving the plea and handing over the mioshie , code-switching to medical language occurs in the religious teacher 's detailed recording of the symptoms, the course of the disease, the diagnosis by a phy- sician, and the prescribed treatment. The manual for religious teachers ill us- trates how the symptoms of various diseases are to be described in great de- tail and how their location is to be marked on a drawing of the human body. For example, in the case of a rash, the person is asked whether s he or he experiences hot flushes at night, and whether the symptoms increase when the person is exposed to cold wind; in case of sinusitis the believer i s asked how the nasal mucus smells, how it affects the sense of sm ell, and whether it causes headaches; in case of an accident, the course of event s must be de- scribed precisely etc. (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkyka 1991: 231-239). In this communication, religious teacher and believer imitate a conversa- tion between a doctor and a patient. Whereas previously their com munication was in line with the linguistic registers of religious beli ever and teacher, they now switch into the communicative mode of a medical anamnesis p erformed by a doctor with a patient (P fekuto Ribat Kydan Bunkyka 1991: 183- 185). By using this kind of medical communication in order to document the Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 81 symptoms of a disease or injury and by framing it using religious conc epts that explain the occurence of the symptoms, different functions are assigned to medical and religious language respectively: medical language serves to label and locate the symptoms physically, whereas religious language serves to explain the actual causes of the disease and to indicate ways of healing it . Thus, a hierarchical relationship is constructed, in which religio us concepts are assigned a superior position. A similar strategy is followed by Kageyama in his explanations for actual diseases. On the general level, he ascribes the increase of so-c alled lifestyle diseases such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases, cancer, allergies, rashes, high blood pressure, ea ting disorders etc. to the separation of mind and body as characteristic of co ntemporary \"competitive societies\" (2013: 36). This separation creates st ress, the main cause of all the diseases mentioned above, and can be countered by medi ta- tion techniques which reinstate the unity of mind and body (Kageyama 2013: 28-36). In explaining actual diseases, he sometimes blends religious c on- cepts with physiological effects in a way that assigns them dif ferent func- tions. The following is part of his explanation for what causes chronic rheu- matism and rheumatic arthritis, a disease that afflicts mo stly women in the second half of their lives. \"In the minds of women who suffer from rheumatic arthriti s, suppressed contradictory emotions are hidden. In Buddhism we call these \"dust accumulati ng passions\"; this expression describes a state in which the mind, which is or iginally as pure as the Bud- dha nature, in the process of its development has been polluted by dirt . This aggressive karma ( g), in neurophysiological terms, stimulates the sympat hetic nervous system and manifests itself in a muscular tension. By suppressing this strong impulse in order to stop it, the tension of the adversary muscle which is con nected to the originally tense muscle is also intensified. As a consequence, the contra ction caused by the ten- sion of the adversary muscle group damages the joints, and the physical basis causing rheumatism is revealed.\" (Kageyama 2010: 111) In this example, medical terminology and explanations are used to descr ibe a disease as a physiological process, whereas religious terminol ogy\u2014the concepts of passion Buddha nature ( bussh) and karma ( g)\u2014are applied to explain its real cause. To Kageyama, a woman's contradict ory urges to dominate and to protect cause aggressive karma. Buddhist pra yers 82 | Monika Schrimpf (kit) and invoking the title of the Lotus Sutra are advocated as mea ns to purify this negative karma, resulting in a relaxation of the muscles and a sta- bilization of the vegetative nervous system (Kageyama 2010: 114). As in the case of PL Ky dan, medical terminology is incorporated here and assigned the inferior function of explaining organic processes an d rela- tionships, in which it is framed by religious concepts which provide a n ex- planation for what causes these physical effects in the context of a Buddhist notion of man and fate. In this way, religious knowledge and practice , whether Buddhist or new religious, is depicted as superior when it comes to understanding the causes of diseases. 6 CONCLUSION Neither Kageyama nor the religious teachers in PL Ky dan make use of the linguistic tool kit of the field of medicine or apply scientific re asoning in order to compete with medical actors in their respective fiel d. Kageyama does not challenge medical experts by setting up an institution of alternative medical practice or by actually becoming involved in contemporary medic al- scientific discourses. PL Ky dan does have its own medical institutions, but they operate according to the rules of the medical field. Here, the specifically religious interpretation and subsequent treatment of illness are considered to be complementary practices. Rather, Kageyama and PL Ky dan's religious teachers use medical or allegedly scientific language to legitimize, within the religi ous field, their claims that religious practice also fulfills therapeutical functions. In this sense, Kageyama and PL Ky dan both represent one way of bridging the gap between scientific medicine and their own therapeutic practices. Th ey advo- cate an understanding of \"the purposes of the field\" (Fligstein/McA dam 2012: 9), which includes the goal of a healthy body and mind in the literal sense. By doing so, they re-claim a premodern or 'pre-differentiated' under - standing of religions and their \"purposes\" in which medical care was a fun- damental task of their respective religious communities. However , they do not propagate to simply return to this previous state and replace sci entific medical authority by religious medical authority. Instead, they qual ify their therapeutical techniques as compatible with science, thus a cknowledging the Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 83 superiority of scientific medicine, while at the same time dis solving the boundaries between it and their own activities. In this sense, scientification and code-switching between medical and re- ligious language are used to strengthen the position and influence of religions in contemporary Japanese society. They aim to re-establish the r elevance of religious traditions as (complementary) medical traditions via il lustrating their compatibility with scientific-medical knowledge and the s uperiority of religious over medical explanatory models. The strategies of scientific legitimization and code-switching applie d in the two examples also shed light on possible ways in which religious actors may conceptualize the relationship between the two fields. On the one ha nd, the religious field\u2014assuming it includes medical functions\u2014is s een as being in a dependent relationship (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 18-19) with the med- ical field. Although Kageyama extensively describes premodern Budd hist medical knowledge in times when medicine and religion were not ye t differ- entiated, this traditional knowledge gains relevance for the prese nt only if it is validated by contemporary medical-scientific knowledge. This conce ptu- alization clearly reflects the relationship on the social leve l, where medical experts do not require religious legitimization, but religious act ors cannot claim medical authority without referring to the tool kit of medici ne. Or, in Rothstein's terms: \"Religion has the ability to transform sci ence into some- thing useful for its purpose, while science usually is deprived of the possibil- ity of transforming religion into something scientifically meaningful\" (2004: 102). On the other hand, in the internal discourse, an interdependent rel ation- ship is conceptualized by means of functional hierarchization accordin g to which religious doctrines are claimed to provide the ultimate explanation of what causes illness. In this way, the one-sided dependence of religion on the social level is counteracted. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ahn, Juhn Y.

Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 89 Yumiyama, Tatsuya (1995): \"Varieties of Healing in Present-Day Ja of Religious Studies of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner Semantic Structure and Structuring Conditions Nina Rageth ABSTRACT This article examines issues related to competition within the domain of Siddha med- icine ( citta maruttuvam ), that It focuses on the tension a nd co - constitution of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practit ioner and the college -edu- cated Siddha practitioner. Based on ethnographic interviews cond ucted in South India, it analyzes how the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is semantically delin- eated in the aftermath of the formal professionalization of Sid dha medicine. Based on the assumption that practices of self -representation and broader social structures form a constitutive relatio nship, it discusses the interlocutors' accounts as posi- tionings in a 'strategic action field' (Fligstein/McAdam 2012). Accordingly, the arti - cle suggests that the interlocutors' distinct self-fashioning, especially their appropria- tion and fusion of religious and scientific semantics, be conceptualized as a strategic improvisation that establishes and ensures them a favorable position in this particular social field. 92 | Nina Rageth 1 INTRODUCTION Siddha medicine ( citta maruttuvam ) is a medical system mainly practiced in the Tamil-speaking areas of South India.1 According to emic accounts by contemporary Siddha practitioners, the medical system is of divine prove- nance, having been discovered by the god iva and revealed by him to the siddhars ( cittarka), \"the ancient supernatural spiritual saints of India\"2, who in turn introduced the Siddha knowledge to the human realm.3 Today, Siddha medicine is recognized by the Indian government as a traditional Indian med- ical system and has been integrated into the public health service. In the la te colonial period and in the context of the policy of \"state-sponsored medica l pluralism\" (Sujatha/Abraham 2009: 35), Siddha along \"modernist lines\" (Habib/R aina 2005: 74). This process entailed the introduction of a standardized college education modelled on the biomedical paradigm, the reworking of Siddha medical knowledge in accordance with scientific principles, a dif ferentiation between qualified and non-qualified practitioners through registration and official certificates such as the Bachelor's in Siddha Me dicine and Surgery (BSMS), and the regulation of Siddha medical practices, especially in the production of pharmaceuticals (cp. Hausman 1996; S\u00e9bastia 2012a, 2012b; \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 In accordance with the convention in English academic publications, I use the Sanskrit term siddha rather than Tamil citta to refer to the medical tradition. Fur- thermore, following conventions in English publications, I us e siddhar and not the Sanskrit siddha or Tamil cittar to refer to the alleged authors of the Siddha literature and the founders of Siddha medicine. A further n ote on transliteration: Tamil terms are transliterated according to their Tam il forms. However, terms which are more commonly used in their Sanskrit versi ons, I have tr ansliterated according to the Sanskrit spelling (e.g. gurukula instead of kurukulam , doa in- stead of tcam, stra instead of cstiram , iva instead of civa). Plural forms of Indian terms are marked by the suffix -s instead of the Tamil plural suffix -ka (e.g. pa\u00f1captas instead of pa\u00f1captaka). I render place names and personal names in their usual English spellings. 2 http://www.siddhavaidyam.com/Origin_of_SiddhaMedicine.html , August 18 , 2017. 3 For scholarly work on the Siddhars, see White 1996; Venkatraman 1990 ; Zvelebil 1973, 1974, 1996. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 93 Sieler 2015; Weiss 2009). The formal professionalization of Siddha m edicine led to the establishment of a secularized institution, which I refe r to in this article as \"the college institution.\" This professionalizati on also led to the appearance of a new figure in the medical field, whom in this arti cle I c all \"the college-trained practitioner.\" The college institution is sufficiently pow- erful to sanction what constitutes genuine Siddha medical knowledge and Siddha medical practice and to define the criteria for occupat ional closure. Moreover, it is in a position to undermine the authority of the previ ous au- thoritative institution, which I call \"the gurukula institution.\"4 This article looks at a particular figure that has emerged und er these changing social conditions and that has become effective in opposi tion to the college-trained practitioner. I refer to this figure as \"the hereditary Siddha practitioner.\" Hereditary Siddha practitioners depict themselves as represent- atives of the gurukula institution, which, they claim, has preserved the \"real\" Siddha knowledge, the \"divine science\"5, and which has transmitted this knowledge within lineages (paramparai) of physicians from teache rs to ini- tiated students until the recent establishment of college educ ation and the mainstreaming of an altered version of the siddhars' original knowle dge. On the basis of self-descriptive accounts of seven contemporary Si ddha practi- tioners who identify with the figure of the hereditary practitioner, the artic le analyzes how my interlocutors frame the figure of the hereditar y prac ti- tioner.6 The article examines the self-fashioning of the hereditary prac titioner in the current medical landscape, as well as the fashioning of the traditional Siddha medicine, that is, following Habib and Raina (2005: 76), of the \"c on- temporary practitioners' traditional medicine.\" The term \"self- fashioning\" has been chosen to emphasize the strategic orchestration involved in the con- struction of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner. In adopting the term, I aim to highlight the proposition that my interlocutors' sel f- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4 A gurukula is traditionally a school where the disciples live together with the ir teacher. 5 http://www.devavidya.com/vision.html, September 29 , 2016. 6 The term \"framing\" features prominently in the socia l sciences i n areas as differ- ent as ritual theories (Goffman 1974) and media theories (Gams on 1985). How- ever, I use the term in its everyday meaning of \"delineating ,\" \"describing ,\" or \"laying out ,\" without reference to any particular academic debate. 94 | Nina Rageth representations are consciously fabricated within the structuring fra mework of their social position.7 The first part of the article describes how the figure of the hereditary Sid- dha practitioner is semantically fashioned by examining the constructi on of the symbolic boundaries between this figure and its \"constitutive out side\" (Hall 2003: 17, emphasis in the original). Special attention is give n to the application of religious semantics and the emphasis on tradition i n the self- descriptive accounts of my interlocutors. In the second part, the arti cle dis- cusses the social structures within which the figure emerge s and suggests interpreting the specific self-fashioning as a semantic positioning in a \"stra- tegic action (Fligstein/McAdam 2012). The article dieu's stance that the \"construction [of social reality] is not c arried out in a social vacuum but subjected to structural constraints\" (Bourdi eu 1989: 18). It argues that the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner emerges withi n the contextual conditions of the professionalization of Siddha medicine and that the college-trained practitioner creates the foil against which this figure becomes meaningful. Consequently, the article does not focus on the com - petition between Siddha medicine and biomedicine, but examines issues r e- lated to competition within the domain of Siddha medicine itself. In doing so, it fills a gap identified by the historian of religion, Richard Weiss (2009: 201). The article argues that, under conditions of the professionaliz ation of Siddha medicine, the religious semantics and the emphasis on tradit ion ap- pear as a mode of cultural production which becomes effective in t he self- fashioning of the position of the hereditary Siddha practitioner. The replace- ment of the gurukula institution by the secularized college institution f avors, so to speak, the appropriation of religious argumentation and the rhetoric of tradition as a means whereby a distinct social group attempts to provide its knowledge with authority and to attain a different status in the social fiel d. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7 The term \"self -fashioning\" loosely reflects the term \"objective self -fashioning\" coined by the medical anthropologist Joseph Dumit. While Dumit uses the latter term to analyze how the understanding of the biological self, the \"person, body, brain, and mind\" (2010: 368), are actively and continually produced, I use the term \"self -fashioning\" to point to the ways in which a position in a social field is produced. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 95 2 ETHNOGRAPHIC MATERIA L: SAMPLE AND ANALYSIS This article is based on material generated in the explorat ory phase of my PhD project, which stretched over a period of four years (2014 to 2018).8 The main sources for this article are informal conversations and ethnographic in- terviews with Siddha practitioners conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. Ethnographic interviews are unstructured and open inter- views which do not follow a set pattern but respond to the particular situation in which they take place. Also, they typically resemble an everyday conver- sation, yet without the back and forth characteristic of this type of social in- teraction (Schlehe 2003: 72). A further source are the webpage t exts of my interlocutors. Furthermore, the tool of ethnographic observation was u sed during fieldwork in order to see what people do and what kind of infrastruc- ture they use for their actions (cp. Bernard 2011). However, since this artic le is mainly concerned with semantics rather than practice, the data I generated through observational techniques come into play only marginally in the pre- sent article. The sample consists of Siddha practitioners who present themselve s as hereditary Siddha practitioners. \"Hereditary Siddha practitioner\" is a term I introduce to capture and subsume the emic terminology I encountered in the field, doctor\" (Devanes an). I conducted ethnographic interviews with seven practitioners, six men and one woman (Anbarasi), one in Tamil (Kapilan), the others in English, or more precisely with English as the foundational language interwoven with Tamil , which proved to be the most convenient mode for conducting the interviews for everybody involved. All the interviews were conducted in the clinics of m y interlocutors. The interlocutors share some basic socio-demographics. The y are all around forty years old and live in towns in the southern Indi an state \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8 The doctoral thesis focuses on the intersection of H indu guru organizations and Siddha medicine in pres ent-day South India. The research was generously sup- ported by the University Research Priority Program Asia and Europe, University of Zurich and funded by the Humer Foundation. 96 | Nina Rageth of Tamil Nadu. The exception is Prem Nath, who lives in Kerala in an area populated by both Malayalis and Tamils. Prem Nath comes from a Tami l family, and the circumstance that he lives in Kerala does not make his situa - tion different from those of the other interlocutors.9 My interlocutors also share similarities with regard to their medical practice. The y all run their own clinics ( vaittiyaclai), and they all produce medical drugs ( maruntu ), which, as they state, are based on formulas inherited from their gurus . The clinics are small -scale settings, and my interlocutors cater to as many as fort y pa- tients a day. In all the settings, consultation is free of charge, but the co sts of the drugs have to be covered by the patients. Apart from two practition ers (Anbarasi and Surendran) who run a business selling drugs to retail ers, the drugs are exclusively dispensed to the practitioners' own patient s. Moreover, my interlocutors share themes in their self-representation. They all st ate that they see their work as their duty to keep Siddha medicine from vanis hing. They argue that the Indian government's recognition of their medical system and its integration into the public health sector has not benefitte d Siddha medicine but rather has had adverse effects on it. The most important shar ed element in their self-representation for the argument I develop in this articl e is that they all identify with the hereditary Siddha practit ioners and strongly distinguish themselves from college-trained practitioners. While they de- scribe themselves as practicing Siddha \"the traditional Siddha medicine, going the \"academic way\" \"university Nath). My int erlocu- tors claim that they, on the contrary, learnt the \"real\" Siddha medicine out- side modern college institutions with a guru. Three of my interlocutors (Prem Nath, Avalok, Rubendran) stated that they hail from Siddha physician fami- lies and that they studied with their grandfathers and fathers, wher eas the other four interlocutors learnt Siddha medicine with a guru outside t heir fam- ily. One of my interlocutors (Kapilan) framed this distinction in te rms of karuvai and kuruvai, that is, entering a gurukula by birth ( karuvai, the way of the embryo) or by initiation ( kuruvai, the way of the guru). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9 Prem Nath did not wish to be anonymized. The other i nterlocutors have been given pseudonyms. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 97 It should be noted, however, that, in addition to their training with a gur u, my interlocutors have also earned certified medical degrees, a prerequisite to practicing medicine legally in contemporary India.10 From an analytical point of view, the fact that my interlocutors earned certified diplomas makes thei r self-representation as non-college-trained practitioners appear contr adictory. However, what is important for the argument I develop in this article is that, regardless of the certified diplomas which they hold, they fashion them selves as hereditary Siddha practitioners and distance themselves from practitioners who only learnt Siddha medicine in college and who do not have access to any other source of medical knowledge. The method used in analyzing the data follows the paradigm of theoreti- cal coding and the analytical method of grounded theory (cp. Glaser 1978). Theoretical coding is a reconstructive method that aims to identify concepts in the material from which more abstract categories are devel oped. These abstract categories serve as a tool with which to organize the m aterial and present it analytically. The categories are derived from the a nalysis of the material obtained during fieldwork. The dominant categories in the material serve as the basis for the construction of the ideal type of the hereditary Si d- dha practitioner I discuss in this article. The ideal type is not identical with empirical types; rather, it is to be understood as a generalization of t he dom- inant features that are present in my interlocutors' accounts.11 My interlocu- tors show these features to varying degrees, which will be indicate d in the analysis. As should become clear with regard to the limited size of the sam- ple, this study is conceptualized as a case study which does not sp eak for a larger whole, yet which is a valuable means of exploring trends in a specific group and thus of diversifying the existing academic discourse. However, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10 Two of my interlocutors (Anbarasi and Surendran) hav Bachelor's degrees in Siddha (BSMS), one (Prem Nath) a Diploma in Si ddha medicine (the older equivalent of the BSMS), one a Bachelor's degree in Ayurve da (Ruben- dran), and one a Bachelor's degree in homeopathy (Avalok). Two other practi- tioners have certificates issued by different Siddha associatio ns, which do not count as legal documents allowing one to practice legally (Devan esan, Kapilan). 11 For a discussion of the ideal type versus the empirical type, cp. Kuckartz 1991. It would be revealing to test the ideal type that was de veloped on the basis of the seven cases in a next step using a larger sample in ord er to refine or confirm it. 98 | Nina Rageth one should bear in mind that the conclusions are provisional and more r e- search is needed to strengthen the arguments and make them more nuanced. 3 THE PROTAGONISTS: AN EMANATION OF THE FIELD I conceptualize the figure of the hereditary practitioner not as m y interlocu- tors' individual creation or ad hoc improvisation, but as a figure that emerges in a distinct social configuration. This view is expressed in Bourdi eu and Wacquant's famous statement: \"And we could say, following the formula of a famous German physicist, that the individual, like the electro n, is an Aus- geburt des Feldes : he or she is in a sense an emanation of the field.\" (1992: 107, emphasis in the original) On this note, I suggest that the articul ations of my interlocutors follow certain rules which are linked to the dynam ics of their social field (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 98). Furthermore, I understand the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner as a collectiv e figure, the col- lective dimension resting on the construction of a sense of a lar ger commu- nity of hereditary practitioners, both synchronically and diachronically. This sense of community is established and reproduced by my interlocutors through the articulation of tradition. The synchronic community is expressed in the individual practitioner's identification with other, contemporary prac- titioners. The diachronic community is expressed in the linking of th e indi- vidual practitioners with previous practitioners and in their self-locati ng in a lineage of hereditary practitioners. The crucial point is tha t the articulation of community allows multiple subjects to identify with the figure of the he- reditary Siddha practitioner, a collective figure that transcen ds the interests and identity of the individual. This stance brings to the fore a pressing ques- tion: Which social configurations are constitutive for the emergence of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner? What are the cha racteristics of the field from which this figure emanates? The field in which my interlocutors are situated underwent far-re aching transformations in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries tha t are still reflected in its current arrangement. Those transformations are too complex to meaningfully outline in a short synopsis. In the following, I will limit my attention to one distinct component of those transformations, name ly the pro- cess of the formal professionalization of the medical profession. B roadly Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 99 speaking, professionalization means turning an occupation into a profes- sion12, a process observable in many different occupational domains, medi- cine being just one among them, though it is often held out as \"the canoni cal example\" of professionalization (Ranganathan 2013: 903). Needless to say, the professionalization of Siddha medicine is a complex process that can only be sketched out in broad strokes here.13 The process can be traced back to the late colonial period, and it continued into India's independence. T he colonial administration and later the Indian government both took on a leading role in this process, yet it should be realized that associations of what were then called ISMs (Indian Systems of Medicine) and individual practitioner s of ISM were also decisive actors (cp. S\u00e9bastia 2012b ; Sujatha/Abraham 2009 , who strongly emphasise this point). I will limit the following remarks to one scholarly position arguing that it is no historical coincidence that the profes- sionalization of Indian medical systems coincided with the emergence of re- sistance to British colonialism.14 This position is reflected in Last's statement that the professionalization of Indian medical systems was carr ied out \"to rival those [medical institutions; NR] set up for 'cosmopolitan ' (or medicine by the imperial regime\" (Last 1996: 385).15 The development of professionalized Indian medical systems, be it Siddha medicine or others , reflects, so to speak, a dominated society's strategy to \"establish parity wi th the hegemon\" (Habib/Raina 2005: 69). Indian medical systems emerged as standardized, professionalized forms of medicine in a period in which I ndia \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12 Broman lists six criteria for a pr ofession: \"(1) specialized and advanced educa- tion, (2) a code of conduct or ethics, (3) competency te sts leading to licensing, (4) high social prestige in comparison to manual labor, (5) monopolization of the market in services, and (6) considerable autonomy in conduct of professional af- fairs\" (1995: 835). 13 I am not referring here to what Engler (2003: 450), wi th regard to Ayurveda, calls \"rudimentary professionalization\" at its very inception, but to professionalization which is closely linked to the dev elopment of a modern college institution. 14 There is a rich literature on the connections betwee n nationalism, the construction of identities, and medicine; see, for example, Brass 1972, Ha usman 1996, Lang- ford 2002, Leslie 1976, Weiss 2009, Wujastyk/Smith 2008. 15 Another interpretation prioritizes the role of pract itioners and students of IMS who wanted to improve their reputations and economic opportunities and thu s aspired to adapt I MS to the dominant biomedicine. 100 | Nina Ra geth was engaged in what Weiss calls a \"struggle to counter cultura l imperialism\" (2005: 175) and was forming a \"national-cultural imaginary\" (Langf ord 2002: 17) of the emerging nation state. Through the process of professional- ization, Indian medicine was reified as a series of distinct medical systems, making it possible for them to challenge Western claims of superi ority in general and to oppose the particular Western medical knowledge syst em to which the colonial state subscribed (Sujatha/Abraham 2009: 37).16 While Ayurveda featured most prominently as the Indian counterpart to West ern medicine and has received the greatest attention in both emic and a cademic debates, other Indian medical systems also emerged and were pr esented as superior alternatives to Western medicine.17 These dynamics found expres- sion in the \"state-sponsored medical pluralism\" (Sujatha/Abraham 2009: 35), least and advocates non-biomedi cal sys- tems and integrates them into the public health sector. The pos itive evalua- tion of Indian medical systems has continued and is visible in India's present medical landscape in the form of the Ministry of AYUSH (an ac ronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy), which promotes medical pluralism and is tasked with the role of protecti ng AYUSH medical systems.18 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16 The term \"Siddha medicine\" appears f or the first time in a government report of 1923, the so -called Usman Report. Before that, it was known as Tam il Medicine or Tamil Ayurveda (S\u00e9bastia 2012a: 166). Krishnamurthy (1984) also show s that Siddha and Ayurveda have only been treated as two di stinct medical systems rel- atively recently. 17 On Ayurveda, cp. Langford 2002; on Siddha medicine, c p. Weiss 2009; for na- turopathy in India, cp. Jansen 2016. 18 The Ministry of AYUSH dates back to the establishmen t of the Department of Indian Systems of Medic ine (ISM) in 1969, to which homeopathy was added in 1995, when it became the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine & Home- opathy (ISM&H). It was renamed the AYUSH Department in 2003, and in 2009 Tibetan medicine was included. In 2014 it was given the sta tus of an independent ministry. However, in spite of the promotion of medical plurali sm, AYUSH med- icines still receive only marginal support. Priya to speak of \"unde mo- cratic pluralism\" (2012: (2014) of \"asymmet- rical conversations\" between different medical systems. For the issue of inequal- ity in accessing these medical services, cp. Broom et al. 2009. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 101 As Broman (1995: 835) points out, \"specialized and advanced education\" is one of the key criteria for distinguishing professions from othe r occupa- tions. Professionalization involves a process of setting up a formaliz ed and standardized education and training system. Retrospectively, the es tablish- ment of the School of Indian Medicine in Chennai in 1924 can be described as the starting point of this process, since it was the first college to teach Indian medicine (Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha) independently of Western medicine (e.g. Arnold 2000: 185; Bala 2007: 103).19 The first college where Siddha medicine could be studied as a separate degree was only opened in 1964 in Palayamkottai, a town in Tamil Nadu (S\u00e9bastia 2012b: 4f).20 \"specialized and advanced education\" (1995: 835) also involved the definition of an orthodox body of knowledge. This meant sanctioning what is considered valid and excluding what is cons idered invalid knowledge, a process which obviously led to the alteration of the knowledge base of the respective occupation (Ranganathan 2013: 925). In the process of the professionalization of Siddha medicine, the te aching and transmission of medical knowledge was turned into a college cours e comprising a set canon of subjects and following a distinct curriculum a nd, as Sujatha points out, \"distinct (Sujat ha 2011: 191).21 Siddha medical training was restructured on the basis of a W estern- style education and modelled along the lines of the biomedical curric ulum, as is obvious from the length of the course, the distinction betwe en under- graduate and postgraduate training, the subjects taught,22 the setting of the teaching, and the way the students are examined.23 This restructuring has had \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 19 Previously, in 1822, a Native Medical Institution wa s opened in Calcutta, which aimed at a hybridized form of the Western and Indian medical systems. It was closed in 1835 (Fischer -Tin\u00e9 2013: 35). 20 Today there are seven Siddha medical colleges in Tami l Nadu and one college in Kerala offering a BSMS degree. Six of them are priva te and the other two gov- ernment ins titutions. 21 The curriculum of the 5.5 -year college program was designed by the CCIM (Cen- tral Council for Indian Medicine), cp. bus.php, July 10, 2016. 22 The BSMS includes subjects such as biochemistry, mic robiology, anatomy and physiology; cf http://www.ccimindia.org/siddha -syllabus.php, July 10, 2016. 23 Jansen shares a similar observation with regard to naturopath y (2016: 15). 102 | Nina Ra geth an effect not only on the form and content of Siddha medicine as a medic al discipline, but also on the practice of the prospective practitioners .24 I ob- served during my fieldwork that Siddha physicians who studied exclusivel y in the college setting often exhibit striking similarities to bio medical doctors: they wear white coats, are equipped with stethoscopes, and speak of meta b- olism, hypertension, and sugar levels in generic biomedical language; also, they are addressed by patients as \"doctor\" and hardly ever as vaittiyar or maruttuvar . Moreover, these practitioners often begin a consultation by checking the patient's blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer, but hardly ever assess the imbalance of the three humors ( ( ni parictaai or ni prttal).25 Also, they send their patients to take X-rays and blood tests in laboratories and prescribe drugs in the same manner as biomedical doctors. The drugs are colorful capsules and s ealed tablets that look very much like biomedical drugs. Furthermore, the profes- sionalization of Siddha medicine involved the establishment of scienti fic so- cieties and associations that were founded as a means to c reate a platform for the exchange of medical knowledge and to institutionalize the scie ntific ideal of transparency.26 The Indian government played a decisive role in the creation of the new medical institution, which leads Sujatha and Abraham to speak of a \"state- induced institutional development\" (2009: 37). They write (2009: 40): \"Th e establishment of various councils, national institutes and drug t esting labor- atories were direct outcomes of the recommendations made by various com- mittees set up by the government.\" One of the major concerns of this \"state- induced institutional development\" was the testing and validation of drugs in accordance with biomedical standards. New regulations concerning the pro- duction of drugs were introduced. One of these regulations requires t hat drugs which are produced for sale on the pharmaceutical market have t o be patented by the Office of Drugs Control and must receive a Good \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 24 Referring to these changes, Sujatha speaks of a proc ess of \"pharmaceuticaliza- tion\" (201 1: 193). 25 On sensing the pulse, Daniel 1984: 115; cp. Siele r 2014: 325 -326. 26 The establishment of scientific societies is a strong example of what Habib and Raina call the \"routinizing [of] a new set of instit utional practices that ele- ments of the modern systems\" ( 2005: 74). Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 103 Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate (S\u00e9bastia 2012a: 1 78-179, 2015: 951). In order to obtain this certificate, the composition of the drug has to comply with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) and Rules (1945), whic h, as Sujatha and Abraham rightly state, subjects \"the ISMs [Indian Systems of Medicine] to the political economy of the laboratory\" (Sujatha/Abra ham 2009: 40- 41) and restricts the agency of the practitioner in the production of the medicine. The role of the government in the process of professional iza- tion also becomes visible with regard to legal regulations concerning the re- quirements for the practitioners. One of these regulations is the Indian Med- icine Central Council Act, introduced in 1970, under which only physicians with the required credentials have the authority to practice medicine (Pay- yappallimana/Hariramamurthi 2012: 284).27 With the introduction of this act, holding an officially recognized certificate became mandatory t o practice Siddha medicine legally, which delegitimizes other forms of knowledge transmission (S\u00e9bastia 2012b: 5).28 Thus, professionalization introduced oc- cupational closure on the basis of a requirement for formal qualification and created a group of professionals who are entitled to practice Sidd ha medicine legally and, vice versa , a group of practitioners who are excluded from the profession because they do not have the documents authorizing them to prac - tice. These government regulations thus replaced other, informal m echa- nisms of occupational closure laid down by the gurukula institution, or, more broadly speaking, the government regulations did not reinforce the authority of the gurukula institution but undermined it. As will become clear in the following reconstruction of my interlocutors' self-understanding, it is this process of the formal professionalization of Siddha medicine that is consti- tutive of the emanation of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 27 This act was preceded by several other registration acts, such as the Medical Reg- istration Acts introduced between 1912 and 1919 in all the pr ovinces of India (Hardiman 2009: 275). 28 Since 1977, the required ce rtificate has been the Bachelor's degree in Siddha Medicine and Surgery (BSMS). 104 | Nina Ra geth 4 THE FIGURE OF THE HE REDITARY SIDDHA PRACTITIONER Using one of Bourdieu's phrases, the reconstruction of my interlocutors' nar- ratives regarding their self-representation provided in the follo wing section takes the form of \"'an account of the accounts' produced by social subjects\" (Bourdieu 1989: 15). It emphasizes especially how my interlocutors con- struct symbolic boundaries, that is, conceptual distinctions which socia l ac- tors deploy to organize their social worlds (Lamont/Moln\u00e1r 2002: 168). In- vestigating symbolic boundaries sheds light, as Lamont and Moln\u00e1r remark, on \"the dynamic dimensions of social relations, as groups compete in the production, diffusion, and institutionalization of alternative systems and principles of classifications\" (ibid: 168). It is this dimension of social rela- tions and the construction of classifications which is ultimatel y of interest here. The analysis of the construction of symbolic boundaries is divide d into two sections. The first part focuses on the \" constitutive outside \" (Hall 2003: 17, emphasis in the original) in the accounts of my interlocutors. The a rgu- ment formulated here is based on the common assumption that \"all ide ntity is differential identity\" (Laclau 1995: 151) and that therefore th e outside is constitutive of the identity concerned. The second part focuses on the appro- priation of symbolic resources in the process of self-fashioning, such a s con- ceptual distinctions or interpretive strategies. Special att ention is given to the fusion of a religious and a scientific semantics in the self-f ashioning of the hereditary Siddha practitioner and to the emphasis on tradition versus i nno- vation. 4.1 The Constitutive Outside My interlocutors distinguish the hereditary Siddha practitioner from three figures and their respective forms of medicine: the biomedical doc tor, the Ayurveda practitioner, and the college-trained Siddha practitioner. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 105 4.1.1 The Biomedical Doctor as the Constitutive Outside All my interviewees, apart from Devanesan, refer to biomedical doctors and biomedicine.29 Their descriptions of biomedicine revolve around a small rep- ertoire of topics on the basis of which they demonstrate Siddha m edicine's alleged superiority over biomedicine. A dominant theme which runs through their accounts is the juxtaposition of biomedicine as a man-made inve ntion is anybody else. Not ['by'] me, nor ['by'] my ancestors nor by anybody else.\"30 It has, he states, a \"divine source.\" My interlocutors describe biomedicine, by c ontrast, as a science developed by human scientists who gradually come up with new technology and new medical formulations that only have a provisional v alid- ity and will eventually be overwritten by new inventions: \"Then the next thing, in allopathy they find out some combi nation. Then, after ten years, what they say is, 'this medicine is not good for this pr oblem, so please avoid this medicine.' But in Siddha medicine what was written three th ousand years back, still I am doing that same medicine. And three thousand years from now, my successor will still be doing this medicine. How miraculous it i s!\" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)31 Another issue which comes up with regard to biomedical drugs is the nature of the drugs themselves. My interlocutors share the view that biom edical drugs are made of chemicals. Anbarasi states, for example: \"Al l are chemi- cal. Not natural. It is a pity what is going on.\" (6.1.2015) Siddha me dical drugs, on the other hand, are held to be composed of natural substance s and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 29 While my interlocutors speak of \"allopathy,\" \"modern medicine\" or \"English medicine,\" I will use the term \"biomedicine,\" which is a common term in aca- demic literature. 30 Mr. Prem Nath practices Siddha medicine in his own clin ic in Thiruvananthapu- ram. He hails from a hereditary Siddha family with a lin eage dating back in his- tory before the Common Era. He has a Diploma in Siddha m edicine. 31 Mrs. Anbarasi practices Siddha medi cine in her own clinic in Coimbatore and runs a business selling drugs to retailers. She has studied in a gurukula and has a Bachelor's degree in Siddha Medicine and Surgery. 106 | Nina Ra geth thus to be in tune with nature. The trope of Siddha medicine's harmony with nature is prominent in all my interlocutors' accounts, and it is a lso visually present on their webpages, as well as in the leaflets and broch ures they pro- vide through icons such as fresh leaves, flowers, roots, and images of ma nual tools for the production of drugs. Biomedicine appears in all the account s (except in Devanesan's) as a counter-example to the naturalness of Siddha medicine. The chemical substances of biomedical drugs are conside red \"poi- son\" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) and are seen source the side effec ts (pak- kaviaivu) of these drugs.32 The characterization of biomedicine as a medi- cine with side effects is present in all my interlocutors' acc ounts (again not in Devanesan's). Kapilan states: \"[...] the problem is the side effects caused by this treatment. One disease will disappear with the medicine, and anot her will arise in another part of the body because of the medicine.\"33 (12.1.2015) Siddha medical drugs, on the other hand, are described as drugs which do not have any adverse effects\u2014provided they are made in the right wa y\u2014be- cause, as stated above, they are believed to be made from natur al substances, or, as my interlocutors also say, they are made in accordance with the pa\u00f1captam theory. This theory comprises the view that the micro- and macro -cosmos are both constituted of the five elements\u2014 earth, water, fire, air, and space\u2014and that accordingly everything that we take in should only comprise these pa\u00f1cap tas. \"So we are using the herbs to prepare the medicine. With the help of pa\u00f1captas only we are treating the patient s. So the herbs have pa\u00f1captas, our bodies have pa\u00f1captas. [...] But allopathy medicines are not made by pa\u00f1captas. Or were they made by pa\u00f1captas? No! Allopathy is made by a company. They mix up che micals and make them i nto a medicine. That is all.\" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) With regard to biomedical drugs, my interlocutors raise another asp ect, namely the curing mechanisms. All my interlocutors (except Devanesan) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 32 This claim can be taken as a reversal of the accusat ions with which their \"gui ld\" is often confronted today: accusations of quackery and of causing harm to people. 33 Mr. Kapilan practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic i n Pollachi. He has stud- ied in a gurukula and has a certificate in Siddha medicine issued by a Siddha associati on. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 107 express the view that biomedicine treats the symptoms while Siddha medi- cine treats the root cause of the disease. \"And in allopathy, I am not blaming it, but in allopathy they are only treating the symptoms. But we are not giving any treatment to the symptoms. We only focus on the root cause. So when the root cause will be gone, tically the p roblem will subside.\" (Rubendran, 6.1.2015)34 4.1.2 The Ayurveda Practitioner as the Constitutive Outside Ayurveda practitioners and Ayurveda medicine appear in all my inter locu- tors' narratives, yet only on the periphery. This is a surprising findi ng, since, during the Tamil revivalist movements of the twentieth century, Ayurve da figured as the quintessential \"other\" of Siddha medicine (cp. Wei ss 2008, 2009). On the basis of this observation, and with Richard Weiss in mind, I am inclined to translate this finding as an expression of a shift in boundary- making. It is noticeable that, when my interlocutors refer to Ayurved a, they do not emphasize the differences between Siddha medicine and Ayurveda in the first place but rather accentuate their similarities. My i nterlocutors stress that the two medical systems are both Indian, that they share diagnost ic proce- dures (Rubendran), medical formulas (Rubendran, Anbarasi, Surendran) concepts about the constitution of the body (Devanesan, Surendran), and that they mainly differ in terms of language (Tamil for Siddha medicine and San- skrit for Ayurveda). However, and this should not be overlooked, at the sam e time they subordinate Ayurveda to Siddha medicine. Some of my interlocu- tors (Surendran, Avalok, Rubendran ) do this by arguing that Siddha is the older and original medicine and that Ayurveda is just a translation of Sid dha medicine into Sanskrit. Most often, however, Ayurveda is subordinated t o Siddha on the basis of the substances used for the medical drugs. Four of my interlocutors describe the use of metals and minerals as one of the quintes- sential and unique characteristics of Siddha medicine, while they describe \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 34 Mr. Rubendran practices Siddha medicine in his own clini c in Coimbatore. He hails from a hereditary Siddha family with a lineage going back fif teen genera- tions. He has a Bachelor's degree in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery. 108 | Nina Ra geth Ayurveda as herbal-based medicine, which they consider less effec tive and not fit for treating chronic and severe diseases. \"And this is another important thing: Siddhars did not only prepare medicine with herbs, but also metals and minerals and salts, byproducts from the sea, shells, all kinds of shells [...]. So our Materia Medica is not only herbs, but also metals -medicine, minerals -medicine. If we look at the books, it is alchemy work . In the whole world until now, nobody did that, nobody else can do it. \" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) On the basis of the same argument, because it is herbal-based medicine that does not require higher knowledge for the pro- duction of drugs. Conversely, he argues that Siddha medical drugs c an only be produced by applying the \"divine method\"35 for the purification of metals and minerals, that is, the method that was discovered by the siddhars, which makes Siddha medicine tvavaittiyam . 4.1.3 The College -Trained Siddha Practitioner as the Constitutive Outside The figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is primarily framed against the figure of the college-trained Siddha practitioner. The latte r is, so to speak, the main \"constitutive outside\" of the hereditary Siddha practiti oner in accounts. In my interlocutors' view, college-trained pra ctition- ers are Siddha practitioners who studied exclusively in a moder n college set- ting. Prem Nath describes them as mic people\" who follow the \"university model.\" Alternatively, they depicted as prac college-trained Sid- dha practitioner is constructed as the negative other of the heredi tary practi- tioner with reference to a number of issues, all of which can be interpreted as expressions of my interlocutors' perceived struggle to have t heir knowledge approved and of the question of what constitutes genuine Siddha \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 35 http://www.siddhavaidyam .com/Principles_of_SiddhaMedicine.html, August 18, 2017. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 109 medical knowledge. Furthermore, my interlocutors share the view that the establishment of the college institution has not contributed to the pre serva- tion of the medical tradition but, on the contrary, poses a danger to its con- tinuation. Kapilan encapsulates this view by stating that the colle practitioners are \"tweaking the original concept\" of Siddha medici ne and that \"therefore there is a danger that people who are bookish are destr oying the real practical tradition of Siddha\" (12.1.2015). This leads him to spe ak of the \"false institutionalization of Siddha medicine,\" which amounts to t he \"sys- tematic destruction of Indian traditional culture.\" My interlocutors share the view that one cannot learn the real Siddha medical knowledge in colleges because colleges are not in posses sion of it. Prem Nath says that colleges do not have access to the \"key books ,\" that is, to the knowledge revealed by the god iva, because this knowledge is kept within the families of hereditary Siddha practitioners. The \"prope r knowledge\" can therefore not be acquired in college. On Prem Nath's webpage it says: \"Today there are recognized Siddha Medical Colleges [which] run under the govern- ment universities where Siddha medicine is taught. Bu t they are running the course with average syllabus [compared] to the knowledge of Traditional Vaidyas. In Siddha Vaidyam [...] many toxic drugs manuf acture [of] bhasmas and chindooras. purification cause m ajor draw -backs in health. Traditional Siddha Physicians are doing effective p urification process. But they hide it as traditional secret and transfer [it] only to the ne xt generatio n.\"36 As this quote shows, my interlocutors are mainly concerned about knowledge that pertains to the production of Siddha drugs that involves the purification of the substances, that is, the transformation of metals and min- erals into medicine. In their view, this purification process is the unmistaka- ble characteristic of Siddha medicine and an essential eleme nt of Siddha practice. Rubendran states that he learnt the production of medicine from his father, which is the only way to master that practice. And Surendr an too states that in college you can only learn how to become a Siddha phys ician, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 36 http://www.siddhavaidyam.com/siddhavaidyam.html , August 18, 2017. 110 | Nina Ra geth you cannot learn how to produce medicine, because, he states, \"[f]or that w e need a guru.\"37 My interlocutors do not just speak of the omission of certain elements of Siddha knowledge, but also of the remaking of Siddha knowledge through the merging of traditional Siddha knowledge with biomedical knowledge. With regard to this remaking, Prem Nath mentions the mixing of moder n anatomy, physiology, and pathology books such as Chaurasia's Anatomy or Hutchinson's Clinical Methods with the classical Siddha literature. Two of my interlocutors (Devanesan, Avalok) also mention the introduction of bi o- medical diagnostic techniques into Siddha practice, such as measur ing blood pressure, taking blood tests, and doing X-rays, instead of assessing the i m- balance of the three humors ( mukkua or tridoa) through the ni prttal (examination of the ni). \"The vaittiyar s who lived here, they healed people in this way. The y would not take a stethoscope and check, no [...]. But now everybody has different techniques. [...] I cannot criticize that. I am only telling you the way how I p refer it. \" (Devanesan, 5.2.2015)38 Furthermore, Devanesan points to the change in how the medicine is dis - pensed. He says that the \"modern practitioner\" prescribes manufac tured medicines which come in capsules, tablets and syrups, and he adds: \"How can you trust that modern medicine? I cannot trust that mo dern medicine. They are putting preservatives. Preservatives are damaging the liver ! So why would we do it like that? This Siddha medicine is meant to be taken naturally. This is how the divine gave it.\" (Devanesan, 5.2.2015) With regard to changes to Siddha medical knowledge through the establish- ment of a college education, Prem Nath (31.12.2014) speaks of the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 37 In this respect, some of my interlocutors mention th e omission of formulas for the production of key drugs in Siddha medicine such as mupp or navap am, which are thought to cure all diseases and even to b estow immortality. 38 Mr. Devanesan practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Pondicherry. He has studied in a gurukula and has a certificate in Siddha medicine issued by a Sidd ha association. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 111 consolidation of a \"fake route\": \"[...] unfortunately I want to say tha t the new government policies like AYUSH and medical universities and e very- thing is going on a fake route.\" In his view, the siddhars transmitte d to hu- manity a complete science which ought to be followed uncompromisingly . He says: \"If you want to teach the exact way, you need to follow e xactly whatever is written in manuscripts, [isn't] it?\" And a littl e later he says: \"Whatever is explained by lord iva to Prvat, by Prvat to Muruka, by Muruka to Akattiyar, that needs to be studied.\" He argues that in college they teach an altered version of the \"divine science,\" which thu s has \"lost the sacredness that was conceived [by] the Siddhars.\"39 Another issue that the majority of my interlocutors bring up is the t ype of knowledge that can be acquired in college. They describe the college as a place that only provides theoretical knowledge and that does not acknowledge the centrality of practical and experiential knowledge t o Siddha medicine. They share the view that ni prttal for diagnosing diseases and the methods of producing drugs cannot be learnt theoretically but only prac- tically by gaining experience from experienced persons. Prem Nat h speaks in this regard of \" aupavam citta vaittiyam cikiccai ,\" which he translates as \"Siddha medicine as the treatment of the experience\" (31.12.2014). The the- oretical knowledge of the schoolbook is not sufficient to become a S iddha practitioner. Kapilan refers to college-trained practitioners as \"bookish peo- ple\" and states that \"there is a danger that people who are booki sh are de- stroying the real practical tradition of Siddha\" (12.1.2015). They pose a dan- ger to the Siddha because they \"cannot prepare Siddha me dicine\" (Kapilan, 12.1.2015), which, however, as mentioned above, is a defining characteristic of Siddha practice. In my interlocutors' view, the Siddha med- ical texts do not contain straightforward instructions for how to pr actice Sid- dha medicine but are written in an encoded manner that is generall y known as paripai (obscure language). Rubendran says: \"The books are full of se- crets, and the experience-people, they find out these secrets. Each and every stra, every poem, every note has some secrets.\" (6.1.2015) It is only through practice that the physician can discover the meaning of the te xts and learn how to practice the medicine properly. This experiential know ledge is not, as Rubendran stresses, written down and can thus only be acquired by \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 39 http://www.devavidya.com/vision.html, September 29 , 2016. 112 | Nina Ra geth learning from an experienced teacher. Apprenticeship and not st udying is thus the appropriate mode of learning. The last dominant theme in the framing of the college-trained pr actitioner that I want to mention revolves around the duration of the study period. Four of my interlocutors point out that the study of Siddha medicine is a long- term commitment, or, as Prem Nath puts it, a \"lifetime enrolment\" (31.12.2014) . A Bachelor's degree in Siddha Medicine and Surgery, by contrast, is com - pleted within only five and a half years, a timeframe within w hich, in my interlocutors' view, Siddha medicine cannot be mastered: \"Definitely it is not enough. It is not enough! How can you learn all those things in five and a half years? In that time we can just lear n the basic things, that's it.\" know iyan? He must learn at least twelve years under the supervision of a guru. Then on ly he is eligible for practice.\" (Suren- dran, 16.1.2015)40 4.2 The Self -Fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner All my interlocutors present themselves as protecting and diss eminating Sid- dha medicine, which is congruent with their view that Siddha medicin e is on the verge of disappearing and that, in order to preserve it, the medicine needs to be spread, both locally and globally. Though my interlocutors agree on t he Tamil character of the medicine\u2014according to the common narrati ve, iva gave the medical knowledge to the siddhars in the Tamil language\u2014t hey also agree that Siddha medicine is not supposed to remain within the Tamil com- munity but is destined to be a global commodity. My interlocutors' eff orts to preserve Siddha medicine, or, as \"to (12.1.2015 ), sometimes directed against bio- medicine, but mainly against Siddha medicine as taught and learnt in Siddha medical colleges. This becomes evident, as I show below, in how they \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 40 Mr. Surendran practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Coimbatore and runs a business selling drugs to retailers. He has stud ied in a gurukula and has a Bachelor's degree in Siddha Medicine and Surgery. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 113 fashion themselves as hereditary practitioners in opposition to the college- trained practitioners and in the specific way they frame the tra ditional Siddha medicine. Among my interlocutors, Prem Nath challenges the college ver- sion of Siddha medicine in the most explicit way, as becomes visible in the figure of the rebel that he enacts:41 \"Sometimes university people have a lot of trouble with me. They are thinking I am a rebel. No, I am not a rebel, but yes I am, this is my blood, this is my tradition, I cannot disobey my ancestors' comments [...].\" (Prem Nath, 31.12.2014) The other interlocutors also fashion themselves as hereditary pra ctitioners in opposition to college-educated Siddha practitioners, a position that finds ex- pression in the criticism they articulate against them, yet they apply a less insurgent rhetoric than Prem Nath. My interlocutors employ four mai n themes in their fashioning of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner and their framing of traditional Siddha medicine. On the basis of thos e four themes, they differentiate more or less explicitly the hereditary Siddha pra c- titioner from the college-trained practitioner who serves them a s a primary source of legitimacy. These four themes share a distinct religious semantics and a strong emphasis on tradition. They are: type of knowledge (man-made versus divine), access to knowledge (college versus gurukula ), the purpose of the medicine (physical versus religious), and the motivation for the prac- tice (money versus karma). 4.2.1 Type of Knowledge My interlocutors differentiate between divine knowledge and man- made knowledge, portraying traditional Siddha medical knowledge as belonging to the former and the college version of Siddha medicine as well as biomed- icine to the latter. As mentioned above, my interlocutors classify Siddha medicine as divine medicine, tvavaittiyam , because of the medicine's prov- enance: Siddha medicine is not seen as an invention but as a divi ne discovery, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 41 Prem Nath enacts the role of the rebel not only in the in terview he gave me, but also in interviews on local TV channels. See, for instance, his interview on Surya TV (Devavidya, 2015). 114 | Nina Ra geth that is, as a discovery of the siddhars, the \"godly people\" (Anbaras i). On Prem Leaf Manuscripts says [ sic] that the Siddha System of medicine was first taugh t by Lord Shiva to his wife Goddess Parvathy. Goddess Parvathy in turn passed on all these knowledge to her son Lord Muruga. Lord Muruga the n taught Siddha Medicine to his favorite disciple Sage Agasthya. It was from Agasthy a and his disciples, the 18 Siddhars, the great wisdom of Siddha spread to what it is today. \"42 The divine nature of Siddha medical knowledge is expressed in differe nt ways, the most dominant being its characterization as absolut e knowledge. Avalok, for example, speaks of Siddha medicine as a complete body of knowledge that the siddhars have obtained and transmitted, and Anbarasi says in a similar vein: \"Everything is there. You cannot go anywhere from here. Every thing is written. Eve- rything is finished. Everything is over. There is no n eed to find new things. Everything is written. You just have to take and do a nd give. It will be effective. \" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) Prem Nath also speaks of the completeness of Siddha medicine, his point being that it is flawless and unerring knowledge. In this connection, he com- plains that, if a treatment is unsuccessful, college-trained pr actitioners blame the medicine for the failure. However, as he also says: \"There is no mistake happening in the science, only in the scientist.\" (31.12.2014) The absolute character of the medicine is also expressed on the basis of its timelessness . As I have already mentioned, Siddha medicine is contrasted with biomedicine on the basis that Siddha medicine will never correct itself . Surendran states: \"The medicines present today will disappear in five years. But our medicines, no one will ever cha nge them. Even one million years after. It was their [the Siddhar s'] 29, 2016. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 115 Furthermore, as I mentioned before, Prem Nath argues that humans are not supposed to change anything in the Siddha knowledge, since any alterati on of divine knowledge is a corruption of the absolute knowledge, an argument he uses to challenge the college version of Siddha medicine: \"If I invent something, it is a fake statement.\" (31.12.2014) He says that he ha s \"no right\" to customize the knowledge because he is not the creator of the knowl edge, but only a medium who transfers this knowledge on to others: \"I am a n agent. The masters are above me, beyond my control.\"43 Prem Nath thus demands proper respect for it: \"[...] when a god gives you a chance to know the se things, don't neglect, don't challenge the god; you have to obey the order s of divine source.\" Anbarasi and Surendran too stress that it is crucial that they exactly follow \"whatever is written in the literature\" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) in order to produce good medicine. 4.2.2 Access to Knowledge My interlocutors claim to have access to the complete Siddha k nowledge be- cause they have studied in a gurukula with hereditary Siddha physicians, who are believed to hold the real knowledge, unlike the colleges. The \"key books,\" as Prem Nath notes, are in the hands of hereditary practitioners, and the knowledge they contain is only transmitted through hereditary line ages: \"blood is thicker than water,\" he says proverbially to indicate t hat Siddha knowledge is not shared with outsiders but remains within the fa mily (31.12.2014). The importance of the sense of belonging to a lineage of he- reditary Siddha practitioners is also reflected his webpage: \"Prem Nath hails a traditional Siddha family dating back to pre -british [ sic] era in India. His family migrated to Kerala from Pandi Kingdom of Tamil Nadu on the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 43 Prem Nath is reflexive about innovative elements in his own practices, such as running a website, providing consultancy through skype, appearing on TV, or of- fering an online Siddha training program. He applies the analogy of \"old wine in a new bottle\" to point out that the form of knowledge tran smission can be altered if this is beneficial for the quest to preserve divine know ledge, though the knowledge itself ought not to be changed. 116 | Nina Ra geth request of the king Cheraman Perumal to provide Varmam training44 to his military as well as to serve as Siddha physicians in the cou rt. [...] The most revered vaidyam of his lineage is the Velitheriyil Kesavan Vaidyan about whom even poets have sung.\"45 His webpage also states that his family possesses texts composed by the si d- dhars: \"He hails from a traditionally reputed family of Siddha Physicians. They have [a] huge collection of old secret manuscripts about Siddha S ci- ence.\"46 Avalok too claims to belong to a hereditary Siddha family in the f ifth generation, and he states that he learnt Siddha medicine with his grandfath er and that the Siddha manuscripts which he showed me belong to his fam ily. Surendran also states that he stayed with different hereditary practi tioners in order to learn the art of medical production, which is kept secret from out- siders. And Rubendran points out decisively that he belongs to a lin eage of hereditary practitioners. He opens his account by saying that he belong s to the fifteenth generation of practitioners in his family. The elem ent of lineage is also strongly present on his webpage. The \"About Us\" section on the webpage starts with the following sentences: \"The founder of Agasthiyar Siddha Ayurveda Hospital was t he Great Legend Late Dr. Sri Brahmananda Swamigal. He was born [...] as the 4th son of Sivadha Ach ary, a well-known traditional siddha physician and Ammaluammal. He got interes ted in medicine at the age of 8 yrs. So he started his Guru kulam period under his respectful master Sri Velayuthampillai from Thiruvettar in Kanyak umari District. \"47 The webpage also informs the reader that Dr. Sri Brahmananda Sw amigal, who is Rubendran's father, also \"gathered much knowledge of tradit ional Siddha medicine from his father\" and that he had two other gurus. Rubendran stresses that he has studied Siddha medicine since childhood under the guid- ance of his father and thus learnt how to produce drugs, which is impossible in the college setting: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 44 \"Varma training\" refers to varmakkalai , the art of the vital spots, a technique which constitutes a sub -branch of Siddha medicine; cp. Sieler 2015, http://www.devavidya.com/about.html , 47 http://agasthiyarsiddhaayurveda.com /aboutus.html , June 2, 2017. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 117 \"Nobody in any university or any college can teach these medicin e preparation or purification, because they don't know. They don' t know. The teachers, they don't know how to prepare. That is what I told you. Many of the poems, they ha ve a secret. Those secrets are never taught in the colleges, neve r taught in the universities, that is, only hereditary people, they only know. \" (Ruben dran, 6.1.2015) This quote shows that from my interlocutor's point of view access to knowledge depends not only on physical access to the manuscripts, but also on access to their meaning, which requires someone with the experti se to decode the encrypted information contained in the Siddha poems. 4.2.3 Purpose of the Medicine A further recurring theme is the purpose of the medicine. Four of my i nter- locutors express the view that Siddha medicine's ultimate objective is not to cure a physical sickness, but to serve as a means to unify with god, that is, to attain liberation, a view which is not \"their own,\" but which is present i n the classical Siddha literature.48 They share the view that the siddhars have passed on a medical system which guarantees longevity.49 Kapilan even speaks of \"deathlessness\" (12.1.2015 ). Longevity in turn allows for more time to complete the process of spiritual perfection, which will ultimately lead, as Devanesan says, to \"a connection between the soul and the divine\" (5.2.2015 ), by which he means liberation ( jvamukti ). The theme of libera- tion is most distinctly discussed by Anbarasi, who makes the str ong point that wellbeing is a precondition for liberation. Siddha medicine, according to Anbarasi, is a means to purify the body and the mind, which is needed for doing good things in society and is, in turn, a step towards one's merging with god. In her view what might appear to be a preventive and rejuvenating medicine serves a religious purpose. She says: \"So those who are strong in physical, they will reach god, they will do service to the people with their healthy body, so they will reach god. This is t he main aim of our Siddhars. \" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 48 Cp., for instance, Zvelebil 1973: 29. 49 They are referring to kyakapa, a major subfield of Siddha medicine which teaches technique s for the prolongation of life. 118 | Nina Ra geth And elsewhere she states: \"If our body is healthy only, we can do, with the help of this body only we can do service to the society [...]. We will become part of g od in future. That is the main thing of the Siddhars. \" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) 4.2.4 Motivation for the Practice The fourth dominant theme in the fashioning of traditional Siddha medicine that I wish to highlight revolves around the question of the motivation for carrying out this medical practice. All my interlocutors express the view that a main characteristic of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is that he or she is not driven by entrepreneurial motives but rather practices Siddha medi cine out of a sense of duty. They all present themselves as working for t he preser- vation of Siddha medicine, which they describe as their duty towards human- ity and their tradition. Devanesan, for example, speaks of it being his duty to protect Siddha medicine from disappearing, and Avalok states that he makes great efforts to share his knowledge with other traditional physi cians in order to preserve it. Prem Nath too describes his Siddha medical activities as a duty, an idea he connects with the supposedly divine nature of the medicine. He states that Siddha medicine was \"developed for human beings\" and that he therefore wants to turn the secretly kept knowledge into \"a public prop- erty\" and make it accessible to the people (31.12.2014). He states that this i s a duty which was given to him by god: \"Without the grace of god and master, we cannot do it [practice t he medicine]; if god opens a gateway to the system, we have to enter it, realize i t, not for you, but for your people.\" (Prem Nath, 31.12.2014) Anbarasi equates duty with karma: a duty, it i s karma\" (6.1.2015 ), and she goes on to say that she does her Siddha medical work o ut of a sense of karma, without any financial motivation. Four of my interlocu- tors express the view that executing a (divine) duty should not be a mea ns of making money. Prem Nath, for example, states that there \"cannot be a busi- ness motivation; money is wrong motivation,\" and elsewhere he says that \"healing is not [...] for money. It has a divine, a divine source, a divine vi- sion\" ((31.12.2014). And finally, my interlocutors contrast their non-Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 119 entrepreneurial motivations with the motivations of the college- trained Sid- dha practitioners, which they unanimously describe as being financial in na- ture. Devanesan says, for example: \"The modern way is, it is a com mercial way, you know, [it is] business\" (5.2.2015). In my interlocutors' view , the quintessential materialization of the commercialization of Siddha medicine is the pharmaceutical companies that are competing for money. Anbara si states: \"Another big company is INCOPS, a government company in Ch ennai. But the INCOPS medicine, they are making them for commercial purpose. They are supplying all primary hea lth centers all over Tamil Nadu. [...] But they are go ing commercial. Myself, we are not commercial; our medicine should act well [...], so we are concen- trating on the quality of the medicine. \" (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) While my interlocutors describe the college-trained practition er and pharma- ceutical companies as prioritizing economic profit over quality, they fashion themselves as giving the utmost importance to quality and as h aving no in- terest in financial profit. 5 SEMANTIC POSITIONING IN A STRATEGIC ACTION FIELD 5.1 Positioned Semantics The finding of the similarities and overlaps in my interlocutors' accounts could be interpreted in different ways, such as mere coincidence, t he result of the particular interview situation, or the reproduction of a domina nt dis- cursive strand. The finding could also be viewed as an expression of t he shared structural constraints within which the accounts are cons tructed, which indeed is the interpretation I suggest applying. I will argue f or this interpretation on the basis of Bourdieu's proposition that \"[...] social space is so constructed that agents who occupy sim ilar or neighboring positions are placed in similar conditions and subjected to simila r conditionings, and therefore have every chance of having similar dispositions and interests, and thus of producing practices that are themselves similar.\" (Bourdieu 198 9: 17) 120 | Nina Ra geth Accordingly, I adopt the position that my interlocutors internalize the ir struc- tural conditions and enact them in their practices, thus producing simila r se- mantic patterns which become apparent in their accounts. This B our- dieuesque stance that the individual is socially constituted does not imply that the individual does not \"possess the necessary properties\" to structure the field him- or herself (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 107). According to Bourdieu, the individual is both socially structured by the field and als o ac- tively structures the field.50 I go with this proposition in so far as I do not consider my interlocutors as mere \"epiphenomena of structures\" (Honne th et al. 1986: 41), nor regard their semantic construction of the figure of the he- reditary Siddha practitioner as an act of tacit reproduction of wh at the objec- tive structures allow to be articulated. Rather, I suggest that my interlocutors recognize and reproduce symbols of authority in their self-fashioning while also consciously reconfiguring them, at least partially, that is, within the structuring framework of their social position. I understand their self-fash- ioning in this sense as \"regulated improvisations\" (Bourdieu 1990: 59), a term which interweaves the embodiment of objective structures with human agency. What are these symbols of authority, and how are they reconfigured in my interlocutors' accounts? The most dominant symbol of authority is sci- ence and biomedicine. As I have already mentioned, the professionalizat ion of Siddha medicine meant the adaptation of the Siddha medical tra dition to the biomedical paradigm and the introduction of the secular, scientifi c ra- tionale as the yardstick of its validity. Clearly, my interlocutor s recognize the biomedical paradigm. The majority of them frame Siddha medicine as a sci - ence; they speak of the efficacy of their drugs, provide catalogues w ith treat- ments and medication to their patients, and use a biomedical vocab ulary to describe diseases. However, they also interweave a religious semantics with the scientific semantics and in doing so reconfigure the notion of science. In their accounts Siddha medicine is not just a science, it is a divin e science, a science, moreover, with absolute validity and completeness, a scienc e that has not been invented by mortal scientists but was discovered by the siddhars. And what are the structural conditions to which the fashioning of the fig- ure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is subjected? As has hopeful ly \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 50 Kaldewey (2015: 104) uses the term \"co -construction\" to describe the relationship between the subject's habitus and the social field. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 121 become clear in the preceding sections, I argue that the semanti c figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner emerged as a reaction to the professional- ization of Siddha medicine. The specific fashioning of this figure can be read as an expression of their perceived struggle to preserve and dissemi nate their knowledge and practice with the authority of which it has been depriv ed in the process of the professionalization of Siddha medicine. As I stated ab ove, the professionalization of Siddha medicine induced, at least norm atively, a standardization of the medical system. This led to the creation of a more ho- mogenized version of Siddha medicine and to the delegitimization of c ertain forms of knowledge and practice. I argue that it is my interlocutors' experi- ence of the marginalization of their knowledge which leads them t o formu- late narratives that confront the dominant version of Siddha medicine. Thus, their accounts can be read as alternative narratives that on the one hand rec- ognize the scientific paradigm, yet on the other hand interweave a r eligious semantics with the scientific semantics, producing counterhege monic ac- counts as a result. So why, one might ask, do religious semantics and tradition figure so prominently in these counterhegemonic accounts? Generally speaking, inter- pretative social scientists are wary of asking for explanati ons because they carry an air of positivism and determinism at worst and provide a reductionist analysis at best (Charmaz 2006: 126). Nevertheless, I will point to one pos- sible explanation for the distinct delineation of the hereditary Siddha practi- tioner in my interlocutors' accounts. I suggest that the rhetoric of religion and tradition is particularly effective as a symbolic resource because the col- lege version of Siddha medicine prioritizes a scientific over a religious l ogic and uses a secular, scientific rationale as the yardstick for its validity, or to put it more generally, because the professionalization of Siddha medicine entailed a secularization of the Siddha system. The government's recognition of Siddha medicine as an Indian medicine and its integration into t he AYUSH ministry alongside other medical systems\u2014and not, for exampl e, into the Ministry of Culture\u2014happened alongside its \"scientification. \" By emphasizing religious elements in the depiction of the \"real\" Siddha medi- cine, my interlocutors accentuate exactly those elements that are absent from their constitutive outside. Furthermore, the college version of Siddha me di- cine is not guarded by a religious authority but by a secularized medic al pro- fession. The representatives of the college version of Siddha med icine do not appear as religious experts, but rather as medical experts who are close to the 122 | Nina Ra geth biomedical profession and not to any religious group or community. Hence, the representatives of the college version of Siddha medicine are not inter- ested in participating in a religious discourse and therefore do not pose a challenge to my interlocutors' religious strategy: the medical aut hority will not question my interlocutors' religious semantics or confront it with a n al- ternative religious interpretation, which makes it a powerful strategy. Finally, reference to religion, whether by emphasizing its divine provenance, stre ss- ing the sacredness of the knowledge or introducing concepts such as jvamukti , grants my interlocutors a degree of stability and independence which they would not acquire if they were trying to authorize their knowledge by obtaining the backing of other medical entities such as th e WHO or medical research institutes. Reference to religion is un problematic and is favored because religion appears as an independent entity. T his is par- ticularly true of the Hindu religion, which is the source of my in terlocutors' claims to legitimacy: there is no higher or centralized reli gious authority in the Hindu religion which could challenge my interlocutors' narratives, and the religious figures they draw on are the gurus, the siddhars and iva, who, however, are both absent and invisible.51 5.2 Competition for Power Shmuel Eisenstadt states concisely that processes of instit utionalization en- tail \"the creation and definition of norms to regulate the major units of social behavior and organization,\" as well as the \"criteria according t o which the flow of resources is regulated between such units, and sanctions to ensure that such norms are upheld\" (1964: 235f). It is hardly surprising that the cre- ation, definition, and sanctioning of norms involves struggles over power be- cause these practices set standards which marginalize and exc lude certain actors. The present section deals with these power struggles. What is meant by power and power struggles? A social field in t he Bour- dieusque relational view is a \" field of struggle\" (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 101, emphasis in the original) in which the actors strive to mainta in or im- prove their relative positions. The relationship between different posi tions is structured on the basis of the distribution of the power that is va lid within a particular social field (ibid: 97). Possessing power encompasses t he authority \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 51 For a discussion of the role of the guru in Hinduism, cp. Mlecko 1982. Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 123 to grant or refuse access to resources and to decide about the incl usion of people in and their exclusion from \"the game\". Bourdieu speaks here of \"symbolic is, the \"power of 'world-making'\" (ibid : 22). It is this struggle for symbolic power that is at stake in the a ccounts of my interlocutors, the struggle over the power to formulate criteria of legiti- macy, competence, and validity. Bourdieu equates power metaphorically with capital, a concept that he extends from material to intangible resource s. He argues that the unequal distribution of capital structures the arrangem ent in the field and that the possession of power coincides with the pos session of capital (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 97). Bourdieu identifies four key types of capital, the four \"fundamental powers\" (1989: 17) of economic, cultural, so- cial, and symbolic capital, which are relationally linked to the conc epts of field and habitus in his theoretical framework. Capital is fiel d-specific, mean- ing that the different types of capital become effective in differ ent fields. \"Fields designate arenas,\" as Swartz paraphrases Bourdieu's sta nce, \"where specific forms of capital are produced, invested, exchanged, and acc umu- lated\" (1996: 78). I want to argue that it is the production, inve stment, ex- change, and accumulation of cultural capital that is at stake i n the present case of the Siddha medical field.52 In his numerous writings, Bourdieu uses the concept of cultural capital in different ways, giving it a polys emic char- acter. Yet, broadly speaking, it can be described as a concept that pinpoint s cultural resources as the basis for social inclusion and a mea ns to improve one's social position. Swartz (1996: 75-76) states: \"His point is to sugg est that culture in the broadest sense of the term) can become a powe r resource.\" According to Bourdieu, cultural capital appears in three different type s. It exists in an incorporated form, that is, in the form of embodied knowledge, of cultivated dispositions, or the habitus which a person has acquired (Bour- dieu 1992: 55). Secondly, it exists in an objectified form, that is, in the form of material goods which make cultural capital materially trans mittable (Bourdieu 1992: 59). Finally, it exists in an institutionalized form, that is, in \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 52 In the eyes of Bourdieu, application of the term \"cul tural capital\" might appear inappropriate here because he uses the term to denote signals which stem fro m the dominant culture. However, I am using the term to denote not that their cul- tural capital reflects the \" r\u00e9pertoire of high status cultural signals\" (Lamont and Lareau 1988:161, emphasis in the o riginal), but that they have competence in the repertoire of \"marginal high status signals\" (ibid: 157). 124 | Nina Ra geth educational credentials which sanction the incorporated capital (Bourdieu 1992: 61). Thus, cultural capital, unlike economic capital, does not follow an economic rationale and does not generate an economic profit in the fi rst in- stance, but a symbolic value. The symbolic value is typically expres sed in official nominations such as titles, recognized qualifications, and certifica- tions which generate prestige, honor, or recognition (Bourdieu 1989: 21). If we analyze the accounts of my interlocutors under these conditi ons, we see that Siddha medicine appears as cultural capital in their accounts, yet that they create an alternative version of cultural capital to the domina nt form. In my interlocutors' discursive reality, the embodiment of knowledge generates prestige, honor, or recognition, yet it is not the accumulation of c ollege knowledge but the accumulation of hereditary, traditional Siddha knowledge. The latter knowledge finds expression in an objectified form, in mate rial ob- jects which are not college books but old manuscripts. And the here ditary Siddha medicine appears as institutionalized cultural capital, not in the form of college diplomas attesting to college training, but in the form of member- ship of a gurukula which sanctions their claim to possess the \"real\" Siddha knowledge. The elements which act in my interlocutors' accounts as cultural capital correspond to those elements which are excluded from the c ollege version of Siddha medicine. My interlocutors' alternative cultural ca pital is knowledge which is not tied to a modern educational institution, but to tr adi- tionally authoritative persons and lineages. My interlocutors refuse to acknowledge the capital of the college institution and construct ins tead the hereditary knowledge that is not certified by a BSMS as an alternative capi- tal. This alternative capital serves them as a resource for the power with which they strive to improve their position in the field. 5.3 Strategic Semantics I suggest conceptualizing the semantic construction of the figure of the he- reditary Siddha practitioner as the expression of a strategy in a social field. Bourdieu's term \"strategy\" is far from being a voluntaristic and subjective pursuit of unrestricted freedom in a deliberate improvisation. Swartz (1996: 76) states concisely: \"Bourdieu's actors pursue strategies but not as con- scious maximizers of limited means to achieve desired ends.\" A strategy is Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 125 tied to the game in which it is played out and connotes \"a feel for the game\" (Lamaison/Bourdieu 1986: 111).53 Examining my interlocutors' accounts, I suggest that they pursue a strat- egy of heresy and that they speak from the semantic position of the ch al- lenger. Moreover, I suggest that they position themselves in oppositi on to the college-educated practitioner, who figures as the incumbent in the social field. The analytical distinction between the challenger and the incumbent has been introduced by Fligstein and McAdam (2012) in their analysis of the workings of strategic action fields, which is their own conceptual de velop- ment of Bourdieu's concept of field.54 They argue that strategic action fields are sites of constant rearrangements: \"In short, we expect str ategic action fields to always be in some sort of flux, as the process of conte ntion is ongo- ing and the threats to an order always present to some degree. \" (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 13) Responsible for this flux are the two fi gures of the challenger and incumbent, which (together with the governance units) compose a strategic action field.55 Incumbents are the actors \"who wield dis- proportionate influence within a field and whose interests and views tend to be heavily reflected in the dominant organization of the strategic action field\" (ibid: 13). It is the incumbents' interests which structure the field. Challe ng- ers, on the other hand, occupy a less influential position within the fie ld. Ac- cording to Fligstein and McAdam, challengers \"recognize the nature of the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 53 With this stance, Bourdieu distinguishes his own con cepts from rational action theory and stresses that actors' choices are tacit and di spositional and are deter- mined by their socialization and the opportunities a nd constraints provided by the field in which they act. 54 Fligstein and McAdam define a strategic action field as a \"constructed mesolevel social order in which actors (who can be individual or collective) are attuned to and interact with one another on the basis of shared (which i s not to say consen- sual) understandings about the purposes of the field, relationships to others in the field (including who has power and why), and the rules gover ning legitimate ac- tion in the field\" (2012: 9). 55 The analytical distinction between incumbent and cha llenger can be traced back to Bourdieu's differentiation between conservation strategy and strategy of heresy (1993: 73). According to Bourdieu, conserva tion strategies are followed by the orthodox, those who aim at the consolidation of the social order, where as strate- gies of heresy are pursued by the heterodox, those whose aim is its subversion. 126 | Nina Ra geth field and the dominant logic of incumbent actors,\" but formulate an alterna- tive version of the social field and their position within it (ibid: 13 ). I argue that the circumstances generated by the professionaliza tion of Siddha medicine lead my interlocutors to articulate an alternative version of the social order to secure for themselves a position in the social field. In this alternative version, they disparage the knowledge of the college-t rained prac- titioner as corrupted, whereas they assess their own knowledge as being of divine provenance and hence flawless. They claim that they learnt the \"real\" Siddha medicine from practitioners who stand in a lineage of heredita ry Sid- dha physicians who trace their origin ultimately back to the siddhars . Clearly, my interlocutors' semantic strategy does not aim at consolidating the social order. On the contrary, they try to reframe the social order in a w ay that is profitable to them. In this sense, I argue that their self-fashioni ng as heredi- tary Siddha practitioners and their devaluation of the latter's knowledge is to be interpreted as attempts to attain a different status in the social f ield. Their claim to belong to a lineage of hereditary Siddha physicians and the distinct stylization of traditional Siddha knowledge serve them as weapons w ith which to counter the dominant position in the field and the dominant narra - tive. My interlocutors need a \"weapon\" in order to maintain and bring i nto the present their understanding of Siddha medicine, in which lineage is an integral part. Only if the element of lineage is accepted as a re levant feature of the medical tradition can my interlocutors survive and thrive. 6 CONCLUSION From my interlocutors' point of view, the recognition of the Siddha medical system by the Indian government and its integration into the public hea lth sector does not favor the medicine's preservation, nor does it have an em- powering effect on Siddha practitioners. On the contrary, they argue th at it has corrupted the divine medicine. Furthermore, they argue that recent de- velopments have undermined their authority and restricted them in thei r agency, subjecting them to a multitude of regulations. This is a common as- sessment made by my interlocutors, who fashion themselves as he reditary Siddha practitioners. However, from an analytical perspective it can be ar- gued that it was precisely the formal professionalization of Siddha medicin e that created the conditions under which the semantic figure of the hereditar y Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 127 Siddha practitioner could emerge. The conditions created by the profession- alization of Siddha medicine allow Siddha practitioners like my i nterlocutors to position themselves in relation to college-trained practiti oners and to fash- ion their self-image in opposition to them. The figure of the hereditary prac- titioner thus appears as a counterpoint to the college-trained pra ctitioner. Though the hereditary practitioner opposes the college-educated pract itioner, they stand in a symbiotic relationship. It is only in this opposition that the religious semantics becomes effective and the figure of the here ditary Siddha practitioner becomes meaningful. Though the heterodox strategy of the chal- lenger and the orthodox strategy of the incumbent are two distinct stra tegies, they need to be seen as mutually constitutive: \"Orthodoxies,\" as Swar tz puts it (1996: 80), \"call into existence their heterodox reversals by t he logic of distinction that operates in cultural fields.\" Obviously, this argum ent does not aim to make the dread expressed by my interlocutors less real or less valid. However, it does deconstruct their accounts as discursiv e strategies and reminds us of their historical contingency. The argument stres ses that the semantic construction of the hereditary Siddha practitioner aims at reconst i- tuting the epistemic hierarchies. Accordingly, I propose that the he reditary Siddha practitioner be conceptualized as following a strategy of he resy or the strategy of a challenger, both of which aim to improve the challenger 's social position in the field. Moreover, I suggest their narratives, whic h give space to religion and emphasize tradition, should be read as a mode of cult ural pro- duction through which they attempt to attain a different status in t he social field. The adoption of a religious semantics and the emphasis on tr adition become effective in this strategy because my interlocutors pos ition them- selves in opposition to an \"other\" who lacks those very qualities.

Ayurveda and Discursive Formations between Religion, Medicine and Embodi ment A Case Study from Germany Antony George Pattathu ABSTRACT This article examines the discursive formations of A yurveda as a healing practice that is entangled between religion and medicine, along with its p otential for religious em- bodiment. Looking at the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany and its treatment by different academic disciplines, the article addre sses the positions of Ayurveda practitioners in relation to religion and m edicine, showing how this affects them and the potential fo r religious embodiment in the interactions and relatio nship between practitioner and patient. In this regard , the doctrine of the Doshas in Ayur- veda plays a crucial role in its representation as the epitome of holistic healing. It will be shown that the no tion of religious embodiment and the positions of the practitio ners are constantly involved in processes of negotiation correlated with flexibility of posi- tioning within the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, relig ion, and medicine.1 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 This article is a translated and adapted version of \"Ayurveda als Aushandlungsort religi\u00f6ser Verk\u00f6rperung? und Therapiemarkt. 134 | Antony George Pattathu 1 INTRODUCTION In Germany, Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing healing practices in the field of complementary and alternative medicine or CAM.2 Based on the In- dian cultural context and its historical development, Ayurveda is often l inked to spirituality or religion in the study of religious approaches a nd debates (cp. Koch 2005a; Knoblauch 2009; L\u00fcddeckens 2018). In particular, Ayurveda's connection with New-Age influences and questions regarding the authentic- ity of its practice have been discussed 2001). Accordingly, studies have been published in the disciplines of religious studies, anthropology, sociology and medicine ad- dressing the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and me dicine (cp. Chopra 2008 ; Engler 2003; Langford 2002; Warrier 2008, 2011). The increase in alternative healing practices3 has to be understood as a reaction to transformations and reforms in health-care systems (Fr ank 2004: 32; L\u00fcddeckens 2012: 288). The historical dissemination of the doctrine of the separation of mind and body (Cartesian dualism) within biomedici ne4 has created a need for alternatives on the market. CAM therapies, with their ho- listic conceptions, fill this gap and are becoming increasingly att ractive (Kai- ser 2001: 16). With this development as a backdrop, we can observe the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2 T he World Health Organization (WHO) defines CAM as follows: \" The terms 'complementary medicine' or 'alternative medicine' are use d interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They re fer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own traditio n and are not inte- grated into the dominant health care system. \" This is consistent with Cant and Sharma, for whom CAM can also be understood as \"forms of healing that depend on knowledge bases distinct from that of biomedi cine and which, as such, do not share the special legitimation that the state has confe rred upon biomedicine \" (1999: 5). The term itself is one of the problem s that CAM s face. 3 Cp. L\u00fcddeckens in this volume. 4 Here the word \"biomedicine \" refers to the dominant form of medicine that is dis- persed globally and that in Germany is designated as Schulmedizin . This term is used in medical anthropology to refer to biological and pathophysiological per- spectives on the human body and to emphasize the norm ative an d technological implications that are inscribed into biomedicine's history and development. For an overview of this discussion , cp. Lock and Nguyen 2010. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 135 boundaries between religion and medicine shift. Territories that f ormerly fell mainly within the scope of medicine have increasingly been addresse d by religion and vice versa (cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2012). These shifting boundaries are influenced by the historical development of both categories in the context of \"scientific authority, capitalist commodification of medicine, a nd colonial- ism and postcolonialism\" (Klassen 2017: 403). This also affects the self-un- derstanding of practitioners in both fields, and there is an increa sing boom in religious therapeutics (Fields 2001: 2 ; Kaiser 2001; Koch 2005a: 24). Ayurveda is entangled exactly within this field of shifting boundaries be- tween religion and medicine, as it caters to the need for an alternative to the biomedical system that goes beyond the separation of mind and body. Thi s entanglement is inscribed into the holistic healing approach of Ayurveda that is rooted in the doctrine of the Doshas.5 This doctrine has the potential for religious embodiment within Ayurveda and locates it in the discursive f ield constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine.6 Here religious embodiment is understood as a process that is negoti ated between the practitioner, the patient, and their surroundings. In this proces s the body becomes the medium between the inner and outer worlds and osc il- lates between processes of subjective perception and objectificat ion (cp. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5 Discussion of the meaning of the Doshas forms a discourse in its own right within Ayurveda , with different positions and philological interpretations (Heck mann 2003 : 35; Mittwede 1998 : 89-91). In relation to the ethnographic research de- scribed in section 2 below, I will provide an explanation of the Do shas based on a German Ayurveda textbook that is lin ked to practitioners in th is field. According to this textbook the Doshas can be understood as forms o f energ y that constitute and guide the body's physical and psychological processes. In their materiality the different Doshas of Vata, Pitta and Kapha are based o n the elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether. They can be found in dif ferent parts of the body in dif- ferent concentrations and are characterized by different qualities (e.g. Vata has the quality of movement). Depending on whether the Dosha s are in balance or not, they can cause different illnesses or can cure. They can be affected by medi- cines, nutrition and behavior (Heckmann 2003 : 35-40). 6 This discursive field, which is addressed in this study with r egard to the possibil- ities for religi ous embodiment in the healing practices of Ayurveda , is conceptu- ally based on an approach to discourse influenced by Michael B ergunder (2008: 491, 2011: 19), Stuart Hall (2011), and Judith Butler (1997, 1999). 136 | Antony George Pattathu Csordas 1990; Sch\u00fcler 2015; Klinkhammer/Tolksdorf 2015). The and practitioners, the aesthetic setting, thei r preconceived imaginations, and their knowledge of Ayurveda are the prerequisites for this process.7 Genealogically the article will trace positionalities in the field in the light of historical developments. This will be done to decipher the ways in which Ayurveda is constructed, articulated, and performed by the actors in the field, rather than looking at the origins of Ayurveda to determine whether it is re- ligion or medicine. According to Butler (1999: xxix), \"genealogy investi - gates the political stakes in designating as an origin and cause those identity categories that are in fact the effects of institutions, prac tices, discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin. The task of this inquiry is to ce nter on\u2014 and decen ter\u2014such defining institutions.\" Which attributes and characteris- tics are ascribed to Ayurveda by different authorities in the f ield? What does this mean for practitioners who position themselves in relation to religion and medicine, and how does this enable or prevent religious embodiment within Ayurveda? With regard to different authorities or actors in the field, connec tions be- tween academic statements on Ayurveda and the emic perspective must be examined because they determine the positions of the practitioner s. The question of religious embodiment in Ayurveda is connected to the self-un- derstandings of its practitioners,8 who convey their own understandings of Ayurveda to their patients and enable or restrict practices tha t can be per- ceived as a form of religious embodiment. Given the specific historical con- text of Ayurveda in Germany, certain academic positions on whether A yur- veda is religion or medicine, taken together with the perspectives of its prac- titioners, will reveal interferences between Ayurveda and reli gious \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7 The conceptual framework of this article a nd the material available only allow a few examples to be provided of a form of religious embodiment in Ayurveda rooted in different conceptions of Ayurveda by different practitioners, the emic perspective of its patients and the actors in this discursive field. 8 The terminology practitioner is specifically chosen to grasp the wide spectrum and diversity of Ayurveda practitioners. Compared to terminologies like therapist or healer the whole range of practitioners from medical doctors t o nutritionists can be integrated and the terminology also integrates the possibility of m ultiple qualifications, as the following paragraphs will show. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 137 embodiment. This will help us map a first layer of the relevant discursive networks and structures in both the academic and the emic perspec tive in relation to Ayurveda and religion in Germany. The different conceptualizations of Ayurveda by practitioners, acade m- ics, journalists, and other authorities in the field, who constitute a discourse community, can be understood as a discursive network held together through communication, language, practices, and the institutionalization of Ayur- veda, religion, and medicine in Germany. These articulations and co nceptu- alizations of Ayurveda as a form of \"identity marker\" in the sen se of Michael Bergunder and Stuart Hall9 take place in different discursive fields (media, science, law, politics, etc.). The different fields constantl y overlap, and dif- ferent authorities can be active within different fields. As part of these net- works and its field of discourse, Ayurveda can be also understood eit her as spiritual or religious, or as a form of spirituality negotiated by agents in the field.10 In this context, the discursive elements that condition the potentia l for religious embodiment within Ayurveda will be addressed. On the basis of fieldwork conducted in 2009, the aim of this article is to map the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medic ine, and to illustrate the circumstances that make religious embodi ment possible for the patient. The practitioners' point of view will be helpful in understand- ing how positionings between religion and medicine take place in the Ge r- man health-care market and how these positionings are influenced by aca- demic discourses. In the following especially, the initial consult ation and the interaction and relationship between practitioner and patient will provide ac- cess points for the discussion. 2 ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARC H The point of departure for this article is ethnographic research consis ting of three months of fieldwork carried out between December 2008 and Fe bruary 2009 and based on the anthropological method of participant observation and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9 Identity in this sense is always contested and negot iated (Bergunder 2008 : 492) 10 As will be shown , the focus on this discursive field is very much influenced by existing academic studies and media representations (Bergunder 2 011: 44-45). 138 | Antony George Pattathu semi -narrative interviews with Ayurveda practitioners inspired by grounded theory.11 The study was also based on an analysis of media representations of these practitioners and their institutions in the form of adv ertising bro- chures, webpages, newspaper articles, and both academic and non-academ ic publications by the interviewees. As part of the study, different Ayurvedic facilities in southern Germany have been visited, among them private clinics and hospitals, health centers, and the practices of Heilpraktiker (alternative practitioners). The study explicitly tried to capture the broad range of Ayur- veda practitioners, which other studies often reduce to a specific status group, such as medical doctors (MDs).12 The duration of the participant observation varied from three to four days to half a day. The interviews were conducted in this period, as we ll as a num- ber of informal conversations and interviews with staff and pati ents. Nine practitioners in particular form the core of the study, among the m two Heilpraktiker , two Bachelors of Ayurvedic Medicines and Surgery (BAMS),13 and five medical doctors. Two of the MDs were female and three male, all the other practitioners being male. The aim of the ethnographic re- search was to describe the different forms of Ayurveda pract ices and to iden- tify the positioning of Ayurveda practitioners within the German heal thcare system. Questions regarding career development, therapeutic meas ures, and motivation formed part of the interviews. Already here the question of the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11 The ethnography is the result of cooperation with Pr of. Harish Naraindas from JNU in Delhi and would not have been possible without his support. I would also like to thank Prof. Gabriele Alex, who made this cooperation possible. The inter- views conducted for this research were held in English , many of which contain linguistic errors that have been retained in the quoted passages to provide an au- thentic impression of the interview situation. The names of the interview partners have been changed to protect their identit ies. 12 For example, Robert Frank only takes medical doctors into account in his work : see his \" Globalisierung alternativ er Medizin : Hom\u00f6opathie und Ayurveda in In- dien und Deutschland \" (Frank 2004: 200). 13 The title \"BAMS \" is given to students within the Ayurveda college system in India, being based on a study program lasting five to six years which is increas- ingly integrat ed with and adapt ed to the biomedical curricul um (Langford 2002 : 130; Welch 2008 : 129 ). Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 139 relationship of their particular Ayurveda practices to religious influences and medicine formed part of the interview schedule. It should be mentioned that the focus on religious embodiment in this article requires a long-term and thorough study of practitioner-patient inter- actions and consultations. Lacking this, the article can only pr ovide initial insights into the potential for religious embodiment based on an anal ysis o f the discursive field and the perspectives and practices of some A yurveda practitioners. 3 THE HISTORICAL DEVEL OPMENT OF AYURVEDA IN GERMANY The historical development of Ayurveda in Germany already gives the first indications of the relationship of Ayurveda to religion. As in Suzanne New- combe's description of the development of Ayurveda in England, only media representations and initial processes of institutionalization can be found in the evidence for the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany (2008: 257). The following descriptions of this development must be understood as a sketch that can only give a rough idea of its course. At the beginning stands the founding of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ayurveda in Osnabr\u00fc ck in 1983 as the first association of Ayurveda practitioners in Germany. The firs t Maharishi Ayurveda health center was also founded in Osnabruc k (Frank 2004: 198).14 Already in 1980 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi15 was invited to a conference in Delhi, where he announced the worldwide dissemination of Ayurveda and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 14 Examples of other associations that have been founded since then and acquired an influence over the development of an Ayurveda practitioner 's network in Ger- many are the European Professional Association of Ayurveda -Practitioners and Therapists (VEAT) and the German Doctors Association for Ayurveda Medicine (Deutsche \u00c4rztegesellschaft f\u00fcr Ayurveda -Medizin, D\u00c4GAM). 15 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was an Indian phys ics graduate who stud- ied at the Sankaracarya Jyotir Math with Brahmananda Sarasw ati (1869 -1953) and was introduced to the teachings of the Advaita Vedanta. He was the founder of the technique of transcendental meditation and came to fame as the guru of certain celebrities such as the Beatles and Mia Farrow (Knott 2 006: 634). 140 | Antony George Pattathu the revitalization of the Vedic sciences (Jeannotat 2008: 300). The founding of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f \u00fcr Ayurveda , which is connected to the Ger- man Academy of Ayurveda, has to be understood in context of the Maharishi movement, even though this connection has become weaker, especially si nce the Maharishi's death. The Association is registered as such and claims to be an inde pendent and autonomous association of experts in which Ayurvedic medicine is not bound to any particular school.16 The explicit reference to Maharishi Ayur- veda as a seal of quality supported by the All India Ayurvedic Congress can be found in a special section on its webpage, where the Associat ion also cau- tions against facilities that lack standardized forms of qualit y management.17 Here we can observe how the exclusion of non-standardized Ayurveda pr ac- titioners is used as a marketing strategy in media representations that at the same time lend credence to the Maharishi Ayurveda label. Not onl y is Ma- harishi Ayurveda a registered trademark () that offers a whole range of products, the Maharishi Ayurveda system is itself a franchise that re presents one of its first tangible processes of institutionalization in Germany (Humes 2008: 309-310). Maharishi Ayurveda has played a similar role in the i nsti- tutional development of Ayurveda in England (Newcombe 2008: 257) and North America (Reddy 2000: 5). In the 1980s and 1990s Maharishi Ayurveda represented the most com- plex networks within the German Ayurveda landscape. With own product s, its private clinics and health centers played an important part in the popula r- ization of Ayurveda (Jeannotat 2008: 303). The movement also caused a lot of criticism because it combined Ayurveda with transcendental medi tation (TM),18 as the following excerpt from the German news magazine Der Spie- gel shows: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16 shi-ayurve da, July 10, 2018. 18 Kim Knott defines TM as follows: \" [T]ranscendental meditation is a technique for mental and physical well -being and rejuvenation which, for some committed meditators, leads on to programmes for higher spiritua l development (e.g. sidhi yoga), alternative medicine (ayurveda), and Vedic astrology \" (2006 : 634-635). Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 141 \"Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical system, is a mega trend in the wellness sector. The German market is dominated by disciples of his h oliness the Indian guru Maha- rishi Mahesh Yogi. With costly treatments, his holine ss markets his transcendental meditation and abstruse world salvation theories.\" ( Schwertfeger 2004, author's trans- lation) This short media representation points to the fact that this a spect of the de- velopment of Ayurveda in Germany through the Maharishi Movement at- tracted criticism. The ethnographic research for this article also revealed other s trands in the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany that ran in paral lel to the institutionalized development of the Maharishi Movement. Individual prac - titioners who began their training in India in the 1980s and 1990s or earl ier and who migrated from there to Germany to practice Ayurveda characterize these trends. This was the case for the two BAMS practitioner s who feature in the ethnographic research. The public visibility of Ayurveda practitioners and institutions that are not part of the Maharishi Network has increased over the last years. One example of this is the European Academy of Ayur veda, which was founded by Kerstin and Mark Rosenberg in Birstein in 1993 and is led by both (Rosenberg 2012: 63). They offer a broad variety of trai ning programs and have been able to initiate a program for Ayurveda consultants (Ayurveda Fachberater ) that is certified by the Saarland Chamber of Com- merce and Industry (IHK). In addition, they offer a master's degr ee for med- ical doctors and medically qualified employees in cooperation with Middle- sex University in the UK.19 This article can merely point out some of the highlights of the historica l development of Ayurveda in Germany. This development must be thor- oughly researched to obtain a deeper understanding of the current situa tion, but a comprehensive history of Ayurveda in Germany providing a genealogy that reveals the breaks and continuities in the historically domin ant narratives remains a research aim. Hopefully, however, this brief genealogi cal sketch will give an idea of the dominant forces and processes of institutionalizat ion in the field and of the insights into public perceptions of this development. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2018. 142 | Antony George Pattathu The tendencies that are visible in the development of Ayurveda in Ger- many have nevertheless been framed conceptually by Anne Koch in order to provide a deeper understanding of the current situation. With reference to Michael Stausberg, Koch takes into account the reaction of sci ence20 to the historical development, media representations, and different meanings of Ayurveda (2005a: 26). Taking this as a premise, she distinguishes three phases in the development of Ayurveda, which she describes as (a ) homo g- enization, (b) popularization and (c) diversification. (a) The fact that Ayurveda is perceived as a homogeneous obje ct in her descriptions is the result of the translations and receptions of different aca- demic works and concepts of Ayurveda by different scholars. Through their own academic work, these scholars have played their own part in the canon- ization and standardization of Ayurveda, and it is this that Koch describes as homogenization. In this context the reform and modernization of the Indian Ayurveda landscape has played a role in its existence in Germany, but Ger- man discussions of the relationship of Ayurveda to religion and medic ine cannot be deduced from the Indian context (Koch 2005a: 27). (b) The popularization of Ayurveda is characterized by a number of dif- ferent factors. Here important roles have been played by institut ionalization processes and new writings, as well as by individual practitioners who act as multipliers for the propagation of Ayurveda. Special attention in this phase is given to the history of the New Age Movement,21 which Koch mentions with reference to the scholar of religious studies, Christoph Boc hinger, espe- cially pointing out the mixture of secular and religious elements wi thin the movement in relation to ecology and holism. This development and the mix- ture of New Age and Ayurveda will be given special attention in the next section. The popularization of Ayurveda can be related to the growth in med- ical pluralism within the German health-care market, which can be under- stood as a reaction to changes in the health-care system and the \"religious \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 20 In this contribution , the word \" science \" refers to branches of science and the scholars who have dealt intensively with the practice and theory of Ayurveda, primarily indologists, anthropologist s, sociologists, medical practitioners, and public health and religious studies sch olars. 21 For the discussion about New Age and the different a pproaches of conceptualiza- tion within the Study of Religion Bergunder Bochinger 1994, Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 143 field.\"22 The rise in CAM therapies can be also attributed to these deve lop- ments, as this emerging medical pluralism serves as a kind of cat alyst for the popularization of Ayurveda in Germany. This also has the effect t hat some of the practitioners who feature in the ethnographic research have offered not only Ayurveda but a broad variety of CAM therapies (Koch 2005a: 28-30). (c) This kind of combination of Ayurvedic practices with other therapies and the introduction of Ayurvedic principles into other areas for commer cial purposes can be understood as part of what Koch describes as Ayurveda 's diversification, which at the same time is closely linked to it s popularization. Diversification is the third phase in the development of Ayurveda i n Ger- many for Koch, which she dates to the 1990s. A special characteristi c of this period is Ayurveda's intensified institutionalization and the sort of marketing strategies that can be observed with the Maharishi Movement. Repre senta- tions of Ayurveda on the web and marketing strategies selling Ayurveda a s wellness or cosmetics are also characteristic of this st age. At this point it is the legal aspects of practicing Ayurveda and legitimizing it that come to the fore (Koch 2005a: 30). Koch's conceptual frame, taken together with the examples from the eth- nographic study, provides a first access point for a better underst anding of the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany, even though an ade - quate study is still missing. In this sense the three phases f orm a heuristic tool with which to describe processes that have taken place diachroni cally but that also exist in parallel to the current situation of Ayurved a in Germany. In the following section, the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine will be mapped by the statements of scholars from sociology, Indology, religious studies and medicine. The reaction of science in the field that Koch describes will be deciphered in detail to show how Ayurveda has become an \"identity marker\" that is negotiated around reli gion and medicine. It will be also shown how these positionings enable the poten- tial for religious embodiment as an aspect of therapy. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22 Koch uses the terminology of the \"religious field\" wi th referenc e to Pierre 60-61) 144 | Antony George Pattathu 4 THE DISCURSIVE FIELD CONSTITUTED BY AYURVEDA, RELIGION, AND MEDICINE IN GERMANY To map the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine in Germany, different positionings must be taken into account. In the previ- ous section, Ayurveda's historical development in Germany was des cribed in order to form a background for some of the positions in this discourse. Examining different academic positions within this field of discour se will demonstrate the normative impact, both implicit and direct, that these evalu- ations and conceptualizations have on the self-positionings of Ayur veda practitioners within the field. In some cases, practitioners' voi ces cannot be sufficiently taken into account unless they are actually spoken to. For exam- ple, Anne Koch and Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens analyze media representations of Ayurveda ( cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2018), while Zysk provides a gen- eral diagnostic of the situation of Ayurveda (cp. 2001). In this section I would like to contrast their observations with the results of my own ethnographic research, which addressed the level of the pr acti- tioners and practitioner-patient interactions in order to discuss t he relation- ship of Ayurveda to religion, medicine, and the potential for religious em - bodiment.23 Academic positions, media, practitioners, and patients are im- portant factors in mapping the field within which Ayurveda is characterized as medicine, as spiritual or religious, or as religion. In order to consider these positionings critically, I will examine a few arguments in the academic fiel d to show how Ayurveda is often construed as the \"other\" of religion.24 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 23 This article is very much part of the discourse that is discussed here and it has a normative effect in itself. Contrary to other articles in the field the trajecto ry here is to integrate the opposing positio ns to capture the plurality of Ayurveda and discuss the possibilities of a religious embodiment instead of locat ing Ayurveda on the side of religion or medicine. 24 This can be illustrated by the following quote : \"Hence, Ayurveda is able to cover important life spheres in a spiritual or world -view like manner, which are not cov- ered in Christianity \" (Koch 2005b : 253, author's translation ). By c ontrasting Ayurveda directly with Christianity in this way without taking the multiplicity of non-religious position s on Ayurveda in to consideration , Ayurveda automatically becomes the \"other \" of religion. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 145 One of the schools of Ayurveda that is clearly characterized by strong religious connotations is Maharishi Ayurveda, already mentioned in the pre- vious section. First and foremost, this characterization is due the connection with transcendental meditation that formed part of the world view of Maha- rishi Mahesh Yogi and that is still propagated by his followers. In his teach- ings, Ayurveda is only one of the Vedic sciences that are being revitalized. Another is Gandharva Veda, a specific form of Vedic music tha t is used to accompany some of the treatments of Maharishi practitioners, as was ob- served in the ethnographic research. Listening to this music is said to enable a direct connection to transcendental consciousness.25 In this strand of Ayur- veda, these techniques form part of an even broader spectrum of the religious techniques of the Maharishi movement.26 The movement is one of the examples used by the Indologist Kennet h Gregory Zysk to describe Ayurveda in the West27 as \"New Age Ayurveda\". Zysk uses this terminology to describe the current phase in the histor y of Indian medicine, which for him is characterized by the importation of Indian medicine into the West. Criticism of biomedicine and Cartesia n dualism from within the New Age Movement was correlated with the devel opment of the \"Holistic Health Movement,\"28 the link that enables Zysk to talk about \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 25 \"Gandharva music is the eternal melody of Nature which is ever -lively in Tran- scendental Consciousness. From there it reverberates and constructs different lev- els of creation. Gandharva Veda is the basis of all order and harmony in Nature, therefore is [sic!] has that most harmonizing, most integratin g influence \" (cp. http://gandharva -veda.com/page4.htm , July 10, 2018. ) 26 For a discussion and an overview of the tec hniques in the Maharishi movement , cp. Jeannotat 2008 : 285-307. 27 The terminology \"west\" here is set in quotation marks to emphasize the pejorative history of the terminology and undifferentiated dichotomy that is impl ied in its use. My own understanding of \"west\" is in accordance with Talal Asad 's: \"There is in my view the west, but I think it is best regarded neithe r as a geographical place nor as a self -contained civilization, but as a hegemonic project, glo bal in scope.\" (2006 : lecture ). 28 Hanegraff (1996) sees the concepts of holism, mildness and the harmonization and integration of body and mind as central aspects of \"holistic medicine \" arising out of the Holistic Health Movement. Like the latter , holistic medicine has the goal of healing the person as a whole. In this constellation, every individual is 146 | Antony George Pattathu New Age Ayurveda (2001: 13). He frames this concept as follows: \"The most recent manifestation of Ayurveda is found in the Western world. I t combines the spiritual and ideological elements of the New Age Movement w ith an ancient Indian medical tradition to produce New Age Ayurveda\" (ibid.: 26). In this way Zysk implicitly gives Ayurveda a religious characteriza tion and creates an antagonism between what he perceives as authenti c Ayurveda in India and his concept of New Age Ayurveda in the West (ibid.).29 Using his description of what authentic Ayurveda is, Zysk replicates the oppo sing forces of the field, thus supporting the emic authenticity discourse of its prac- titioners in Germany and India, instead of describing the discourse and mul- tiplicity of Ayurvedic practices and trying to understand why and how this authenticity is claimed to work.30 The phrase \"New Age Ayurveda\" also has a stereotyping effect and excludes the highly politicized discussion over re- ligion and spirituality among the community of practitioners (Warrier 2011: 87). The aim of this article is to understand how specific truth claims withi n Ayurveda in relation to religion and medicine are construed within the f ield and how they stand in relation to the potential for religious embodiment (Langford 2002: 2). The critical reception of this categorization of New Age Ayurveda by practitioners is illustrated by the following quote: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 considered to be an interdependence of body, mind and emotions. The healing process involves all these aspects and goes even deeper, as the interdependence that constitutes the individual is itself constituted by the universe , and the healing process addresses precisely this inner connection and power. The pow er of the mind o ver the body is a crucial feature of this healing process and has the potential to heal, but at the same time it is a source of illness. The individual must under- stand the deeper meanings of the disease and hence beco me the center of treat- ment (Hanegraaff 1996 : 53-55). 29 Wujastyk and Smith (2008) also apply the concept of \"New Age Ay urveda \" by referring to Zysk an d describe it as one of three forms of \"global Ayurveda \" that have evolved outside the Indian context in different regions. In their conceptual- ization, \"New Age Ayurveda \" stands in opposition to the secularized Ayurveda that is practiced in India (2008 : 2). 30 For a similar argument concerning the authenticity of Ayurveda in the West, cp. Otten 1996 and Zimmerman 1992. Both come to the conclusion that Ayurveda in the West is merely sold as a form of rehabilitation and wellness therapy , not as codified medical system. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | not a 'wellness center'; patien ts usually come here to treat or prevent diseases. It also must be stressed that Ay urveda, as it is understood here, is not a spiritual discipline, nor is it 'New Age Ayurveda.' [...] Rather, it is a medical discipline in continuation of a centuries ol d tradit ion.\" (Chopra 2008: 244) This positioning of the practitioner's field is that described by Ananda Samir Chopra,31 a medical doctor and chief physician at the Habichtswald Klinik in Kassel. He explicitly positions himself, his facility, and his pr actice in oppo- sition to Zysk's categorization. The economic situation and the mar keting strategies of Ayurveda as a form of wellness are another source of opposi- tion. In particular, the academic ascriptions that categorize Ay urveda as reli- gious or spiritual reveal another facet of the discursive fiel d that addresses the practice of Ayurveda in Germany. The efforts to legitimize Ayurveda as a medical system in Germany are fully evident in Chopra's statement. The fact that in Germany, Ayurveda is inclined towards spiritual ity and religion is not only evident in respect of its historical developme nt, is also validated in a recent study from the medical field by Kessler et al. (2013). The positioning of both practitioners and patients in relation to religion, spir- ituality, and medicine was assessed using a primarily quantitative approach. In total 140 people formed part of the evaluation cluster and were ques tioned by means of a questionnaire. Of those, 70 were practitioners and 70 we re patients. It should be pointed out that 73% of all respondents viewed Ayur- veda as a form of spirituality and only 11% as a religion, while 100% under- stood Ayurveda as a health science and 95% as a medical system ( Kessler et al. 2013: 5). For the respondents Ayurveda therefore embodies aspects of spirituality, religion and science. However, it is the medical di mension of Ayurveda that comes first for them, and they do not exclude the possibility of combining it with biomedicine (ibid.: 6). The arguments of Kessler et al. (2013) and Chopra (2008) make it clear that the connection with spirituality and religion requires further c onsidera- tion in respect of practitioner-patient relations and the question of how reli- gion and spirituality are dealt with in practice (cp. section 6). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 31 Chop ra is an indologist and works on different projects at the inter section of med- ical anthropology and indology. His person also exemplifies the plurality of the discursive field, because he is active in different fields a nd has multiple qualifi- cations. 148 | Antony George Pattathu In addition, the medical understanding of Ayurveda and its practice, as well as the self-positioning and understanding of Ayurveda practitione rs, should be analyzed against the background of a health-care system that is dominated by biomedical agents and institutions, showing how this influ- ences the field and its practitioners (cp. section 5). These examples make it clear that academic ascriptions of Ayurveda in relation to religion and spirituality form part of the tensions ar ising in the positionings between religion and medicine and that they also influence the potential for religious embodiment. What is interesting in Zysk's contr ibu- tion (2001) and Chopra's reaction (2008), as well as in the historical de vel- opment of Ayurveda in Germany, is the connection of Ayurveda to the New Age Movement. Koch has already drawn attention to this, and Zysk also em- phasizes it in connection with the Holistic Health Movement in s upport of his own conceptualization of Ayurveda. The medical sociologist Sita Reddy (2000) also shows this for North America, emphasizing that Ayurveda is in- creasingly framed as a form of holistic health care and arguing that this i s an adaptation to the American context reflecting the influence of Ne w Age movements. For her, this connection between Ayurveda and spirituality be- comes a form of symbolic capital in the health-care market w hile at the same time being the pivotal point in the critiques of biomedicine made by A yur- vedic practitioners (2000: 5). The aspect of \"holism\" and holistic healing is a crucial part of the Ayur- veda \"identity marker\" as construed by academic discourse. This is also the case for Anne Koch's \"web-ethnography\" (2005a).32 In her investigations of web representations of ten Ayurveda providers from 2004 she system atically analyzes the credibility, representation, language, and aesthetics of the Ayur- veda offering. In doing so, she develops an aesthetic content cluster that \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 32 Koch's publications elaborately cover different aspects of Ayurveda in G ermany. She has worked on the representation of Ayurveda in cookbooks and religious codification in Ayurvedic nutrition ( cp. Koch 2005b), the attractiveness of Ayur- veda as an alternativ e healing system (cp. 2006), the ethical plausibility patterns of Ayurveda in the West , and the \"f ormation of German Ayurvedas \" examined on the basis of their presence on the web (cp. 2005 a). In this contribution, the results of the web ethnography are ref erred to especially since they imply direct connections to the practitioners in the ethnographical research and the quoted words of A.S. Chopra. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 149 exposes the semantic stereotypes of the web representation. He re the first six of eleven points are of importance regarding the discursive field c onstituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine in Germany: \"1. Authentication/standardization of the offer; 2. Origin an d dating of Ayurveda, def- inition (e.g. health science, [natural] healing system, alterna tive medicine), possibly mentioning the earliest written sources; 3. Labeling of Ayurveda, mostly as gentle, individual, complementary, holistic; 4. Theory of the eleme nts and tri -dosha teaching with balance; 5. Types of constitution; 6. Pathology : dosha, equilibrium theory.\" (Koch 2005a: 35 -36, author's translation)33 These semantic stereotypes resonate with the findings of my own ethno- graphic research and are often mentioned in the positionings of the prac ti- tioners. The statement by Chopra quoted above is a further example tha t em- phasizes this resonance through the definition, dating, and authenticati on of Ayurveda, which are important criteria for the positionings of those A yur- veda practitioners who want to frame Ayurveda as a medical discipline. The features of \"mildness\", \"individual,\" and \"holistic\" reoccur in de bates on au- thenticity and are used to condemn Ayurveda as practiced in the We st as inauthentic (cp. footnote 26). After a qualitative description of the web pages and a compilation of the semantic stereotypes, Koch introduces her results with the following words: \"We could observe the establishment of a f ederal German 'holistic religion.' Healing, categorization, meditation, and civili za- tion-critical stress management all play roles within it\" ( Koch 2005a: 40, au- thor's translation).34 Characteristics drawn from the results of the analysis \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 33 The other aspects of the semantic stereotypes are: \"7. Highlighting the prevention and benefits of chronic d iseases, lists of indication ; 8. explanation of the treatment methods, especially Panchakarma ; information on other included holistic proce- dures: yoga, meditation, color therapy, psychotherapy, conventional medicine etc.; 9. Nutrition ; 10. Service : accommo dation, costs, directions, price lists ; 11. Disclaimer .\" (Koch 2005a : 36). 34 A localization of Ayurveda in the religious field is also carried out by Hubert Knoblauch : \"An impressive example of the spiritual form of medicine is cer tainly Ayurveda, which h as spread throughout Germany since the 1990s.\" (2009 : 168). Knoblauch largely draws on the contributions by Anne Ko ch to locate Ayurveda in the field of popular religion. 150 | Antony George Pattathu are thus used to define Ayurveda as a specific form of religi on based on \"ho- lism.\" The different positions in the academic field in Germany have sh own that the discourse marker \"holism/holistic\" repeatedly became the decisi ve crite- rion in locating Ayurveda in the religious field. The idea of h olism as an aspect of the historical development of Ayurveda can be related to the argu- ments of authors like Zysk (2001), Reddy (2000), Koch (2005a, 2005b) and L\u00fcddeckens (2018) that Ayurveda belongs to the New Age, as in the case of Maharishi Ayurveda. These arguments locating Ayurveda in the religi ous field can be verified through the understanding of practitioners and pat ients that Ayurveda is spiritual or a religion (cp. Kessler et al. 2013 ). However, these arguments and statements oppose the statements of Chopra a nd other practitioners while also hiding the aspect of the self-image of Ayurveda prac- titioners that locates them primarily in the realm of medicine. The discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine i n Germany is characterized by diverse positions within the field. Media repr e- sentations, academic positions, and practitioners' views support and/or con- test each other, each presenting a conception of what the Ayurveda \"ident ity marker\" means by using different discourse markers. These positions\u2014t hat is, Ayurveda as a religion based on semantic stereotypes (cp. Koch 2005a, 2005b), Ayurveda as a medical discipline based on tradition (cp. Chopra 2008; Kessler et al . 2013), and Ayurveda as spiritual through its connection to New Age movements and notions of holistic health (cp. Reddy 2000; Zys k 2001)\u2014take part in constant processes of exchange. In particular, the e fforts of practitioners to establish Ayurveda as a medical discipline i n a biomedi- cally dominated health-care system illustrate a basic hierarchica l difference, as well as saying something about power relations between the different de- fining agents and institutions. This influences the positions of prac titioners and their self-image, as well as their understandings of Ayurv eda and how they represent and define it in the face of agents in the discursive field. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 151 5 DISCURSIVE EXCHANGE PROCESSES Based on the interview statements of the practitioners involved in my ethno- graphic research, this section will discuss their positions in relation t o Ayur- veda, biomedicine, and religion, as well as showing how these positions a re characterized by different discursive processes of exchange. To understand the relationship between Ayurveda and religion in terms of the prac titioners' self-conceptions and practices, one must first understand the relat ionship of Ayurveda to biomedicine. None of the practitioners referred to the re lation- ship of Ayurveda to religion or spirituality as a primary discursi ve marker. Instead they saw Ayurveda as a CAM or a medical system, also s tressing the explanation of Ayurveda as holistic, without necessarily pointing to any re- ligious or spiritual dimension it might have. Within a biomedically dominated health-care system, Ayurvedic pract ice is constantly being transformed and subjected to biomedical proc esses of ad- aptation, which can be observed in the translation of Ayurvedic principle s into the biomedical system. These adaptations and translations are necessary in order to be able to practice Ayurveda within a biomedical health system . On the official level, Ayurveda in Germany cannot be practiced as an officially recognized medical system like biomedicine in Germany or Ayur- veda in India.35 For economic reasons, Heilpraktiker , physicians, and BAMS practition- ers often have no other option than to balance between the dominant me dia representations and images of Ayurveda as wellness and its repr esentation as an alternative healing method and then to imply their own understa nding of Ayurveda, whether as purely medical or as connected with a spir itual prac- tice, in their practice and in respect of practitioner-patie nt interactions. In recent years there has been an increase in statements in academic publis hing by German practitioners positioning Ayurveda in the medical field a nd breaking up the tension in the field described above. The conception of Ay ur- veda as a \"Whole Medical System\" by Kessler and Michalsen (2012) pro- vides an example of this.36 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 35 For an outline of the historical process of the state re cognition of Ayurveda in India, cp. Wujastyk and Smith 2008: 8 -9. 36 \"Whole medical systems are eo ipso complete and coherent systems of medical theory that have evolved, and continue evolving, in differen t regions, cultures and 152 | Antony George Pattathu If experts were to practice Ayurveda as a recognized medical system, a completely different corpus of laws would apply, and the administrati on of many Ayurvedic medicines would no longer be possible unless they fulfill ed the requirements of the laws on medicines. BAMS Shulaji, one of my inter- viewees who is a senior Ayurvedic doctor at a center with thirty be ds, em- phasized that he is forced to register his facility as a business and t hat he has to label Ayurveda \"wellness,\" even though he does not perceive his practice in any way as wellness. The status of Ayurveda in Germany leaves him in a legally gray area. When I asked him about the administration of Ayurvedic medicines in his institution, he replied: \"We give herbal tea s. Kashayam [an Ayurvedic concoction] is actually a herbal med- icine, but we are giving it as a tea. You know, here, ever ywhere there are loopholes. If you say kashayam is a medicine you are not allowed to use it. But if you declar e it is a tea, you are all owed.\" (Shulaji, BAMS, 10.12.2008) The clinical trials required to legitimize Ayurvedic medicines in accord ance with German law are very costly, and often the financial resou rces are not available to perform pharmacological and clinical studies. These st udies are slowly increasing in number, but they are still faced with the funda mental problem that the principles of Ayurveda have to be translated into a biomed- ical context.37 This shows that institutional influences (e.g. from the Federa l Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) on the discourse constituted by Ayurveda , religion, and medicine creates multiple processes of exchange, pr actices, and descriptions that provide the \"identity marker\" (e.g. Ayurveda as we llness, Ayurveda as religion, Ayurveda as a medical system). These descr iptions and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 time periods around the globe, independently from mod ern western medicine [...]. Here, the most well -known traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, can spearhead as pars pro toto for all others for a particular reason : on top of its inbound coherence it possesses an inherent outbound qua lity of opennes s to its surrounding realities .\" (Kessler /Michalsen 2012 : 65) This definition and the re- lated article clarify the efforts to legitimize Ayurveda and give it a firm and rec- ognized place in the German health -care system. 37 For a similar situation integrating kanpo medicine as a form of \"traditional medi- cine\" into biomedicine in Japan , see volume. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 153 attributions to Ayurveda are related to each other in a complex di scursive network and influence each other. The relationship of Ayurveda to biomedi- cine is hegemonic and forces Ayurveda practitioners to define Ayur veda in a variety of ways. Therefore, none of the practitioners interview ed denied the reference to or the involvement of biomedicine, an expression of the discur- sive premise that biomedicine has to be integrated. The positions of the practitioners and their representations of Ayurveda must in this sense be understood as multiple. Different dimensions of the practice reflect the situation and hierarchies within medical pluralism and the vexed relationship with religion. In this connection, the following statement by medical anthropologists Sarah Cant and Ursula Sharma on the situa tion of CAM therapies applies to the positioning of Ayurveda in the Germ an health- care system: \"In as much as these forms have not been totally incorporated in to biomedical prac- tices and knowledge they do not share biomedicine's privil eged relation to the state, though the precise nature and degree of their delegitimation varies from case to case and from country to country.\" (Cant and Sharma 1999: 6) This also becomes evident at the practitioner level, as is cle arly seen in the statement of Dr Tumar, an Ayurvedic practitioner and medical doct or: \"Doc- tors of modern medicine tell me that I do not have a clue and be cause I do not have a clue, this is why I am using alternative medicine \" (Dr Tumar, physician, 10.12.2008). Delegitimization is not only perpetrated by one's peers, as in the case of Dr Tumar, it also appears through the as sociation with religion, that is, in practice. When asked about the role that religion plays in his practice, BAMS Shulaji answered as follows: \"No, we are not doing that, especially because we are Indians. We h ave our religion and our culture, but I don't want to implement that in th is center with Indian medita- tion and everything. [...] I say you can believ e in whatever you believe God is. There is one energy, and I am born in a Hindu family. We have employees from the Muslim and Christian religion here, but we do only Ayurvedic treatmen t, nothing more. If you start and make some meditation and everything, t he local publics will start and say: 'That is a sect'. [...] have to be careful [...] .\" (Shulaji, BAMS 10.12.2008) 154 | Antony George Pattathu This statement by Shulaji expresses his concern about implementing re ligion in his practice without denying his own religious background. The associ a- tions he makes with meditation and his fear of being identified a s a \"sect\" resonate with the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany and the practice of Maharishi Ayurveda, as depicted in Der Spiegel .38 This is an ex- ample of one of the arguments in which the relationship of Ayurveda to reli- gious embodiment is rejected, since religion is viewed as a de-legi timizing factor and a danger to the practice. The same applies to Chopra, quoted ear- lier, who does not situate his Ayurvedic institution and practic e in the field of wellness or spirituality, but sees it as a medical disci pline. Chopra's oppo- sition reveals a clear strategy to legitimize Ayurveda as a medical discipline. To be publicly perceived as a secular medical discipline, the as pects of w ell- ness and spirituality must be excluded. With regard to the school of Maharishi Ayurveda, it is particularly inter- esting that the three participants in the ethnographic researc h who called themselves Maharishi Ayurveda practitioners have moved away from admin- istering and combining transcendental meditation with their Ayurveda prac- tice. One reason for this was the cost of the meditation courses. One of the doctors emphasized that, although she still indeed regularly advises on TM and recommends its effects to every patient, that is not a condition for thera- peutic treatment, a position held by all three Maharishi practitioners. However, one example of religious embodiment in Ayurveda is transcen- dental meditation. This is connected to a broader belief system in w hich the individual practice of the patient has an effect on the whole of humanity, affects the cosmos, and influences the Doshas (Newcombe 2008: 263). The positions of the practitioners presented so far show a clear ave rsion to di- rectly combining Ayurveda and religion. Kessler et al.'s and Koch's studie s, on the other hand, clearly stress the religious or spiritual aspects of Ayurveda. This was also the case for the practitioners in my ethnographic re search when it comes to therapeutic measures and consultation. However, it becomes clear that the answer to the question of whether Ayurveda has a religious aspect has to start with the practitio ners' own posi- tions and their economic and legal strategies. Here a political dimension is recognizable, as shown by the statements of BAMS Shulaji and the Mahari- shi practitioners in my ethnographic research, as well as by Chopra. D r \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 38 See the above quote from Schwertfeger 2004 : 7. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 155 Tumar mentioned that, in cases of doubt involving a particular colle ague, she would conceal the religious connotations that Ayurveda has for her, s eeing this aspect as crucial not for the scientific evaluation of Ayurveda, but for the relationship between practitioner and patient (Dr Tumar, physici an, 10.12.2008). The relationships between Ayurveda, religion, and medicine are more complex than the frequent situating of Ayurveda in the religious field sug- gests. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the practice, practitioner-pati ent re- lations, and the respective prevailing conditions should reveal how th ey in- fluence the potential for religious embodiment. Fundamentally, it should be remembered that the relationship betwee n practitioner and patient has a foundation of trust in which the pra ctitioners introduce their respective understandings of Ayurveda. The initial co nsulta- tion and the teaching of the Doshas play a central role in both the individual treatment and the patients' understandings of Ayurveda, as well as in respect of religious embodiment into the therapy. 6 THE POTENTIAL OF REL IGIOUS EMBODIMENT IN AYURVEDA THERAPY Consultations as a means of therapeutic practice in Ayurveda ar e particularly relevant to the question of how far certain elements of Ayurveda are consid- ered religious in the context of treatment, as well as in understa nding how they find their way into therapy. Neither the study by Kessler et a l. (2013) nor the studies by Koch (2005a, 2005b), L\u00fcddeckens (2018) or Zysk (2001) investigate how the relationship to religion and spirituality is dea lt with on the level of practitioner-patient relations. This article can only provide an initial insight into the potential for religious embodiment based on the anal- ysis of the discursive field and the perspectives and practices of certain prac- titioners of Ayurveda. The focus on religious embodiment would ideally re- quire a long- term and thorough study of practitioner-patient interactions and the respective consultations. Fundamental to the treatment, as all practitioners in my ethnographic re- search have stressed, is the initial consultation. It is on this occasion tha t the basics of Ayurvedic practice are explained in relation to the needs of the pa- tient and that the patient's initial resistance to or sympathy for a \"religious\" 156 | Antony George Pattathu therapy becomes apparent. In many consultations and treatments, rel igion or spirituality are not directly addressed in relation to Ayurveda unl ess this is desired by the patient. This requires some flexibility on the part of the prac- titioner in dealing with the patients. Apparently, a religious interpretation of Ayurveda has to be understood as a process that can be established i n the treatment depending on the preferences of both the patient and the prac ti- tioner. In addition, these initial consultations with practitioners are supported by lectures in their clinical institutions. In the case of pr ivate clinics th ese are public lectures, while in the context of smaller facilities the y are tailored to the patients' interests. The results presented in this article are based on interview s with practi- tioners. However, they highlight key elements of the consultations t hat ena- ble religious embodiment. Heilpraktiker Lutz, who runs a small private practice in which he also offers outpatient therapies, begins his consultation with questions relat ing to a patient's birth (e.g. the circumstances of the birth process) and his or her social and family relations. The antagonism to common biomedical cons ul- tations can be seen when the patients express their surprise at the fact that the practitioners want to hear their individual stories in more detai l. This is a common experience shared by most practitioners, as BAMS Shulaji and other practitioners reported (Pattathu 2009: 62-77). Based on the initia l con- sultation and the description of the Doshas, it is possible to show how reli- gious embodiment may take place. It is a crucial factor that the depiction of the Doshas gives the patient the opportunity to become familiar and identif y with the Ayurvedic categories. The following interview excerpt conveys how Heilpraktiker Lutz introduces the concept of Doshas Doshas (wind), its akasha (ether) and vayu. Wind and ether, I tell them, for e xample, vata is a very thin person, tall or small, and because of what? The wind is cooling, makes the people cold, wind is drying. If there is water it dries the water, it dries the skin, the eyes, the hair, some organs, the stool, and this main center of vata is the colon [...] for example kapha is water and earth. If wind blows into the earth like in the desert, the sand is flying away, so you need some water to make a sandcas tle. I tell them, if you do some castles at the seaside, sand alone is nothing, but you need t he water and, well, also pitta. These elements, 20% water and mostly fire, it holds t he temperature, it makes the metabolism.\" ( Lutz, healing practitioner, 18.12.2008) Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 157 All practitioners refer to the Doshas as the main concept th at constitutes the relationship between illness and health. The Doshas are des cribed as part of the biological process and the physical nature of the body, but always in re- lation to the mental characteristics and traits of the pers on. They are based on a selection of the five elements of fire, water, earth, air / wind and space / ether, which are part of the nature of all substances and form an integral part of the Ayurvedic cosmology, as Lutz explained in the course of the i n- terview. At the same time, he showed the applicability of the teaching of the Doshas to the environment. For example, wind as part of vata, having the property of drying, dries the skin and clarifies the relation of th e Doshas to the body. This basic tenet of Ayurveda explains the role of the body as con- necting the outside world of the patient with his or her inner world. Through the Doshas, which are based on the elements, the outside world affec ts the human body. The Doshas are the central principles in Ayurvedic teachings and are what enables the identification of Ayurveda as \"holistic.\" They ar e repre- sentative of the overcoming of the mind-body opposition, since every Dosha is understood both physically and mentally. For Zysk and Koch this aspe ct is a clear reference to the New Age or Holistic Health Mov ements, which place Ayurveda in the religious domain. The role of the elements with regard to notions of harmonization, balance, and relation to the cosmos is one reason why Koch categorizes Ayurveda as a form of religion. These aspects are in fact the focal point of the potential for religious em- bodiment. Yet in order to see how religious embodiment takes plac e as a process of negotiation, the perspectives of the practitioners and patients must be taken into account. According to one of the Maharishi practitioners, the process of religious embodiment begins just through the setting of his clinic and the Vedic Gandharva music, which brings both his Doshas and those of his patients into balance. In this way practitioners and patients can feel, think, and identify with the elements and the Doshas, which, according t o the reli- gious views of the Maharishi, bring them into harmony with the cosmic or- der. The patients can actively participate in the embodiment of Ayurveda , since they are guided by the practitioner's explanations and can re-consoli- date their identity within the doctrine of the Doshas. The proble m of the le- gitimacy of Ayurveda is rooted in a clash of two discursive premises , namely the biomedical and Ayurvedic perspectives, but this can be transformed into 158 | Antony George Pattathu a dialogue that is further developed in the practitioner-patient r elationship. Some informal discussions with patients during the ethnographic resea rch described just such a dialogue. According to them, their illnesses and per- sonalities were recreated through the dialogue with the practiti oners and their explanations. In light of Judith Butler's conceptualization of speech, the illness of the patient, her identification with the disease, and her identity a re all re-signified performatively through the terms of the Doshas. This resignificati on partly takes place in the communication between the practitioner and t he patient, as well as in her own reflections and conversations about this proces s. Simi- larly, as the word \"queer\" is re-signified from a hurtful slur int o a positive identity, the Doshas enable a positive identification for the patie nts (Butler 2006: 28).39 Whereas from a biomedical perspective the body and in a sense the identity of the patient are conceptualized as \"sick\", that is, as p athologi- cal, this identity is re-evaluated in the communication betwe en the Ayurveda practitioner and the patient. By means of the Dosha concept body and iden- tity are re-consolidated, not as ill but as \"out of balance\". This process affects everyday life, since the Dosha teachings are linked to the patien ts' daily ac- tivities, for example, through dietetics. The results of Christine Kupfer s thesis, \"Caring for the Whole Se lf: How German Patients Use Ayurvedic Concepts\" (2006), also describe eve ryday use of the Doshas by patients. Over a period of three weeks, s he observed the therapy process of Ayurveda patients in an Ayurvedic clinic and intervie wed twenty patients. She came to the conclusion that for many patie nts the Doshas represent one of the central building blocks in their conceptualizat ion of Ayurveda. For the patients, the Doshas are a vehicle of self-empowerment40 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 39 \"More generally, then, this suggests that the changeable power of such terms marks a kind of di scursive performativity that is not a discrete series of speech acts, but a ritual chain of resignifications whose origin and end remain unfixed and unfixable. In this sense, an \"act\" is not a momentary happening, but a certain nexus of temporal horizons, the condensation of an iterability that exceeds the moment it occasions. The possibility for a speech act to resignify a prior context depends, in part, upon the gap between the originating context or inte ntion by which an utterance is animated and the eff ects it produces .\" (Butler 1997 : 14). 40 With regard to self -empowerment in the context of alternative therapies, see Zeugin, L\u00fcddeckens Schrimpf and Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 159 that they can use to maintain their own individuality, autonomy, and deci- sions regarding their own self-care, as well as their heal ing process (Kupfer 2006: 110-114). Kupfer does not neglect the role of the practitioners' in- structions in this regard. She explains how they support the patients and con- tribute to a better understanding of the concepts. She also stresse s that through the Doshas patients become able to access Ayurveda on the basis of their previous knowledge and to confirm this knowledge with a new vocab- ulary associated with the Doshas (ibid: 72). Especially at this level of individual trust and communication in the in- teraction between practitioner and patient, both the social circums tances of the patients and their possible reservations have to be taken i nto account. In this regard, the sensitive character of the practitioner-patient rel ationship re- quires great flexibility on the part of the former. Dr Tumar empha sized this point when it comes to linking Ayurveda to religion during consultations and therapy: \"So you can use it, and that is a very nice thing about Ayurv eda, that, according to the level of your patient, you can stay on a functional level. But the more you realize the patient opens up to more, the more you can also kind of intr oduce terms like prana. You can introduce terms like chakra; you can show what the different chakras' ener- gies are for. Whatever their 'thing' is. [...] You hav e incredible options in Ayurveda. You can start with simple oils and herbs, [...] the ph ysical thera py, and you can go to the extremely subtle and extremely fine therapies, dependin g on what level the patient is ready to come with you.\" (Dr Tumar, physician, 10.12. 2008) This statement by Dr Tumar is central to the understanding of rel igious em- bodiment in Ayurvedic treatment, showing that the field of tensi on between religion and medicine requires a flexible and individual approach to religion in practice. The possibilities of Ayurveda being practiced on a func tional level and of introducing religious or philosophical concepts prove the nego- tiable character of religious embodiment in Ayurveda.41 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 41 This kind of flexibility is interpreted by L\u00fcddeckens as a characteristic o f CAM , seen as a \"loosely coupled field .\" See L\u00fcddeckens , this volume. 160 | Antony George Pattathu 7 CONCLUSION The positionings and voices of practitioners in a field that is cha racterized by a religious understanding of Ayurveda, and the interest in establishing A yur- veda as a recognized medical system, are central but also con flictual ele- ments in the field of discourse that constitutes Ayurveda, religion, and med- icine in Germany. Practitioners, patients, media presentations, and recipi- ents' perspectives\u2014in short, the entire discourse community involved in the articulation of Ayurveda\u2014should be included in observations of this field. The construction of Ayurveda as a counterpart to religion in the se nse of \"New Age Ayurveda\" (Zysk 2001) or as a \"Federal German holistic r eligion\" (Koch 2005a) represents a categorization that omits key aspects of the prac- tice and conceptions of Ayurveda in the emic, popular, and scientific under- standings of Ayurvedic practitioners and scholars. Ayurveda has many spiritual and religious connotations, as is evident from the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany, in which the Ma- harishi movement has been a central player, as well as in the emi c perspec- tives described in the study by Kessler et al. (2013). The discursive approach using the perspectives of medical anthropology and religious studies showed on the one hand how practitioners position themselves within a biomedical field that is determined by a h egemonic re- lationship with biomedicine. On the other hand, it revealed how the dif ferent authorities in the field influence practitioners' positions through the distinc- tions they make between religion and medicine. I argue that Ayurveda is constituted and defined in multiple ways, which also determine the possibil- ities of religious embodiment. Using the teachings about the Doshas as an example, it was possibl e in this article to show how they serve as a means to enable the patient to identify with a particular concept of Ayurveda and hence enable religious em bodi- ment. The Doshas provide a way to re-define one's identity. If and how Ayur- veda provides a religious connotation as an aspect of this identity depends on the respective patient and practitioner. Hence a flexible treat ment of Ayur- veda, whether on the medical level and/or on the religious level , is based in the procedural relationship between practitioner and patient. The aim of this article has been to show how Ayurveda as a medica l sys- tem is entangled with religion and biomedicine and to analyze how it of fers the potential for religious embodiment, especially in the initial consul tation Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment | 161 and the practitioner-patient relationship. The conditions for this r eligious em- bodiment are already determined by the ways in which practitioners position themselves in the German health-care market, and they require flexibility in their approach to Ayurveda, religion, and medicine. The various positions in the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, re- ligion, and medicine, and the processes of negotiation that became obvious through the interviews and the ethnographic fieldwork, both revealed t he po- tential for religious embodiment in theory and practice. The pos itionalities and power relations in the field require additional ethnographic rese arch on practitioner-patient interactions and consultations. This will enable us to open up new perspectives that leave room for exploring the voices of those concerned in order to capture the complexities of Ayurveda in Germany.

Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as a T oolkit for Secular Health -Care The De -differentiation of Religion and Medicine Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens ABSTRACT Complementary and Alternative M edicine (CAM) plays a crucial role in many con- temporary societies. While biomedicine observes the social differentiation between medicine and religion, holistic healing systems integ rate the two. After clarifying im- portant terms, this article begins with a brief sketch of research on these topics. Re- ferring to Ann Swidler's concept of the \"tool kit,\" it su ggests an explanation for the attractiveness of CAM to both patients and practitioners. Drawing on relevant studies and data from the author's qualitative study of palliative care, it argues that the attrac- tion of CAM lies in its function as a tool kit that is not differen tiated into medicine and religion but is characterized internally by being a loosel y coupled field that offers a resource for self -empowe rment. 1 INTRODUCTION The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by the ge neral population in many countries, such as the United States, the United K ing- dom, Japan, and Switzerland, is substantial.1 Indeed, CAM therapies are \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 Surveys suggest that the use of CAM increased in the United States (Eisenberg et al. 1998) until around 2000 and that it has been more or les s steady in several 168 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens practiced within the conventional health-care systems of moder n western countries, as well as outside them. Referring to the United Sta tes, Kaptchuk and Eisenberg state that \"[...] substantial portions of the medical system have begun to seek reconciliation with alterna tive medicine. Managed care, insurance carriers, hospital providers, major ac- ademic medical centers, and individual MDs are increasingly recept ive to developing new 'integrative' models of health care [...]\" (2001: 193). Similarly, Frisk (2013: 388) notes the \"increasingly blurred borders be tween the medical mainstream and complementary and alternative the rapies\" in Sweden, while Wahlberg points out how \"various CAM therapies come to be mainstreamed into national health delivery...\" (2007: 2310) in the UK . The situation is similar in Switzerland, where a growing incor poration of CAM into both the academic educational system and public health care can be seen.2 This \"reconciliation\" seems astonishing, given the in many respec ts successful struggle of biomedicine against what it sees as \"heterodox\" heal- ing systems and actors. The evolution of modern biomedicine or so- called \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 countries since then (Hunt et al. 2010: 1501). For further information, cp. Ha rris and Rees 2000, Yamashita et al. 2002, Wolf et al. 2006, Harris et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2010. One has to bear in mind that there is no unifo rm way to define CAM and operationalize its use. Whi le some studies include, for example, prayer or dietary supplements, others do not (Hunt et al. 2010: 1501). Therefor e, it is diffi- cult to give accurate quantitative data about the popularity o f CAM. 2 In 2009, 67 percent of Swiss voters supported a cons titutional article on CAM (Federal constitution Art. 118a BV (new): \"The Federal government and cantons shall ensure that, within the scope of their jurisdiction, complementary medicine is taken into consideration.\" Since at least 2012 CAM has slowly been integrated into the Swiss public health . On CAM's institutional inte- gration into the Swiss academic educational system, cp., for i nstance, www.ikom.unibe.ch, for example, Spielberg 2007. De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 169 conventional medicine during the nineteenth century, which was closely en- tangled with the development of public health-care systems, is l inked not only to the struggle of \"orthodoxy\" against \"heterodoxy,\"3 but also to the social process described as \"differentiation\" (cp. Luhmann 1984, 1995; Par- sons 2001), including that between medicine as physical healing and re ligion as focusing on the metaphysical and transcendent aspects. As many healing practices and concepts belonging to CAM include such aspects, it is aston- ishing to see CAM becoming more and more established in institutionalized secular medical contexts. As I will argue below, I interpret this develo pment as an indication of de-differentiation. My aim in this article is to suggest an explanation for why, among other possible reasons, CAM is attractive in certain medical contexts by looking at the situation in Switzerland. In asking this question, I use Ann Swidl er's con- cept of the \"tool kit\" (1986), outlining three specific traits that are cons istent with many CAM therapies.4 Before doing so, I will clarify the relevant terms and give a very brief introduction to the historical background of modern medicine and the process of social differentiation in Europe. The theses presented in this article are backed up by empirical data de- rived from a Swiss research project on \"Alternative Religi on at the End of Life,\" as well as by related studies by other authors. We conducted this pro- ject with Rafael Walthert, Mirjam Mezger5 and Barbara Zeugin in six health- care institutions in the German-speaking part of Switzerland f rom 2013 to 2016.6 We carried out qualitative research in different kinds of hospi tal, a hospice and a nursing home for the elderly. Two of these institut ions had a specific ideological background based in anthroposophy, but the others had none apart from the fact that they practiced biomedicine. In all six case stud- ies, we carried out participant observation and conducted guided interviews with nurses (28), doctors (11), therapists (17), chaplains (11), and in m ost \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 Cp., for example, Wahlberg 2007. 4 As this suggestion stems from a social -scientific position and reflects the non - normative perspective of the Study of Religion, the potential medica l effects of CAM will not be discussed in this article. 5 Cp. Mezger 2018. 6 This project was conducted with the financial support of the Swiss National Foundation.

We ana- lyzed the data based on the analytical background of grounded theory. The coding procedure was supported by Atlas ti. 2 A MINEFIELD OF TERMS Kaptchuk and Eisenberg (2001: 189) called the taxonomy of contemporary unconventional healing practices a \"linguistic minefield\". Further m inefields are th e healing practices,\" \"religion,\" and \"spi r- ituality.\" The use of these taxonomies is influenced by power struggles over legitimation and is profoundly linked to value judgements. According to Ernst, the umbrella term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" (CAM) \"refers to a diverse array of treatment m odalities and di- agnostic techniques that are not presently considered part of conv en- tional/mainstream medicine and emphasize a holistic approach tow ards health care\" (2008: 2). Kelner and Wellman7 explain that the \"concept of CAM\" covers \"[...] a diverse set of healing practices, which do not normally f it under the scientific medical umbrella. Instead, these practices emphasize t he uniqueness of each individ- ual, integration of body , mind and spirit, the flow of energy as a source of healing, and disease as having dimensions beyond the purely biolog ical. The life force is very commonly seen as a crucial element of the healing process and str ong emphasis is placed on the environment, the subjective experience of patients, the healing power of nature, and health as a positive state of being.\" (2000: 5) CAM therefore unites very different healing practices and hen ce inevitably leads to unjustifiable generalizations.8 However, in this context, the term \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7 Kelner and Wellman are referring here to the perspec tives of Howard S. Berliner and J. Warren Salmon, as well as Michael Goldstein. 8 On the terminology here, cp. Koch 2015; Ernst 2008:2 -3. Similarly used terms are medicine\" and \"holistic medicine.\" De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 171 \"biomedicine\" refers to the more or less consistent medical system that is restricted to the principles and academic knowledge of the natural sciences .9 I use the term \"religion\" as an etic term, including concepts and pr actices that practitioners may not refer to as \"religion\" but as \"spirituality.\" This us- age is similar to that of Wouter J. Hanegraaff (2000), who also uses religion as an umbrella term, but differentiates between \"a religion\" (i nstitutional- ized) and \"a ing Geertz, Hanegraaff defines \"religion\" as \"[...] any symbolic system which influences human action by pro viding possibilities for ritually maintaining contact between the everyday w orld and a more general meta - empirical framework of meaning\" (2000: 295). This perspective is compatible with Luhmann's notion of religion, who states that \"communication is always [...] religious when it observes imm anence from the point of view of transcendence [...]\" (2002: 77).10 In this sense, semantics can be called \"religious\" if something that is perceived as \"imma- nent\" is framed by something that is perceived as \"transcendent\" (Luhmann 1989: 313-316). For various reasons I do not follow the emic distinction between \" reli- gion\" and \"spirituality,\" which is often used in a highly normative way: reli- gion is seen as something institutionalized, which may be superficial , dog- matic, exclusive, and intolerant, or even dangerous and aggressive, whi le spirituality is seen as experience- based , private, \"universal,\" and \"whole- some\".11 These normative associations are often the reason why the respec- tive terms are used or rejected by particular agents.12 I wish to avoid the nor- mativity of these distinctions by using \"religion\" as an umbrella t erm. This \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9 Other authors prefer terms such as \"conventional,\" \" allopathic,\" \"orthodox,\" \"Western,\" or \"modern\" medicine in this context. 10 translation in Laermans/Verschraegen 2001: 15 . 11 Cp. Sinclair et al. 2006: 475. 12 The right of religious freedom makes the label \"reli gion\" attractive to specific actors, while the aim of becoming integrated into secular s ystems, as for insta nce into secular schools or secular hospitals, can cause its reje ction and replacement with the label \"spirituality.\" 172 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens also allows me to take the continuity between phenomena labeled \"r eligious\" or \"spiritual\" into account. Assuming a modern, Western, and Christian environment, in this paper, \"alternative religion\" is understood as a relative concept re ferring to a pool of practices and concepts that are not commonly seen as forming part of the traditional canon of Christianity in its institutionalized forms. Although they may even be more popular than traditional practices and concepts,13 in the West they are seen as \"alternative\". This pool has no strict boundaries, and the respective practices and concepts\u2014such as, for example, belief in rein- carnation or meditation practices\u2014can also be found in conventional reli- gious communities, for instance in churches. There is a huge overlap with tendencies often called \"Esotericism\" (Frisk 2013: 373) or \"New Age ,\" which may themselves be influential. Referring to Hanegraaf f, Steven J. Sut- cliffe (2014) has referred to this field of religion as \"New A ge sensu lato\", that is, as a field that \"remain[s] analytically elusive de spite [its] increased visibility in many societies\" and that tends to \"blur the bound aries between expressions of 'religion' and 'culture\"' (2014: 42). In the case of health care, this blurring refers to the boundaries betw een expressions of religion, medicine, and therapy. Since the first publication of New Age Religion and Western Culture , this \"wider New Age movement\" has diffused into the wider cultural and social environment of modern \"sec- ular\" societies and therefore yielded a \"fluid New Age\".14 It is important to realize that there is no unified \"movement\" or entity that contains unifying concepts. Nevertheless, what could be called a \"fluid New Age\" and be seen as part of this \"alternative religion\" m ay be delineated by the field's emphasis on emotions and subjective experiences, combined with an \"individualistic orientation and a weak tendency to organization and holistic function\" (Knoblauch 2008: 142).15 Typical markers of \"alternative religion\" are the se lf-identity of being an alternative to something else (Sut- cliffe 2004: 467, 479), hence the conceptualization of the self as being dif - ferent from the kind of religion that is seen as traditional a nd conservative. This is frequently combined with a sense of belonging to the future, with a \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13 Cp. Partridge 2005. 14 Cp. L\u00fcddeckens/Walthert 2010: 9 -17. 15 Even if there is organization in this field, the sel f-perception is often in non -con- formity therewith. De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 173 sense of having outgrown the old \"narrow-minded\" religions and of belong- ing to some kind of growing movement that is different from the predominant materialism. The narrative of the autonomy of the individual is cr ucial. Th e individual him- or herself is the guiding principle for the accepta nce of au- thority and for decisions about orthodoxy and orthopraxy. One's own au- thentic experiences are the normative reference,16 and communicating choices as individual ones is important. Paul Heelas (2002: 362) in par ticular called attention to the focus on life in the sense of one's own \"tr ue inner life\". Quite often it is the life and the focus on the body of the indiv idual in the here and now and the aim of the progress of the individu al\u2014her or his trans- formation into a higher spiritual and mental level (Frisk 2013: 373)\u2014t hat counts more than the prospect of an afterlife. As we shall s ee later, these aspects of alternative religion play a crucial role in the context of CAM. 3 THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN ACA DEMIC MEDICINE AND SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION Three linked developments are important to consider with regard to the evo- lution of biomedicine as a differentiated social subsystem in the Global North.17 These developments were responsible for the medical and social success of biomedicine while at the same time giving rise to ongoing criti- cism. First, the \"clinical gaze\" (Foucault 1973), decisive for the ev olution of biomedicine, went along with a social differentiation between physicia n and patient. Within the modern institution of the hospital, patients were no longer \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16 Heelas and Woodhead choose to use the term \"spiritua lity\" and describe the same phenomenon by calling it a \"subjective turn\" (2005: 2 -5). The emphasis on the individual is in accordance with Callum Brown s observation ( 2006) of the narra- tive of individual self -fulfillment and personal freedom that has arisen since the 1960s. 17 The developments described in what follows reflect t he medical history of Euro- pean and subsequently North American societies. However, similar (at l east to a certain extent) developments in the direction of the establish ment of biomedicine took place in other parts of the world, as exemplified in this volume by case stud- ies in Tanzania (W. Bruchhausen), India (N. Rageth), a nd Japan (M. Schrimpf). ,174 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens in a feudal patron-client relationship but had become \"objects\" for the phy- sician to work on. Moreover, the \"transition from Bedside Medicine t hrough Hospital Medicine to Laboratory Medicine was accompanied by a shi ft in cosmological form away from a person orientated towards an object ori en- tated cosmology\" (Jewson 1976: 225).18 Medicine was no longer \"person- the physician perceiving the patient as a \"holis tic\" person, but disease-oriented: patients were seen as separate from their social posi- tions, relationships, and social traits, and were only viewed from t he aspect of a disease (cp. Vogd 2007; Schoene 1980). \"The modification in professional self-understanding from a healer whose duty is to preserve the patient as a creature of God in a more or less artistic way to a scientist whose duty is to understand illness in a rational way, also changed the attitude towards patients which, in the age of scien ce, seems almo st indifferent, (Atzeni/von Groddeck 2015: 31) (Bio)medicine became level, often bei ng per- ceived as fragmentary and mechanistic. Patients became bodies, a nd bodies were seen as matter. Atzeni and von Groddeck (2015: 30) analyzed doctors' autobiographies and summarized them with reference to the generation \" who started their careers around the middle of the nineteenth century,\" as well as emphasizing the \"scientific aspect of medicine\" in their pr ofessional self- understanding: \"Doctors save bodies, not souls. This self -understanding is connected with the belief that the human body is the sum of a person (biological re ductionism). Through me- thodical examination, which Foucault describes as the 'medi cal gaze' on the body (Foucault, [1976] 1994), the doctor deduces symptoms, illnesses, and causes by ap- plying scientific methods.\" (Atzeni/von Groddeck 2015: 30) Hence, patients might experience themselves as being reduced to a diagno- sis\u2014a person as a patient seems to be nothing more than his or her illness.19 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 18 On the development from patient -centered to physician -centered medicine, cp. Lachmund/Stollberg 1995. 19 \"From the late 1960s onwards, the image of the heroic, pater nalistic doctor disin- tegrates\" (Atzeni/von orms of the De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 175 Secondly, as the developing biomedicine based itself on scientific meth- ods, it distanced itself from religion and even excluded it. A corresponding development can be observed in modern academic psychology, where \"tran- scendence was structurally excluded and the physical determinis m of the 1880s was adopted as an academic theory\" (Koch 2015: 436). The approach to the body as matter and thus the exclusion of any meta- physical, non-empirical aspects led to knowledge that claimed t o be scientific because it was based on and restricted to the body as an empirical entity.20 Medicalization21 linked to rationalization (cp. Turner 2008; Ballard/El- ston 2005) is compatible with secularization (cp. Bull 1990), of which i t forms a part: for example, many \"conditions have become transformed from sin to crime to sickness\" (Conrad 1992: 213). Deviant social behavior, s uch as homosexual practices or epileptic seizures, and bodily dysfunctions like infertility, formerly understood in a religious framework, became medical- ized and were redefined as medical: \"Disapproved behavior is more and more coming to be given th e meaning of illness requiring treatment rather than of crime requiring punish ment, victimization requiring compensation, or sin requiring patience and grace.\" (Freidson 1988: became relevan t and led to a change in the general attitude towards patients. 20 It was common in the struggle for medical legitimizat ion to declare one's own kind of medicine to be \"scientific\" instead of \"reli gious\". Therefore, one argument put forward by a medical editor in 1876, an advocate for medicine rel ying on clinical empiricism as opposed to medicine relying on labor atory experimenta- tion, was, for example: \"The practitioner, at the bedside of his patien t does not care to indulge in medical metaphysics. [...] In his attempts to solve mysteries, known only to the Infinite, the modern speculator makes bold assertions, not guar- anteed by a single fact, and with an audacity unparalleled, wil l no doubt shortly give the medicinal effects of religion on the human soul, describi ng the essence of the vital spark, its chemical constituents, and a number of newly discovered elements contained therein.\" (cited in Cunningham/Williams 2002 : 132). 21 Medicalization is a \" sociological concept, that essentially refers to the process by which social life comes to be seen through a medical framework\" (Howarth 2007: 119). 176 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens Thirdly, the evolution of \"medicine\" as a distinct social and acad emic system was accompanied by increasingly successful attempts at the su bordination and exclusion of practitioners who did not belong to the same academic sys- tem and did not share the same \"scientific\" rationale.22 While there has al- ways been medical pluralism in the form of different kinds of h ealers, during the nineteenth century many new healing systems emerged, leading even more strongly to the formation of an \"orthodox professional identity\" and a \"rigid ideology of orthodoxy\" (Warner 1998: 5), as well as vice versa (Starr 1982: 95).23 This antagonism divided biomedicine from medical concepts and treatments that did not restrict themselves to the acade mic knowledge of the natural sciences and did not necessarily exclude religion. With the \"pro- fession of medicine\" (Freidson 1988), the profession of medical doctor s de- fined by a certain academic education, and the evolution of spec ialized pro- fessional institutions, (bio)medicine became an 1988: 303). According to Freidson, \"[...] it cannot fail that t heir [practicing professions'] conceptions will be different from th at of the man on the street [...]\" (1988: 303). This alienation of professional conception s from the conceptions of patients is strongly interrelated with the \"clinical gaze\" described above. The result of these three linked developments was the differentiation be- tween medicine as biomedicine, inseparably linked to the natural sc iences24 and focus ed on immanent physical illness, on the one hand, and religion, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22 However, this was not a straightforward development with out any setbacks. In the pre -war period in the U SA, for example, \"the power and prestige of the regu lar profession were declining\" (Warner 1998: 6). Nevertheless, in this period many boundary structures evolved: the American Medical Association (A MA, founded 1847), for example, had as one of its goals to \"draw the line of demar cation be- tween those who are of the profession and those who are not\" (cited in Warner 1998: 9). 23 The opposition was to medically exclusive \"systems\" that were \"rationalist\" in- stead of \"empiricist\" in orientation, as especially h omeopathy was said to be (Warner 2003: 347). 24 This link does not hint at the de -differentiation between medicine and science, but, in the language of systems theory, to its \"subsidiarity\" (Sc h\u00fctzeichel 2011: 86). Medical praxis, the practice of dealing w ith patients, should first of all be aimed at their health, not at the acquisition of new scientifi c knowledge. De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 177 concerned with transcendent matters, on the other.25 Sociological differenti- ation theory (cp. Parsons 2001; Luhmann 1984, 1995) assumes that there are functionally differentiated systems in modern societies. These systems ha ve different functions for society and operate with different codes. As Sch\u00fctzeichel (2011) observes, in modernity we move within the fram ework of different Sinnwelten , such as art, science, religion, or medicine. According to Sch\u00fctzeichel, we usually know in what kind of framework or Sinnwelt we are and \"which rules apply, where the boundaries of these rules are, and therefore where the boundaries of these areas are\" (2011: 73, my tra nslation). Medicine in the shape of biomedicine is just one such \"area\" in the sense of a functionally differentiated subsystem of society (Luhmann 1983, 1990: 183-187; While \"(bio)medicine\" operates with the code \"sane/insane\", \"religion\" operates with the code \"transcendent/immanent,\" its function bei ng to reduce contingency or eliminate it, at least temporarily. Luhmann assumed t hat re- ligion will not be part of other functionally differentiated systems in moder n societies. Correspondingly, we observe the \"separating out of welfa re [in- cluding medical care] as a distinct area of activity [...] central to the process of secularization in European societies [...]\" (Davie 2013: 225). This sepa- ration went along with professionalized agents and the creation of an auton- omous sphere with institutions organized by scientific instead of religious logics, norms, and structures. According to Casanova, \"differentiati on and emanc ipation of the secular spheres from religious institutions and norms \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 25 Starr mentions the different moral and religious as well as naturalistic American responses to the cholera epidemics of the nineteenth centur y: \"During a second epidemic in 1849, clerical attacks on science were common, but reli gious author- ity no longer figured prominently in response to a third cho lera epidemic in 1866. By then, public health methods and organizations wer e assuming more effect ive authority.\" (1982: 36) 26 As Peter Beyer pointed out, under modern circumstanc es religion, as a functi on- ally systemic form, acquired \"essential s ymptoms of such systematization\": \" con- vergent centres of religious authority, expressly religious organiza tions (many with global extent or at least more than local range ), articulated religious pro- grammes elaborating clear religious binary codes, and the effec tive (self -)obser- vation of these (1997: | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens remains a modern structural trend\" (1994: 212). Religion is still present in medical institutions, especially in the field of dying and death, but medical and religious care have been separated: medical staff are re sponsible for the body, while chaplains are responsible for the soul. According to the Worl d Health Organization, \"spirituality\" (not \"religion\"!)27 should be an integral part of palliative care, and many manuals of various palliative care unit s de- mand that medical staff provide spiritual as well as medical support. But these agents are not expected to do both at the same time withi n the same interaction. All this fits into the framework of social \"differ entiation,\" where different social subsystems are responsible for physical healt h on the one hand and religious well-being on the other. The process of medicalizat ion and the exclusive focus on physical health in biomedical contexts are more sophisticated with regard to psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. Ps ychi- atrists might feel responsible for the religious well-being of the ir patients in so far as they may discuss feelings of religious guilt or th e fear of hell, but conventional psychiatrists will discuss these matters within a psychiatric framework: their focus is on the health status of their patients, not their trans- cendent salvation. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 27 \"Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients a nd their families facing the problem associated with life -threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impec- cable assessment and trea tment of pain and other problems, physical, psychoso- cial and spiritual.\" (http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative -/definition/en/, June 14, 2018). De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 179 4 THE CAM TOOL KIT In the following, I will suggest explanations for why, in a modern diffe renti- ated society, processes take place that may be understood as pa rt of a de- differentiation of medicine and religion. In particular, I will foc us on the question of why CAM is attractive in certain medical contexts. Thi s question was inspired by the observation in our case studies that many nurses, thera - pists, and patients in biomedical institutions used practices t hat belong to the field of CAM, such as aromatherapy, aura-healing, polarity, breath therapy etc. I will argue that CAM is attractive because it does not differentiate be- tween medicine and religion, because internally it is a \"loosely coupled field\" in the sense of Weick (1976), and because it offers a resource for self- em- powerment. The first trait, I argue further, is especially impor tant and rele- vant for the other traits. Therefore, I will concentrate on it more broadly. These arguments have been developed on the basis of various case studies of alternative medicine in Europe and the US, in combination with the oretical reflections on contemporary religiosity and religion. They are s ubstantiated by observations and interview data from our own research project. 4.1 CAM as an Undifferentiated Tool K it Grace Davie and Terhi Utriainen have already used the term \"de- differenti- ation\" with regard to processes in the field of health care in Britain and Fin- land respectively. Davie (2013: 233) called European developments, where religious agents\u2014the c hurches among others\u2014are meant to provide a system of welfare, while the state re- treats at least partly. Utriainen observed \"de-differentia tion\" with regard to \"spiritual care,\" which she distinguished from Christian pas toral care. She refers to the entering of \"spiritual care\" in secular insti tutions and the \"becoming increasingly indeterminate and boundless\" (Utriainen 2010: 446). She further suggests that \"spiritual care i s becoming part of the language and, perhaps increasingly, part of the practice of care, [which] will be understandable when it is seen in its historica l context and conceptualized as de-differentation\" (Utriainen 2010: 447). While Da vie and Utriainen discussed the de-differentiation of medicine and rel igion without referring to CAM, Buss and Sch\u00f6ps see the recognition of naturopathy as an 180 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens example of de-differentiation phenomena. However, they do not explicitly discuss this topic with regard to religion (Buss and Sch\u00f6ps 1979: 327). Schlieter suggests to see MBSR clinical sett ings as an exam- ple of \"dedifferentiation in biomedicine\" and argues that \"we ma y des cribe 'dedifferentiation' more precisely as a process in which two in dependent sys- tems interact in a shared interface [...]\" (2017: 457). It is one a rgument of this article that the CAM tool kit is used because it is un differentiated with regard to medicine and religion. I suggest using the concept of de-differentiation not only where we find the same actors practicing medicine and religion, but also where pra ctices are intended to have religious as well as medical effects and aims at the same time. In other words, I suggest using the concept of de-differentiation where communication deals simultaneously with the differentiation betwee n sane/insane and transcendent/immanent (Luhmann 1989: 313-316). In the cases described in this paper, therefore, (immanent) medica l situations and practices are observed under the perspective of transcendence. Thus, the CAM tool kit does not reproduce the social differentiation be - tween medicine and religion that took place with regard to biomedi cine. As I will show below, its strength lies in opposing the developments sketched out above. The advocates of the unorthodox healing systems of the nineteenth cen- tury distanced themselves from what they called \"allopathy\" or ater \"Schulmedizin\" (J\u00fctte 1996: 23-35). While the for example, used the label \"medical science\" for the k ind of med- icine that was mainly taught in the universities and stressed t he orientation toward the natural sciences, opponents put \"nature\" in opposition to the \"nat- ural sciences.\" Accordingly, they blamed allopathy for not being oriented towards nature and even for working against nature and against patients' bodies by means of its barbaric practices. To contrast the mea sures associated with \"heroic medicine,\" they claimed that their own therapies a nd remedies were smooth, \"natural,\" and in harmony with nature. Catherine Albanese quotes part of the motto of two Thomsonian editors: \"No poisoning, bleeding, blistering, or physicing \u2014the unity of disease, it bei ng an obstruction to the free op eration of the laws of vitality \u2014the use of those remedies only, that act in harmony with nature's laws .\" (1986: 492 -493) 'De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 181 These healing systems, later summarized under the term \"CAM,\" did not ac- cept the \"clinical gaze\" and did not want to reduce the patient as a person to an object with a very specific illness related to specific asp ects of her or his body.28 Many CAM practices and concepts claim to be \"holistic\" and to de al with the person as a unity of \"body, mind and soul/spirit\". While biomedicine differentiated itself from religion, CAM, at l east in its holistic branches, integrated medicine with religion simultaneously. 4.1.1 CAM and Alternative R eligion The integration of religion took place through the reception of alternati ve religion that did not follow the process of becoming a functionally di fferen- tiated subsystem of society.29 In modern societies we witness religion ex- pressing itself not only in a functional system and in social movem ents, as Beyer outlines, but in . an \"alternative for religion a nd its carriers [...] to avoid functionally specific systemization, to avoid extensi zation, orthodoxifications, and self-presentation as religion\" (Beyer 1997: 223). New healing systems of the nineteenth century, such as homeopathy, Thomsonianism, osteopathy, and hydropathy, were influenced by the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 28 Sered and Agigian call this a \"holist ic illness narrative\" and explain that, while the \"discursive expansion of illness intrinsic to the holism of holistic healing may be no less valid than conventional understandings of breast cancer, \" there are \"hidden costs to the holistic illness narrative, just as the re are hidden costs to the conventional medical narrative\" (2008: 617). 29 Apparently, there is a striking parallel and link be tween \"alternative/unorthodox\" and \"conventional/orthodox\" systems in the medical and religio us fields. For ex- ample, William H. Holcombe (1804 -1870), a North American adherent of Swe- denb orgianism and a prominent homoeopathic physician, saw a strong coherence between his religious and medical convictions and his opposition to \"al lopathy\" and orthodox theology: \"Today when speaking rather bitterl y of Roman Catholic mummeries, my mind follow ing a familiar undercurrent of thought, I misnamed it Allopathic mummeries. The Old and New Medicine. Indeed, I am a Homeopath simply in primary view because I was previously a new Churchman\" (Holcombe as cited in Warner 1998: 8). 182 | Swedenborgianism, mesmerism transcendentalism, and magnetism. Accordingly, mind and body, materia l matter and spirit, nature and divine energy, were seen as intermingl ed and in correspondence with each other (Albanese 1986). Albanese described t hese conceptions, which \"deified nature and made it into religion\" and wh ere \"na- ture became a symbolic and salvific center, encircled by a cluster of related therapeutic beliefs, behaviors, and values,\" by using the term \"natur e reli- gion\" and linking it to the experiences of industrialization and urbani zation (1986: 489). Beyer mentions as examples of contemporary \"non-systemic forms\" New Age movements, Western neo-paganism and Pentecostalism. All three of them are examples of religious expressions that show medica l and thera- peutic aspects as well. Alternative religion, with its \"holis tic\" self-under- standing, is deliberately capable of combining religious and medical pr ac- tices and \"avails itself of a range of bodily techniques, particular ly healing techniques, meditation, yoga, Ayurveda [...]\" (Knoblauch 2008: 144). Beyer explains that in the case of New Age, its eschewing \"convergent s ystemati- 1997: 223).30 Correspondingly, writing of the 1970s, John Gordon Melton observed that \"the New Age Movement and the holistic health movement merged to the extent that it is difficult, if not impossible, for an observer to draw the line between them\" (1990: xix-xx). The common semantics and conceptions of CAM and alternative rel igion still involve, for example, \"energy,\" \"the 'correspondence' of the phys ical realm with higher metaphysical realms, enabling lawful patte rns of interac- tion among them\" (Fuller or subtle bodies (cp. Johnston 2010).31 Some authors therefore see CAM as a gateway to alternative religion (e.g. Knoblauch 2008: 144; Andritzky 1997). Accord- ing to Koch, \"[...] 'spiritualization' in the sense of the adoption in society of elements linked to religion can [...] be observed in the sector of a lternative medicine\" (2015: 437). She observes further that, for example, \"[...] an \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 30 \"All three of these [v arious religious manifestations like Western neo -paganism, New Age movements, and ironically enough, Pentecostali sm] eschew convergent systematization in principle, if not actually in prac tice. This direction, however, risks precisely the 'invisibility' of religion [...]\" (Beyer 1997: 223). 31 For a primary source, cp. Dale 2014. De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 183 increasing number of 'Ayurvedas' have appeared since the 1990s, which of- ten expressly describe themselves as spiritual or use religious conce pts (cos- mological and anthropological concepts of happiness)\" (Koch 2015: 437). All this indicates that alternative religion and CAM go hand in hand in many cases. Aromatherapy, for example, is often perceived as a complemen- tary therapy, with its \"etheric qualities\" as therapeutics for the body, mind, and spirit that improve well-being physically, mentally, and emotiona lly, as well as \"spiritually.\" These effects are sometimes attr ibuted to their influence on the limbic system. If a therapist wants to support a patient to connect with his or her \"higher self\" through an application of bergamot oil or to att ract spiritual beings through the application of basil oil, there are obviously reli- gious aspects involved. In our case studies, neroli, lavender, and rose (dam- ascena and bulgarian) oil have been prominent. Beyond their physical a nd psychological effects, like \"relaxing\" and \"calming,\" they are \"purifying,\" and supporting transi- tions, all of them being effects that belong to a wider spiritual concept . Rose oil especially is seen as supporting transitions. One nurse explai ned her usage of aromatherapy after being asked about any \"spiritual practices\": \"[...] because it [aromatherapy] is something that supports and comforts you. [...] For instance, especially sli ghtly heavier scents like rose oil or lavender, um, (2) they help (.) people say, I don't know if and how this is scientifically proven (.) But people say that it, that it helps for restlessness, stress, anxiety, (.) that it also helps, specifically rose f or, um, like letting go, or for, for, for transitions (.) um, like from life to death or vice versa (.). Into life, like at births, one uses that too.\" (Regi na, nurse, 9.12. au (5) wo Halt und Trost git. [...] Zum Bispiel \u00e4hm bi Geburte brucht me das au\". This interview was conducted b y Mirjam Mezger. 184 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens These practices (including communicated concepts) quite often go beyond the regulated practices suggested by the institutional manuals of secular health-care institutions. Given the undifferentiated character of CAM, the question about the ways in which the use of CAM is made attractive is raised . What are the goals of using CAM in biomedical contexts? In our case studies, nurses, therapists etc. often rely on CAM when they encounter limits with regard to the tools they are officially trained in. This is the case when nurses experience situations where they \"cannot do anythi ng more for the dying patient,\" and a medical system restricted to biomedici ne can no longer work with its own references and logic of healing the physical body. This experience is irritating, as medical staff see them selves as profes- sionals \"helping\" patients and having an empathic relationship with th em. Therefore, they resort to CAM to develop strategies in order to keep in tune with their habitus, to be of help to their dying patients, and to maint ain or enforce interaction with them: \"We, the nurses, would like to have complementary medicine tools sometimes, so that you are able to do something. Healing isn't possible anymore [at the palliative care unit], but at l east to be able to do something \u2014one has to be careful, whether one is doing it for the patient or for oneself.33\" (Andrea, nurse, 17.6.2015) The CAM tool kit involves \"symbols, stories, rituals and world-views\" (Swidler 1986: 273), practices and concepts that go beyond the framework of the natural sciences. When nothing else can be done for the healing of the body, support for emotional, metaphysical, and transcendent needs is an at- tractive strategy of action. CAM allows medical staff to rationalize their ac- tions and the ends they are pursuing with them beyond the boundaries of biomedicine, framing them further as \"supportive.\"34 At the same time, this tool kit allows them to remain within the framework of \"hea ling\" and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 33 Field note, Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens. 34 CAM al so enables actors in the religious field, such as cha plains, to deal with precarious situations by targeting non -empirical as well as bodily levels. Thus, we found carers who rationalized their practices with alterna tive religious concepts and used CAM, as well as ecclesiastical ministers who completed comple mentary medical training. De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 185 \"caring.\" The use of Aromtherapy by Regina mentioned above is an exa mple of this: the aroma of rose oil is used to support the transiti on from life to death, the capacity of the patients to \"let go\", an aim for which no biomedical tools are available. 4.1.2 Religion as a Coping S trategy CAM also offers a tool kit for agents who are generally interest ed in creating scopes of action that exceed the limits of their professions as defined and delimited by the differentiated subsystem we call \"medicine\". They attract actors in the medical field who do not want to restrict themselves to medica l practices that focus only on the physical body but want to use religi on, or rather \"spirituality,\" as part of coping strategies. This again s eems to be es- pecially the case with palliative care, which today is strongly infl uenced by Cecily Saunders, a British Anglican social worker, nurse, and la ter physician, and Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, a Swiss-American psychiatrist. One reason for their continuing, international influence is that they combine conventi onal health care with so-called \"spiritual care\". As long as there is hope for he al- ing, the physical body is at the center of attention in secular hospita ls. Social relationships, psychological aspects, and above all religion are only see n as supporting factors in the physical healing process. However, in instit utions and hospital units specialized in palliative care, just the opposite can be ob- served. The treatment of the body, in the sense of getting \"symptoms under control,\" is seen as the condition for a process in which much m ore im- portance is attached to the idea of \"a good death,\" which involves mental and \"spiritual\" engagement with dying and death, including \"acceptance, \" \"peacefulness,\" and \"the decision to 'let go'\".35 \"There seems to be a corresponding interest on the part of the p atients, as several studies hint at a 'value shift towards self -transcendent values in palliative care pa- tients, possibly reflecting coping processes which take place in the face of a terminal illness'\" (Fegg et al. 2005: 158). CAM, in connection with \"fluid New Age\", often meets patients' nee d to understand their illnesses in broader contexts. It also allows them to discuss \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 35 Cp. Demj\u00e9n et al. 2016; Semino et al. 2014. 186 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens themselves and their bodies. Patients can understand their sic k bodies and their own \"spirituality\" as an integral part of their own sel ves. According to our case studies, the tool of breath therapy, for example, may enable patients to connect with suppressed, difficult emotions with the goal of \"letting th em go\". This in turn may be seen as a path to their \"higher inner sel f\". In the words of one patient, \"[...] last but not least my illness alerted me, to tell me, hey, do something, in your second life\" (Elsbeth, patient, 8.6.2015).36 According to one therapist, falling ill is often seen as a task or a \"'chance' to have to learn something that maybe I haven't learned in my last l ives\" (Mara, eurythmy therapist, 11.5.2015).37 In a similar way, illness is perceived as a \"path\" or task for personal \"development\": \"There is some reason for getting that [illness], however. And whether to develop myself, to, perhaps, become aware, this is who I am\" (Manuela, nurse, 22.5.2015).38 Physical experiences in the context of treatments can be connecte d to the goal of spiritual development. This allows patients, especially w hen faced with their imminent death, to act, to do something for themselve s, even with- out any opportunities to do anything actively to improve their bodily condi - tions. In this context, one therapist explained: \"Often it happens during the therapy that people [experience] a min i-enlightenment. [...] and from that something This interview quote and the following ones stem fro m interviews con- ducted by der Therapie, and Medicine: CAM | 187 Many CAM treatments simultaneously have medical and religious aims or offer at least the opportunity for the treatments to be used for both purpo ses at the same time. Therefore, against the backdrop of the process of differe n- tiation outlined above, the increasing incidence of CAM treatments and CAM practitioners in secular medical institutions may be seen as signs of a process of de-differentiation (Tiryakian 1985, 1992; Buss/Sch\u00f6ps 1979: 324). De-differentiation might be seen as \"processes in which pr eviously separate roles or organizations are fused to deal with a broa der set of prob- lems.\" (Rueschemeyer 1977: 8). However, a \"'de-differentiated role' does not return to the structurally prior level of development charact erized by lack of specialization\" (Lipman-Blumen as cited in Tiryakian 1985: 121). The role of the nurse or therapist may become de-differentiated in serving medi- cal and religious aims at the same time without a loss of medical specia liza- tion. These phenomena appear mainly at the margins of the biomedical hea lth- care system in cases of palliative care, maternity war ds, psychosomatic med- icine, psychiatry, and preventive medicine. Yet it is often at the margins that new developments occur and this trend has already reached cancer tr eatment units in particular. Beyond institutional implementation, in our studies , nurses and therapists, as well as in some cases medical doctor s, use CAM and explain their dealings with patients by referring to alter native religious concepts, such as extra-sensory perception. This presence of CAM in secula r medical institutions, going along with religious semantics, concepts, and norms, hints at processes of de-differentiation. 4.2 An Internally Loosely Coupled F ield The field of alternative medicines and therapies and of alternative rel igion is decentralized and has so far been institutionalized only weakly. In being characterized by weak and non-committal internal connections between dif- ferent agents, it can be called a loosely coupled field in t he sense of Weick (1976). In contrast, in strongly institutionalized fields such as acade mic med- icine or academic theology, the connections between agents, institutions etc . are much closer and more determined. This means first that tr aining pro- grams are comparatively open, with low-threshold access: one doe s not need a special level of educational attainment to be admitted to Reiki traini ng, for example. 188 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens Secondly, being a loosely coupled field allows a semantic vagueness a nd a high level of sensitivity to the environment. Semantic vagueness40 is highly compatible with the diverse professional self-perceptions and wor ld views of the medical staff. The diversity and flexibility of the available concepts and practices enable selective reception with high degrees of accuracy and fl exi- bility to form varying configurations to fit the respective actors and their sit - uational needs, as there are no authorities who can regulate access or the ap- plication of concepts and practices. Thirdly, this adaptability also applies to the relationship of al ternative religiosity to medicine and established religion: selectively, theologic al and especially medical and scientific schemes are integrated int o alternative re- ligiosities and their therapeutic practices. Accordingly, we obser ve a \"reflex- ive curing\" culture (Koch 2015: 437) that corresponds to the popularizati on of the discourse in ritual studies (cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2004) and \"reflexive rit u- alization\" (cp. Stausberg 2004). In the case of the latter, elements of anthro- pological theories of ritual are integrated into popular discourses about ritual (re)inventions. In the case of CAM, for instance, biomedical res earch, con- cepts, semantics, and symbols are partly integrated , or else references are made to science like quantum theory. CAM concepts involve, for example , nerve tracts, references to the chemical ingredients of reme dies, biomedical diagnostics etc.41 These flexible and selective connections allow actors to frame CAM as \"compatible\" with and \"complementary\" to their own bio- medical professionalization. 4.3 A Resource for Self -Empowerment In 1988, in his afterword to his study of 1970, in which he writes about the changed position of the patient since then, Freidson noted that \"w ell-edu- cated middle-class women of childbearing age have become mor e inclined to challenge medical authority and to insist on playing a more active role in their own treatment\" (1988: 388). In fact, surveys show that the idea of hav- ing more autonomy is one of the crucial motives for patients turni ng to \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 40 Typical examples of this sem vagueness are terms like \"energy\", \"nature,\" and \"holistic\" . 41 One example in the Japanese context is kanp medicine, Harasawa S., Miyoshi A., and Miwa (1998). De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 189 CAM.42 Ahlin, who discusses several studies from Europe, Canada, and the USA, concludes that \"[...] most important among these [the appealing positive qual ities of alternative ther- apists] is the sense of responsibility that alternative therap y offers i ts clients. In con- trast to conventional medicine, the client is not a passive receiver of healthcare but a self-governing actor with responsibility regarding his/her health, both today and in the future .\" (2015: 406) CAM practices do not necessarily involve patients more actively, and the autonomy of patients in their relationships with their therapists is in fact not necessarily greater than in a biomedical context. However, patient s associate the use of CAM with their own control over their own health mat ters, and this image of CAM is decisive. Bishop, Yardley, and Lewith, in their article A systematic review of beliefs involved in the use of complement ary and al- ternative medicine , concluded: \"The evidence suggests that CAM users want to participate in t reatment decisions, are likely to have active coping styles and might believe that they can control their health. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 42 One has to take into account the fact that the diffe rent studies rely on users of different kinds of CAM and that some of them found different resul ts for different practitioners (e.g. Reiki prac titioners may differ from homeopathy users). More- over, it makes a decisive difference whether one studies people w ho rely exclu- sively on CAM or people who combine CAM with biomedi cal treatments. Astin was able to show that the \"desire for control over he alth matters\" (1998: 1551) was one of the independent variables among the signi ficant predictors for relying primarily on alternative forms of health care. Bishop, Yardley, a nd Lewith sug- gest that \"people who use CAM might be more likely to prefer an a ctive or col- laborative role in treatment decisions than non -users\" (2007: 852). Similarly, Pawluch outlined that \"[...] complementary therapies represented a way to make a statement about the unresponsiveness and oppression of Wester n medicine. It represented a way to take control of one's health [...]\" (2000: 26 1). In contrast to a study published in 2003 by L\u00f6nroth and Ekholm, as repo rted by Ahlin (2015), the gender aspect is rarely considered. The latter found that 25% of patients, most of them women, had a \"w ish to take an active part in the healing process,\" an important factor in the use of CAM (Ahlin 2015: 407). 190 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens They value non -toxic, holistic approaches to health and hold 'postmodern b elief sys- tems' with viewing themselves as unconventional and spiritu al.\" (2007: 862) My argument here is that CAM is associated with more autonomy than con- ventional biomedicine because it is perceibed, at least partl y, as separate from the hegemonic health system dominated by biomedicine (which is exper i- enced as depriving patients of their autonomy) and as something the \"cultural authorities\" do not accept and that is therefore to some extent \"subversive .\" There is a congruence between these heirs of a \"medical coun ter-culture\" (cp. Saks 2003) and contemporary spiritualities along the lines of a New Age spirituality (cp. Hanegraaff 2000), the heirs to a \"religious counter -culture\". The impression that CAM is being increasingly accepted by the mainstream population, and even by the medical authorities, health insurance companies and so on, is even more a confirmation that the \"truth\" will prevail. Not only patients, but medical staff too may use CAM as a resource for self-empowerment and a tool for autonomy. As a loosely coupled field, CAM offers actors\u2014in our case health- care providers such as nurses and thera- pists\u2014more self-determination and autonomy than fields with strong ties do (cp. Granovetter 1973; Weick 1976). The strict regulations in hospita ls re- garding the practices of nurses are related to the fields of biom edicine and conventional nurseries: they do not include any rules regarding energy med- icine or aura healing. There is no constraining authority to control nurse s in these fields of CAM as long as they do not offend violently against the gen- eral hospital regulations. Therefore, CAM provides a route to \"self -empow- erment\" for actors in the hierarchically organized medical fie ld who see themselves as limited by their professions, as is often the cas e with nurses and therapists. The threshold for becoming an alternative therapist is consid- erably lower than the threshold to enter academic medicine. For a nurse seek- ing a career change, it is much easier to become a \"polarity ther apist\" than to embark on medical studies.43 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 43 People who follow a de -differentiating course of action publicly and explicit ly lose their status in their original field: Cicely Saunders, who is immensely im- portant for \"spiritual care\" and integrates medical and religi ous practices and ends, no longer has a strong standing as an academic theologian. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler -Ross, originally a doctor, also made de -differentiating moves by conceiv- ing death in a way that is no longer accepted within academic medicine. Her ideas De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 191 CAM offers a way to enhance self-esteem and prestige in the eyes of patients and sometimes colleagues as well. As Homi Bhabha obser ved of agents with less hierarchical power: \"[...] there exist possibilities to reverse the cultural autho rities we're facing, to adopt some aspects of it, and dismiss others . This leads to a hybridisation of the symbols of authority and turned into something of its own. Hybridisation to me does n ot simply mean mixing, but rather a strategic and selective app ropriation of meaning, the crea- tion of space for agents whose freedom and equality is threatened.\"44 (Bhabha cited in Babka/Posselt 2012: 13) CAM offers a \"selective appropriation of meaning\" that one may c all a re- flexive or hybrid curative culture (cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2013). By integrating the metaphysical or transcendent aspects into medical care, CAM provi des agents with the power to claim care beyond what is conventional and physi- cal. The medical system makes this kind of self-empowerment possible, es- pecially in palliative care. Where conventional medical reason has reached its limits, healing is no longer possible, and no more or at least l ess medical damage seems possible: thus, the field can be opened to alternative practices and interpretations. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 are regarded as esoteric precisely because they integrate the relig ious and medical perspectives. 44 Original wording: 9192 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens 5 CONCLUSION We are witnessing the growing institutionalization of CAM in secular me di- cal institutions in Switzerland, as in many other European countri es. In pal- liative care units, the CAM tool kit is used when the differe ntiated \"(bio)med- icine\" sub-system reaches the limits of its inherent logic. In cases where \"nothing can be done anymore\" with regard to the physical health of pa tients, medical staff face challenges to their professional habitus as care-gi vers. I have argued that CAM is currently successful in European countrie s because of three characteristics it has. By responding to medica l as well as religious or spiritual needs, and also by integrating aspects of alternative re - ligion, CAM allows medical staff to serve not only the bodily but also the emotional, metaphysical, and transcendent needs of their patient s. Thus, by using the CAM tool kit, medical staff are able to preserve thei r habitus as care-givers even at the end of life when nothing or less can be done f or the well-being of their patients' physical bodies. As a loosely coupled fie ld, CAM offers low-threshold access to training and application. It al so serves as a resource of self-empowerment for patients and medical sta ff alike in relation to conventional biomedicine and its hierarchical structures. The relevance of action strategies that refer to the CAM tool kit is gro w- ing in secular, biomedicine-oriented institutions in Switzerland. Compl e- menting other cases from England and Scandinavia, I suggest that thi s in- crease may be understood as a process of the de-differentiation of medic ine and religion in modern, European societies.

Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf ABS TRACT This article presents results of a qualitative study based on fieldwork and interviews in an anthroposophical hospital. From a practice -theoretical perspective, the paper discusses the interferences of medicine, religion, and spirit uality in the fie ld of anthroposophical end -of-life care. It describes the main practices conducted throughout the different stages of end -of-life care in this hospital and relates them to their rationalizations by medical actors as well as to basic anthroposophical concepts. Besides, the authors analyze power struggles between different actors displaying various dispositions concerning conventional and anthroposophical medicine, the latter integrating religious and spiritual aspects. The paper co ncludes by arguing that (1) there is a shift of relevance with regard to body -oriented and discursive practices in the course of anthroposophical end -of-life care, with a stronger emphasis on body - oriented practices at later stages. Moreover, (2) body -oriented practices, if rational ized in a religious way, serve as a resource not only for pa tients, but for staff members, too. Finally, (3) the contested issue of administering pain -killers and sedatives at the end of life in this hospital revealed that in many cases, nur ses, despite their inferior position compared to physicians, succeeded in their wish to act in dis cordance with anthroposophical principles. 202 Monika Schrimpf 1 INTRODUCTION1 In 2012, the Swiss people voted in favor of a popular petition to integrate anthroposophic2 medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, neu- ral therapy, and herbal medicine into the official list of services covered by obligatory health insurance. As a consequence, all expenses for thes e types of treatment will henceforth be covered, if they are provided or prescribed by trained physicians. This indicates a growing social acceptance of Com- plementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)3 in Switzerland as part of the established health-care system.4 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 All the empirical data on anthroposophical end-of-life care used in this article come from a case s tudy conducted by Barbara Zeugin within the broader c ontext of a research project on Alternative Religiosity and its Conse quences at the End of Life funded by the Swiss National Science ). We would like to convey our special thanks to all th e managerial staff in the hospital where Zeugi n conducted her fieldwork, to the leading internist, who introduced and mentored her, and to all employee s and patients who wel- comed her with open arms. Without their willingness to sha re their thoughts and experiences with her, this fieldwork would not ha ve been possible. The research project was approved by the Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich. Aside from the relevant literature, the few remarks in this article on co nventional palliative care are based on Dorothea L\u00fcddecken's fieldwork in a Swiss conventi onal palliative care unit conducted in 2016. 2 We decided to use the term \"anthroposophic medicine\" instead of \"anthroposoph- ical medicine\" so as to acknowledge the most common emic language usag e, in line with Kienle et al. (2006 ). 3 Gale and McHale's c ollection (2015) gives an overview of CAM, J\u00fctte (1996) introduces the history of CAM, and Crawford (2003) discu sses terminological issues. 4 The website of the Swiss Federal Office of Public He alth provides information about all policies related to the i ncorporation of CAM into the public health sector (cp. www.bag.admin.ch/themen/gesundheitspolitik/03153/index .html?lang =de, July 4, 2018). Puustinen (2014) has criticiz ed the incorporation of anthroposoph- ical medicine into the Swiss health -care sector by claiming that its religious ori- entation is incompatible with the principles of natural science. Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland | 20 3 Alongside these developments, the social sciences are also show ing an increasing interest in CAM. Social scientists are either exa mining particular examples of CAM or else discussing its relationship to conventional medi- cine ( cp. Jeserich 2010). Scholars in the Study of Religion, on the other hand, tend to scrutinize relationships between religion and medicine by referring mostly to discursive data material, that is, to written and oral data. Most of these studies discuss particular healing practices such as Ayurveda (cp. Koch 2006a, 2006b; Koch/Binder 2013; L\u00fcddeckens 2018) or generally (cp. Brown 2013; Koch 2015; L\u00fcddeckens 2012, 2013). The latter approach often leads to the conclusion that, while CAM s tems from specific religious traditions, it also forms an interface bet ween religion and medicine. While this article agrees with this conclusion, it differs methodo- logically from these earlier studies, which restrict their anal yses to the level of conceptualization by using only discursive data. Instead, this articl e at- tends not only to what people say but also to what they do, that is, to how they act.5 Thus, the central focus is on the social practice of anthroposophica l end-of-life care using one particular anthroposophical hospital as a case study.6 Adopting a practice-theoretical perspective on religion has proved to be a promising endeavor in recent research in the Study of Religion (c p. practice theory, Bourdieu's terms and concepts are quite prominent and allow not only varied sets of actions to be differenti ated as specific to a certain group of people (habitus), but also their attri bution to a specific realm (social field). Whereas scholars have already worked on the religious field (cp. Bourdieu 2000; Echtler/Ukah 2016b), this article deals with the intersection between it and the medical field. This specific focus is due to the fact that anthroposophical end- of-life care unfolds in a particular historical, social, and institutiona l context that already indicates a position between (alternative) religion7 and (convent- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5 Cp. Mezger 2018. 6 A communication -theoretical approach may represent another way of escaping a conceptualizing view of CAM (cp. Zeugin 2017). 7 The term \"alternative religion\" is used in this pape r as an etic category. In general , practitioners of anthroposophic medicine do not consider themselves to belong to 204 | Barbara Zeugin , end-of- life care combines the basic principles of conventional medicine with alternative religious be- liefs and practices, as anthroposophic medicine has aimed to counter -balance the one-sided notion of conventional medicine since its beginnings: \"This is not an opposition against contemporary medicine w orking with scientifically acknowledged methods. We fully accept this medicine in her pr inciples. And in our opinion what we offer should only be used by that practitioner of the a rt of medicine who can be considered a full physician according to these principles.\" (Stei- ner/Wegman 2014: 7)9 Anthroposophic medicine claims to undo the mechanistic and fragmenta ry conceptions of human beings that allegedly exist in conven- tional medicine by re-integrating \"spiritual science\" (\"Geistes \"Geis teswissen- schaft\" as a synonym of anthroposophy to highlight the aspect of spiritua l science that goes along with the anthroposophical worldview. In this s ense, \"Geisteswissenschaft\" means the aim and claim to Geistige\", \"the spiritual,\" exactly and methodically.10 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 the realm o f religion, nor to alternative religion. From an emic pe rspective, an- throposophy is seen at most as \" spiritual\". 8 We use \"conventional medicine\" in this paper as an e tic category. German texts written by anthroposophical authors mainly use the t erm \"Schu lmedizin\" or just \"Medizin.\" Kienle, Kiene and term \"scientific medicine\", and remark that \"Anthroposophic medicine considers itself to be an extension of sci- entific medicine\" ( 2006: 4). 9 This translation and all following translations o f texts originally in German are made by the authors of this article. 10 The English version of the official website of the \"School of science \" of the An- throposophical Society at the Goetheanum explains: \" In 1924 Rudolf Steiner de- veloped a course of study based on meditative exercises that lead 'the spiritual i n the human being to the spiritual in the universe.' This is the basis for the work of the School of Spiritual Science. It is also the background of the research, teaching, and training activities of the General Anthroposophical Section \" (https : //www.goetheanum.org/en/school -of-spiritual -science, March 8, 2018). | 205 According to subtitle of Steiner sen (1977), their motive for founding anthroposophic medicine consisted in the desire to extend the art of healing through spiritual knowledge (\"Erwe i- terung der Heilkunst nach geisteswissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen\" ). conventional medicine with anthroposophy and thus with alter- native religious beliefs and practices was intended from the outset. From the perspective of the Study of Religion, anthroposophy can be cat- egorized as a form of alternative religiosity , that is, as a contemporary reli- gious phenomenon that in some ways represents an alternative to ma instream religions. The attribution of these forms of religion as alternatives point s to the fact that alternative religions draw on sources that do not form part of the dominant canons of religious belief and practice (Knoblauch 2009: 104). Moreover, by referring to religiosity, the emphasis lies on indiv idual rather than institutional forms of religion (cp. Luckmann 2005). In recent decades, alternative religious beliefs and practices have been widely diff used through- out society, with medicine and CAM leading the way (cp. L\u00fcddeckens/Wal- thert 2010a, 2010b). Hence, the attribution of these forms of religion as \"al- ternative\" is increasingly losing its legitimacy. However, in contrast to other terms, it still has important advantages: unlike the terms a form of religiosity's current position in the religious field. The narrative of re-integrating \"spiritual science,\" and therefore from an etic point of view (alternative) religion, into medicine is only pla usible when the respective fields have already been subjected to processes of differentia - tion, as is true of conventional medicine and of caring for the t erminally ill.11 The continuing differentiation between religious and medical actors w as strongly criticized (Kellehear 2007: 157), and, as a result, the conve ntional medical paradigm of palliative care developed as a counter-balanc e to the medicalization of dying and death (Walter 1994: 12-13). From its ver y be- ginning, (conventional) palliative care was not only informed by conven- tional medical care, it also included religion and spirituality (\" spiritual care\") in its treatment of the terminally ill and dying. This multidisc iplinary ap- proach to palliative care is often traced to Cicely Saunders and the hospice \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11 L\u00fcddeckens (this volume) examines the interrelatedne ss of CAM with religion and medicine using the concept of de -differentiation. Anthroposophical End-Of-Life 2012). In one of her lectures at Yale University in 1963, Saunders suggested introducing palliative care as a form of holistic care that involves the treatment of \"physical , spiritual, and psychological discomfort\" alike (Lutz 2011: 305).12 By not simply delegat- ing religious and/or spiritual care to actors within the establi shed churches, concepts of palliative care hold everyone liable for caring for pat ients' r eli- gious and/or spiritual needs and they quite often make room for alt ernative religious practices and rationalizations. 2 THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL MEDICAL SETTING There is a broad range of academic publications about contemporary anthro- posophic medicine from an insider's perspective. For example, K ienle et al. (2013) provide a general overview of anthroposophic medicine. In addition, there are more general publications by anthroposophical physicians, nurses , and as well as research articl es on different methods of anthroposophic medicine (e.g., on the effectiveness of mistletoe therapy with cancer patients).13 Heusser et al. (2006a, 2006b), von Dach (2001), and von Dach et al. (2009) focus specifically on end-of- life care. For accounts of the history of anthroposophic medicine, its origins and sources from an anthroposophical perspective, in particular the public ations of the Ita Wegman Institute and of Peter Selg (2000a; 2000b), the he ad of the Ita Wegman Institu te (http://www.wegmaninstitut.ch/, July 4, 2018) should be consulted.14 There are only a few academic accounts from an outsider's \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12 One o utcome of this conceptualization is the official definition of t he World Health Organization : \"Palliative care is an approach that improves the qua lity of life of patients and their families facing the problem associ ated with life -threat- ening illness, thro ugh the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pa in and other prob- lems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual \".(www.who .int/cancer/palliative/ definition/en , July 4, 2018) 13 A list of other English publications is to be found on the webpage of the medical section of the Goetheanum : www.medsektion -goetheanum.org/en/home/books. 14 Cp. Gl\u00f6ckler et al. 2011. | 207 perspective. Apart from book chapters on the history of contemporary research on anthroposophic medicine from an etic point of view, although there are a few exceptions (Arman et al. 2008; Karschuck 2018 ; Ritchie 2001; Zeugin/Walthert 2016). To our knowledge, apart from Arman et al. (2008), who conducted qualitative interviews in a Swedish clinic, no qualita tive study from a social scientific or Study of Religion perspective has ever been conducted in an anthroposophical hospital.15 Anthroposophic medicine16 was founded by the physician Ita Wegman (1876-1943) and Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925).17 Even though Steiner had al- ready shown an interest in medical subjects in the first decades of the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15 Ritchie (2001) provides a qualitative study of the National Centre for Social Re- search, an independent social research institution. Th e study was funded by the Anthroposophic Medical Trust and printed by Weleda. In this study, which adopts an etic perspective, the aut hors investigate six practices and one residential unit in GB that offer anthroposophic al treatment in addition to general practice. By means of interviews with patients and medical staff, as well as an analysis of medical records, the authors address the questions of how anthroposophic al treat- ment is perceived by medical staff working in general practice, how it is organized and delivered, and what impact it has on patients in terms of patient responses and clinical effects ( ibid: 4). 16 The following para graphs are based on emic sources, exemplary monographs that fall entirely within the contemporary field of anthroposophic medicine ( cp. Gl\u00f6ckler et al. 2011; Girke 2012), and the website of the medical section at the School of Spiritual Science, Goetheanum , in Dornach, Switzerland (www.medsektion -goetheanum.org/home/anthroposophische -medizin , July 4, 2018 ). Even though the field of anthroposophic medicine i s indeed heterogen e- ous, these self -portraits should be considered accurate, despite the diffe rence in actors. For an overview of the contemporary practice of anthropo sophic medicine, see \"Facts and Figures on Ant hroposophic Medicine Worldwide\", www.ivaa.info/fileadmin/editor/file/Facts_and_Figures _AM_WorldwideJuly 2012_Final_Public_Light. pdf, May 8, 2018. 17 On other influential actors in the development of an throposophic medicine, cp. Zander 2007 : 1542 Monika Schrimpf twentieth century, the founding date is often located in the early 1920s, a decade that witnessed three events that had a lasting impact on a nthropo- sophic medicine. First, Wegman and Steiner held medical courses for medi- cal practitioners in Dornach, Switzerland (the centre of anthroposop hy).18 Secondly, Wegman founded the first anthroposophic hospital in Arlesheim , Switzerland, where medical research has been conducted ever sin ce. Thirdly, in 1925, Wegman published the first monograph on anthroposophic medi- cine, written by herself and Steiner (Steiner/Wegman 1977).19 As mentioned above, Steiner and Wegman did not view anthroposophic medicine as being opposed to conventional medicine; rather, they conceptu- alized it as being in accordance with academic medical scie nce and thus as an extension of conventional medicine, which anthroposophy comple- mented. Therefore, anthroposophic medicine is combined with conventional medical practices, each with their own rationalizations. This i s why many anthroposophical medical actors favor the paradigmatic term oth- ers created new anthroposophical medical practices (e.g., rhythmic massage), they also adapted existing such practices to the medical setti ng (e.g., eu- rythmy therapy).20 Since its beginnings, anthroposophic medicine has cared for the terminally ill, but it was not until recently that the c onception of an- throposophical end-of-life care has emerged and received express ion (cp. Girke 2012: 1051-1083; www.sterben.ch). Within anthroposophic medicine, human beings are viewed as multi-lay- ered. In his early works, Steiner mainly referred to an anthropology that con- sisted of seven bodies (2010: 19-36) and that goes back to theosophy. In the 1920s he started to elaborate an anthropology featuring four bodies (Zander 2007: 1495-1497). In this view, the human being consists of a fourfold body, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 18 https ://www.goetheanum.org/en/, July 4, 2018. 19 This publication has now been translated online as \"Fundamentals of Therapy : An Extension of the Art of Heal ing through Spiritual Knowledge \" (cp. http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA027/E nglish/RSP1983/GA027_index.html, July 4, 2018) . 20 Even though all these proprietary anthroposophic med ical practices were more or less informed by anthroposophy, anthroposophy is not their only source. Some researchers, for example, have examined the connection between anthroposop hic medicine and homeopathy ( J\u00fctte 1996 : 237-261; Zander 2007 : 1514 -1522). | 209 the physical body (shape, anatomy, organs, and all the other material as- pects), the etheric body (the source of life and growth that endows us with thinking skills), the astral body (the carrier of consciousness a nd feelings), and the I-organization or higher self. The fourth body constitutes the individ- uality of the person or his or her spirit, which ultimately transcen ds life (Stei- ner/Wegman 1977: 7-19). This conception of the human being is linked to a specific conception of the afterlife, as the I-organization or hi gher self will not only outlast death, it will be reincarnated (Steiner 2010: 37-59). Steiner's notion of the four bodies is closely related to the concept of the threefold nature of the human organism that distinguishes the nerve- sense system, the metabolic-limb system, and the rhythmic system. An anthropo- sophical medical article advocating the need for \"rhythm studies\" (Hilde- brandt 1997) illustrates the close link between the models of t he threefold nature and the fourfold (or sevenfold) body, as well as their foundation i n religious concepts. In Steiner's own words: \"The rhythmic element in the four bodies [a spects of the human being] was implanted in man over long, long periods.... And we would recogn ize the rhythm of our human aspects in the movements of the heavenly bodies, which make a co mplete system.\" (20 July 1923, Dornach) \"One day man will also apply his own rhythm to the world, when he has reached the divine level.\" (21 Dec. 1908, Berlin)21 3 PRACTICE THEORY: MET HODOLOGY, METHODS, AND DATA 3.1 A Practice -Theoretical Approach According to a practice-theoretical approach, the social is only acc essible when it is carried out in action. This is in line with Theodore R. Schatzki's definition of social practices as a \"temporally unfolding and spatia lly \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 21 The second quotation by Rudolf Steiner appears in hi s lecture \"\u00dcber Schrimpf dispersed nexus of doings and sayings. [...] To say that the doings and say- ings forming a practice constitute a nexus is to say that they are linked in certain ways\" (1996: 89). Thus, social practices are constituted by the per- formance of doings and sayings and the existence of a coherent system of knowledge about the links between these doings and sayings. Accordingly, they can be heuristically distinguished in terms of a) their use of language and b) their knowledge structures: a) Social practices that exhibit a high use of language might be labeled discursive practices in so far as they \"[...] embrace different f orms in which the world is meaningfully constructed in language or in other sign- systems\" (Reckwitz 2002: 254). Social practices do not necessarily have to invol ve language or other sign systems and might thus be labeled body practices, or non-discursive practices. However, a closer look at social realit y reveals that social practices are only rarely either solely discursive or non-di scursive. Ra- ther, they exhibit a greater or lesser orientation towards language or the body, being either more communication/language- (and less body-) oriented or more body- (and less communication/language-) oriented. b) Social practices often build on the ability of actors to rationalize their actions reflexively. What Giddens calls the rationalization of action mean s that \"actors\u2014also routinely and for the most part without fuss\u2014maintain a continuing 'theoretical understanding' of the grounds of their activity\" (1984: 5). This form of knowledge is the most common one, yet it is ofte n not \"directly accessible to the consciousness of actors\" (Giddens 1984: 4). Although, as social scientists, we examine this knowledge either through ob- servation or by explicitly enquiring about it, the implicit motivati on of action is not discursively accessible (Giddens 1984: 6, but constitutes the \"implicit sense of what someone actually wants\" (Reckwitz 2003: 293). 3.2 Data and Data Collection Adopting a practice-theoretical view of anthroposophic medicine has an im- pact on one's methodological approach: this qualitative study first looked at what is happening on the ground and then asked the actors to rationalize their | 211 doings and sayings discursively.22 Accordingly, this study combined the qualitative research methods of participant observation23 and qualitative in- terviews.24 Given that our main interest was in anthroposophic end-of- life care, the fieldwork focused on those hospital units that exhibited dyi ng and death as crucial features, namely an oncological ambulatory and an oncol ogy ward. Zeugin actively participated in the field by means of a nursing in ternship and the job-shadowing of physicians, nurses, and therapists alike. This pro- vided valuable insights into what happens behind closed doors (e.g., consul- tations between physicians and patients, appointments with therapi sts, an- throposophical medical treatments). Apart from participant observation, she blended in by experiencing certain anthroposophical medical practice s her- self, such as art therapy, rhythmic massage, poultices, and therape utic eu- rythmy.25 In addition, she conducted 25 interviews of an average duration of one hour with health professionals (nurses, physicians, therapists, social workers), pastors, and terminally ill and dying patients. Finally, she c ollected grey literature, online information, and internal documents. 3.3 An Anthroposophical Medical Hospital26 The anthroposophical hospital in which the fieldwork was conducted ope ned in the 1990s as a private clinic primarily providing anthroposophical me dical \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22 Even though, following Bourdieu (2005 : 18-19), this is legitimate, we have to pay attention to the fact that such rationalizations \u2014concepts, beliefs and values \u2014 and their verbal manifestations in discourses might not occur if it were not for us. 23 Apart from general guidelines about participant observation (cp. Spradley 1980; Emerson et al. 2001; Franke/ Maske 2011), Zeugin considered the term \"focused ethnography \" coined by Hubert Knoblauch (2001, 2002, 2005) to be an important reference point. 24 In order to enhance the comparability of all the inte rviews, Zeugin designed a qualitative interview technique that combines elements of narra tive interviews as conceived by Fritz Sch\u00fctze (1983) and elements of problem -centered interviews suggested by Andreas Witzel (1985, 2000). 25 For a similar approach , cp. Langford 2002. 26 The following description is primarily based on the hospital's discursive self -por- trayal in grey literature and on their website. Anthroposophical Monika Schrimpf treatment. In the late 1990s, the hospital was entered on the offi cial list of hospitals, and since then it has been authorized and required to conduct pri- mary health care, as well as emergency medical aid, like a ny other public health facility. Whereas its conventional medical treatment has a lways been covered by obligatory health insurance, formerly many anthroposophical medical treatments had to be financed by the patients themse lves or by sup- plementary insurance. Only very recently, and as a result of the of ficial recognition of anthroposophic medicine in 2009, has the hospital managed to introduce a lump-sum payment for anthroposophical treatments on a c ase- by-case basis.27 Since then, the costs of anthroposophical medical practices have been covered by basic health insurance, provided that they are pre- scribed by a physician and are carried out for a patient on this fina ncial basis. A support association funded by donations and guided by members of the Anthroposophical Society bears some of the additional expenses asso ciated with the hospital's orientation towards anthroposophic medicine from day one. For example, the support association pays for the employment of a n anthroposophical nursing expert, who is responsible for training nurses in anthroposophical nursing, as they usually only have conventional trainin g. 4 ANTHROPOSOPHICAL END -OF-LIFE CARE As end-of-life care embraces more than just one's death bed, it is conducte d at various stages of both conventional (Jonen-Thielemann 2012: 989-997 ) and anthroposophical end-of- life care. Corresponding to the anthroposophi- cal concept of the end of life and to practice in the respecti ve hospital, the following stages also cover the time after the death of the respective patie nt. The following description presents data from Zeugin's fieldwork in 2015. 4.1 Late Stag e At this time, most terminally ill patients are not permanently hospitalized, but are given outpatient treatment. Most conventional and anthroposophical curative treatments are reduced, and the provision of anthroposophical \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 27 Cp. http://apps.swissdrg.org/manual40/drgs/54771e6ce4b0887aa13fd25c?locale =de, June 4, 2018. | 213 medical treatment shifts away from oncological practices to rel ieving anthro- posophical medical, nursing, and therapeutic practices. Some of the body-oriented practices stay the same throughout all stages, but others are reduced,28 and some vary over time and are attributed with different meanings, such as body wash care. No matter whether body-or i- ented practices lost importance or were continued, all options were usually rationalized by referring to anthroposophical concepts. In reducing body-oriented practices, the argument was mostly based on the belief that too much touching prevents patients from \"letting go\" and ac- cordingly from dying. This is expressed in the following quote from a rhyth- mic massage therapist: \"I've often experienced that patients who always loved rhythmic massage and who wanted to have it every day got to the point where ev ery single touch was too much. And they say: No, I don't want that anymore. And mostly , this happens right before they really cross the threshold. Maybe because everything that is forced on the p hys- ical body from the outside reconnects them to it. That there i s this feeling of letting go of their physical body.\" ( Heike, rhythmic massage therapist, 8 June 2015)29 The remaining body-oriented practices were often explicitly rationalized us- ing anthroposophical concepts, again with the importance of \"letting go\". The conception of letting go is found in Girke (2012: 1053), one of the very few accounts of end-of-life care written from an anthroposophical point of view. In this work, \"letting go\" is strongly linked to an alternative religious conception of the human being, as Girke refers to the fourfold articul ation of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 28 According to the observations of L\u00fcddeckens during h er fieldwork in a conven- tional medical palliative care unit, the reduction in body -oriented practices is not specific to the anthroposophic al setting : in conventional palliative care wards body -oriented p ractices, such as hygienic measures, also lose importance. 29 Original wording : \"Ich hab noch oft erlebt, NEIN, will nicht Monika Schrimpf the body by using it as an explanation for what is happening throughout the process of dying. For example: \"In death, the I, the astral and the etheric body detach from t he physical organization. [...] A [...] manner of crossing a threshold between life and deat h concerns the con- sciousness and hence the nerve -sense system. Patients grow increasingly tired, which is associated with the separati on of the fourfold body throughout the dying process.\" 2012: 1054, 1058)30 of the patients' phys i- cal body at the time of death, then of their etheric body during the following 72 hours, and finally after this time of their astral body, was al so found in the hospital in this case study: \"In anthroposophy, there is the crossing of a threshold and afterwards the (transcend- ent) bodies let go of each other. [...] And after three days all that remai ns is the [...] corpse, right? And all the other bodies step by step let g o of this physicality.\" (Lothar, physician, 30 April 2015)31 One example of this rationalization of a body-oriented practice is the convic- tion that certain directed ways of touching support patients in \"letting go:\" We often perform the so -called pentagram embrocation. They really address the hu- man being as a whole, in his or her individuality. A nd they strongly lead the person \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 30 Original wording : \"Im Tod verlassen das Ich, der astralische und der \u00c4the Organisation. Sterbeprozess zusammenh\u00e4ngt \" (Girke 2012 : heraus. \" | 215 back to his or her real self, so as to facilitate the l etting go when it comes to dying. (Heike, rhythmic massage therapist, 8 June 2015)32 While in this case, the embrocations are conceptualized as re assuring the wholeness and individuality of the patient as a precondition for \"letting go\", the next example instead emphasizes the calming effects of ce rtain practices: \"Someone who has difficulties in letting go needs to get his underarms washed quite coldly. [...] I t calms and supports letting go.\" (Manuela, nurse, 22 May 2015)33 In this view, the process of \"letting go\" is facilitated by nurses acting cal mly and silently, and deliberately touching, thus performing body care in a certain way. From an anthroposophical perspective, one aspect of the person will transcend death. This aspect is referred to most often as the s oul, the spiritual dimension, or the I, as anthroposophists would say, and just as frequently it is linked to the idea of reincarnation. The notion of \"letting go\" is also found in conventional medical palliative care contexts as one of its o wn core se- mantics. However, here it is merely a matter of the patient's need to let go of life: \"As death nears, many people feel a lessening of their desire to live longer.\"34 In the anthroposophical context, in contrast, \"letting go\" is clearly linked to conceptions of human beings and the afterlife. At this stage, discursive practices that actively involve the pa tients are reduced, whereas discursive practices among the health professionals t hem- selves increase slightly, rationalizing the body-oriented practices, as w e will see in the following examples. An important discursive practice is the nurs- ing case discussions, which are held weekly, last thirty minutes, a nd occur \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 f\u00e4llt. \" 33 All interview quotations and observation logs are tra nslated by Barbara Zeugin. Original wording : \"\u00d6pper, wo M\u00fceh Schrimpf under premise that internal and oncology nurses are physically copre sent. Additionally, the performance of this social practice builds on formal guide- lines aimed primarily at the rationalization of action by producing a theoret- ical description of the fourfold articulation of the body. At the same time, these guidelines offer instructions for action by referring to t he nurses' expe- riences of work and providing a list with features of each element of the four- fold body that guides them in their observations and their treatme nt of the patients. In preparation for the discussion of each case, one of the nurses is asked to fill in a table with her observations. The performanc e of the nursing case discussion is the anthroposophical nursing expert's responsibilit y, whereas the presenting nurse varies each time. In Zeugin's observations, the discussion unfolds as follows. While all the nurses sit in the nurses' station, one nurse describes a patient who is being somewhat \"problematic \" by using a guideline table of the fourfold bodies as a template for her presentation. In this table, the four bodies are adapted to the medical setting: the physical body is linked to visible, easily determinable aspects such as age, gender, and symptoms; the etheric body carries information about respiration, body heat, nutrition, and expulsion, as well as creativity, habits, and everyday rhythms; the astral body is to be found in the patient's experience and communication of pain and mood, as well as thinking, feeling, and wanting; and the las t body, the ego or \"I\" of the human being, is exemplified as a patient's profession, all sorts of biographical information, and indications of self-awareness, e.g., regarding the finiteness of his or her being. After this presentation, the other nurses add their own observations. Finally, possible nursing interventi ons are discussed by making use of a conception of anthroposophical nursing called the \"twelve gestures of care\" in nursing.35 The twelve gestures, such as H\u00fcllen/or \"grounding\" and Harmonisieren or \"harmonizing,\" are different objectives that can be achieved by several different nursing practices. In the case of a female who refused to eat in accordance with the results of her measuring each food item with a pendulum, the interventions included the following: sending in the (anthroposophist) nutritionist to discuss a ba lanced diet; the affection and love of nurses spending time with her; and a footbath \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 35 This conception was developed by Rolf Heine on the b asis of Stein er's belief in the twelve www.vfap.de/anthroposophische -pflege last sense, the \"Ich -Sinn,\" is based on the ego of the fourfold body conc ept; cp. von Dach 2008. | 217 in water containing rosemary in order to \"ground her\" because she seems too \"spiritually minded\": \"She is so spiritually minded. [...] She asp ires to over- come her trauma so as to not have to go through it again in her next incarna- tion\" (Nadja, nurse, 18 May 2015).36 Another discursive practice is the inter-professional biographical work37 case discussion. Biographical work constitutes a crucial part o f anthropo- sophic medicine, as of end-of-life care. According to the biographical coun- sellor, she first conducts a conversation with a patient to learn about his or her life story. This conversation follows the pattern of seven-year cycles as- cribed to Rudolf Steiner. This pattern is again used throughout the biogra ph- ical work-case discussion, as in the case of a 55- year-old woman with leu- kaemia. In this case, biographical work discussions brought together the at- tending physician, the key nurse, a physiotherapist, and a social worker, as well as representatives of all anthroposophical therapies. To begin with, they shared their initial impressions of the patient's current sta te. The physician said that she had recently delivered some computer tomography results and that the patient didn't behave normally: \"She hugged me. I don't like that, but I didn't say anything. I think she is really longing for closeness\" (Elisa- beth, physician, 22 April 2015). The nurse adds that the patient seems ve ry sensitive: \"She reacted strongly to physical contact when I appli ed a rhyth- mic embrocation; it really exposed her emotions so strongly that I had to give her some tranquilizer\" (Nora, nurse, 22 April 2015). Afterwards, the bio- graphical counsellor retold the woman's life story in accordance wi th the pattern of seven-year cycles. Finally, the health professionals discussed what they had been listening to and concluded that the patient clearly lacked a basic sense of trust in her first seven years and that she had always cared more for others than for herself. From this the physician deduced the follow- ing need for action: \"Anthroposophically speaking, her higher self needs shelter, warmth and protection. [...] I'd recommend some nice warm poul - tices\" (Elisabeth, physician, 22 April 2015). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 36 Original wording : \"Sie ist so strebt an, ihr Trauma zu bew\u00e4l- 37 \"Biographical work \" is an anthroposophic al extension of conventional psychol- ogy complemented by the anthroposophic al theory of reincarnation and anthro- posophic al anthropology ; cp. Ritchie 2001 : 78ff.; Schrimpf In examples, body-practices the patient, such as a footba th and poultices, are the consequence of a discursive practice among he alth- care professionals.38 4.2 Final Stage On the physical plane, the body starts shutting down and curative medical treatments become completely irrelevant. Even though the physici ans are still engaged in both conventional and anthroposophical medical care, the y withdraw from the sickbed, leaving nurses to be more present. Once a cure is definitely no longer an option and discursive abilities decline, body-or i- ented practices gain more and more momentum , such as rhythmic massage. According to Margarethe Hauschka (1978), who was an assistant to Wegman, the founder of rhythmic massage, this form of massage combin es Swedish massage techniques with anthroposophical spiritual scien ce. An- throposophical anthropology and the conception of the threefold nature of the human organism (nerve-sense system, metabolic-limb system, rhythm ic system) are the main official rationalizations of this form alized set of prac- tices (cp. Hauschka 1978: 92-100; see also above). Rhythmic massage, as its name suggests, is primarily aimed at the rhythmic system. Whereas different practices of rhythmic massage are performed a t sev- eral stages, the so-called embrocation is of great significance when it comes to patients who are very close to death.39 In her fieldwork, Zeugin found that the pentagram embrocation is embedded in a wider scope of action. The fol- lowing account is based on her own experience of a rhythmic massage ther- apist carrying out pentagram embrocation on her for illustrative purposes. While sitting on the massage table, the therapist explained that pentagram embrocation requires a subsequent rest of about twenty minutes to prod uce its effect fully. She further explained that this effect consist s in bringing all parts of the body back together and making the patient \"whole\" again. T he massage therapist fetched a piece of paper and, while drawing a pentagr am, she continued her explanation as follows. The embrocation stems fr om \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 38 In the second case , however, the discussion among the healthcare professionals was preceded by a biographical con versation with the patient. 39 Cp. v on Dach (2001) Pflege an der Grenze Seins, pp. 36 f.; also Layer 2006 : 110-116. | 219 Leonardo, but thanks to anthroposophy this picture was assigned to the etheric body, where the energy flow is positioned. As rhythmic massage op- erates at this level, blocked energy can be set free by indica ting five essential points. According to what she had said in a previous interview, she ai ms to bring all the bodies together by pointing to these five positions on the physi- cal body in the correct sequence. After the treatment, she started a conversa- tion that led from the illnesses of the etheric body to the Tibetan Book of the Dead . With regard to this therapeutic practice, a conventional medical rationa l- ization of action is missing altogether: there is no reference to the relief of pain or any other distressing symptom, as required by the definition of palli- ative care, but it is primarily aimed at the patient letting go of he r body and life in order to prepare for the afterlife.40 The link to the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\", a book that is widely popular for its content about support for th e souls in the process of dying and their transition to the afterl ife, even strengthened this aim. This rationalization of action, i.e. letting go of the body and preparati on for an afterlife, is part of the discursive knowledge of all he alth professionals in the hospital of Zeugin's fieldwork.41 It comes into effect in the communi- cation with the particular patient, provided that the latter ca n still be ad- dressed and is conscious. Otherwise this body-oriented practice can be per- formed without any use of language. 4.3 Terminal Stage Due to the increasing loss of agency that develops in the ter minal stage, an- throposophical physicians and therapists noticeably back away from t he death bed, leaving it mainly to the nurses to provide all sorts of primary and end-of- life care. Nurses now become more autonomous and independent \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 40 See the \"Therapeutic Rational \" of massages with regard to the findings in the study of Ritchie: \" Through achieving balance in physic al functions, the therapist is able to influence and connect with the other higher levels to promote greater balance and connection between them. Massage mainly works through t he phys- ical and etheric (or life forces) level which can then stren gthen the s oul (emo- tional) and spiritual levels (ego organisation) \" (2001: 72). 41 For the Lucas Clinik in Arlesheim (CH), cp. von Dach 2001 : 36 Schrimpf Often, they perform self- directed \"little somethings\", as one of the nurses explained: \"For me, the anthroposophical aspects just go wit h caring for the terminally ill. [...] Not pampering them, but to giv e them a little treat \u2014in another way.\" (Larissa, nurse, 26 March 2015)42 A prevalent and thus almost institutionalized instance of little somethings is the social practice of installing a rose-quartz lamp in pati ents' rooms. The lamps are not installed until the patient's death is foreseeable, yet from the n onward they are lit permanently. While some nurses simply highlight the practice's aesthetic value, others argue that it supports t he patient in letting go by providing a nice, warm, quiet ambience. Furthermore, nurses increasingly relocate their doings and sayings to- wards a set of practices that are often referred to as \"bein g with\" when the dying process progresses.43 Practices of \"being with\" are carried out so as to still be doing something, even though medically nothing can be done any- more. \"Being with\" comprises a multitude of practices, such as sitting at the patient's bedside, decorating his or her room, singing a song, narrating a story, holding the dying person's hand, and so on. Even family members are instructed just \"to be with\" their dying relatives in order\u2014 at least this is how the saying goes\u2014to facilitate the process of letting go and thus promote dy- ing. Hence, \"being with\" is strongly linked to conceptions of a good death , the human being, and the afterlife in the form of the metaphor of letting go. During the terminal stage, practices and their rationalizatio ns are even more detached: the latter are not discursively communicated in contact with the patients, but only in interprofessional conversations or in exchanges with the researcher. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 42 Original wording : \"Und /Walthert 2016. | 221 4.4 After Death Once a patient has died, there is still work for the physicians and nurses to do until the state funeral office takes over. After a physician ha s issued a death certificate, the nurses are in charge of most post-mort em care practices, that is, going through the formalities, dealing with family membe rs, and burning incense in the patient's room. It is common practice to le t the de- ceased patients rest for some hours before preparing them for the laying out. Usually one nurse prepares the deceased without the bereaved being present and performs individual actions like closing the deceased's eye s and washing and clothing him or her quietly without moving the body unnecessarily. The latter aspect accords with two differing rationalizations of action, one saying that things are done like this out of sheer respect, the other th at the souls need to let go of their bodies and thus need quiet.44 The deceased are laid out in the in-house mortuary for three days. T his temporal determination is in line with Rudolf Steiner's conception of a pan- orama of the past life that follows death and lasts around two to three days. Whereas the physical body leaves the person at the time of death, the etheri c body splits off during this subsequent period (Steiner 2001: 140). \"There is a period of rest, and in it, the bodies [...] let go of their physicality. I believe we overestimate ourselves if we beli eve we have a great impact on this process of letting go. It is connected, is connected to the person's bio graphy, right? [...] Well, I believe there is this frame, and we do not strictly lay out the deceased's body for three days, but if possible.\" ( Lothar, physician, 30 April 2015)45 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 44 Both kinds of rationalizations can be found in conve ntional palliative care con- texts as well. However, in most cases , the deceased are prepared for their \"depa r- ture\" within short time of their death and incense is only burnt if a staff member chooses to do so as an individual . 45 Original wording : \"Es gibt Monika Schrimpf As these words from a physician in a leading position indicate, l aying out the deceased for three days is rationalized by means of the notion of letting go of the various bodies, i.e. as an anthroposophical practice. However, wher eas he considers this action as supporting the process of letting go, t o him it is not necessarily a precondition.46 This stance is in line with actual practice in the hospital, which is also influenced by economic and other practic al con- siderations resulting from its designation as a public hospital: whereas laying out the body for three days is the usual practice, the duration may be reduced, or it may not take place at all when there are more deceased than rooms for laying out, or when the deceased or his relatives do not approve of it . How- ever, if possible the practice is performed in its original form. In addition, all health professionals are invited to participate i n a collec- tive farewell ritual that is primarily targeted at the health professionals them- selves, though the deceased's family is invited too. The decea sed is laid out in the middle of the small room, specifically reserved for thi s purpose. The room is decorated with candles and flowers, and the attendees surround t he coffin. The actual farewell ritual starts with a gong being sounded, and two tunes are chosen and performed by the health professionals.47 After the sing- ing, the physician provides the deceased's biography, focusing on the de- scription and interpretation of his or her dying process and the health profes- sionals' share in it. Depending on the physician's personal assessment of the religiousness of the deceased, he may say the Lord's Prayer. The endi ng of the ceremony is again marked by the same songs. This stage, where the med- ical staff are still involved, is marked by religious ritualistic practices and other discursive practices, all of them in line with anthroposophica l rational- izations. During the successive stages of anthroposophical end-of-life care, from the late stage till the terminal stage, body-oriented practices in relation to discursive practices in contact with the patient gain momentum. H owever, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 46 He pointed out that the separation of the four bodie s also takes place when people die a painful death and cannot be laid out, for example , when they are buried alive in an earthquake. 47 The first canon, \"Dona Nobis Pacem \" (\"Give us peace \"), originates from the last words of the Roman Catholic mass of Agnus Dei; the sec ond tune, \"Harmonie der Sterne \" (\"Harmony of the stars \"), by the German songwriter Werner Gneist, ex- plicitly concerns God, cre ation , and the meaning of life. | 223 death seems to be the turning point, where body-oriented practices with re- gard to the deceased patient are reduced decisively, while discur sive prac- tices with anthroposophical rationalizations among the healthcare profes- sionals become central. At this stage, the difference betwee n anthroposophic care as including care for the deceased and conventional medical care which ends when the patient has passed away is most obvious. 5 R ELIGIOUS RATIONALIZA TION IN END -OF-LIFE CARE As the description above indicates, it is a distinctive feature of anthropo- sophic medicine that it provides religious rationalizations that e nable healthcare professionals to maintain their agency even if medica l rationali- zations do not support further actions. In conventional palliative care, less and less action is carri ed out over the course of the dying process.48 This is due to the fact that many conventional medical practices are no longer of effect and communication becomes more difficult, with patients losing their communication skills or thei r conscious- ness. However, in the case of the anthroposophical medical care in our ca se study, health professionals continue providing care by focusing their acti on on more body-oriented practices, as we have seen above. While some more communication-oriented medical practices, such as psychotherapeutic interventions (\"biographical work\"), end completely, oth- ers vary over time and become more body-oriented: eurythmy therapy,49 for example, becomes more passive and has fewer communicative ins tructions as death approaches, as patients are not required to engage in physical acti v- ities by themselves anymore; rather, the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 48 Cp. Zeugin/ Walthert (2016) for an account of the relocation of action against the backdrop of hospice end -of-life care. 49 Eurythmy is an anthroposophic al expressive art and movement therapy. \"The therapeutic rationale \" of eurythmy therapy appears in the findings of Ritchie as follows: \" As with all treatments, the overall therapeutic ratio nale and subsequent processes are very much dependent on the individual patient and rela te to a key principle of developing the potenti al of the person \" (2001: 76). Anthroposophical Monika Schrimpf physical activities for them either by moving the patient's body parts or by taking over the exercise completely and performing it herself. By means of such non-discursive practices, the health professionals r e- claim agency, which seems to decline increasingly in the face of death. Even when it appears that nothing can be done anymore because the patient is go- ing to die anyway, this allows health professionals to still do som ething for their patients and not just stand by idly. A typical rationalization of eurhythmy therapy is as follows: \"U ncon- sciously experienced states of restlessness decrease and give way to a peace- ful state of mind. All these are important means in order t o commit oneself to the next steps and the new spiritual space connected to death. \"50 Emphasis on these body-oriented practices is backed up by way of ra- tionalization based on an anthroposophical understanding of the dying pro- cess. With regard to the various activities in the different s tages mentioned above, the healthcare professionals often refer to explanations p ertaining to anthroposophical concepts such as the pattern of the seven-year cycl es, the fourfold body, and the departure and reincarnation of the soul. In these explanations, particular emphasis is placed on the notion of \"let- ting go\": Throughout the dying process, people have to let go not only of their lives, but of their bodies too. This notion is used to rationalize the body care, rhythmic massage, the \"little somethings\" such as the r ose quartz lamp, and even the effort to avoid moving the body immediately after death. Thi s kind of religious rationalization enables health professionals to contin ue providing care without focusing their actions on healing and without r estrict- ing their focus on the physical existence of their patients. Ins tead, the idea of easing the separation of the bodies and the soul's transition into the afterli fe gains importance. As already noted, this relates to a specifi c conception of human beings and the afterlife, as well as showing that the heal th profession- als in the anthroposophical hospital feel accountable for this kind of religious or spiritual care. It is this rationalization of action that dist inguishes the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 50 http://www.sterben. ch/Heileurythmie.81.0.html, Tod verbunden ist.\" | 225 practice of anthroposophical end-of-life care from conventional medical s et- tings, where end-of-life care might also feature a transiti on from communi- cative to more bodily-oriented practices, yet without this very speci fic an- throposophical rationalization. Therefore, in this setting, where religion a nd medicine intersect, reference to the religious dimension provides a funda- mental basis for how therapeutic practices are rationalized. These examples illustrate the ways in which actors in anthroposophic end-of- life care, unlike those in conventional medicine, act according to the rules not only of the medical field but also of the alternative religious field of anthroposophy, showing how they gain agency by means of this double orientation. The body-oriented practices, like the poultices and the footbath i n the examples given above, are in most cases conducted because of instr uctions from the interprofessional nursing case and biographical work discus sions. In most cases, the nurses did not rationalize these practic es with anthropo- sophical concepts in contact with the patients. The first patient will probably never know that she was given a footbath so as to \"be grounded\" as a s up- portive measure with regard to her future reincarnation, any more than the second patient will know that the poultices will protect her \"higher self\". In the stages in which the discursive practices are reduced ther e is consequently less communication about religion. However, religion is practiced by means of footbaths, poultices, the ways of performing body care, and so on. 6 POWER STRU GGLES According to Bourdieu, fields are internally structured by actors' st ruggles for power.51 The valid set of rules of acting and of the distribution of power are the main bones of contention between leading actors who hold a monop- oly of power and novices or oppressed actors who are trying to gain pow er (Bourdieu 2014: 107). In the case of end-of- life care in our case study, the rules of both conventional and anthroposophic medicine are at stake. There are practices based on conventional medical dispositions and others based on \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 51 For a short but concise explanation of Bourdieu s con ceptualization of field, (sym- bolic) power , and forms of capital as manifest in habitus, material goods , and institutionalized forms , see Rageth struggles over t he valid- ity of different sets of rules occur. The actors involved embody a conven- tional medical habitus and an anthroposophical habitus to different degr ees. Moreover, they have different degrees of symbolic power with regar d to their anthroposophical expertise and institutional status. Thus, the question of how, under these specific circumstances, the r e- spective power struggles can be understood arises .52 Most of the actors' struggles over power have to do with the fact that the actors or ient themselves to the set of rules of more than one social field. While all act ors play by the main set of rules of anthroposophical end-of-life care, they relate different ly to conventional medicine and anthroposophy respectively. Even though in our case the anthroposophical medical treatment is provided by physic ians, nurses, and therapists alike, a nurse who mainly refers to the conventi onal medical set of rules is likely to perform fewer anthroposophica l medical prac- tices and to rationalize them in a less anthroposophical manne r than a nurse who relates more to anthroposophy, such as the anthroposophical nursin g expert. All nurses are trained in conventional medical nursing, yet, apart from the in-house training, they have hardly any education in anthroposophical nursing. Accordingly, they are most likely to relate to the set of rul es for conventional medicine in cases where the two fields are in conflict. In contrast to the nurses, the physicians all have a general in terest in CAM, and more than half of those who engage in end-of- life care have de- grees in anthroposophic medicine in addition to their conventional medical education. The nurses and physicians who have this kind of double trainin g occupy powerful positions within their own occupational groups, as well as throughout the hospital. For example, all attending physicians on the hospi tal management board are trained in anthroposophic medicine and are wel l- known practitioners of it. Therapists, finally, are greatly involved i n acting on anthroposophical principles, as they have all been trained by an anthro po- sophical institution and are also likely to relate to anthroposophy, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 52 As Bourdieu explains : \"The struggles which take place within the field are about the monopoly of the legitimate authority (specific authority) w hich is character- istic of the field in question, which means, ultimately, the conservation of the structure of the distribution of the specific capita l\" (1995 : 73). | 227 irrespective of their professional engagement in the medical setti ng.53 Physi- cians, therapists, and the anthroposophical nursing expert, socialized within the anthroposophical field, consequently tend to act in a respective habitus and prefer anthroposophical practices in cases of conflict. The continuing power struggle of the actors involved in the practice of anthroposophical end-of- life care may be illustrated by attempts made by the anthroposophical nursing expert to control the doings and sayings of nurses in caring for the terminally ill and dying. By means of the nursing cas e dis- cussions, the anthroposophical nursing expert tried to impose a colle ctive nursing habitus by directing it towards the anthroposophical set of rules. That she was allowed to do this reflects the fact that she was accorded greater power than the regular nurses. This further demonstrates that the hospital's management and the supporting foundation\u2014leading actors\u2014who have not assigned a conventional medical nurse to administer further training ar e up- holding the anthroposophical set of rules in doing so. However, the nursing expert's influence on the nurses remains li mited in so far as in most cases the nurses do not transfer the anthropos ophical dispo- sitions taught in the actual case discussions to other cases. Fur thermore, it must be noted that the practice of the nurses is informed by anthr oposophical dispositions only when they consider it not to be in conflict wi th conventional medical practice, despite the instructions of the anthroposophical nursing ex- pert. This way of acting is in line with Bourdieu, who argues that the inte n- tional communication and teaching of any habitus is exceptional and bound to fail (1997: 165-169). The reasons for this are twofold. First, the in corpo- ration of objective structures involves a lengthy process of implicit learning, which for most nurses took place in the realm of conventional nursing, not in anthroposophical care. Secondly, those forms of habitus are the mos t ef- fective that are not informed by intention. Due to their socializa tion within conventional nursing, the nurses implicitly acquired learning about certa in norms that led to certain dispositions with regard to practices. In contrast to this implicit learning, the intentional teaching of the nursing exper t is less influential in conflict situations, as the crucial example below will demon- strate. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 53 A last group of actors are the terminally ill and dy ing patients themselves. Due to the article's terms of reference, however, they will not be dealt with specifically here. Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care Schrimpf The practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives at the end of l ife poses a problem for anthroposophical end-of- life care. While many nurses openly argued in favor of this practice, anthroposophical physicians t ended to be reluctant to follow it, while the hospital management did no t participate in any explicit discourse on the matter. One important rationalization for the physicians' reluctance is the emphasis on the patient having a c lear mind so as to have an opportunity for transformation and inner growth and to be able to extract experience until the very end, which is gainful for the aft erlife.54 Therefore, as patients should be able to experience this tra nsitional period consciously, anthroposophical medical care tries to avoid the use of sedating painkillers: \"The aim is to pass away with the least required pa in medication and a mind as conscious as possible\" (Lothar, physician, 30 April 2015).55 In this context, it important to realize tha t the anthroposophical physicians shared the anthroposophical view that dying is not something to be prevente d at all costs and that death is not dreadful. On the contrary, the ti me of death appears as a significant and wonderful moment in an anthroposophical view (Steiner 1980: 327-328). Another rationalization articulated in the hospit al where Zeugin's fieldwork was conducted consisted in the conviction that th e \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 54 This rationalization , expressed by the physicians in our case study , is in accord- ance with anthroposophic medical theory. Cp. 2016 : 2012 : 1062 2008 : : The same physician explained further that many patie nts appreciated a state of painlessness: \"It is as if their pain is receding and their spiritual life gains free- dom\" (Lothar, physician, Geistesleben eigentlich freier\" to administer as few painkillers as poss ible is in accordance with von Dach 2001 : 34-37. Floriani (2016 ) refer s to (1996 ) here: \" According to the anthropo- sophic approach, humans are on a path of spiritual evo lution, wherein disease can play a central role in their terrestrial fates as part of a process of transformation and inner cures, with particular transformative power durin g the process of dying. In other words, disease is unde rstood as means of transformati on and spiritual development \" (ibid: 99-100). For anthroposophical concepts , cp. Girke 2010 ; 2012 : 426, 1052 -3. | 229 dying need fewer painkillers in order to ease their pain, as they are already letting go of their bodies during the dying process.56 Nurses, on the other hand, mostly preferred to administer pain-killer s and sedatives and used conventional medical rationalizations in doing s o, con- centrating on the physical needs and psychological conditions of their pa- tients. By emphasizing their greater presence at the dying patients ' sick-beds, they claimed to know their patients' wishes and needs, leading the m to argue for the benefits of the conventional medical treatment of administ ering pain- killers and sedativ es. The anthroposophical physicians were powerful actors within this an- throposophical hospital because they acquired more symbolic power than other health professionals: they were officially in charge of imple menting anthroposophy in the hospital, and they had both conventional and anthropo- sophical medical degrees and titles that equipped them with institut ionalized cultural capital (cp. Bourdieu 1986). The nurses, by contrast, had less ins ti- tutionalized capital and symbolic power than the physicians who administer and supervise their actions. From their positions of symbolic pow er, the latter tried to control the practice of anthroposophical end-of-life care by rational- izing it in an anthroposophical manner. However, although the nurses possess less symbolic power than the an- thoposophic al physicians, in many cases they prevailed. A close look at the actual practice indicates that although, at a rough guess, the admi nistration of pain-killers and sedatives is still less common in this a nthroposophical hospital than in conventional medical health facilities, it is still more com- mon than anthroposophic medical actors intend. Their symbolic power ulti- mately seems less than originally anticipated. Thus, when it comes to the practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives within the pr actice of an- throposophical end-of-life care, it is the anthroposophic al physicians in this case who are the \"oppressed actors,\" most probably because the y orient themselves towards the alternative religious field instead of the conventional medical (or economic) field. The reasons for this finding are threefold. First, the nurses tried to act in conflicting situations in accordance with their own habitus, whi ch was the conventional medical one. Secondly, they were closer to the patient s at the crucial time during the terminal stage once the physicians had m ore or less \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 56 Cp. Girke 2012 : Monika Schrimpf backed away from the death bed. Thirdly, the hospital management ult i- mately turns the scales, even when it does not adopt a position on this is sue discursively. Rather, as representatives of the hospital, its members are held responsible for its management and viability. In their doings and sa yings, moreover, conventional medical and economic rationalizations go hand i n hand: being governed by the public health sector's standards and the eco- nomic habitus according to which time is money, they quite inadvertently prefer the administration of pain-killers and sedatives because it is less time- consuming than any anthroposophical end-of-life care practice and also ac - cords with the prevailing rules and regulations. 7 CONCLUSION Anthroposophical end-of-life care belongs to both fields: from an emic per- spective anthroposophic medicine complements conventional medicine with spiritual knowledge, while from an etic perspective it pursues medical as well as spiritual and religious goals. This study, based on fieldwork in an anthro- posophical hospital, has provided three main insights about social prac tices in the intersection between the religious and the medical fields. First, in the course of anthroposophical end-of- life care, body-oriented practices that are rationalized by anthroposophical religious conc epts gain momentum in relation to discursive practices in contact with the patients. After death, discursive practices among healthcare professionals gain in im - portance, while body-oriented practices with regard to the deceased lose in importance. Secondly, by rationalizing their actions in a religious (anthroposophical) way amongst themselves, healthcare professionals not only explain their ac - tions, they also regain agency in the face of a terminal illne ss backed up by the institution. Body-oriented practices with anthroposophical ration aliza- tions therefore serve as a resource not only for patients but for staff members too, enabling the latter to support their patients even when, from a conven- tional medical point of view, nothing can be done anymore. From an anthro- posophical perspective, not only does the physical body have to be taken c are of but other non-empirical bodies also have to be taken into account. One of the main references in this regard is the notion that patients need to let go of their various bodies throughout the dying process and beyond death and are | 231 in need of support. Other rationalizations are the support of the souls' pr ep- aration for the afterlife by taking care of the transcendent bodi es and trans- cendent aspects of the dying patients. It is important to note that, in the later stages of end-of-life care, anthro- posophical rationalizations occur in inter-professional communication, or in communication with the researcher, and only rarely in communication wi th the patients. Nevertheless, even though religion might not be a topic of staff- patient conversations, it is still practiced in the form of m assages, baths, poul- tices, so-called \"little somethings,\" and further body-oriented practices . Thirdly, the examples in this study have shed light on the social context within which anthroposophical end-of-life care is carried out. The healthcare professionals are constantly contending with each other over the distr ibution of power and the appropriate set of rules to follow. Yet, anthroposophica l end-of- life care -providers are not only contending with each other over their respective social positions within a particular social fie ld, they are also strug- gling over the different fields of (conventional) medicine and (al ternative) religion. It is the anthroposophical foundation of anthroposophical end-of- life care that causes its actors to become involved in addition al work and expense, as they not only act in accordance with the conventional medi cal field, but also orient themselves towards anthroposophy's own set of rule s. Whereas this mostly occurs without problems, the need to play by t wo dif- ferent set of rules at the same time makes the practice of anthroposophical end-of-life care liable to conflict.57 As we have seen, those physicians and nurses who are also trained i n anthroposophic medicine generally have a higher social status. This does not mean, however, that they are more powerful in practice. As indicated by the practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives, the actions of nurses are determined rather by the habitus they have acquired in their conventiona l medical training than by the influence of the anthroposophically trai ned nurs- ing expert or physicians, notwithstanding her or their higher social position. Given that the hospital in question is an anthroposophical institution, one might have expected that in cases of conflict medical treatment w ould be in \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 57 This is all the more the case when i t comes to discursive practices, such as an open discussion about administr ating painkillers and sedatives, because dis- courses require greater explanation and thus more easily uncover conflicting is- sues and demands for autonomy. Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care Schrimpf anthroposophical that case, in the exampl e of pain- killers and sedatives at the end of life, the position of the anthroposophical physicians would prevail. This is especially the case since anthroposo phical physicians have more symbolic power than nurses because of their i nstitu- tional position and their anthroposophical expertise. However, Zeugin s fieldwork revealed that in many cases the nurses successfully negotiated with the physicians in charge in favor of giving pain-killers and sedatives . Hence, often the nurses position was implemented at the bedside. We argue that there are three explanations for this: a) Nurses are closer to the patients in terms of time, body care, and emo- tional contact during the last stages of life. This might be even more the case in anthroposophical end-of-life care because more body-oriented care pr ac- tices are performed in this period, as we have outlined above. b) Nurses tend to act according to their conventional medical habitus in cases of conflict between anthroposophical and conventional medical pr ac- tices and their respective rationalizations. c) The hospital's management, including the most influential physi cians, who are anthroposophically oriented, has to keep the financial conditions of the hospital in mind. However, the financial challenges are r ooted partly in the hospital's specialization in anthroposophic medicine, which goes a long with additional remedies and technical facilities, as well as the greater ex- penditure of time involved in care. Examples are the applying of a poultice or a rhythmic embrocation instead of administering pain-killers and sedatives at the end of life. Thus, the anthroposophical hospital in question stands between the de - mands of the public health sector, its patients' needs and demands, the care - givers' attendance, and the anthroposophical orientation of its support ing foundation. All these interests mingle when it comes to anthroposophica l end-of-life care, as they are apparently not located within the boundar ies of any one social field.

Mapping the Boundaries between Science an d Religion Psychology, Psychiatry, and Near-Death Experiences Stephanie Gripentrog ABSTRACT In contemporary rel igious landscapes, entanglements between the field o f religion and the field of psychology and psychiatry are manifold. In th is paper, the psychological school of \"Transpersonal Psychology\" (TP) and specifical ly the work trist and LSD researc her Stanislav Grof is introduced in order to illuminate the inter- ferences between psychological or therapeutic discourses and religious discourses. Of particular interest are psychological approaches to Near -Death Experiences (NDE) and the way in which the y become productive of religious imaginary. In this way, this paper will outline the boundaries between science and religion, or rather the fluidity of such boundaries, using the example of a specific discourse as ma nifested in schol- arly approaches to Near -Death Experiences in Transpersonal Psychology. 1 INTRODUCTION Of all the scientific disciplines that have dealt with the topic of near- death experiences (NDEs), psychology and psychiatry have played a special role. The first scientific studies of the topic in the twentieth cent ury were both 242 | Stephanie Gripentrog written by psychiatrists.1 At the same time, psychological explanations of Near -Death Experiences (NDE)2 form only one group of many, as yet frag- mentary attempts to explain them scientifically. The aim of this artic le is to examine the relationship of a very specific and contested psychological school\u2014\"Transpersonal Psychology \" (TP) \u2014to religion, as exemplified by its approach to NDEs. Given the proximity of NDE research to religion, as well as its dis semi- nation in society in general, the topic is a complex one. Anyone who wants to examine the approaches of psychology and psychiatry to NDEs from the perspective of the academic Study of Religion will therefore ha ve to limit the study to just a few aspects. Accordingly, this article is structured as follo ws. I begin with an examination of the concept of experience as a key ide a in the psychology of religion, which will be exemplified by a brief analysis of the work of William James in this area. The writings of this \"c lassical\" author are more than one hundred years old, but they are still one of the key refer- ence points for more recent branches of psychology that deal with NDEs. In addition, James's concept of religious experience can still be see n as ground- breaking in contemporary discussions of this topic. The subsequent section introduces the concept of Transpersonal Psych ol- ogy, which is considered marginal within academic psychology and has given rise to controversies regarding whether it even is a legiti mate part of it. Nonetheless, it is above all here where the issues of peak and border ex- periences in general and of NDEs in particular have been argued t o be ther- apeutically fruitful and have become the vehicle for a new form of dealing with death, which, for good reasons, can be called religious. Special a ttention will therefore be paid to the interference between psychological or therapeu- tic discourses and religious discourses, using the work of the psy chiatrist and LSD researcher Stanislav Grof as an example to illustrate this in deta il. The analysis will be completed by some reflections on the extent to which the phenomenon of NDEs can also be described as a new and very specif ic \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 Elisabeth K\u00fcbler -Ross and Raymond Moody were instrumental in shaping e arly research on NDE, as well as the term itself. 2 For contemporary psychiatric and psychological research, -92. For an example of an approach from medical anthropology , cp. Corazza 2008 . Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 243 form of contemporary religiosity, as well as on the role that TP and psycho- therapy play in this context. The treatment of the issue in this article is therefore twofold: on the one hand, the topic is presented from the perspective of the psychology of r eli- gion; on the other hand, discourses of TP about NDEs as a religious phenom- enon are analyzed from the perspective of the academic Study of Religion. 2 ON THE CONCEPT OF EX PERIENCE The concept of NDEs has constantly been questioned since the beginning of research on the topic. Reasons for this include the fact that a lot of people actuall y report features of an NDE without having been close to death at all (van Lommel 2001: 2039-2045). Thus, the term loses its differentia specifica in relation to other extraordinary experiences, most notably so-called out -of- body experiences, on which a lot of research is currently being c onducted and which are frequently, though not always, reported as part of an NDE (Blanke et al. 2016: 323-347). At the same time, recent neurological r esearch also shows that out-of-body experiences and NDEs \"may share importa nt functional and brain mechanisms, but clearly point towards distinct m echa- nisms as well\" (ibid: 333). Since Moody's study (1975), which listed fifteen different aspects (a lt- hough none of them had featured fully in any of the 150 cases he analyzed), various attempts have been made to develop a phenomenology of the most important characteristics of an NDE (Blanke et al. 2016: 331). Further prob- lems stand in the way of a definition, especially cultural and regiona l varia- tions in recorded experiences3 and the fact that they are only accessible through the medium of language or imagery. What is more important for the purposes of this paper is the obser vation that the notion of NDEs, whether clear or meaningful or not, serves as a fun- damental concept not only in scientific research, but also in the re spective social discourse and practices, regardless of any possible inconsiste ncies with regard to its meaning. Here, Mieke Bal's reflections on conc epts are helpful: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 For further literature see, for example , the study by Hubert Knoblauch (1999) comparing the NDEs of East and West Germans . 244 | Stephanie Gripentrog \"Mostly, they are considered abstract represe ntations of an object. But, like all repre- sentations, they are neither simple nor adequate in t hemselves. They distort, unfix, and inflect the object. [...] In fact, concepts are, or rather do, much more. If well thought through, they offer miniature theories, and in that g uise, help in the analysis of objects, situations, states, and other theories. [...] They t ravel \u2014between disciplines, between individual scholars, between historical periods, and be tween geographically dispersed academic communities. Betw een disciplines, their meaning, reach, and op- erational value differ.\" (Bal 2009: 11 -12) Thus, the concept of NDEs should be understood as one that moves betwe en different disciplines and that facilitates their interdiscipli nary dialogue, pre- cisely because it is more than a simple word, though also less than an elabo- rate theory (ibid: 15). The debates on the general concept of experience in both the psychol ogy of religion and the Study of Religion have been similarly complex, espec ially because it has been so crucial to both disciplines. The related debate alre ady started when the psychology of religion began to emerge as an empirical sci- ence in the United States around 1900. William James, one of its k ey repre- sentatives, dealt with it in detail in his much-read work, The Varieties of Re- ligious Experience . At that time, the spiritualist movement was in full blos- som, with attempts being made to contact the dead in the hereafter by m eans of spiritualist mediums in s\u00e9ances where occultist practice s such as table- turning were highly popular. Frequently at this time, renowned psychologists and psychiatrists we re also present at the s\u00e9ance tables, trying to find alternative explanations for the observed phenomena and, in the process, triggering highly controversial discussions about the status and role of psychology and psychiatry as sc ien- tific disciplines.4 Thus, psychology and psychiatry were already involved in the search for an alternative, scientific approach to the so-ca lled \"beyond\" long before modern research on NDEs started. James was among those psy- chologists whose theories were heavily based on analysis of such ext raordi- nary phenomena, and his work, The Varieties of Religious Experience , is full of examples of this kind. However, one key element in his reflections is the question of the actual object of research in the psychology of religion and the ontological status of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4 For further literature see Treitel 2004 or also Gripentrog 2016. Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 245 the object of religious experience itself. Discussing this quest ion in detail, he points out that it is not the task of science to provide evidence r egarding questions of religious truth, let alone the ontological status of objects of re li- gious experience. Rather, science must limit itself to the d escription of the experiences of those who \"apprehend themselves to stand in relation to what- ever they may consider the divine\" (James 1902: 32). What is of spec ial in- terest to him, then, is the intensity of this experience, whic h those affected describe as an increased perception of reality, a reality \"whi ch no adverse argument, however unanswerable by you in words, can expel from your be- lief\" (ibid: 72). Thus, he writes: \"All our attitudes, moral, practical or emotional, as well as religious, are due to the \"objects\" of our consciousness, the things which we believe to exist, whether really or idea lly, along with ourselves. Such objects may be present to ou r senses, or they may only be present to our thought. In either case, they elicit from us a reaction ; and the reaction due to things of thought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to sensible presences. It may be even stronger. \" (ibid: 53) Hence, James is not concerned with deciding whether a \"real\" obj ect corre- sponds to such an experience or, if so, what kind of object. Rather, answ ering this question seems wholly irrelevant to the value of such an experience. In- stead, both real and ideal objects are simply objects of consciousne ss that, as such, \"coexist\" within us. James, writing as a philosopher here, anticipated an important insight of contemporary brain research at this point, which has confirmed that the same brain areas are active in imagining as in visually perceiving a real object (Traut 2015: 33). For the brain, it seems to make no difference if something is just imagined or actually experienced. Thus, for James and his question about the ontological status of t he object of religious experience, this means that it does not really matter whether the experience is real or to what extent. In the first of his twenty lectures that make up Varieties , he discusses the closeness of religious experiences to pathological ones, a topic that has also been discussed with regard to NDEs. In doing so, he states explicitly that there is no real possibili ty of making a clear distinction between them. In particular, \"'geniuses' i n the religio us line\" frequently show, as James puts it, \"symptoms of nervous insta bility\" and are therefore often \"subject to abnormal psychical visitations\" (James 1902: 8). At the same time, this might be precisely the reason for the ir special 246 | Stephanie Gripentrog religious meaning, because \"often [...] these pathological features in their career have helped to give them their religious authority and inf luence\" (ibid: 8). The physiological and possibly even pathological causes of such experi- ences are therefore not relevant to James compared to their co nsequences for the life of the person having them (ibid: 51). At any rate, from James's point of view, the emotional reactions triggered by such \"objects of consciousness\" can be extremely intense. He writes: \"They are as convincing to those who have them as any direct sensible experiences can be, and they are, as a rule, much more convincing than res ults established by mere logic ever are. [...] if you do have them, and have them at all strongly, the probability is that you cannot help regardin g them as genuine perceptions of truth, as revelations of a kind of reality which no adverse argument, however unanswerable by y ou in words, can expel from your belief.\" (ibid: 72) The subjective power of the persuasion of such experiences seems to be ov er- whelming and can scarcely be questioned anymore. What James descri bes here can easily be matched with numerous reports of NDEs, and it al so high- lights an aspect that is repeatedly discussed in current research: the c laim of those concerned that such experiences were, so to speak, \"mo re real than real\". In their 2013 neuroscientific study, Thonnard et al. (2013) stat e that the clarity of memories of NDEs often exceeds the actual experi ence of them: \"A recent study compared NDE memories to real and imagine d memories, including non-NDE coma memories. It was found that NDE memories had ri cher content than all other types of memories, including better clarity and mo re self -referential and emo- tional information, suggesting that memories of NDEs are mor e akin to flashbulb memories and hallucinatory experiences than imagined e vents. These characteristics seem related to the content of the memory per se, rat her than medical factors or actual closeness to death, and help understand why such experiences are often perceived as 'super real,' even more so than real recent events.\" (Thonnard et al. as cited in Blanke et al. 2016: 334) But how can a scientific description deal with this kind of recourse t o expe- rience\u2014an experience that claims to be even \"more real than real\"? Despite the continuing popularity of James's approach, the conceptualization of rel i- gion based on the concept of experience has found no lasting success. Even Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 247 though it was established as a key term in the first half of the twentieth cen- tury, especially in the discipline of the phenomenology of religion, it wa s more or less abolished as \"too religious\" in the course of the reorientation of the academic Study of Religion as a cultural science in the sec ond half of that century (Gladigow 1988: 6-37). In the case of both religious experiences and NDEs, the question also arises under what conditions such \"experiences\" can be scienti fically de- scribed at all. The German sociologist and scholar of the Study of Religion Volkhard Krech has therefore proposed a different approach following his research on conversion, one that highlights the aspect of communication in- stead of experience. In his view, one implication of adopting a communica- tive paradigm is that religious experience should not be understood (a t leas t not exclusively) as a consciousness-like structure that is i naccessible to com- munication and thus to the sociological perspective, but instead as something that is constituted by communication and therefore is to be under stood as a social fact (Krech 2005: 358). Such experiences may be conceived, described, or even made visible through imaging procedures, as they are never directly accessible to research. The possibility of scientific, intersubjective access thus ends w ith the ex- pressed (mostly linguistically), mediated experience. Looked at in this fash- ion, new, interdisciplinary approaches become relevant that deal, for exam- ple, with questions of the narrative format of an NDE or the relationship be- tween narrative and experience in their mutual reciproci ty. But what are recent psychological studies on NDEs dealing with if not with the question of experience? Here, questions about the relationshi p be- tween mental health and the occurrence of NDEs have become very promi- nent. In his research, Kenneth Ring, for example, asked whether people re- porting an NDE differed in any way from the normal population in terms of their mental health. They were found to be no less healthy than the control group, but still differed from them in certain other respects (cp. Ring 1980; Greyson 1999: 7-19). This involved, for example, an increased susceptibility to hypnosis, the ability to remember dreams better and the ability to use im- agination (cp. Irwin 1985). There also seemed to be an accumulation of tr au- matic childhood experiences among this group, with feelings of alienation from the environment as a consequence (cp. Ring 1992). Previous psychological research on NDEs has primarily dealt wit h the question of how such experiences can be explained, suggesting that ND Es 248 | Stephanie Gripentrog could be a mental defense mechanism initiated by confrontation with immi- nent death (Vaitl 2012: 157). Another explanation that goes in a similar direction sees memorie s of the birthing process at work during the tunnel experience (Gabbard/Twemlo w 1991: 41-47). Grof's approach is similar but will be discussed later in detail. Depersonalization theory also invokes a defence mechanism as an e xplana- tion; due to an acute situation of crisis, the organism is put int o a state of alarm, which causes dissociation of the crisis situation. This prevent s the in- dividual from being forced to live through its full drama (Vaitl 2012: 157). However, Dieter Vaitl, summing up the various approaches to psycho- logical explanation, points out that there is still no explanation of the discrep- ancy between physiological restriction and the complexity of experie nce (2012: 156). Thus, important questions regarding explanations for thes e phe- nomena remain unanswered. The following analysis will be less concerned with making a fu rther at- tempt to provide such clarifications than with describing a ver y specific psy- chological and psychiatric approach to the topic. The notion of TP that i s invoked here is characterized by its comprehensive claim to be a ble to ex- plain the occurrence of such experiences in their entirety, while at the same time being largely excluded from academic psychology as unscientific. It is , therefore, in no way representative of the history of psychological and ps y- chiatric engagement with the topic of NDEs, though historically i t is still located at the inception of NDE research. 3 ON \" TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGY \" So-called \"Transpersonal Psychology\" represents a special case within mod- ern academic psychological research (Walach et al. 2005: 405-415). As a psychological movement founded in the late 1960s, it mainly defined itsel f through its organ of publication, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology , and its related society, the Transpersonal Association . However, it can hardly be characterized as a homogeneous movement, nor even as a school. Instead, its origins can best be described as heterogeneous (ibid : 405). Dif- ferent authors influenced its emergence, conceiving TP in very diff erent ways. These include especially Antony Sutich, who wrote the const itutive article of the discipline in the first volume of the Journal in 1969, Stanislav Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 249 Grof, who became known to the public mainly through his research on LSD, Abraham Maslow, the creator of the so-called hierarchy of needs, and a bove all the autodidact Ken Wilber, who began to develop a system of TP in the mid-1970s. Both Sutich and Maslow characterized TP as the \"fourth force\" coming at the end of an upward development, with behaviorism as the first force, psychoanalysis as the second and humanistic psychology as the third. As such, they understood it as completing and absorbing the previous stages of psychological theorizing and therapy. For Maslow, this implied an expl icit reference to transcendence, which was also to be part of his new psycholog- ical anthropology and its corresponding therapy. He wrote: \"Without the transpersonal, we get sick, violent and else hopeless and apa- thetic.\" (Maslow 1968: iii- iv) For Maslow, the starting point of this approach was an explicitly anti- materialist anthropology. He did not orient himself to the average or the men- tally ill, but to the concept of a healthy, even above-average human, w ho has fully developed his or her potential, a process he called \"self-realiza tion\". In his opinion, only very few people have ever achieved this level. Masl ow said in a lecture in 1962: \"When I started to explore the psychology of health, I pick ed out the finest, healthiest people, the best specimens of mankind I could find, and studied th em to see what they were like. [...] I found that these indivi duals tended to report having had something like mystic experiences, moments of great awe, moments of the most intense happi- ness or even rapture, ecstasy or bliss.\" (1962: 9) These remarks of Maslow's remind the reader strongly of Willi am James's suggestion to deal not with the experiences of the average rel igious human being, but with the most outstanding, extraordinary cases instead. The r eason for this, according to James, is that the essence of religion and re ligious ex- perience can best be studied with reference to extreme cases (1902: 8). Sim- ilarly, it recalls Maslow's specific conceptualization of the concept of e xpe- rience through which TP acquires its profile in relation to other branc hes of psychology and psychotherapy. Again, the reference to William James is ob- vious. Maslow calls such experiences\u2014these moments of great awe, int ense happiness, ecstasy, and bliss\u2014 peak experiences (Maslow 1964). 250 | Stephanie Gripentrog But what role do NDEs play in this regard? Their relationship to t he ap- proach described above will be explained below, using the example of an- other important representative of TP, Stanislav Grof. 4 STANISLAV GROF'S RESEARCH ON LSD AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO NEAR -DEATH EXPERIENCES In 1943, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the substanc e LSD and, at first through self-experiment, experienced its enormous effect on th e human psyche (Hofmann 1979). The Czech psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof was one of the first to receive samples of the new substance from Basel. One of his main questions was about the therapeutic potential of LSD, as it was initially considered to be a means of generati ng model psy- choses that could be explored and then possibly cured (Grof 1980). Very soon, Grof also started to be interested in the potential signi ficance of the substance for the dying. Thus, in 1974 he took over the leadership of the so- called Spring Grove Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre, USA,5 from Walter Pahnke, who himself had already become well known for his so-called Good Friday Experiment (Pahnke 1966: 85-106). Origi- nally, the program had been dedicated to the effects of LSD on schizophren- ics and alcoholics, but in 1966, the research was thematically reoriented, in- itiated through an employee of the Research Department who had fa llen se- verely ill with cancer and decided to test the effects of LS D in view of her approaching death. This was the third attempt worldwide to treat terminally ill cancer pa- tients with LSD and it was scientifically documented. Its impr essive results (Pahnke et al. 1970: 1856-1863) initiated a new research project on the ef - fects of LSD on such patients. For two decades, the Maryland P sychiatric Research Center and its research facility became the site of intense research on LSD. The very first pilot study produced astonishing results,6 which the authors themselves directly related to Maslow's concept of peak experiences : \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5 More on the history of this program cp. Yensen /Dryer 1995 : 73-101. 6 Cp. Richards et al . 1972 : 121-149. Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 251 \"It has been our clinical impression that the most dramatic ther apeutic changes fol- lowed sessions in which the patient experienced an intense p sychedelic peak experi- ence, the phenomenological description of which corresponded to the categories of (1) unity, (2) transcendence of time and space, (3) objec tivity and reality, (4) sense of sacredness, (5) deeply felt positive mood and (6) inef fability [...] Profound experi- ences of this kind were described by approximately 25% of the p atients in this study. These patients were often those who seemed most comp letely free of a fear of death following their sessions.\" (Richards et al. 1972: 142) The assumptions based on this research were that LSD, combined wit h good therapeutic support for cancer patients close to death, could help t o relieve them of anxiety and associated symptoms. As the passage quoted a bove makes clear, the aspect of the peak experience was decisive right from the start. The authors describe it using terms such as unity, transcend ence of space and time, objectivity and reality, a sense of holiness, deeply posi tive moods, and ineffability; aspects that can all also be found in phenomenolog- ical descriptions of NDEs. These similarities become even more obvious in The Human Encounter with Death , which Grof published together with Joan Halifax in 1977. This work was published only two years after Moody's Life after Life , (cp. 1975) and Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, in her foreword to Grof and Halifax' s volume, explicitly pointed out the close connection between the two pieces of r e- search (cp. Grof/Halifax 1977). Also, the two authors themselves repeatedly referred to Moody's work (cp. Grof/Halifax 1977). The reports th ey collected and presented in their volume on the experiences of patients treat ed with LSD include out-of-body experiences as well as various forms of life re view, en- counters with the dead, and even a light identified as \"divine.\"7 Some of the patients who had both an LSD experience and an NDE confirmed the st riking similarities between them: \"During the operation Ted had two cardiac arrests resulting in clinical death and was resuscitated on both occasions. [...] At the same time, however , he was involved in a number of unusual experiences. [...] The initial darkness was replaced by brilliant light, and he was able to approach it and fuse with it. The feelings he described on experiencing the light were those of sacredness and deep peace. [...] Before we left \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7 For further similarities, cp. Bryant 2003 : 143-144. 252 | Stephanie Gripentrog him that day, he emphasized how glad he was that he had had three LSD sessions. He found the experience of actual dying extremely similar to his psychedelic experiences and considered the latter excellent training and preparation. 'Without the sessions I would have been scared by what was happening, but knowing these states, I was not afraid at all.'\" (Grof/Halifax 1977: 181-182) Despite these remarkable parallels, Grof and Halifax also point ed out that there is an important difference, at least from the accounts in Moody's work: the descriptions of his cases lacked mythological elements, or, as G rof and Halifax put it, the \"cartoon sky\" of LSD experiences, with all i ts multiform expressions of archetypal images of deities and demons. But how can these parallels be explained? According to Grof a nd Hali- fax: \"Observations from psychedelic research, as well as data from his tory, comparative religion and anthropology, seem to indicate that we a ll harbo ur functional matrices in our unconscious minds that contain an authentic encounter with deat h. Activation of these unconscious structures by psychoactive drugs, o r by nondrug factors and tech- niques, results in a dramatic experience of death that, in ter ms of its intensity, is in- distinguishable from actual dying.\" (ibid: 9) It is this explanation that will be discussed in more detail b elow. In the course of his more than fifty years of research, Grof developed a new and very spe- cific model of the human psyche, which he also uses to explain NDEs . Fur- thermore, his approach ultimately embodies the comprehensive claim to put psychology and psychotherapy on a completely new basis and, at the same time, to initiate a scientific paradigm shift (Grof 2012: 137-163). He writes: \"In the last five decade s, various avenues of modern consciousness research h ave re- vealed a rich array of 'anomalous' phenomena \u2014experiences and observations that have undermined some of the generally accepted assertions of moder n psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy concerni ng the nature and dimensions of the human psyche, the origins of emotional and psychosomatic disorders, and effect ive therapeu- tic mechanisms. Many of these observations are so radical that they question the basic metaphysical assumptions of materialistic s cience concerning the nature of reality and of human beings and the relationship between consciousness and matter .\" (ibid: 138) Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 253 The consequences of this for the roles of psychology, psychiatry, and psy- chotherapy in the \"religious field\" will be discussed in section five. At this point, it is appropriate to explain the matrices mentioned by Grof in more detail. He has constantly elaborated this model to this day, which is an essential result of his work, taking into account the experiences of numer- ous clients, comparisons between whom revealed nothing less than the need for a new cartography of the psyche (cp. Grof 1975). Due to his research on extraordinary states of consciousness, he has extended the tradit ional view of the psyche into two further major areas (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Sketch of Grof's cartography of the human psyche. Source: Illustration by Stephanie Gripentrog based on Grof (1975). Beyond content from the postnatal biographical level (from birth to a dult- hood), people in exceptional states of consciousness can gain acces s to the area of birth (experiences in the womb and during birth = perinatal domain) and the so-called transpersonal domain. He compares the experience s of these domains with those of mystics and shamans, as well as with C.G. Jung's concept of the collective unconscious. Two aspects are of further im- portance to him: Matrices . COEX systems are systems of condensed experience : 254 | Stephanie Gripentrog \"A typical COEX system consists of many layers of unc onscious material that share similar emotions or physical sensations; the contributio ns to a COEX system come from different levels of the psyche. More superficial and easier available layers contain memories of emotional or physi- cal traumas from infancy, childhood, and later life. On a deeper level, each CO EX system is typically connected to a certain aspect of th e memory of birth, a specific BPM; the choice of this matrix depends on the nature of the emotional and physical feelings involved. [...] The deep est roots of COEX systems underlying emotional and psychosomatic disorders reach into the transpersonal domain of the psyche.\" (Grof 2012: 150) Furthermore, Grof noted that these systems tend to be associate d with certain aspects of the birth process, which he then summarized as Basic Perinatal Matrices (see Figure 2). Fig. 2. Basic Perinatal Matrices Source: Grof 1994: 31 . As such, they also provide the pattern for different forms of transpersonal experience. Grof distinguishes four different Basic Perinatal Matrices , as shown in Fig. 2. These are listed below in a simplified and shortened table according to Grof (see Table 1). Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 255 Table 1. Matrix I: Unity with ma- ternal organism Matrix II: First stage of the birth pro- cess when the uterus con- tracts, but t he cervix is not yet open Matrix III: Struggle to be born after the uterine cervix di- lates Matrix IV: Separation from the mother Related memories from life after birth Happy memories of infancy or childhood, atten- tion from the mother, ro- mances, swim- ming in the sea Situations that were associ- ated with dan- ger to life, ac- cidents, logical intoxicating experiences, vic- tim seduction dangerous sit- uations, over- coming diffi- cult obs tacles by own efforts Related phenomena from LSD sessions Undisturbed in- tra-uterine life: Oceanic ecstasy, oneness with the cosmos, paradise visions Disturbances of the intra-uterine life: Feeling of being devoured, disgust, visions of demons and evil m eta- physical forces Devouring maelstrom, vi- olent physical and mental suffering, feel- ing of an un- bearable hope- less situation, hell vision, feelings of futility and absurdity of human exist- ence Intensification of suffering to cos- mic dimensions, simultaneous sen- sation of pleasure and pain, sado- masochistic or- gies, participation in bloody battles, experiences of death and rebirth, religious blood sacrifice motifs, intense body reac- tions Sudden release of a strong pressure, vi- sions of gigan- tic halls, radi- ant light and beautiful col- ours, feelings of rebirth and salvation, in- tensification of sensory im- pressions Source: Table by Stephanie Gripentrog on Grof (1994: 30 -31). 256 | Stephanie Gripentrog This sketch suggests that experiences made in extraordinary states of con- sciousness are not chaotic but follow very specific patterns a nd can come from all three different levels of consciousness. Thus, experience s from the recent or distant past, as well as experiences around birth and in the last re- sort, also from areas that Grof calls \"transpersonal,\" are possible. T hrough a strong and qualitatively similar emotional quality or physical sens ation, t hese very diverse contents are linked together, and it is through this mec hanism that the transitions from one content of experience to the next can be ex- plained. In addition, the respective experiences can be assigned t o the four Basic Perinatal Matrices , which structure the experience thematically. But how does the access work? And what are the reasons for particula r experi- ences and their timing? For this too, Grof has an explanation th at is particu- larly relevant therapeutically. He writes: \"The techniques that can directly activate the unconscious seem to reinforce selec- tively the most relevant emotional material and facilitate its emerg ence into con- sciousness. They thus provide a kind of inner radar t hat scans the system and detects the material with the strongest charge and emotional signific ance.\" (1988: 4) This means that it is not the therapist who decides which topic to work on, but rather that the topic with the \"strongest emotional charge\" will natural ly come to the surface. As such, it can then work as a door to deeper le vels of consciousness. Grof explains this structure by means of a clinical example : \"A person suffering from psych ogenic asthma might discover in serial breathwork sessions a powerful COEX system underlying this disorder. The biographical part of this constellation might consist of a memory of near drownin g at the age of seven, memories of being repeatedly strangled b y an older brother between the ages of three and four, and a memory of severe choking during whooping cough or diphtheria at the age of two. The perinatal contribution to this COEX could b e, for example, suffo- cation experienced during birth because of stra ngulation by the umbilical cord twisted around the neck. A typical transpersonal root of this breat hing disorder would be an experience of being hanged or strangled in what seems to be a pr evious lifetime.\" (Grof 2012: 150) In repeating an experience under the controlled conditions of a psyc hedelic session, Grof believes that the negative impact of the experie nce can be Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 257 discharged and thereby neutralized. The therapeutic use of this mechanis m will be discussed in more detail below. In his research with LSD, Grof thus observed that those who had experi- enced autobiographical content in their psychedelic sessions were in creas- ingly confronted with other complexes at deeper levels, such as mortality, physical pain, emotional agony, aging and, finally, death. The most im- portant element of this process is that on each occasion the ima ges are per- ceived as extremely realistic and completely comparable to the re al process of dying (Grof/Grof: 1980: 25). The relationship to the topic of NDEs be- comes clear at this point. Grof expresses this explicitly at t he end of his study Encounter with Death . He writes: \"Individuals who experience the encounter with death in psychedelic sessions fre- quently report that it feels extremely authentic and convincing, to the point of being indistinguishable from actual dying. Many descriptions of changes of consciousness in persons facing situations of vital emergency or experiencing clinical death exist in autobiographical accounts, novels, and poetry, but this area has been surprisingly ne- glected by psychiatrists and psychologists. There are only a few studies in which this interesting field has been systematically explored. We will briefly summarize the work that has been done, illustrate it with subjective accounts of survivors, and relate it to our observations from psychedelic research .\" (Grof/Halifax 1977: 131) At this point, it becomes clear how Grof thinks of the relationshi p between LSD experiences and NDEs: they are caused by the same mechanis ms of the human psyche that become active when the normal state is ruptured by some- thing or intentionally changed. This can happen through the use of drugs, as well as in situations of extreme threat to life or through certa in techniques, such as the holotropic breathwork that Grof developed with his wi fe after LSD was banned. This also shows that Grof does not see the drug a s causing the experience, but as making it visible and accessible . The possible paths to such experiences are many and in his writings, Grof draws mani fold com- parisons to induce extraordinary states of consciousness. Later, in their 1980 publication Beyond Death , Stanislav Grof and his wife Christina write : \"There are striking parallels between Moody's observations and d escriptions from es- chatological literature, particularly the Bardo states in the Ti betan Book of the Dead. Similar if not identical elements occur in psychedel ic sessions when the subjects 258 | Stephanie Gripentrog experience deep confrontation with death in the context of the d eath\u2014rebirth process. As we shall see in a later sectio n, there are also correspondences with spontaneously occurring states experienced by some schizophrenic patients.\" (Grof/Grof 1980: 13) Here, Grof and Grof compare various aspects directly with each other, de- scribing them as \"similar\" or \"identical:\" Moody's research res on NDEs and his descriptions of their eschatological character; Buddhist ways of c on- frontation with death, as in the context of the Tibetan Book of the Dead ; and episodes in the experiences of schizophrenics. The images that a ppear in this context correspond to the cartographies of extraordinary states of consc ious- ness that every human being can potentially experience, as menti oned earlier. At this point, the question of the ontological status of the objects of such experiences becomes of particular interest. In the spirit of J ames, Grof writes that they are experienced as being on a special level of realit y. And, like James, Grof concludes: \"Modern studies of holotropic states [...] have shown H eaven, Paradise, and Hell are ontolo gically real; they represent distinct and important states of cons ciousness that all human beings can under certain circumstances expe rience during their life- time. Celestial, paradisean, and infernal visions are a stan dard part of the experiential spectrum of psychedelic inner journeys, near -death states, mystical experiences, as well as shamanic initiatory crises and other types o f 'spiritual emergencies'.\" (Grof 2012: 157) Thus, heaven and hell are real, but in the sense of specific states of conscious- ness, not as external places. However, unlike James, Grof moves one step further. While James, at least in his writings on religious exper ience, does not go beyond the subjective certainty of others, only observing and describ- ing from the outside (which is all too clearly expressed in his form ulation \"who apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may con- sider the divine\" (James 1902: 32)), Grof ascribes priority to co nsciousness over matter when he says: \"Materialistic science has not been a ble to produce any convincing evidence that con- sciousness is a product of the neurophysiological proce sses in the brain. It has been able to maintain its present position only by ignoring, misinterpreting, and even ridi- culing a vast body of observations in dicating that consciousness can exist and function Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 259 independently of the body and of the physical senses. Th is evidence comes from par- apsychology, anthropology, LSD research, experiential psych otherapy, thanatology, and the study of spontaneously occurring holotropic states of consciousness. All these disciplines have amassed impressive data demonstrating clearl y that human con- sciousness is capable of doing many things that the b rain (as understood by main- stream science) could not possibly do and that it is a primary and further irreducible aspect of existence.\" (Grof 2012: 145 -146) Consciousness itself thus becomes the primary factor of existence. In a dopt- ing this proposition, Grof can be aligned with authors of more recent re search on NDEs, such as Pim van Lommel (2010) and Eben Alexander, (2012) who also assume the possibility of a body-independent consciousness a nd con- sider this to be the only plausible explanation of the NDE phenomenon. But it is not only these three authors who share this approach. Rather, their argu- mentation is part of a much broader movement within contemporary re ligi- osity, on which I shall elaborate in the next section. 5 ON THE THERAPEUTIC R ELEVANCE OF NEAR -DEATH EXPERIENC ES As a trained psychoanalyst, Grof's interest in LSD had initi ally been predom- inantly therapeutic. He and other researchers in the field hoped that the use of the drug in a therapeutic setting under controlled conditions woul d provide a cure for schizophrenia and alcoholism. His research with cance r patients and, resulting from it, with depressive patients also demonstrated the drug's high degree of effectiveness in helping people cope with the fac t of approach- ing death: \"According to our observations, those individuals who have experienced death and rebirth in their sessions show specific changes in their perception of themselves and of the world, in their hierarchies of values, general behavior, and overall world -views. Those who prior to these experiences had various forms and degrees of emotional and psychosomatic discomfort usually feel greatly relieved. Depression dissolves, anxiety and tension are reduced, guilt feelings are lifted, and self-image as well as self-ac- ceptance improve considerably. Individuals talk about experiencing themselves as 260 | Stephanie Gripentrog reborn and purified; a deep sense of being in tune with nature and the universe replaces their previous feelings of alienation .\" (Grof/Halifax 1977: 210) On the basis of these findings, later, when LSD was banned, Stani slav and Christina Grof developed the technique of holotropic breathwork as a substi- tute and introduced it as a new form of therapy. Grof sees in thi s a modern form of transitional ritual, using the same vocabulary as the French ethnolo- gist Arnold van Gennep: separation\u2014 liminality \u2014incorporation,8 and he as- cribes great therapeutic relevance to it. In all cultures, Grof and Grof write in Beyond Death , there are certain rituals that have this function: \"However, repeated encounters with annihilation followed by a s ense of redefinition have another important function: they prepare the individual for event ual biological death by establishing a deep, almost cellular awareness that pe riods of destruction are those of transition rather than termination.\" (1980: 23) According to Grof, these rituals, for instance therapeutic sessions , prepare people to deal with death. Thus, in such sessions, the area of the sensory barrier is first crossed, followed by experiences of biographical content. Af- ter that, one enters the domain in which experiences of death and rebirth are made. Those who engage in holotropic breathing will sooner or later be c on- fronted with this area. In all cases, it is important not only to observe, but to live through experiences of problematic content again, including in the phys- ical sense, because that is what causes the therapeutic ef fect. Ultimately, this also applies to one's own death, which is already a structural part of the ca r- tography of the psyche as a potential experience. This is why Grof and Halifax say : \"It is hard to imagine a more useful way to combine medicine, psychology, and religion than psychedelic therapy with dying individuals.\" (1977: 24) However, the technique of holotropic breathwork is relevant not only for the sick or those in need of ther apy. With the discovery of these structures in human consciousness, Grof claims noth- ing less than to have found the decisive key to the actual constitution of re- ality, the understanding of religious history, as well as of menta l illnesses and the transformation of psychotherapeutic treatments, which he the n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8 Cp. v an Gennep (1909 ). Grof and Grof refer to van Gennep in Beyond Death (1980: 22). Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 261 qualifies as \"technologies of the sacred\". (Grof 2012: 139) Grof's claim is thus all-encompassing, and he sees in his psychology the \"psychology of the future\" (cp. 2000). Since 1987, when Grof Transpersonal Training as a \"psy- cho-spiritual practice,\" he and his team have been training people i n this ther- apeutic technique. The courses (cp. www.holotropic.com, 04 July, 2018 ) they teach consist of seven six-day modules, which the trainees have to at- tend. Each of the modules to be visited has a thematic motto, of which four are compulsory: \"The Power Within,\" actual experiences with holotropic breathwork during workshop s led by certified leaders and another ten individual sessions are mandatory. On the basis of this, the trainees must assist at least f our times in the relevant workshops. Whoever has gained two more years of experience with holo- tropic breathwork and attended the final two-week intensive course receiv es a certificate. Even then, certain obligations remain to be met regula rly to en- sure the quality of the work in the long term, on pain of losing one's certifi- cate (Ibid: 6). Grof makes it very clear in the letter accompanying the t raining application forms that the technology itself is easy to learn, but that as a leader or companion you must have special competences that requi re long- term learning: \"To be able to effectively facilitate Holotropic sessions for others, we often have to go through a very profound personal transformation that has emotiona l, psychologi- cal, philosophical, and spiritual dimensions. As you trai n to be Holotropic Breathwork facilitators, we as k you to work toward the capacity to remain unperturbed while providing support for people in all possible forms of non -ordinary states of conscious- ness, toward the ability to follow them wherever they have to go i n their experiences, and toward maintainin g trust in the intrinsic healing forces in them.\" (Ibid: 16) In addition to the American organization (cp. www.holotropic.com, July 4, 2018), a separate network, the \"European Association for Holotropic Bre ath- work,\" was founded. The organization's website describes the therapy as a \"powerful technique for self-healing and self-exploration allowing for greater self-understanding, expansion of self-identity and access to the root s 262 | Stephanie Gripentrog of emotional and psychosomatic challenges one might face.\"9 The countries in which training is currently available are Australia, Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia , Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Apart from this certified training, the technique of holotropic breathwork is also offered independently. One example is Sylvester Walch (cp. 2012), who was tra ined by Grof but developed the method further independently of him and has pub- lished a lot on the subject. A website associated with the Grof Transpersonal Training website states that there are currently five hundred people worldwide who a re certi- fied in the technique of holotropic breathwork.10 It is unclear how accurate this information is\u2014statistical surveys on the actual dissemi nation of the practice worldwide do not yet exist. However, random samples for Ger many show that there are people in the alternative medicine sector11 who not only offer holotropic breathwork as a form of treatment but also train others in it. In fact, LSD has itself recently moved back into the focus not only of social and therapeutic interest, but also of scientific interes t. This is currently shown by various research projects on LSD and related substances suc h as psilocybin,12 which again not only highlight its extraordinary effect on the human brain, (Nutt et al. 2016: 4853-4858) but also its therapeutic rel evance. It may therefore be assumed that this research topic is undergoing a renais- sance. Organizations such as the Multidisciplinary Association for Psyche- delic Studies (www.maps.org, May 8, 2018), founded in 1986 as a non-profit organization and based on donations, have supported this renaissance for many years and taken it further. Moreover, events like the World Psychedelic Forum in Basle (March 21-24, 2008), the conference Horizons: Perspectives on Psychedelics (Oct 6 -8, 2017) in New York and the International Transpersonal Conference 2017 (Sept 28-Oct 1, , May 8, 2018 . 11 A probably incomplete list of therapists in Germany can be found at: https://www.therapeuten.de/therapien/holotropes_atmen.htm#anbieter , May 8, 2018 . 12 On the latest research, including the effect s of LSD on cancer patients , cp. Grif- fiths et al. 2016: 1181 -1197. Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 263 demonstrate the public presence of the topic. What kind of impact these ini- tiatives may have on the future of the rapidly developing branch of pall iative care remains to be seen. Finally, with regard to the therapeutic dimension, there is an overlap be- tween research on LSD and NDEs.13 Not only do LSD experiences and NDEs show striking similarities phenomenologically, in the field of TP t hey also seem to have similar psychological consequences for those affec ted, as re- peatedly reported in the form of the loss of fear of death or of a changed view of oneself and the world.14 In the form of the technique of holotropic breath- work, the experience of dying, death, and rebirth also has a place today on the German therapy and counselling scene, although exact data are curr ently still lacking. In addition, Grof's early research on terminally i ll cancer pa- tients also demonstrates its claim of potential relevance for end-of-li fe care. 6 TRANSPERESONAL PSYCH OLOGY BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION What is special about the question of the relationship between p sychol- ogy/psychiatry in the case of TP and NDEs is that Transpersonal P sychology seems to play a twofold role. On the one hand, it is a means to establish an allegedly scientific perspective on the topic of NDEs. On the other hand, psychology\u2014in the form of TP, for example\u2014itself becomes entangled with the religious field through certain therapeutic practices and t he exploitation of patterns of scientific plausibility to religious ends. This i s probably why \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13 Roland Griffiths, who conducted research on the effe cts of LSD on cancer patients (see above: Griffiths et al. 2016 ), set up a new project in 2 015, collecting data about people who had an NDE or some other non -ordinary experience that fun- damentally altered their beliefs or under standing about death and dying, the re- sults of which are not yet published (cp. http://www.drpennysartori.com/NDE% 20death%20flyer.pdf , May 08, 2018) . In an earlier interview from 2006, Griffiths also pointed out the parallels between his r psilocybin and NDEs ( cp. https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2006/Griffithspsilocy binQ , May 08, 2018). 14 Such results have, for instance, been reported in a recent study on NDEs and their relation to spiritual well-being (Khanna/Greyson 2014: 1605 -1615). 264 | Stephanie Gripentrog the inventor of LSD, Albert Hofmann, said in an interview that psychiatrists are the \"curative priests\" of contemporary society.15 And Stanislav Grof too speaks of the \"re-enchantment\" of psychology in one of his recent pu blica- tions in which he looks back at the last fifty years of consciousness resear ch (cp. 2012). It therefore seems logical to read this case as a typi cal example of what Wouter Hanegraaff has described as \"New Age religiosity\" and the religion psychology\" (Hanegraaf f 1998: 514). What the alternative and complementary medical/ thera- peutic area in particular, to which Grof can be ascribed, gener ates an increas- ing resonance on the customer side. Thus, regardless of how they might be assessed scientifically, they obviously play a role in some par ts of society that should not be underestimated. At any rate, this movement can best be characterized as program matically transboundary, and as such it may seem more attractive than ever to many people, precisely because it claims to be both scientific and religious. More- over, it stands apart from the institutionally established forms of religion and offers a radically individualized form of access to the beyond whic h requires no mediator. Grof writes as follows about this with reference to C.G. Jung: \"As he saw it in his later years, the psyche is not a product of the brain and is not contained in the skull; it is the creative and generative princip le of the cosmos ( anima mundi ). It permeates all of existence and the individual ps yche of each of us is teased out of this unfathomable cosmic matrix. The boundaries between th e anima mundi and the individual psyche are not absolute; they are permea ble and can be transcended in holotropic states.\" (2012: 154) Not only does this type of psychology represent a clear rejection of t he ma- terialistic paradigm in science, it also claims to open up a path for the con- nection of the individual psyche with the anima mundi and the process of man becoming one with the cosmos. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15 Cp. http://www.bpv.ch/blog/albert -hofmann -interview/ , May 08, 2018. Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 265 7 CONCLUSION The aim of this paper has been to analyze a striking development in the con- temporary religious landscape, namely the \"religionization\" of sc ientific dis- course as manifest in research on Near-Death Experiences in T ranspersonal Psychology as a specific, marginal part of psychology and psychiatry. T his development has been analyzed by focusing on one of its most impor tant representatives, the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof. Overall, four co ncluding ob- servations can be made. First, the distinction between science and religion is once again i m- pugned and re-negotiated in the field of Transpersonal Psychology. As suc h, these cases are a good example of what Burkhard Gladigow, in his hi ghly quoted text on European religious history, has described as the \"vertic al transfer\" of results of the humanities and natural sciences i nto the realm of \"religion\" (1995: 21 ). In the case of both holotropic breathwork as well as psychological approaches to Near-Death Experiences (NDE), resear ch that claims to be scientific becomes productive of religious imaginary. Secondly, even though TP may be a contested branch of psychology, there have been noticeable changes within \"orthodox\" psychology in d ealing with religion and spirituality as well. This observation helps to furt her con- textualize the case at hand. In Germany, for example, a re-evaluation of top- ics related to religion and spirituality can be observed in the fi elds of psy- chology and psychiatry. This development has already - devalued [...], recent publications on religious psychology have registered a remarkable cha nge of direction [...]\" (Utsch 2002: 68). For example, a survey of more than nine hundred German psychotherapists in 2011 revealed \"[...] that spirituali ty and religiosity seem to be relevant to the majority of psychological psychothera - pists in Germany\" (Utsch 2002: 69). More than half of them said \"[...] that their personal spiritual or religious orientation strongly (8 per c ent), fairly (21 per cent) or moderately (27 per cent) affects their psychothera peutic ac- tivity\" (Ibid: 69). Thus, quite independently of the special case of T P or of specific client and patient demands, a notable trend to integrate spirituality or religiosity can be observed in the broader fields of psychology, psychi atry, and psychotherapy. Thirdly, this whole development can be situated in the wider context of research on the \"therapeutization of society,\" (cp. Anhorn/Balzereit 2016; 266 | Stephanie 2011). Therapeutization means, according to Anhorn and Balzereit, the diffusion, spreading, and generalization of highly indivi dual- ized and self-referential methods and techniques of everyday life and prob- lem solving, accelerated under the conditions of the neo-liberal socia l for- mation (2016: XVII). This description of the diffusion of therapeutic me th- ods cannot be discussed in detail here. Such a diffusion will, how ever, not remain without influence on religion. From a theoretical point of view, one aspect seems particularly interesting, namely the religious productivity of therapy itself. In this way, therapeutic approaches, same as for instance holo- tropic breathwork, are at times deliberately designed to induce transpersona l experiences that can be effective in healing. Detached from a de finite, clearly identifiable religious tradition, these specific forms of therapy can become an extraordinarily powerful medium for religion. The \"re-sacralizat ion\" of psychology, the orientation of mainstream psychology and psychotherapy towards religious and spiritual questions, and finally the \"therapeuti zation\" of society are therefore important factors in contemporary we stern religious history. Finally, the aspect of somatization is crucial in current re-configurations of religion(s). In an anthology on the \"somatization of the religious\" pub- lished in 2015, Gritt Klinkhammer and Eva Tolksdorf point out that religion and spirituality have become enormously important in the resear ch-based and application-oriented secular health sector in recent years, alongsi de an increase in the supply of and demand for religious and spiritualist-ori ented therapies in the alternative and complementary medical field, i n religious and spiritual communities, and in the esoteric field. Within the curre nt state of research, questions of the effect this development may have had on new un- derstandings of \"body\", \"religion\", and \"health\", on potentially novel ways of religious (self-)organization and communitarization, as well a s on for- mations of religious authenticity and authority remain unanswered (Klinkhammer/Tolksdorf 2015: 3-4). The topic of NDEs seems to be a paradigmatic case here, in which dying, even if \"only\" perceived psychologically, is always a physical event. From the point of view of therapists such as Grof, who deliberately induc ed such processes, they are always both psychological and physical events at t he same time. This method is characterized by the fact that a ps ychic experience always implies a physical one, and that it is only by involving both that heal- ing becomes possible. As mentioned in the passage from Klinkhammer and Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion | 267 Tolksdorf quoted above, this further implies a specific view of religious a u- thenticity and authority: authenticity is constituted by the individual exper i- ence of the clients, and therapists are solely companions of a proce ss that is basically autonomous. Developments such as these change the social config- uration of the field. This is why Klinkhammer and Tolksdorf predict that the new processes of somatization in the religious field will re-est ablish charis- matic communitarization, as well as retroactively affect tradi tional forms of religion(s). This understanding could generate in-depth questions about new processes of religious authorization by means of \"the body\" and \"he aling\" and new communitarization dynamics in the face of a charismat ic healing relationship. The practice of healing is by no means limited to the r eligious virtuosi, as there is a definite tendency to duplication and individuation. These developments therefore raise questions about changes in the un der- standing of roles, the relationship between religious clients and heal ers, and the dynamics of the healing pro cess (ibid: 7-8). In the case of both holotropic breathwork and NDEs, the individual ex- perience is itself meant to cause the healing. These are therefore exactly the tendencies towards duplication and individuation that Klinkhammer and Tolksdorf speak of. What is new here, above all, is the conn ection with the aspect of healing, which is both physical and psychical at the same time and is put back into the hands of the clients themselves as a process of self -heal- ing. Therapists are solely companions in these processes or temp orary teach- ers in therapeutic techniques, which are never limited to them as \"virtuos i\". What kinds of new communities are emerging from these constella tions? How are they changing the religious field?16 What widespread effects are such developments exerting in view of the \"therapeutization of society\" and the \"spiritual turn\" in psychology and psychotherapy? Research is j ust about to start at this point.
