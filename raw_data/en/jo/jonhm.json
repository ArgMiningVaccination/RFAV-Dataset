One of these recurring cycles we can always count on is the changing of the seasons. Many practitioners of ayurvedic medicine recommend a wellness approach that is specific to the state of our inner and outer worlds. And that brings us to the spring detox. Ayurvedic spring detox is a way to bring balance back into our bodies after any disruptions that the winter may have caused. It's also a method of creating a long-term routine in our body's cycles, so we can prepare for what lies ahead. We know you might have some questions, and we're here to help. Ayurveda, also known as ayurvedic medicine, is a longstanding practice of using natural methods to heal our bodies. It is a comprehensive belief system that locates our place within the natural processes of the universe. According to ayurvedic belief, the universe consists of [five basic elements](https://www.ayurherbs.com.au/principles-of-ayurveda/)\u2014space, air, fire, water, and earth. Combinations of these elements give rise to three vital forces, called doshas, within our bodies. You can regulate your diet, lifestyle, and emotions in order to balance these doshas, but in some cases, you may want to turn to specialized treatments. Ayurvedic treatments have a wide range. These include herbal treatments, oils, massage, diet changes, lifestyle changes, and mindfulness meditation. There are specialized methods of applying these treatments, and each should be in response to the state of your body's energies. Beyond elements and doshas, there are also malas that are excreted from the body, dhatus that compose the body, rasas which you ingest as tastes, and gunas, which are qualities of the universe. These systems coexist in a delicate balance. Ayurvedic practitioners tell us that a disturbance or blockage in any of these natural rhythms will result in illness and poor health. This is why some people use ayurvedic medicine as an alternative or supplement to drugs and other medications. Like pharmacological drugs, ayurvedic treatments are designed to target the cause of the illness. But unlike common medication, Ayurveda has to do with the balance of these systems of the universe. The truth is, an ayurvedic spring cleanse is a good idea for any human being. You don't need to be suffering from a certain ailment to benefit from a spring detox. Because of the planetary change in seasons, though, you may find yourself falling into a common pattern as you transition from winter to spring. Winter can be a period of imbalance in your [kapha dosha](https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/detox-your-life-holistic-ayurvedic-spring-cleanse#gid=ci020756b220242620&pid=woman-in-bath), which represents the combination of water and earth. For many, it's a time of heaviness. The decrease in sunlight and colder environment can make you feel sluggish or tired. This can have a negative impact on your physical health as well as your mental health. You may begin to feel less active, and heavy emotions may weigh on your mind. Maybe you're experiencing a change in diet over the winter months, eating a different quantity or type of food. All of these seasonal changes can create an imbalance in your body's 3 doshas. Winter is notorious for lower immunity levels and risks to mental wellbeing. If you experience a difference in health during the wintertime, you may be looking forward to spring as a time to \"start fresh.\" Or maybe you aren't experiencing negative symptoms, but are just going through a bit of winter hibernation. At times, the stasis of winter can be an incredibly generative environment. But different seasons call for different approaches to life. As the springtime rolls around, your hibernation may not fit your surroundings as well as it once did. As you embrace your body's natural cycles, you can ease yourself into the arrival of spring with an ayurvedic detox. Because each human body's interaction to the surrounding world is unique, there is no one way to do a spring detox. What we can provide is an overview of ayurvedic detox principles and how these can fit within a spring detox ritual. First, we can take a look at body treatments. These are done in consultation with an ayurvedic practitioner, and they are specific to the energy in your body. For example, you might want to schedule a [panchakarma detox](https://www.ayurherbs.com.au/panchakarma-detox/) for a comprehensive rejuvenation treatment. Panchakarma is made up of multiple steps, and it is usually done on-site at an ayurvedic practice. It targets the waste matter, or ama, that builds up in the body over time. Each step is designed as a different way to release this waste and return your body to its sacred balance. Because panchakarma is done in consultation with an ayurveda practitioner, it can be tailored to your body and any ailments you might want to work on. Panchakarma may [be preceded by](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ayurvedic-detox#steps) something called purvakarma. Purvakarma is a step in the detox process that relaxes the body by using things like [massage and Shirodhara](https://www.ayurherbs.com.au/services/shirodhara/), the pouring of warm oil or medicated liquids onto your forehead. This is an optional step that is designed to bring your body into the right state for release. Another way to detox your body is to expose your body to herbal remedies and foods recommended by ayurveda. Because ayurvedic belief considers the way these things affect human energy, you can undergo a special diet aimed toward energetic balance. Ask a local ayurvedic practitioner what you can intake to improve your springtime health. In this hectic world we all live in, it can seem like there is such little time to reflect on our own wellbeing. If you've been wondering how to take care of your mental, physical, and spiritual health as the seasons change, an ayurvedic spring detox might be just what you're looking for. To schedule a detox appointment or consult with our ayurvedic practitioner, all you have to do is [let us know](https://www.ayurherbs.com.au/book/).
