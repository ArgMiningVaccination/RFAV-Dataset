As the Museum serves a variety of audiences, including many children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine, we have a responsibility to protect our guests and ensure that their visit is not only fun and educational, but safe.\" In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History has remained committed to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all visitors and staff. The Museum's leadership stands behind the science that propelled the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines. It made the decision to require employee vaccinations following the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. A critical component of the Museum's new [strategic plan](https://www.cmnh.org/cmnh_strategicplan2021/index.html) is scientific leadership, including the interpretation of scientific discoveries to address pressing issues of our time. Championing the importance of vaccination aligns with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") recommendations for the single best step individuals can take to protect against contracting and spreading COVID-19. According to a [public opinion poll](https://www.cmnh.org/science-news/announcements/scientific-literacy-poll-results) the Museum sponsored this year, the vast majority of Americans trust science and think public understanding of science is necessary. They also cite scientists as the most trusted source of accurate scientific information. \"As representatives of a scientific institution, Museum scientists, researchers, educators, and all our other staff lead by example,\" said Winner. \"The success of our employee vaccination efforts shows that together, we can achieve the high community vaccination rates that are required to help stem the spread of COVID-19.\" In addition to mandating vaccination for employees, the Museum requires that all volunteers show proof of vaccination before registering for shifts. All newly hired employees will also need to show proof of vaccination before their employment begins. In addition, the Museum requires that all guests, employees, and volunteers ages 2 and older wear masks throughout the Museum's galleries and public spaces. The Museum's employee vaccination policy is based on guidance from the CDC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and state and local health agencies, and is designed to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
