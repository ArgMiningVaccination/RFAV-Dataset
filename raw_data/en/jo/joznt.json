Known as Quantum Chelation Therapy or Quantum Holographic Therapy, it supposedly works via a machine known as a BICOM\u00ae 2000. . This is how one](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/biocom-2000.jpg) [proponent's website](http://quantumchelationtherapy.com/The_Therapy.html)describes therapy works: \"The BICOM\u00ae 2000 is a receiver-amplifier-broadcaster. The therapy vial containing the quantum information needed to clear the particular toxic metal from your body is placed in a brass input container which the machine reads, then broadcasts into your 'blood spot'.\" [Practitioners](http://quantumholographichealing.com/Therapy_Vials.html)say a person needs anywhere from six to 10 therapies, each lasting anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. \"The first therapy is always a major balancing therapy which resets your health field, almost like a re-booting, if you will. This resetting is so thorough, so powerful, that you will immediately begin to clear the toxins in your body. If a chemical doesn't support your good health, then your body will eliminate it. Your Quantum Hologram will be re-written, too, so that the toxin will no longer be tolerated.\" Supposedly, this machine is so powerful \"it will reach you anywhere in the world,\" one proponent claims. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to support any of these claims. In fact, chelation therapy itself, which involves a series of intravenous infusions or the ingesting of pills containing disodium EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and various other substances to rid the body of heavy metal toxins, is questionable. Proponents claim that EDTA chelation therapy is effective against a variety of serious health problems such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease and many believe it to be an alternative to coronary bypass surgery, but there is no scientific evidence that this is so. In fact, none of the studies cited in [this report](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chelation.html)found chelation therapy to be effective. Even more interesting is the machine itself, the BICOM 2000, which is also used in bioresonance therapy (which appears to be an earlier version of the updated \"quantum\" variety). The [manufacturer's website](http://www.regumed.com/com.html)makes it quite clear that there is no science behind any of this. \"Just like homeopathy, acupuncture and other methods of complementary therapy, Bicom bioresonance is a form of regulatory medicine. Within complementary medicine, Bicom bioresonance therapy is recognized as an effective tried and tested method. Within conventional medicine, however, Bicom bioresonance has not been subject to scientific research and is, therefore, not yet approved.\" Send your New Age "}
