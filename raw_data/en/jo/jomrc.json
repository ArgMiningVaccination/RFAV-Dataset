Drug combinations or combination therapy could exert improved e fficacy and 38 reduced toxicity through hitting multiple discrete cellular tar gets. 39 Methods 40 We have developed a knowledge graph architecture towards immuno therapy and 41 systematic immunity that consists of herbal drug-target interac tions with a novel 42 scoring system to select drug combinations based on target-hitt ing rates and 43 phenotype relativeness. To this end, we employed this knowledge graph to identify an 44 herbal drug combination for PCM and we subsequently evaluated t he efficacy of the 45 herbal drug combination in clinical trial 46 Results 47 Our clinical data suggests that t he herbal drug combination cou ld significantly reduce 48 the serum level of various inflammatory cytokines, downregulate serum IgA and IgG 49 level, reduce the recurrence rate and reverse the clinical symp toms of PCM patients 50 with improvements of general health status. 51 Conclusions 52 .

We 54 demonstrated that the herbal drug combination holds great promi se as an effective 55 remedy for PCM, acting through the regulation of immunoinflamma tory pathways 56 and improvement of systematic immune level. In particular, the herbal drug 57 combination could significantly reduce the recurrence rate of P CM, a major obstacle 58 for PCM treatment. Our data suggests that the herbal drug combi nation is expected to 59 feature prominently in future PCM treatment. 60 Funding 61 C.

Interestingly, PCM shares similarity 76 with breast cancer in the perspective of macroscopical or micro scopical 77 characteristics3. On the other hand, mounting evidences suggest that the dysreg ulation 78 of immune system is closely associated with the pathogenesis of PCM. Recently, the 79 incidence rate of PCM is quickly rising yet the treatment metho ds for PCM are still 80 rather limited. In clinical practice, surgical resection and ho rmone therapy remains as 81 two major treatments for PCM. Un fortunately, neither surgical r esection nor hormone 82 therapy could prevent recurrence of PCM. Moreover, the serious side effects for 83 h o r m o n e t h e r a p y a r e s t i l l p r o b l e m a t i c4. Therefore, the discovery of effective PCM 84 treatment or therapeutics with minimal side effects is clearly warranted. 85 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a rather long history f or the prevention 86 and treatment of complex diseases in eastern Asia5-7. Moreover, for decades, TCM 87 has been often used as alternative or complementary medicine in t h e w e s t . I n d e e d , 88 Chinese herbal compounds has been successfully applied in the t reatment of plasma 89 cell mastitis (PCM) in conjunction with western medicine8. In clinical practice, TCM 90 refers to herbal entity prescription or formulae (also called a s 'Fangji') which may 91 exhibit coordinating or synergistic effects through the combina tion of multiple herb 92 drugs9. However, the design of formulae in TCM is solely based on the principle of 93 .

In particular, knowledge graph can enable the rational design 99 and identification of combinati on therapies for a specific dise ase or phenotypes11. 100 Recently, we developed and constructed a knowledge graph for th e discovery of 101 herbal drug combination towards immunotherapy and systematic im munity. 102 Subsequently, we identified a synergistic combination of herbal drugs for PCM via a 103 scoring system based on target hitting rates and phenotype rela tiveness. To verify our 104 concept of design, we conducted a clinical trial experiment for the drug combination 105 of herbal compounds mentioned ab ove (ClinicalTrials.gov Registr ation: 106 NCT05530226). Strikingly, our clinical results demonstrated tha t the herbal drug 107 combination identified by knowledge graph can markedly suppress v a r i o u s 108 inflammatory cytokines in serum, restore clinical symptoms and reduce the recurrence 109 rates of PCM patients with improved global health status. 110 Results and Discussion 111 In previous study, we collected and compiled 240 targets for im munotherapy and 112 systematic immunity from literature data12. Recently, we collected 345 entities of 113 herbal drugs documented in TCM books and herbal drugs announced by National 114 .

The existing intricate relationships between the he rbal drugs and 116 immunotherapy targets were also extracted and compiled via adva nced text-mining 117 techniques and manual curation for the construction of knowledg e graph. We defined 118 an ontology list consisting of 13 ontology terms describing the r e l a t i o n s ( e d g e s ) 119 between herbal drug entities and the immunotherapy targets base d on manual curation 120 of literature data ( Supplemental Materials, Edge_ontology_terms ). Moreover, we 121 collected the attributes of the medicinal properties for each h erbal compound from 122 Pharmacopoeia of China13. Totally, we compiled and integrated 64 attributes of the 123 medicinal properties for herbal drug entities into the knowledg e graph ( Supplemental 124 Materials, attributes of the medicinal properties). These medicinal proper ties are 125 useful throughout the design of herbal drug combination. Finall y, we built the 126 knowledge graph via Neo4j and Py2Neo tools which consists of 89 5 nodes and 2197 127 edges ( Figure 1 and Figure supplement 1 ), which can be visited online 128 (http://www.ikgg.org/). 129 Subsequently, we employed a scoring system (or so-called recomm endation 130 system) to asses and predict synergistic herbal drug combinatio n from the knowledge 131 graph. Of note, the scoring function is able to identify those herbal drug combinations 132 that are most related with specific phenotypes as well as herba l drug combinations 133 that are able to hit most discrete cellular targets, yet still following the principle of 134 'syndrome differentiation' as described in Pharmacopoeia of Chi na (Materials and 135 .

To this end, we used this scoring function to select herbal drug 136 combinations consisting of eight herbal entities. We chose to i dentify drug 137 combinations with eight entities because 'formulae' consisting of eight drugs are 138 regarded as 'essence combination' in TCM community. In short, w e employed a 139 combination generator that is able to randomly generate drug co mbinations with eight 140 herbal drug entities for ten rounds, each of which consists of 1,000 random drug 141 combinations. All the generated drug combinations from the ten rounds were further 142 ranked and evaluated. Noteworthy, the scoring results of the te n rounds presented as 143 normal distributions ( Figure 2 ). The top twenty combinations from each round ranked 144 by the scoring function were further curated and inspected by e xperts in TCM. 145 Remarkably, we identified a specific drug combination which was ranked among top 146 twenty choices in all ten rounds o f calculation. The combinatio n consists of eight 147 herbal drug entities including 2 ). 150 Next, we extracted the subgraph for the herbal drug combination mentioned 151 above and created a network diagram for the drug combination vi a Cytoscape tools14 152 (Figure 3 ). In total, the eight herbal drug entities in the combination regulate 46 153 cellular targets related to immunotherapy and systematic immuni ty Figure 3 ).

More over, we conducted 158 pathway analysis for the herbal drug combination for plasma cel l mastitis. 159 Interestingly, we revealed that the herbal drug combination may modulate a few 160 pathways related to systematic immunity including 'Toll-like re 'Innate i mmune system' via 163 reactome knowledgebase15 (Figure 4 and Supplemental Materials ). We believe all 164 these may account for the therapeutic profiles of the herbal dr ug combination towards 165 PCM. 166 Subsequently, we want to evaluate the efficacy of herbal drug c ombination in 167 clinical trial for PCM patients (Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT 05530226). The 'Jun- 168 Chen-Zuo-Shi' was examined for the herbal drug combin ation ('Formulae') 169 by TCM experts and the dosage for each drug entity from the dru g combination was 170 adjusted by TCM experts. The clinical trial is a unrandomized, open label single arm 171 study investigating the efficacy and safety of the herbal drug combination. To reveal 172 the therapeutic effects of TCM drug combination, we selected pa tients who were 173 treated with western medicine in the real world as comparison. Therefore, the two 174 groups of patients were divided into TCM treatment group (exper imental group) and 175 western medicine treatment group (control group). All patients were diagnosed with 176 PCM by biopsy of breast tissue before recruited into the clinic al trial. Patients in the 177 .

Of note, 180 methylprednisolone is a standard corticosteroid for the treatme nt of inflammatory 181 conditions in clinical practice16 and therefore methylprednisolone is used in the CG 182 group. 183 Efficacy was assessed every 2 cycles and the results were summa rized after six 184 months of treatment. The baseline characteristics are shown in Table S1 . Strikingly, 185 our results demonstrated that a few inflammatory cytokines in t he serum including IL- 186 2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN- , IL-1 and TNF- were significantly downregulated in PCM 187 patients after treatment of herbal drug combination as compared to the CG group 188 treated with methylprednisolone ( Figure 5 ). We chose to measure these cytokines in 189 the experiments because they are often regarded as serum cytoki ne markers during the 190 pathogenic development of PCM17. In addition, we found that serum level of IgA and 191 IgG level were markedly suppressed in the treatment group of he rbal drug 192 combination as compared to the control group ( Figure 6 ). Of note, both IgA and IgG 193 have been found to be crucial diagnostic serum markers for PCM patients18. Moreover, 194 IgA is regarded as a major component of mucosal immunity which is closely related 195 to the pathogenesis of PCM19,20. Therefore, our data suggests that the herbal drug 196 combination may enable the regulation of mucosal immunity and c onsequently 197 downregulate IgA and IgG serum level. Furthermore, we conducted t h e s t a n d a r d 198 .

Our 199 results implicated that symptom score, pain score and global he alth status of PCM 200 patients are significantly improved after treatment of the herb al drug combination as 201 compared to the control group ( Figure 7 ). Noteworthy, our results demonstrated that 202 the recurrence rate of PCM patients in the treatment group were reduced to 3.75% as 203 compared to the recurrence rate of 12.5% in the control group ( Table 1 ). Moreover, 204 the incidence rate of adverse events of PCM patients in the tre atment group were 205 reduced to 6.25% as compared to the recurrence rate of 11.25% i n the control group 206 (Table 1 ). In addition, we observed that the clinical symptoms of PCM p atients in the 207 EG group such as swelling, absce ss and fistula were reversed ( Figure 8, Table_S2 in 208 Supplemental File ) after treatment of herbal drug combinations. The clinical 209 symptom score in the EG group is ~4.68 as compared to the clini cal symptom score of 210 ~5.98 in the CG group ( Table 2 ). These results suggest that the herbal drug 211 combination may achieve better efficacy for the treatment of PC M as compared to 212 methylprednisolone. 213 With the increasing amount of biomedical data, the traditional drug discovery 214 campaign has been revolutionized with the aid of artificial int elligence techniques to 215 accelerate the process and reduce the cost21. In recent years, knowledge graph, a 216 technique that can provide structured relations among entities and unstructured 217 semantic relations associated wit h entities, has been introduce d into the domain of 218 drug discovery11. Although the pathogenesis of PCM remains largely unclear, the re 219 .

Herein, f or the first time, we 224 showcase an example that identifies an herbal drug combination via knowledge graph 225 towards PCM. In contrast to using the conventional principle of 'syndrome 226 differentiation', our knowledge graph consisting of intricate r elations between herbal 227 drug entities and immunotherapy targets coupled with scoring fu nctions are able to 228 automatically identify novel herbal drug combinations which can hit most discrete 229 targets, making this strategy unique in the TCM community. Alth ough we 230 acknowledge that the inclusion of chemical ingredients from the herbal drugs may 231 impact the outcome of our analysis and design, unfortunately, t he inclusion of 232 chemical ingredients in the knowledge graph is rather technical ly difficult due to the 233 limited and incomplete datasets for the herbal drugs in the fie ld of TCM. Nevertheless, 234 our strategy captures the prominen t feature of design for drug combinations towards a 235 complex disease such as PCM. In the future, we plan to include multiple types of 236 omics data such as genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metageno mic or 237 metabolomics data into the knowledge graph to reveal novel targ ets and enable novel 238 drug discovery. 239 .

Of note, recurrence has becom e one major obstacle 243 after surgical resection for PCM treatment in clinical practice . O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , 244 hormone therapy may increase the risk of side effects for PCM p atients. Therefore, 245 our approach of herbal drug combination may provide a new avenu e for PCM 246 treatment with less recurrence rate and reduced incidence rate of adverse events. 247 Conclusion 248 In summary, we report the identification and clinical assessme nt of an herbal drug 249 combination towards Plasma cell mastitis (PCM). We demonstrated that the herbal 250 drug combination holds great promise as an effective remedy for PCM, acting through 251 the regulation of immunoinflammatory pathways and improvement o f systematic 252 immune level. In particular, the herbal drug combination could significantly reduce 253 the recurrence rate of PCM, a maj or obstacle for PCM treatment. Our data suggests 254 that the herbal drug combination is expected to feature promine ntly in the future PCM 255 treatment. Moreover, these promising results underscore the pot ential of knowledge 256 graph to identify drug combinations or other novel therapeutics across multiple types 257 of human disorders. 258 Acknowledgments 259 .

These intricate relati ons were subjected to 293 further manual curation. We used thirteen ontology terms (see Supplemental 294 Materials ) to describe the intricate re lations (edges) in the knowledge graph. 295 Moreover, 64 attributes of the medicinal properties for the her bal drug entities were 296 collected and compiled from Pharmacopoeia of China.

Collectively, our scoring system can b e used to select those 338 drug combinations that are most relevant with disease phenotype s and those drug 339 combinations that are able to hit most discrete targets related to immunotherapy. 340 Design of the clinical trial 341 In brief, 160 female patients diagnosed as plasma cell mastitis (PCM) in Shengjing 342 Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University were recruited in the clinical trial 343 between January 2021 to February 2022. Patients were randomly 1 :1 divided into 344 experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). Noteworthy, in order to 345 demonstrate the therapeutic effect of TCM drug combination, we selected patients 346 who were treated with western medicine in the real world during the same period. 347 Therefore, the two groups of patients were divided into TCM tre atment group 348 (experimental group) and western medicine treatment group (cont rol group). There 349 was no significant difference in baseline data such as age, bod y mass index, clinical 350 classification, marriage and child-bearing history between the two groups 351 (Supplemental File, Table_S1 ). Patients in the CG group were orally treated with 352 methylprednisolone tablets, 20mg/ day once a day. The patients in the EG group were 353 orally treated with 20g/bag of herbal drug combination twice a day, once in the 354 morning and once in the evening for 2 months. The herbal drug c ombination was 355 prepared as granules in the form of 358 .

The detailed c linical trial protocol 364 has been provided a separate doc ument in the Supplemental Files n a m e d a s 365 'PCM_Clinical_Protocol'. 366 Measurement of serum inflammato ry CG and EG groups were collected in sterile non-anticoagulant 368 test tube before and after treatment. The immune transmission t urbidimetry was used 369 according to the procedure of CRP kit and automatic biochemical analyzer was used 370 to detect the level of CRP. The levels of serum cytokines were measured by ELISA 371 (Elabscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 372 Measurement of serum immunoglobulin level 373 The venous blood of PCM patients in the two groups were collect ed in sterile non- 374 anticoagulant tube before and after treatment. The serum IgG an d IgA were measured 375 by rate scattering turbidimetry using Array 360 System automati c specific protein 376 analyzer (Beckman Company, USA). 377 Assessment of clinical symptoms of PCM patients 378 .
