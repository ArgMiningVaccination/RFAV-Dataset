Such medical research seeks to find the best treatments for not only our patients but for those seeking care around the world. As described by the National Institutes of Health, \"Clinical trials are research studies performed in people that are aimed at evaluating a medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug or diet or medical device (for example, a pacemaker) is safe and effective in people. Often a clinical trial is used to learn if a new treatment is more effective and/or has less harmful side effects than the standard treatment.\" While we support the advancement of science, the safety and privacy of our patients is paramount, and we make these promises to you: You are never required to participate in any study. You will never be asked to participate in a study without first having an in-depth discussion about the risks, benefits, and goals of the study. You will get the same high-quality care if you decide to participate in a study or not. Your identity and private health information will NEVER be disclosed unless you specifically agree to doing so (for example, if you wish to be part of a news report about a treatment or study).
