Detox diets\u2014sometimes known as 'cleanses' or 'flushes'\u2014are a popular and promising way of doing just that. Biologically speaking, our body already comes equipped with several systems to detox, thanks to three critical organs: The Liver - The first line of defence against toxins, your liver acts like a filter to prevent toxic substances contained in foods from passing into your bloodstream. Maintaining healthy liver function is essential for overall health and wellbeing1. The Colon - This organ has bacteria that produce both healthy and unhealthy chemicals. You need to keep your colon moving regularly since its main role is to flush out toxic chemicals before they can do you any harm. The Kidneys - The kidneys are constantly filtering your blood and getting rid of toxins in the form of urine. From the TCM perspective, healthy kidneys can help nurture reproductive organs, promote strong and healthy bones, and support nourished, beautiful hair2. Natural detoxing might prove too much for our bodies due to our daily habits such as consumption of junk food and sweetened drinks. Compound that with today's sedentary and stressful lifestyles and it would seem that we are inviting physiological mayhem if we rely on natural but slow detoxification processes. This view isn't confined to the 'Western' way of thinking. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Physician Chen Yan Fang, from the Eu Yan Sang TCM Wellness clinic located at Royal Square @ Novena, believes that this is the reason why people nowadays are unhealthier. \"People are eating too much processed foods, not achieving work-life balance and facing computers all the time,\" she explains. \"Living in a heavily polluted environment will also cause toxins to increase.\" Physician Chen points out that once our body's natural detox channels weaken, it is important to revitalise them via external forces. TCM believes that the best way to detox is through sweating, vomiting, heat clearing and nourishing one's vitality. She emphasises that TCM herbs used for this function will not overly burden one's body, and advises people who take over-the-counter products to be wary as they could contain ingredients that do more harm than good. Some common foods and herbs that are good for detox includes: Practised for centuries by many cultures around the world\u2014including ayurvedic medicine and TCM\u2014detoxification is about resting, cleaning and nourishing the body inside out.
