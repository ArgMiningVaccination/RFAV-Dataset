(Feb. 7, 2022) - Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota (BCBSND) has recognized Sanford Medical Center with a Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants designation for kidney transplants. The new kidney transplants designations for Adult Deceased Donor Kidney, Adult Living Donor Kidney, and Pediatric Kidney are a result of expansion of the Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants program by Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) to include higher quality kidney transplant services within the BCBS network. To receive a Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants designation for kidney transplants, a health care facility must demonstrate success in meeting nationally established, objective quality measures along with delivering higher quality transplant services in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) network. Quality measures used in the evaluation are publicly reported by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). All Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants facilities must be fully accredited by a national accrediting organization, meet the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) certification requirements, and adhere to transplant guidelines from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Sanford Medical Center is proud to be recognized by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota for meeting the rigorous Blue Distinction Center quality selection criteria for transplant centers set by the Blue Distinction Specialty Care program for the following new kidney transplant designations: - Adult Deceased Donor Kidney - Adult Living Donor Kidney \"I'm proud of the work our care team does every day to improve our patient's quality of life,\" said Mike Salwei, executive director of transplant services for the Bismarck region of Sanford Health. \"Our team of nephrologists and transplant surgeons work to manage chronic kidney diseases from early detection and diagnosis to advanced treatment including dialysis and organ transplants to help shorten recovery times and reduce the risk of complications.\" According to the National Kidney Foundation, kidney diseases such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are the ninth leading cause of death in America, [impacting nearly 37 million Americans](https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/KidneyDiseaseBasics).

For details on a provider's in-network status or your own policy's coverage, contact your Local Blue Plan and ask your provider before making an appointment.
