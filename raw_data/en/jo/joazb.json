Updated on November 1, 2022 After decades of obscurity in the United States, [measles](https://www.sharecare.com/infections/what-you-should-know-about-measles)\u2014the viral disease known for its spreading red rash and high fever\u2014has re-emerged over the years as a potential threat. In 2000, the U.S. declared measles to be eliminated. Yet, in 2014 there were 667 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cases then spiked to 1,274 in 2019 before dropping sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early Symptoms Are Flu-Like [Measles symptoms](https://www.sharecare.com/infections/is-getting-measles-really-big-deal) can first mimic those of a bad cold or a nasty flu. The signs come in stages, starting off with a high fever, runny nose, watery eyes, cough, and sore throat. Tiny white spots may also pop up inside the mouth within two to three days. Three to five days after symptoms first appear, a non-itchy red rash forms at the hairline and can spread all over the body. It Is Alarmingly Contagious An infected person can pass the virus through the air, usually by coughing or sneezing. Even worse: The virus can stay in the air or on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours. If you breathe that air or touch an affected surface and then touch your nose or mouth, you risk becoming infected, even long after the infected person has left the area. No Treatment Exists With plenty of rest and hydration, symptoms should subside within a week or two. Your healthcare provider (HCP) may suggest ways to ease symptoms, such as using a humidifier for a cough or taking ibuprofen for a fever. If your child is infected, keep them away from other children to avoid spreading the disease. Contact an HCP if symptoms don't improve or seem to worsen. Watch for symptoms such as ear pain, pulling at the ear, and sleep troubles, since about 1 in 10 children with measles also develop ear infections. Shortness of breath, chest pain, or a cough with sputum may be signs of pneumonia. Adults Are At Risk While measles is most commonly known for affecting kids, adults are susceptible, too. Complications for adults can be severe, especially for people over age 20, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant people. In pregnancy cases, the disease may contribute to higher chances of early labor, miscarriage, and low birth weight. You Can Protect Yourself Measles is a one-time disease. In other words, if you've already had it, you won't contract it again. But for those people who haven't previously had the infection, [vaccination against measles](https://www.sharecare.com/infections/measles-vaccination-cheat-sheet) is crucial. All children should receive two rounds of the [measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine](https://www.sharecare.com/child-development/vaccinations/childhood-vaccination-checklist) by age six. Adults who aren't immune should get at least one round of the shot. Vaccination is vital to put an end to the spread of the disease. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
