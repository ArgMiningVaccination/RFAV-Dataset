This letter covers b oth an outline of planned changes to the national immunisati on programme and details of the specific pro gramme for rotavirus for babies at two and three months. It is the first in a new series of joint le tters on public health is sues from NHS En gland, Public Health England and the De partment of Health, replac ing the former series of letters from the Chief Medical Officer. The national immunisation programme in 2013-14 A number of changes to the national immunisation programme are being made during 2013-14 to reflect the planned and phased impl ementation of a series of recommendations by the J oint Committee on Vaccin ation and Immunisation (JCVI) to the overall level of prot ection against preventable diseases. A table providing the full details of these changes is at Annex A but, in summary they are as follows: 2 Meningitis C: From June 2013, changes to the current schedule for administer ing the MenC conju gate vaccine. The second priming dose currently given at four months will be re placed by a booster dose given in adoles cence. The init ial ch ange will be to c ease giving the four month dose from 1 June 2013. Rotavirus: From July 2013, the introduction into the childhood immunisati on sche dule of a vaccine to protect babies against rot avirus. Shingle s: From September 2013, the introduction of a shingles vaccine for people a ged 70 years (routine cohort) and 79 years (catc h-up cohort) to protect against herpes zoster. Childhood Flu: The existing flu immunisation programme will be extended over a n umber of years to incl ude all children aged two to 16 inc lusive. In autumn 2013, immunisation will be offered to a limit ed age range of pre- school -aged children. Full det ails will be given in the annual flu immunisati on letter. These planned changes have the support of the D epartment of Health's Chi ef Medical Officer, Chief Phar maceutical Officer and Director of Nurs ing. We will be writing to you separately about the chan ges in England in relation to MenC, s hingles and childhood flu prior to their implementation. Further detail about the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine is contained in this let ter. The introduction of rotavirus vaccination for babies at two and three months Rota virus is a very common and potentially serious large bowel infection of young babie s. The new vaccine will be inclu ded in the programme from 1 July 2013. The vaccine should be offered routinely to all babies at the age of two months and again at three months (that is, two doses, four weeks apart) when t hey attend for their first and second routine childhood imm unisatio ns. Detai led clinical guidance for healthcare professionals is set out in Annex B to this letter. A new chapter on rotavirus, inclu ding clinical advice and information about the vaccin e, has been inc luded in Immunisation again st infectious disease (the Green Book ), and is available to read at: New chapter for Rotavirus JCVI's statement about rotavirus and vaccine is available at: JCVI Rotavirus Statement 3 Responsibil ity for the national immunisation programme has changed from 1 April 2013.

This guidance is ba sed on advice from t he Joint Committee on Vacc ination and Immunisati on (JCVI)1, the UK's in dependent panel of immunisation experts. Full guidance can be found in the new chapter on rotavirus now included in Immunisation again st infe ctious disease ('the Green Book')2 at following generic link: New chapter for Rotavirus Backgrou nd to the introduction of ro tavirus vaccine 2. Nearly all children will have at least one episode of rotavirus gastro enteritis before reaching five years of age. An estimated 130,000 children with rotavirus gastro enteritis will visit their GP a nd approximately 12,700 children will be hospi talised in England and Wales every year. Alth ough deaths from rotavirus in the UK are rare and are difficult to quantify accurately, there may be up to three to four a year. Rot avirus inf ection in children leads to severe diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps, dehydration and mild fever and are likely to last approximately three to eight days. 3. In the UK there are several ci rculating strains of rotavirus, with G1P[ 8] the most abundant type, a lthough distribution of the strains changes over time. Rota virus is highly contagious and transmission by the faecal-oral r oute is most frequent, although respiratory trans mission may also oc cur. Although good hygiene measures c an help prevent spread of the disease, for example pr oper hand washing after going to the toilet or after nappy changing, the robustness of rotavirus and the low minimal infectious dose of 10 - 100 virus particles, re nders rotavirus re adily transmissible and makes st andard sanitary halt tr ansmission of the vely ineffecti ve. 4. Rota virus inf ection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter a nd early spring (January to Ma rch). People of any age can be infected by rotavirus but most infecti ons occur in infants and children between one month and four years of age. Infections are often recurrent, and many children experience infection on one or more occasio ns by three years of age. Infection in newborns is c ommon but tends to be either mild or asymptomatic because of prot ection by circulating maternal antibodies. Once someone has had a rotavirus in fection they usually develop immunity although it may be short l ived. 5. JCVI advised in 2009 that the lic ensed rotavirus vaccin es would ha ve a significant impact on reducing gastro enteritis in young children, and that the UK health departments s hould i ntroduce the vaccines if they could be procured at a cost 1 JCVI statement: JCVI advice on Rotavirus 2 The rotavirus chapter can be found at: \"The Green Book\" reference 6 effective price. This advice was reiterat ed in 2011 following consideration of a further cost-effectiveness st udy. 6. In England, the NHS Constit ution obliges health ministers to intr oduce new national vaccin ation programmes recommended by JCVI that are cost effecti ve. As we are now able to procure a rotavirus vaccine at a cost effecti ve price, the vaccine is to be added to the UK's chi ldhood immunisation programme. 7. Rota virus vaccin es, including the Rotarix\u00ae vaccine which will be used in the UK, are already used to routinely vaccin ate children in the US and many other countries. In the US, studies have shown that rotavirus-related hospital admissions for young children have been cut by more than two thirds since rotavirus vaccin ation was intro duced. 8. The rotavirus immunisation in the UK will prevent a si gnificant number of young infants from developing this infection. A published study3 estimated that vaccin ating a birth cohort of infants in England and Wales may prevent aro und 90,000 infections, about 10,000 hospital isations and around two deaths due to rotavirus in t hat cohort over the first five years of life. It may also provide some additional prot ection to the wider population through herd immunity. Timing 9. The vaccine will be inclu ded in the childhood immunisation programme from 1 July 2013. All children scheduled to receive their primary vaccin es at ages two and three months should be offered the vaccin e, that is, two doses, four weeks apart. Recommendations for use of t he rotavirus vaccine (R otarix\u00ae) Administration 10. Rotar ix\u00ae vaccine is given orally. It must not be in jected. 11. If the infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccin e, a single rep lacement dose may be given at the same vaccin ation visit. There are no re strictions on an infant's consumption of food or drink before or after vaccin ation. 12. Full guidance on the administr ation technique is inclu ded in the relevant chap ter of the Green Book. Dosage Infants aged six w eeks to under 15 weeks 13. The minimum a ge for the first dose of Rotarix\u00ae is six weeks 0 days, the maximum age for dose one is 14 weeks and six days. Infants aged 15 weeks to under 24 weeks 14. Vaccin ation with Rot arix\u00ae should not be initiated for infants a ged 15 weeks and 0 days or older. Infants who have rec eived their first dose of vaccine under 15 3 Jit M, Edmunds WJ. Evaluating rotavirus vaccination in England and Wales. Part II. The potential cost- effectiveness of vaccination. Vacci ne. 2007 May 16;25(20):3971-9. Epub 2007 Mar 13. 7 weeks and 0 days of age can receive their second dose of Rotar ix\u00ae, which must be given with a minimum inter val of four weeks and by 23 weeks and six days of age. Infants aged 24 weeks or older 15. Rotar ix\u00ae vaccine should not be given to an infant who is 24 weeks and 0 days of age or older. 16. It is preferable that the full course of two doses of Rotarix\u00ae be completed before 16 weeks of age, allowing at least four weeks between the first and second dose. Infants older than 15 weeks of age, who have not received a first dose of vaccin e, shou ld not be offered Ro tarix\u00ae. Infants who rec eive the first dose before week 15 should complete the course by 24 weeks of age. If the course is interrupted, it should be res umed but not re peated, in line with the restrictions on timings above. Contraindi cations 17. There are very few infants who cannot receive rota virus vaccin e. Where there is do ubt, appropriate advice should be sought from an immunisation coordin ator or consul tant in health protection rather than withholding vaccin ation. 18. Rotar ix\u00ae should not be given to: infants with a confirmed anaphylactic rea ction to a previous dose of rotavirus vaccin e; infants with a confirmed anaphylactic rea ction to any components of the vaccin e; infants with a previous history of intussusce ption; infants over 24 weeks of age; vere Co mbined Immunodeficiency (SCID) infants who have malformation of the gastro intestinal tract that could predisp ose them to intussusc eption; infants with rare hereditary ms of e, glucose- galactose or sucrase-isomaltase ins ufficiency. 19. Administration of rotavirus vaccine should be postponed in infants: suffering from acute severe febrile illness; suffering from acute diarrhoea or vomiting. This is to make sure that the vaccine is not regurgitated or passed through the intestines too quickly, which could r educe the effectiveness of the vaccin e. 20. Other minor illnesses without fever or s ystemic up set are not valid reasons to postpone immunisati on. Immunosuppression and HIV infection 21. Rota virus vaccine should not be administer ed to infants k nown to have severe combined i mmunodeficiency (SCID ). There is a lack of safety and efficacy data on the administrati on of rotavirus vaccine to infants with other immunosuppressi ve disorders. Given the high risk of e xposure to natural rotavirus, ho wever, the benefits of administr ation is lik ely to outweigh any theoretical risks and therefore should be actively considered, if neces sary in collabora tion with the clinici an dealing with child's underlying conditio n. 8 22. However, the safety profile between Ro tarix\u00ae and placebo is s imilar in infants with HIV inf ection and therefore vaccin ation is supported in HIV infected infants. Additi onally, infants with unknown HIV s tatus, but born to HIV positive mothers, should be offered vaccination. 23. There is a potential for transmission of live attenuated vaccine in Rotarix\u00ae from the infant to severely immunocompromised contacts through faecal m aterial for at least 14 days. However, vaccin ation of the infant will offer protection to household contacts from wild-type rotavirus disease and outweigh any risk from transmission of vaccine virus to any immunocompromised close contacts. Those in close contact with recently vaccin ated infants should observe good personal h ygiene. Concomitant administration with other vacc ines 24. Rota virus vaccine can be given at the same time as the other vaccines administered as part of the routine childhood immunisation programm e, including BCG, a nd so should ideally be given at the scheduled two month and three month vaccin ation visits (see above). Rotavirus and BCG c an be given at any time before or after each other. Consent 25. See C hapter Two of Immunisation against infectious disease ('the Green Book') \"The Green Book\" - Chapter Two Pharm acy issues Vaccine brand name and manufacturer 26. Rotar ix\u00ae - manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. Presen tation 27. Rotar is s upplied as an oral suspension in pre-filled oral applicator. 28. The vaccine is presented as a clear, col ourless liquid, free of visible partic les, for oral administrati on. 29. The vaccine is ready to use (no reconsti tution or dilut ion is re quired). 30. The vaccine is to be administered orally without mixing with any other vaccin es or soluti ons. 31. The vaccine should be inspec ted visually for any foreign particul ate matter and/or abnormal physical a ppearance. In the event of either being observed, discard the vaccin e. 32. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accord ance with local requirements. Vaccine supply (including ImmForm registratio n) 9 33. The rotavirus vaccine should be order ed online via the ImmForm website (www.immform.dh.gov.uk) and is distributed by Movianto UK (Tel: 01234 248631) as part of the national chi ldhood immunisat ion programme. 34. Centrally purchas ed vaccin es for the national immunisation programme for the NHS can only be ordered via Im mForm and are provided free of charge to NHS organisations. The vaccine will be available to order from June. Vaccines for private prescr iptions, occupational health use or travel are N OT pro vided free of charge and should be order ed from the manufacturers. Furt her information about ImmForm is available at ImmForm Helpsheet from at helpdesk@immform.org.uk or 0844 376 0040. 35. For further information about vaccin es available via ImmForm, please see ImmForm Helpsheet 13 (ImmForm Helpsheet) Storage 36. Vaccin es should be stored in the original packaging at +2C to +8C and protected from light. All vaccin es may be sensitive to s ome extent to heat and cold. Do not freeze. Freezing may cause inc reased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccin es. It can also c ause hairline cr acks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents. 37. The vaccine should be used immed iately after opening. Vaccine stock management 38. Please ensure s ufficient fridge space is available for the new vaccine. Each site holding vaccine is asked to review current st ocks of all vaccin es. Two to four weeks of stock is re commended, and higher stock levels shou ld be reduc ed to this level. A review of available fridge space will be necessary to ensure adequate storage capacity at the start of the programme. 39. Effective ma nagement of vaccin es throughout the supply chain is e ssential to reduce vaccine wastage. Local protocols sh ould be in place to reduce vaccine wastage to a minimum. Even small percen tage reductions in vaccine wastage will have a major impact on the financing of vaccine supplies. 40. Any cold cha in failures must be documented and r eported to the local immunisati on co-ordinator and PHE/ ImmForm as appropr eactio 41. Suspe cted adverse r eactions (ADR) to vaccin es should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme (www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard). Ch apter Nine of the Green Book gives detailed guidance which AD Rs to report and how to do so. Additionally, Chapter Eight of the Green Book provides detailed advice on managing ADRs following immunisat ion. 42. Any reported adverse incidents, errors or events during or post vaccination must follow determined procedures. In addition teams must keep a local log of reports and discuss s uch events with the local immunisati on co-ordin ator. 10 a naturally-occur ring conditio n, with a background annual incidence of around 120 cases per 100,000 children aged under one year (ref: WHO Intussusception information 44. Research from some countries4,5 suggests that Rotarix may be associated with a very small increased risk of intussusc eption, possibly 2 cases per 100,000 first doses given, a nd the Rotarix prescr ibing information incl udes this as a possible si de effect. Even with this small potential risk, the benefits of vaccin ation in pre venting the conse quences of rotavirus inf ection outweigh any possible si de effects. Surveil lance 45. The programme will be c arefully monitored by Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Health care products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Person al Child H ealth Re cord ( the \"Red Bo ok\") 46. Arrangements have been made for the Red Book reco rd of childhood vaccin ations to be amended to reflect the changes to the childhood sche dule, including rotavirus vaccin ation. It is important that information about vaccin ations given are recor ded in the R ed Book, when it is available. Further information on the details to be rec orded is given in Ch apter Four of the Green Book. Patient Group Dir ections 47. The usual method for the supply and administration of vaccin es in the routine childhood immunisat ion programme is via a Patie nt Specific Direction (PSD ). The authorisation for this is usual ly the re sponsibil ity of the GP or an independent nurse prescr iber at the six to eight-week c heck and is record ed as an in struction in the Perso nal Child He alth Record (PC HR or Red Book ). This agreement allows immunisati ons to be given in GP s urgeries or clinics. Where a PSD exists, t here is no need for a PGD. 48. There are no plans to issue a national Patient Group Di rection template for rotavirus vaccin ation as PSDs are the usual delivery method for childhood immunisati ons. Vaccine upta ke data collection 49. Monthly automated surveys from GP systems will run from the start of the programme (1 July 2013) so that July data (1/7/13 to 31/7/13 inclus ive) will be collected in early August 2 013 on ImmForm. A review w ill be conducted in March 2015 on continuing this senti nel col lection. As a GP based collection, there s hould be little disruption caused by the new organisatio nal struct ures that formally come into place in April 2013. The automated collection allows the collection of monthly 4 Intussusception risk and health benefits of rotavirus vaccination in Mexico and Brazil.

A scope for a temporary ImmForm uptake data collection is attached at Annex C. Clearance from the review of central re turns (ROCR) has been applied for. 51. This data collection will run in paral lel with the routine quarterly and annual COVER d ata collections which w ill evaluate rotavirus vaccine coverage for children at 12 months of age. Child Health Inf ormation Systems 52. NHS England will be responsible for the commissioning of Child H ealth Information Systems (CHIS) and associa ted Child He alth Records Department activities. Infants will be c alled for their immunisation against r otavirus at the same time as for their other immunisations offered at two and three months, via the local CHIS or their GP s urgery (whichever is the usual met hod of call/ recall used in the area). 53. The provider must ensure that information on vaccin es administered is documented in the general practice record. 54. The provider must ensure that information on vaccin es administered is submitted directly to any relevant po pulation immunisati on register, in most areas the CHIS. 55. Follo wing an immunisation s ession/clinic or individual im munisat ion, local arrangements should be ma de for the timely transfer of data onto the relevant C HIS. Where possible this should aim to be within two working days. 56. Arrangements will also be re quired to inform neighbour ing areas when children resi dent in their area are immunised outside their local ar ea throu gh the CHIS system. Funding and ser vice arrangements 57. Changes confirmed to the GP contract for 2013/14 intr oduce a new item of service fee of \u00a37.63 for a completed course of rotavirus vaccine for infants. The Statement of Financial Entitl ements published 28 March contains the provisions (Section 12) on eligibility for payment to GMS contrac tors to commence from 1 July 2013. NHS England will be working to agree equivalent arrangements with PMS and APMS contractors who provide childhood immunisation services. NHS England intends to support the calculation of payments for rotavirus vaccin ation using the new Calculating Qual ity Reporting Service (CQRS) wherever possible to minimise the reporting requirements for GP practices. Further guidance on the GP contract chan ges and role of CQRS was published by NHS Employers on 2 April 2013. Communi cations and information for par ents and he alth pro fessionals 58. Information flyers a nd leaflets for parents have been pro duced to support the introduct ion of the vaccine. These will be available from the Publications Order line in the usual way. The existing immunisati on informati on booklets will be amended to 12 bring them into line with the new schedule. In addition to the new Green Book chap ter, there will be a Q&A factsheet for health professionals. 59.

Aim 1. To automatical ly collect monthly uptake data from sentinel GP practices ( i.e. GP practices that have automated data extraction facilities) to: - regularly monitor the progress of t he vaccin ation programme by Department of Health (D H), NHS England and Public Health England (PHE ); - support asses sment by DH, NHS England and PHE of the delivery of the programme; - potentially ident ify areas where c overage of first or sec ond dose is low, - provide epidemiological data to allow assess ment of the impact of the programme; - provide data for vaccine safety assessmen t; - provide information to the public and ministers. Data to be collected 2. Data will be c ollected on the following: - Denominator: the number of infants in a GP practice who, in the survey month, reach 25 weeks of age; - Numerators: number of infants in the denominator who rec eived a) a first dose and b) a second dose of Rotarix\u00ae from six weeks of age up to 24 weeks of age, including vaccin ations given by other healthcare providers. 3. Denominator and numerator data will allow uptake rates to be calculated. The count of doses given wi ll help in validating GP payments and help in vaccine supply and efficiency analysis. The possibil ity of including denominator and numerators (dose one and dose t wo), brok en down by gender and ethnicity will also be explored with suppliers. 4. Monthly automated surveys will run from the start of the programme (1 July 2013), so that July data (1/7/13 to 31/7/13 inclusi ve) will be collected in early August 20 13. A review w ill be conducted in March 2015 on continuing the sentinel collection. As a GP practice-based collection, there s hould be little disruption caused by new organisatio nal struct ures that formally come into place in April 2013. The automated collection allows us to collect monthly data with minimal or no burden to the NHS a nd giving quick and t imely uptake figures. This data collection will run in parallel to a propo sed CO VER data collectio n. 5. Data will be extracted automatical ly for each mo nthly survey as follows: 14 Survey Month Data from Date (inclusi ve) Data to Date (inclusi ve) August 2013 01 July 2013 31 July 2013 September 2013 01 August 2013 30 August 2013 Octo ber 2013 01 September 2012 31 September 2012 November 2013 01 De cember 2012 30 De cember 2012 etc Etc etc NOTES 1. All surveys are from the start of the calendar mon th (inclusive) 2. Each survey incl udes data up un til the su rvey mon th end (inclus ive) 6. Collecting these data will allow monthly assessment of rotavirus immunisation coverage. 7. The source of data will be automated collections from GP practices to ImmForm and will be s entinel i .e. data will only be collected from practices with automated data extraction facilities. Data from GP practices included within t he sentinel scheme can be aggregated by NHS England structures (Clinical Com missioning Groups (CCGs) and Area Teams (ATs)), through the ImmForm website, to: - see c overage rates at local, re gional and national le vels; - compare uptake with other anonymous CCGs and ATs; - view data and export data into Excel, for further analysis. 8. The survey will comprise of: - Monthly data collections from the start of the programme (July 2013) to provide complete data at the GP level. These data will allow DH, NHS England and PHE to assess t he progress of the vaccin ation programme. End of the Sur vey 9. The continuation of the sentinel collection will be reviewed in March 2015.
