Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) supports Access: Timely by routine monitoring of provider network adequacy, including time and distance standards and timely appointment access. PCS m onitors timely access and network adequacy in two main ways: Provider Network Reporting Analysts run reports of time and distance standards each month and assess network gaps; and Access to Care Analysts collect and analyze provider timely access data usin g access and availability surveys, which are mailed monthly and emailed weekly. Surveys include provider questions related to Behavioral Health (BH) Care Services, including whether the provider maintains a waitlist, if/when they have available appointment s, and whether they can provide timely access according to the standards outlined in OAR 410 - 141-3515. PCS reviews network adequacy and timely access reports, including survey results, monthly at a standing Oregon Access to Care Steering Committee meeting . Many internal departments send staff to this meeting, including Provider Network Contracting, Analysis, Access, and Service, Care Management, Utilization Management, Population Health, Community Strategy, and Behavioral Health. If the Committee identifie s compliance gaps, it will develop a mitigation strategy, including Provider Network Service (PNS) reaching out to the provider to learn more about the identified issue and PNS issuing a provider corrective action plan. Alternatively, the Committee refers the time and distance issues to the Network Adequacy subcommittee for resolution, which could include pursuing new provider contracts. In 2021, provider survey data revealed compliance issues concerning timely access standards. In reaching out to those providers who reported timely access non -compliance, PNS learned that most issues resulted from misunderstanding the standard, and they could help the providers resolve through coaching. In some cases, providers shared they had lost staff or their business w as affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, and until visits and staffing levels returned to normal, they would struggle to make changes. Importantly, the weekly BH email survey, introduced in April 2021, revealed that many providers routinely maintain waitlists , while other providers had routine appointment openings for prioritized populations, including members with Serious and Persistent Mental Illness (SPMI) . As demonstrated in the graph below, between June and December 2021, the total reported BH appointmen t availability often exceeded BH waitlisted member counts based on aggregated provider survey data. PCS interpreted these gaps as an important opportunity to move members off waitlists to open appointments to ensure members receive timely access to care. T herefore, PCS developed a pilot navigation program in one of its CCO regions, including member navigation to specialty BH care for SPMI. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 4 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 In September 2021, PCS initiated a small pilot effort in the PCS - Marion & Polk (MP) region focused on providing members with access to BH. PCS launched the following process to identify member appointment navigation needs and help them access open appoin tments. The PCS Access to Care Team created an internal tracking document and workflow to share waitlist and appointment availability data with the Care Management (CM) Team. This process includes the Access to Care Analysts uploading BH appointment availa bility data weekly, including specialty care options, on a shared internal website accessible to the CM Team. When members call PCS - MP, Member Support Specialists (MSS) on the CM Team complete a brief screening to collect information on priority populati on status, identify a member's desired outcomes for the call, assess for suicidal thoughts or crisis needs, and active substance use issues. The MSS Team then works to link members to in -network providers and assist with timely and appropriate connections to needed services based on appointment availability data. The MSS Team also addresses access to care barriers during the screenings (i.e., transportation). While the MSS Team assists all members with access, they focus on serving priority populations, inc luding: Veterans and their families Persons identified as HIV+, having AIDS, or Tuberculosis (TB) Pregnant members and women with children Children ages zero -to-five at risk of maltreatment Intellectual or Developmental Disability (I/DD) identified me mbers Those experiencing suspected psychosis Members with substance use disorders, including those with alcohol, opioid, or IV drug use Members identified as in -crisis, including those experiencing suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or recent propert y damage Members flagged as SPMI PCS CM Team routinely reaches out to members identified as having SPMI following referrals by members or providers, post -inpatient stays, emergency department visits in which behavioral health was a primary diagnosis, or when analytics indicate need (i.e., readmission within 30 days). Identification of members who meet the criteria for SPMI is readily available. As of Q3 2021, the number of members (including children and adults) who meet the criteria for SPMI was 1,028 members within the PCS - Columbia Gor ge (CG) CCO. 020406080100 June July August September October November DecemberNumber of members/appointments2021PCS -Columbia Gorge CCO Available Appointments vs Waitlist June -December 2021 TOTAL Available Appts WaitlistOHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 5 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 This pilot could not tackle waitlisted members; however, it created the foundation for 2022 project expansions into all PCS CCO regions. D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report. The Oregon Health Authority and OAR 309 -019-0225(24)(a -f) identify the following conditions as meeting the diagnostic criteria of SPMI: schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders limited to obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) , post-traumatic stress disorder, schizotypal personality disorders, and borderline personality disorder. People living with SPMI conditions are at greater risk of adverse biopsychosocial and health outcomes , including increased risk of incarceration ; increased use of tobacco, alcohol , and other recrea tional drugs in comparison to the general population ; shorter life expectancy ; and increased inciden ce of homelessness.1 People with SPMI are houseless population , representing an estimated 14% of the total house less population in Oregon in 2017.2 Additionally, access and routine care are more complex for those living with SPMI as these individuals often grapple with other health -related issues that can be left untreated. They often experience challenges in locating community p roviders. Additional burdens that members with SPMI face include treatment within primary care settings by primary care physicians (PCPs) with less knowledge, comfort, and experience in treating severe mental illness. Mongelli et al. note, \"u p to 60% of pa tients with a psychiatric disorder are currently only seen by PCPs. Unfortunately, frequently, PCPs fail to recognize psychiatric disorders, and only 13% of the mental health care delivered is considered to be 'minimally adequate.' The reasons reported are over - or under prescribed psychotropic medications, rarely being provided structured counseling, and infrequent referral of patients for mental health services .\"3 However, in the navigation pilot with PCS - MP CCO, PCS limited the process to members who called PCS seeking assistance or SPMI Emergency Department (ED) follow -up calls. These limitations were due to internal resource needs . PCS requires additional staff and tracking processes to expand opportunities to educate providers that they can directly contact PCS members when a member needs timely access , and the provider cannot accommodate them due to scheduling challenges. The pilot effort within PCS - MP resulted in 200 members screened and connected to services. Of this population, 27 members identified feeling suicidal thoughts within two weeks prior to calling, 72 identifi ed as calling for themselves (though this data set is incomplete), and 16 members identified substance use issues with oral and inhalants being the primary means of use. Prioritized groups included : Seven members identified as women with children Three mem bers identified as I/DD Two members with suspected psychosis One member identified as a veteran Preliminary data also shows 89.5 % of members that PCS supported via this Pilot were connected to services the same day or within one business day. Although th e initial data is promising, the current data sets did not capture children ages zero to five, members with SDOH needs, and members with SPMI specifically. Additionally, data is specific to PCS - MP only, and we did not collec t this information for the oth er PCS regions due to resource limitations. This data, albeit limited, demonstrated the beneficial impact targeted supports ha ve for those members seeking timely access to BH 1 Francesca Mongelli , M.D., Penelope Georgakopoulos, Dr.P.H., Michele T. Pato, M.D., \"Challenges and Opportunities to meet the Mental Health Needs of Underserved and Disenfranchised Populations in the United States,\" Focus 18, no. 4 (2020), 16 -24, accessed January 17, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.focus.20190028 . 2 Megan Bolton, \"2017 Point -in-Time estimates of Homelessness in Oregon,\" Oregon Housing Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 6 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 services. Due to the success of this pilot, PCS intends to expand this effort to all of PCS CCO regions led by a new team tentatively called the BH Access Team. To mitigate member access limitations, PCS is adding specific full -time equivalent (FTE) positions as part of the new BH Access Team to allow a team of MSS to: Work with provi ders who indicate they maintain waitlists to assist members in quickly accessing available appointments within time and distance standards. Provide proactive outreach to members placed on waitlists by community providers, and assist with immediate access to services, pending members' willingness. Engage OAR identified prioritized populations, including members with SPMI, to ensure timely access to services. Support the Utilization Management teams in accessing support for members denied services with out -of- network providers when comparable providers or services are available within the CCO service area. Additionally, t he new BH Access Team will allow PCS to scale and implement a screening tool to identify exact services members need to ensure timely navigation to the services required. This effort will create an immediate access point for this population that does not exist with in current PCS workflo ws. The screening tool will identify members with SDOH concerns. When members identify a n SDOH need, the BH Access to Care T eam will initiate an Intensive Care Coordination ( ICC) screening for members not currently open to CM servic es. Screening results will funnel members to the appropriat e team for outreach, ensuring PCS address their needs. Inevitably, PCS will identify members with potential BH needs who express ambivalence or reticence to engage with services. In these instances, the BH Acces s Team will refer members to CM for long -term services and assist in connect ing members back to the ir PCP to explore potential recommendations for support (e.g. , referral to a Behavioral Health Consultant , Traditional Health Worker, or peer -based services ). This effort aims to provide members with collaborative care within an integrated setting. In all instances, the BH Access Team will support members' rights of self -determination and patient -centeredness by honoring and respecting how members choose to re ceive care . Additionally, the team will utilize motivational enhancement practices for those expressing ambivalence to care and treatment. As the access work evolves, PCS intend s to test our learnings and assumptions about barriers and engagement with thi s population , such as members' willingness to engage . Data collection will help identify the primary needs of our community and the prioritized populations not readily seeking care. The work of the BH Access Team will help inform our engagement and outreach processes and identify best practices in meeting the needs of our membership. PCS hopes to expand this effort in the future by offering support to providers who identify members needing BH services including PCP, specialists, or other BH providers within the community. E. Brief narrative description : PCS will continue to survey providers to identify the number of members on BH provider waitlists, as well as the number of available appointments. The weekly BH emailed surveys collect vital appointment availability data, and PCS will utilize this information to identify and expand navigation opportunities. Access to Care Analysts will post the weekly survey data on an internal website, which the CM Team will use to identify providers holding waitlists for outreach. PCS CM Team will hire a team of four MSS covering all PCS CCO regions to provide outreach to members and providers. PCS will also add a new CM Clinician Team Lead responsible for overseeing the new team and developing tracking systems and workflows to ensure members with SPMI timely access to appointments. Member navigation will include the follow ing components to expand timely access support for members with SPMI: OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 7 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 Educat e providers t o direct members to the new BH Access to Care Team if they cannot schedule an appointment aligned with timely access standards, including for S PMI populations. o Upon hire and training of the team, PCS will send an email to BH providers who reported maintaining a waitlist in the BH survey to indicate OAR timely access sta ndards, and provide the contact information for the BH Access to Care Team for member navigation support. Develop a scaled workflow to manage incoming member calls and provider outreach to offset waitlists . Implement the member -screening tool across all PCS CCO regions to ensure appointment alignment. Develop an internal tracking process to monitor BH provider waitlist change over time and member navigation data by health needs. Analyze and report navigation statistics and waitlist change over time in monthly Oregon Access to Care Steering Committee meetings . Facilitate member access to community -based crisis services in an acute behavioral health crisis. Identify if SDOH needs exist for a member. If present, refer to t he internal CM Team for support. Offer CM services to members eligible for ICC. Initiate a referral and ICC screening for transition to the CM Team for follow -up for members who indicate interest. CM Team will begin sharing navigation data quarterly with the Oregon Access to Care Steering Committee in Quarter 2. This review of SPMI appointment navigation will become part of PCS routine timely access network monitoring, including developing a baseline to set 2023 navigation goals. F.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. Approximately 15, 417 PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge (PCS - CG) members reside in the Columbia Gorge . PCS - CG has approximately 96% of members attributed to Patient -Centered Primary Care Homes (PCPCH) . The Columbia Gorge has nine recogn ized PCPCHs, with three unrecognized clinics. The table below describes the percentage of members assigned to PCPCH clinics above Tier 3. PCS provides a per -member per -month (PMPM) to all recognized PCPCH clinics. In addition, clinics have the option to ap ply for the PCPCH Plus Value -Based Payment (VBP) program, which offers a higher -level PMPM in exchange for increased focus on coordination, quality, access, health information exchange, and patient experience. Technical assistance to achieve higher tier (i f applicable) is also part of the program. Columbia Gorge Member Enrollment and PCPCH Tier Levels Tier 3 Tier 4 Tier 5 Total PCPCH Member Attribution 5.5% (1 clinic) 55.2% (3 clinics) 35.2% (5 clinics) 95.9% In 2021, PCS - CG made several advances to increase PCPCH: Member Enrollment and PCPCH: Tier Advancement by streamlining our processes for clinic engagement through the PCPCH Plus VBP program . PCS - CG convened an internal workgroup consisting of members from the Analytics Team, Population Health Team, Clinical Quality Team, and other internal stakeholders to review monthly audits of clinics' tier status to inform outreach efforts. PCS - CG coor dinates with Creach Consulting to offer TA to clinics to become recognized PCPCHs or advance in tier levels. In 2021, PCS - CG also developed a new VBP program for 2022 for clinics to further encourage and support them in their PCPCH efforts. The new Comm unity Health Worker (CHW) VBP program provides financial support for CHWs at PCPCHs who are Tier 3 and above. To be eligible for the CHW VBP Program, PCPCHs must have a certified CHW on -site at the PCPCH that collaborates as part of the care team and routi nely works with patients and community partners to achieve identified PCPCH standards such as 3.D.2, 3.D.3, or 5.E.3, which are related to tracking community -based referrals for health -related social needs. D. Project context : For new projects, include justi fication for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project differs slightly from the other PCS' PCPCH reports. You will note specific differences in strategy for covering the PCPCH componen ts in PCS - CG and within the Monitoring Measures. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 11 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS - CG reviewed and incorporated the feedback received from OHA for the PCPCH: Member Enrollment and PCPCH: Tier Advancement components in 2021. We designed a new project to highlight the PCPCH Plus VBP program and the variety of TA offered to PCPCHs to advance tier levels and increase member enrollment. Throughout 2021, PCS - CG developed and offered a variety of TA and provided enhanced financial support through the PCPCH Plus VBP p rogram . PCS - CG reduced reporting requirements in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID -19 and only required bi -annual reporting to participate in the VBP program. Beginning in 2022, reporting requirements will return quarterly to ensure that PCPCHs continue high performance and mee t all program requirements. PCS - CG has eight PCPCHs currently enrolled in PCS' PCPCH Plus VBP program . PCPCHs that choose not to enroll in the VBP program still receive the base rate PMPM for being a recognized PCPCH. In 2021, PCS - CG contracted with Cr each Consulting to offer TA and one -on-one coaching to PCPCHs and unrecognized clinics. In 2021, one clinic engaged in TA. Clinics who chose to engage in TA received assistance completing the OHA PCPCH application renewal process and coaching to achieve ad vanced PCPCH measures to become eligible for the PCPCH Plus VBP program. In addition to this, Creach Consulting partnered with Dr. Amy Stoeber, a licensed Psychologist who provides training and consultation in building resilient relationships, to offer one free learning collaborative in the summer of 2021 to help clinics with the new PCPCH standard 2.F: Staff Vitality . PCS - CG also provides clinics access to a Clinical HIT Informaticist through Crea ch Consulting to help meet PCPCH s tandard 4.D.3: Clinical Information Exchange and assist with EHR functions in support of PCPCH: Tier Advancement. In 2021, PCS - CG identified the need to have more targeted TA provided to clinics for PCPCH Standards 3.C.1: Behavioral Health Services , 5.A.1 & 5.A.2: Population He alth Management , and 5.C.2: Complex Care Coordination . PCS has continued to engage in efforts to offer and provide TA to unrecognized clinics to increase PCPCH: Member Enrollment . Over the past several years, the PCPCH program has matured with 96% of clini cs in the Columbia Gorge being certified PCPCHs. Those who are not are small rural clinics with limited resources to become a recognized PCPCH. In addition, last year, PCS met with OHA's PCPCH Program Manager, Amy Harris, to discuss strategies for increasi ng PCPCH: Member Enrollment in the Columbia Gorge given the unique barriers facing small rural clinics, such as staffing challenges and other resources. PCS is committed to ensuring that clinics are provided with resources to maintain their recognition, an d we will continue to offer and provide TA to clinics in 2022. PCS - CG identified opportunities to provide VBPs to support the integration of Traditiona l Health Workers ( THWs ) through partnership s with PCS - CG's THW Liaisons and community PCPCH partners . The THW type that best fits the PCPCH model and popula tion needs is the CHW. In addition , CHWs can bill for services outside of a Certificate of Approval agency. By adding a CHW VBP program, PCPCHs will further meet OHA's PCPCH standard for 3.D.2, 3.D.3, or 5.E.3, therefore, advancing population health and member needs. PCS - CG exceeded the target state by developing the CHW VBP Program in 2021, which will offer both financial support and TA opportuniti es to further integrate CHWs in PCPCHs. E. Brief narrative description : PCS - CG will collaborate with Creach Consulting to outreach and offer TA to recognized PCPCHs to advance tier levels and offer TA to unrecognized clinics to become certified PCPCHs and increase member enrollment. In addition to paying higher PMPM for increased tier levels, PCS - CG will promote the PCPCH Plus VBP program. Clinics that meet specified high -value PCPCH standards may opt to participate in the program . Please reference the PCS VBP Program description in the attachments for full details on TA and PMPMs offered to PCPCHs. PCS - CG will collaborate with Creach Consulting to offer TA to recognized PCPCH clinics and achieve the standards outlined below. To re ceive the enhanced PCPC H Plus program rates, clinics must meet all the following parameters and reporting requirements: Be recognized by OHA as PCPCH Tier 3, 4, or 5 Maintain or improve PCPCH tier of recognition Participate in any OHA PCPCH program site visits Submit quarterly reports to PCS, including a copy of the most recent OHA PCPCH application OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 12 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 Acknowledge that expectations of clinics will continue to rise in subsequent years to ensure continuous quality improvement .

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. In 2021, PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge ( PCS - CG) continued to offer and promote the Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) Value -Based Payment (VBP) program. The BHI VBP program promotes the implement ation and maintenance of an integrated care team structure and provides financial support to Patient -Centered Primary Care Homes (PCPCH s) to do so (please see ATTM 8 - PacificSource 2022 PCPCH VBP Program Description, which includes full details about the reporting requirements and program metrics) . In 2021, e ight PCPCH s had robust integrated behavioral health programs. PCS - CG reinitiated site visits and bi -annual reporting for the BHI VBP Program in 2021 , despite challenges stemming from COVID -19. PCS - CG continues to contract with Creach Consulting to offer technical as sistance (TA) and learning collaboratives, create and monitor program reporting, and conduct site visits. All PCPCHs enrolled in the BHI VBP program submitted data and bi -annual reporting in the summer of 2021. PCS - CG worked closely with Creach Consultin g to review all site visit reports and population reach data. PCS - CG compiled qualitative data from the site visits, which resulted in the following insights: PCPCHs reported high levels of caregiver burnout in combination with increased patient needs for behavioral health services, which has markedly increased since the beginning of the pandemic. Because of COVID -19 and workforce shortages, there has been limit ed access in the community to specialty behavioral health. In addition, more patients with serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI) are having their care managed through integrated primary care settings with Behavioral Health Clinicians (BHC). The shif t to remote work has affected team -based care, which has led to a need for TA to help re -implement important activities such as huddles, curbside consults, and warm hand -offs. Lastly, PCS - CG identified the need to provide more TA to help PCPCHs understan d and implement true team -based care with BHCs and PCPs, rather than just providing referrals to on -site BHCs. Clinics that participated in the BHI VBP program submitted population reach data for the first half of 2021. Columbia Gorge's population reach ranged from 7% to 39%, with the average population reach reported being 17. 5%. In addition to clinic -reported population reach, PCS - CG has Behavioral Health Utilization dashboards, which include claims data for members who received integrated behavioral health services (see example below). The top line indicates Medicaid members in the Gorge who had a service. The variation of population reach highlights the opportunity for continued TA specific ally with clinics that reported lower rates. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 15 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report and in the monitoring measures. In 2021, this project also included components for Behavioral Health Integration, PCPCH: Member Enrollment, and PCPCH: Tier Advancement. After reviewing OHA feedback for 2021, PCS - CG adapted this project to focus on the BHI component for 2022. PCS - CG achieved its 2021 TQS targets for program expansi on and population health reach (see table below). Seven PCPCHs in the Columbia Gorge enrolled in the BHI VBP Program at the start of 2021. One new clinic enroll ed in the summer of 2021 . Over the course of 2021, Creach Consulting conducted site visits with five out of eight participating clinics in the BHI VBP Program to verify program compliance and determine TA opportunities with clinics . In the fall, PCS - CG postponed site visits for remaining clinics until 2022, to help with provider relief related to the pandemic. In 2020, because of COVID -19 and provider relief, PCS - CG waived program reporting requirements. In 2021, again because of COVID -19, PCS - CG only required biannual reporting and reduced population health reach requirements to 5%. In 2021, PCPCHs reported this population health reach data in July, and a ll clinics exceeded the 5% target. In 2022, participating PCPCHs will have new population reach requirements, including the addition of reporting reach on a priority subpopulation. The subpopulation data reporting is aimed at decreasing health disparities. (See attached 2022 VBP Description for full detail on priority subpopulation reach.)

At least one additional PCPCH will enroll in VBP arrangements for BHI in 2021. Target met. One additional PCPCH enrolled in the BHI VBP program. Due to COVID -19, PCS - CG waived reporting requirements in 2020. In 2019, all participating clinics met their population reach requirements. PCPCHs who participated in BHI Program in 2020 will maintain at least a 5% population reach in 2021 . Target Met. All clinics maintained at least 5% population reach. Due to COVID -19, PCS - CG waived reporting requirements in 2020. No data is available for newly enrolled clinics. PCPCHs new to BHI Program will achieve a 5% population reach in 2021 . Target met. All new PCPCHs achieved at least 5% population reach. PCS - CG offered TA and learning collaboratives to all PCPCHs participating in the BHI VBP program in 2021. Four PCPCHs engaged in targeted TA focused on improving population reach; helping with recru itment, hiring and training for BHCs; and improving psychiatric access. In addition, PCS - CG held learning collaboratives in 2021 that provided information about different BHI models of care, PCS' program requirements, and TA availability. Further, based on lessons learned during site visits and by popular request, PCS - CG sponsored a new virtual Primary Care BHC Community of Practice aimed at creating a peer community, clinical skill -building, and addressing burnout. As we continue to eliminate health disparities among CCO members, we are looking to expand upon the data by looking at population reach by preferred language and/or race and ethnicity. PCS - CG's Behavioral Health Population Coach offered TA to Providence, Columbia Gorge Family Medicine, and Mid-Columbia Medical Center (MCMC) to analyze their population health reach data with a health equity lens in the fall of 2021. Because of COVID -19, clinics opted not to participate in TA. However, with the addition of the Priority Subpopulation Reach metric in 2022, we believe PCPCHs will work toward building a health equity lens into their integrated care programs . E. Brief narrative description : PCS - CG will provide financial support and TA to implement high -value BHI elements in PCPCHs that serve our members. For clinics to participate in the fidelity -based BHI program, they must be a T ier 3 PCPCH or higher. Each participating clinic is require d to subm it quarterly reporting to receive payments .

Each eligible BHC must have at least half of their hours at the practic e each week available for same -day open access services . In 2022, the program will offer two different levels of retrospective PMPM payments based on reporting total population reach and a priority subpopulation reach. T o be eligible for Level 1 reimbursement , clinics must achieve 8% total population reach and 10% priority subpopulation reach . To receive a higher Level 2 reimbursement , clinics must achieve 12% total population reach and 25% priority subpopulation reach . The priority subpopulation metric s aim to assess and then decrease health disparities within integrated health care settings by requiring clinics to report on members receiving integrated behavioral health in primary care. Clinics have the option to choose and report on one of three different priority subpopulation metrics: Percent age of patients who identify as a person of color or whose preferred language i s not English who were seen by a BHC . Percent age of patients with diabetes and a positive depression screening who were seen by a BHC . Early childhood social -emotional health: Percent age of patients who r eceived a developmental screening score (ASQ -3 or ASQ: SE -2) in the monitoring zone who were seen by a BHC. F. Activities and monitoring for performance improvement : Activity 1 description : PCS - CG will offer continued and expanded support for the implementation of fidelity -based BHI in PCPCHs using a VBP strategy .

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment(s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data In 2021, PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge (PCS - CG) made progress on Health Equity : Data with advancemen ts to the Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics Dashboard s. These data visualizations display information for Dental Health, Behavioral Health , and Medical Health providers by service location in connection to the provision of interpreter service s. Previously, the dashboards focused on interpreter service gaps attributed to primary care groups . This enhancement allows us to have more information to understand gaps in interpreter services across different types of health providers . Based on these find ings, PCS - CG continued provider outreach to promote interpreter resources such as informing providers on vendors available, how to schedule interpreters from PCS - CG's vendor list , and the reimbursement process for certified or qualified interpreters. PCS' Provider Service team planned outreach and provided technical support to providers via phone. However, due to COVID -19, the provider's capacity to engage via phone was limited. In response, PCS - CG created a web -based form for providers to complete on their own time. The Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics by Service Provider Dashboard , exhibited below, provides a view of utilization at the actual provider service level, when available claims data exists. This information informs where members with interpreter needs are accessing care and the percent age of those services with a documented interpreter service. While this new dashboard allows us to view interpreter metrics by service provider , PCS - CG continues to use the Health Eq uity: REALD dashboard to have a comprehensive view of gaps , e.g., utilization metrics by members' preferred language and zip code. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 20 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS - CG made advancements with Access: Cultural Considerations by sharing existing materials and creating new mater ials to promote Health Care Interpreter (HCI) requirements and resources. These materials explain how to access interpretation services as well as how to become a n HCI. PCS - CG shared these materials with providers through three communication channels: em ail, website, and telephonic communication. In 2021, PCS - CG expanded from three HCI vendors to 10 HCI vendors , which improved wait times and vendor choice in cultural appropriateness . These effort s served to assist providers with identifying their patien ts' cultural and linguistic needs and engaging patients in their care (CLAS Standard #5 ). In 2021, the Provider Manual received a robust update on HCI services. PCS - CG expanded content from one page to three pages to outline the following resources for p rovides and members: Member s' rights to HCI services and provider s' responsibility . Payment responsibility for HCI services Details on how a provider can arrange and bill for HCI services , including promotion of billing code T1013 Contact information for HCI vendors, showing an increase from three contracted vendors in 2020 to 10 contracted vendors in 2021 Definition of a \"credentialed\" interpreter The difference s among qualified, certified, and bilingual interpreters Learning to work with a medical interpreter PCS - CG distribute d information through the enhanced provider Site Visit and Evaluation Form that includes additional technical assistance around HCI access. P rovider Service developed a virtu al site -visit survey for providers. PCS - CG sent the new communication tool electronically through the PCS - CG's Provider Bulletin . The bulletin and survey included questions about providers' policy and procedure for language access , as well as , inquiries and opportunities for technical assista nce for HCI interpreter access and billing. PCS - CG's work in this area has been in close alignment with the Health Equity Plan (HEP) Focus Area 7: Language Access. One strateg y in th e HEP is to establish tracking mechanisms and new processes to improve access to OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 21 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 interpretation services across healthcare settings. Additionally, the Health Equity Quality Incentive Measure provides PCS - CG and providers with direction on priority focus areas to support meaningful language access for members. In 2021, PCS - CG focused on improving CLAS Standards by focusing on CLAS Standard 5: Offering language assistance to individuals who have limited English proficiency (LEP) and/or other communication needs, at no cost to them, to facilitate timely access to all health care and services. PCS - CG adapted the OHA Preferred Language Card to a JPEG format that is share able with members via email and mail when they call Customer Service . The available JP EG file format of the Preferred Language Card allows providers to communicate the card with members via text message . D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provi de progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report and in the monitoring measures. Health Equity : Data PCS - CG met its target to expand the Medicaid I nterpreter Utilization and Metrics Dashboard s to include Behavioral and Oral H ealth providers. PCS - CG utilized t he Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics Dashboard s (Health Equity: REALD and Service Provider ) to identify providers who would benefit from outreach based on interpreter gaps in members' care. The new Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics Dashboard s provide PCS - CG staff with enhanced views to identify the service provider and interpreter ut ilization. PCS - CG provide d outreach to Behavioral Health providers in Q4 2021. In addition, PCS - CG identified an additional data source to improve the accuracy of interpreter service utilization reporting for dental care providers . The Dental Care Orga nizations ( DCO s) provide PCS - CG with language access reporting , which includes visit -level information on interpreter services provided (including the interpreter's OHA Credential and Registry Number). PCS' Analytics team has integrated th ese additional data into the dashboards to support future outreach efforts. In 2021, PCS - CG delayed outreach to DCOs to 2022 to identify the best strategy to share data from the Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics Dashboard s and determine next steps. PCS' Dive rsity, Equity and Inclusion ( DEI) team is working on establishing additional opportunities to share the dashboard with other internal departments. An analysis of survey responses and dashboard data will be concluded by 2023, and this information will guide strategies. PCS - CG updated t he Interpreter Services Survey that Provider Service sent to provider groups to understand their experience providing interpreters during medical appointments. PCS - CG conducted outreach to providers through a new online provider survey, rather than via p hone, to alleviate provider capacity issues . Nine providers received the Interpreter Survey, of which five have responded. The DEI team continues to work with P rovider Service to connect with the remaining providers who have not responded to the survey. Access: Cultural Considerations PCS - CG met its benchmark to distribute a n FAQ and create at least one additional tool to promote HCI requirements and resources. Listed below are the t ools and distribution channels. The resources include how to access inte rpretation services and how to become an HCI. PCS - CG shared the materials with providers through three communication channels: email, website, and telephonic communication.

It outlines how to bill for clinic staff who are certified and qualified interpreters and how to access PCS - CG contracted HCI vendors. PCS - CG developed the Quick Guide t o Becoming an HCI to support clinical workforce development. Best practice is for clinics to have onsite interpreters. The best way to guarantee this is to have multi -cultural/multi -lingual clinical staff trained as interpreters. This new tool outlines the step -by-step process to become a qualified or certified interpreter in Oregon. Additionally, PCS - CG distributed the new flier, which includes promotion of the HCI Guidelines and FAQ , the new T1013 billing code, and contact information to receiv e help fr om the PCS - CG's Population Health team to navigate the interpreter credentialing process. CLAS Standards PCS - CG achieved its benchmark to improve Preferred Language C ards and promote them to providers through two channels. PCS - CG identified opportu nities for improvement and distribution of the OHA's Preferred Language Cards . PCS - CG focused improvements in the following areas: ordering process, printing format, and need for additional languages. PCS - CG reported its findings to the OHA using different types of communication and contact ed at least six different individuals and depart ments, including the official Language Access email , Languageaccess.info@state.or.us . Preferred Language Card Feedback Provided to OHA Topic Identified opportunities Ordering process The Preferred Language Cards on the COVID smart sheet are different from cards available through the traditional ordering process. The traditional process has 26 languages, whereas the smart sheet process only has 12. Access Several language cards are inaccessible and the hyperlinks are broken. Printing format Users are to print the cards double -sided and fold. However, the text does not line up on both sides when printed. If printed as -is, half the text is upside down. Additional language needs PCS - CG needs Mam language cards in our regions. Translation improvements Spanish and French appear to be word -for-word translations, resulting in unclear messaging . To make the cards more user -friendly , PCS - CG adapted Preferred Language Cards from the OHA web page into a format that can be shared via email, mobile device, or web. Prior to these enhancements the cards could not be displayed in a way that allowed members to view both English and non -English language on th e same screen. See examples below of PCS - CG's enhancement. If requested by a member or provider, we will be able to produce the same friendly format in other languages ( if they are available on the OHA web page). PCS - CG shared these resources with prov iders via two communication channels : our website and in two emails, including the Provider Bulletin .

Brief narrative description : This project outlines new activities within Analytics, Communications, and Provider Network departments. The primary focus of this project will be to advance CLAS Standards 5: Language Access and Quality by focusing on Health Equity: Data and Access: Cultu ral Considerations . PCS - CG created the Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics by Service Provider Dashboard to analyze interpreter gaps from Medical, Dental, and Behavioral Health providers. These dashboards identify areas of high need for linguist ic support, monitor provider technical assistance opportunities , and work to improve linguistically appropriate access where interpreter service gaps persist. In 2022, PCS - CG will utilize service provider and interpreter utilization dashboards to establi sh workflows f or monitoring interpreter service claims and technical assistance to determine language access needs and improve quality of services (CLAS Standard #5). We will leverage the Medicaid Interpreter Utilization and Metrics Dashboard s to help impl ement processes and procedures to improve culturally and linguistically appropriate services, including Behavioral Health, Oral Health, and Medical care, which includes Specialty (CLAS Standard #9). To assist with this goal , PCS - CG will outreach to 1 -3 providers and/or community -based organizations that support members with cultural and linguistic needs . PCS - CG will also develop a needs assessment on member and provider education (CLAS Standard #13). We will use the dashboards to distribute material s about the use of HCIs and THWs to providers accompanied with outreach through educational activities and provider network workshops. Activities will focus on: Health Equity: Data : Establishing a workflow from the Medicaid Interpreter U tilization and Metrics Dashboards to monitor and identify technical assistance needs around language access to support providers and inform annual updates of PCS - CG's Language Access Plan (LAP) (CLAS Standard # 11) . Access: Cultural Considerations : We will develop technical assistance for providers to ensure equitable access to care for members in need of language access services and the delivery of culturally responsive care (CLAS Standard #13) . CLAS Standards : PCS - CG will continue to inform and educate providers about the use of preferred language cards to support language access for LEP members. We will distribute preferred language promotional material to providers including THWs. PCS - CG will track provider feedback on the uti lization of preferred language cards. (CLAS Standard #5).

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) Grievances and Appeals department (G&A) receives and processes member complaints pertaining to any expression of dissatisfaction. We log and categorize these grievances into six different categories based upon the ro ot cause of the complaint. On a monthly basis, we analyze complaints related to the access to care category for any specific trends, including those complaints related to transportation. Time, distance, and practitioner -to-member ratios do not apply to Non -Emergent Medical Transportation (NEMT). As such, we evaluate and analyze NEMT provider adequacy monthly. This evaluation includes monitoring monthly and quarterly reports received from the NEMT brokerages, reports created by PCS, and monitoring of Grievan ce data. Th ese data identif y any capacity denials, the reasons for the denials, average ridership, rides per member per month, complaints regarding availability, appeals related to denials, and various additional data points. If we identify any deficiencie s, they are addressed immediately and may result in a corrective action plan with the brokerage . In addition to tracking member complaints, PCS supports Access: Quality and adequacy of services by monitoring compliance with established standards through ac cess surveys and site visit checklists. If PCS recognizes a concerning trend through the access survey or receives three or more complaints concerning a particular provider or facility, the Provider Network Department conducts a site visit . PCS did not per form any site visits due to the COVID -19 pandemic, but alternatively reached out via phone and or email to investigate with the provider. Results from these visits help identify opportunities for improvement and corrective actions, if necessary. In 2021, PCS compiled access data from all monitoring systems into one report to identify gaps and trends related to the quality and adequacy of services. We hired additional staff and partnered with a third party to help support data monitoring and deployment strat egies to measure services' quality and adequacy. G&A partnered with PCS' Access to Care department to share data on access -to-care grievances and discuss opportunities through a monthly Oregon Access to Care Committee. In 2021, PCS identified a trend of access to care complaints regarding the transportation brokerage in the PCS - Columbia Gorge (CG) CCO region. Trend data is show n in the following table and graph.

Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report . In 2020, PCS successfully established a standardized tool for monitoring internal grievance and appeal data from PCS and all subcontractors performing complaint resolution. This process allows PCS to evaluate delegated functions and review for appropriaten ess of response to an appeal or grievance, the timeliness of responding to member complaints, and whether PCS and its subcontractor followed the proper appeals and grievances processes and criteria. These data OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 28 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 gathered in 2020 helped us identify a trend of grievances related to member interactions with dental providers. In response, PCS utilized th ese enhanced data to provide a grievance report to our Dental Care Organizations (DCOs). We then conducted quarterly meetings with the DCOs to review grievance trends and discuss potential interventions. These meetings led to proactive outreach mechanisms, including written communication about programs, available providers, and a potential text messaging system. Results from the 2020 Grievance Report showed that NEMT had the highest complaint rate among PCS' subcontractors. In response, the 2021 project pivoted to focus on increasing NEMT collaboration and mitigation strategies to reduce complaints across all categories. While PCS continued quarterly discussions with dental subcontractors, PCS initiated similar meetings with NEMT subcontractors. The first quarterly meeting with NEMT subcontractors resulted in the creation of a root cause analysis of late -pickup occurrences. PCS focused s ubsequent discussions on th e unpredictability created by C OVID -19 surges , such as but not limited to driver capacity, unplanned appointment cancelations, or the overall reduced appointment utilization and subsequent lower ride utilization . The interventions from this collaboration resulted in a mutually agreed -upon incentive metric for the NEMT brokerage that measured the rate of grievances and incentivized the NEMT brokerage to focus on improvements strategies. In 2021, PCS - CG saw an average complaint rate of 1.88 complaints per 1,000 members, a 59% reduction in total complaints per 1,000 members from the previous year. However, COVID -19 surges in 2021 also led to decreased care utilization and canceled services, which may have skewed the reduction in complaints.

Brief narrative description : In 2021, PCS met its goal to reduce the overall rate of member grievances from 4.57 per 1,000 members to 4 per 1,000. We achieved this through targeted interventions aimed at NEMT member pickups and member communications . However, while PCS saw an improvement in the overall rate o f complaints, a high number of complaints were related to transportation dissatisfaction that affected access to care (see data below). OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 29 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 In 2022, this project will work to reduce grievance rates related to NEMT and improve access to care by engaging wi th the NEMT brokerage to address service dissatisfaction. Furthermore, PCS will expand on this collaboration by utilizing member survey results to identify opportunities to increase member awareness of free ride services. PCS will work with the NEMT broker age to establish benchmark goals for survey responses to questions asking if the member is aware of free rides. Increased member awareness will positively impact member access to appointments and increase ride utilization. This project will use dat a to identify trends, implement interventions to alleviate the barriers to care based on those trends, and ultimately improve access to appointments. F.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. In 2020 and 2021, the COVID -19 pandemic significantly impacted the dental care delivery system. This evolving landscape spurred some progress with teledentistry but continued to impede PacificSource Community Sol ution's (PCS ) Oral Health Integration initia tives to increase dental visits for diabetic members. In recognition of these challenges, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) retrospectively suspended the CCO Quality Incentive Measure (QIM) improvement targets for 2020 and rebased benchmarks and improvemen t targets for 2021. Efforts to increase dental care for diabetic members significantly exceeded both the original target and the rebased 2021 target of 17.3%. CCO MEASURE NUM DEN RATE Target DIFF Columbia Gorge Oral Evaluation - Diabetic 196 599 32.7% 17.3% 15.4 In support of Oral Health Integr ation, PCS-CG continued to encourage the utilization of Reliance's Health Information Exchange (HIE) and health information technology (HIT) platforms. As a result, we now have two of the three Dental Care Organizations (DCOs) participating with the Reliance Community Health Record. However, we have not yet increased participation with the R eliance eReferrals platform from one DCO to two DCOs. In fact, Reliance data shows that eReferrals utilization continues to decline among providers, with only three referrals made in 2021 compared to over 70 in 2019. In response to this challenge, PCS -CG c reated a collaborative workgroup with DCOs and Unite Us, a community information exchange platform used for social determinants of health screenings and referrals. This group successfully designed a pilot to expand the platform's functionality for provider -to-provider closed -loop referrals. Moving forward, we are hopeful this pilot will be successful, given Unite Us' broad provider use across Oregon. Last year, PCS-CG also shared informational materials on co-location, Oral Health Integration , topical fluo ride varnish, and member -facing materials with provider groups. These initiatives helped providers educate their patients on the connection between oral health and diabetes, and also assisted members in getting dental care . Accomplishments from these effor ts include: 100% of PCS -CG contracted physical health partners completed topical fluoride varnish and oral health assessment technical assistance training. Three Columbia Gorge clinics began using the dental visit \"prescription\" pads, a tool used to encourage patients with diabetes to seek dental care. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 32 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 One clinic utilized the PCS -created diabetes and oral health letter, which physicians can send to their patients to educate on the conne ction between oral health and diabetes. Mid-Columbia Medical Center and Advantage Dental Services re -launched a teledentistry co-location partnership and are in the process of finalizing a contract. D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report and in the monitoring measures. In 2019, PCS-CG chose Diabetes: Inter -professional Care Collaboration between Primary Care and Dental Providers as its Oral Health Integr ation (OHI) TQS project due to the high prevalence of diabetes and its impact on members' health in the Columbia Gorge region. Data presented in the 2019 Columbia Gorge Community Health Assessment showed that 11% of Columbia Gorge adults have diabetes (2% higher than Oregon and Washington state rates). Additionally, research has shown that preventing or correcting oral diseases is an integral part of optimal diabetes management. As part of this project, PCS created the Dental Care for Diabetics report and deployed it to participating physical health providers. This report provided information to primary care physicians (PCPs) and c linics on their panel's rate of dental visits, including periodontal or prophylaxis visits, which enabled them to integrate oral health into their patients' overall care. PCS-CG also worked to increase the adoption of both Reliance's eReferrals platform an d its Community Health Record. The eReferral platform provides a single, closed -loop referral system usable by any provider type, regardless of the current Electronic Health Record (EHR) and messaging technologies. The Community Health Record allows provid ers to access important clinical information such as problem lists, medication lists, and visit history. The utilization of these tools allows effective communication between dental and physical health providers, which improves collaboration and coordinati on of care. In 2020, PCS-CG leveraged value -based payment (VBP) strategies, dashboards, and monthly monitoring to increase the percentage of diabetic members who received a comprehensive or periodontal exam. However, COVID -19 led to several dental clinic c losures, which impeded progress towards increasing dental exams for people with diabetes. Despite this, PCS-CG continued working on resuming care through teledentistry and co -location . Additional progress in 2020 included the dental integration activities log deployment, which provided a baseline for current diabetes co -location efforts. PCS- CG also created several informational guides on teledentistry, mobile dentistry, co -location, and Oral Health Integration to facilitate provider awareness and increase understanding. In 2021, PCS-CG continued scoping possible HIE and HIT platforms. While PCS successfully adopted Reliance's Community Health Record platform in the Columbia Gorge and Central Oregon, both regions have shown underutilization of the eReferral s platform. Given these challenges, PCS-CG pivoted to researching Unite Us as an alternative platform to meet this need. This tool can help identify and address social determinants of health (SDOH) needs and potentially serve as a provider -to-provider refe rral platform. Moving forward, we are hopeful about provider - to-provider clinical referral possibilities with Unite Us and its broad provider use across Oregon. The vendor is currently piloting this functionality, and we are encouraged by this use -case, gi ven PCS' investment in Unite Us across its four CCO regions. E. Brief narrative description : To implement and improve Oral Health Integration , PCS-CG will continue using a VBP model to incentivize the delivery of dental care to members with diabetes. This work aligns with the QIM addressing oral evaluations for diabetic members. It also aides the 2021 TQS strategy to use VBPs to incentivize DCOs to achi eve the rebased performance improvement targets and, ultimately, the region's performance benchmark on this measure. The VBP strategy, in combination with monthly monitoring of measure dashboards and gap lists, will help drive continued progress. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 33 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS-CG will also continue promoting the establishment and expansion of co -located teledentistry programs within physical health clinics to increase dental care utilization in the diabetic population. We will continue facilitating regular conversations with DCOs, sharing resources and analytics, hosting discussions to encourage integration and co -location with physical health providers, and connecting interested physical health providers with DCOs to explore further options when needed. Finally, PCS-CG will contin ue promoting the adoption of community HIE and HIT systems to enable interprofessional collaboration and care coordination between physical and dental providers. Given the provider -to-provider referral potentials of the Unite Us platform and the prospect o f a singular solution across our regions, we will focus our attention on that future functionality assuming pilot efforts prove successful. If we learn that provider -to-provider referrals are not an appropriate fit for the Unite Us platform, PCS-CG will re search and evaluate other options to best support provider -to-provider communication. F. Activities and monitoring for performance improvement : Activity 1 description : PCS - CG will l everage VBP strategies, dashboards, and monthly monitoring to increase the percentage of diabetic members who receive a comprehensive or periodontal exam during the measurement period. Short term or Long term Monitoring measure 1.1 Monitoring will occur via a dashboard that displays year -to-date performance on diabetic members with dental visits.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. In 2021, PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge CCO (PCS - CG) explored opportunities to build upon existing community engagement work to improve Health Equity : Cultural Responsiveness and Social Determinants of Health & Equity (SDOH -E). In fall 2019 and winter 2020, we conducted targeted listening sessions and public forums to inform this work. Participants included OHP members, health care providers, social serv ice providers, and community members . Attendees represented various populations that have historically exp erienced health inequities based on their race, ethnicity, language, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, and the intersections among these communities. The feedback from these listening sessions informed our Community Information Exchange ( CIE) planning, including the need to increase access to culturally and linguistically responsive resources. PCS - CG partners with the Columbia Gorge Health Council (CGHC) to ensure local community governance is rooted in the unique assets and n eeds of the communities in Wasco and Hood River counties. CGHC conducts the Community Health Assessment (CHA) and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHP), which drives the SDOH -E work of PCS - CG. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, PCS - CG started to f acilitate a meeting between local public health officials and community partners. This meeting served as an opportunity to collaborate and receive updates on changes that community organizations were making in response to the pandemic. The meeting has evol ved into a monthly Gorge Resource Huddle where providers and community organizations collaborate and share information about their programs and services. Staff from PCS - CG participate in many collaboratives to advance SDOH -E needs in the Gorge, including Gorge Houseless Collaborative, Gorge Native American Partner Collaborative, Gorge Health Equity Collaborative, and the Columbia Gorge Food Security Coalition. PCS - CG, the CGHC, and the Community Advisory Council (CAC) prioritize housing with the 2021 SH ARE Initiative to fund two housing and houseless supports projects in the Gorge. In addition, CAC channels member and community feedback that informs PCS - CG's SDOH -E strategies. PCS - CG's Community Health Coordinator serves as a liaison between the CAC and CIE planning team. When SDOH -E concerns arise in CAC meetings, the Coordinator brings this knowledge to our CIE planning to inform priority resources and communities. The Coordinator is able to share knowledge and perspective from the Columbia Gorge C HIP that are relevant to this work. In 2020, PCS invested in the Unite Us CIE platform. In 2021, PCS joined the statewide Connect Oregon network , including onboarding to the Unite Us platform . This allowed PCS to expand its focus to address SDOH -E at the community level by strengthening connections and collaboration between providers and community -based organizations (CBOs) that provide resources to our members. PCS invested in unlimited licenses for CCO provider and CBO partners to join the network and pl atform. While the network is statewide, the network growth strategy is regional to allow for close work among local partners to develop a robust regional network. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 36 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS - CG collaborated with the CGHC and Unite Us to develop a list of local healthcare and s ocial needs resource providers to invite to the platform. We held community presentations, system demonstrations, and discussions for local healthcare providers and CBOs to learn more about the Unite Us CIE platform and Connect Oregon network. Initially, w e focused on Hood River and Wasco Counties but recognized that Columbia Gorge residents utilize resources on both the Washington and Oregon sides of the river. In 2022, PCS - CG will explore collaboration opportunities in Washington, as the Unite Us platfo rm is live and in the early stages of growth in Klickitat County. In response to community feedback and COVID -19 restraints, Connect Oregon adoption is largely still in an exploratory phase in the Columbia Gorge. Several key community partners requested th at PCS and Unite Us explore integration with Activate Care, a case management platform utilized by several organizations in the region. PCS and Unite Us have agreed to explore this feasibility in 2022. PCS continued its collaboration with the Oregon Rural Practice -based Research Network (ORPRN) and worked with Unite Us to integrate the CMS Accountable Health Communities (AHC) social needs assessment into the Unite Us platform. In addition, we invited AHC participating providers to join the network. In Apri l 2021, PCS - CG Care Management (CM) team s received tr aining and onboarded to Unite Us to begin conducting AHC screenings and referrals with in the platform. Since the Connect Oregon network of resources is still in the initial stages of development in the Columbia Gorge, navigation to local resources typically occurs offline. The PCS - CG CM team plans to begin accepting incoming referrals on the Unite Us platform in 20 22. As more organizations join the network, we hope to see bi -directional navigation on the platform. In addition, the PCS Flex ible Service s team joined the network to receive incoming referrals for flex funds. Moving the process to the Unite Us platform allowed referrers easily to upload a completed form as a PDF attachment. This welcomed process enhancement eliminated the need to fax referrals. It also allows for closed -loop referrals as the sender can see when a referral is accepted or rejected. This ad vancement also allows the sender and Flexible Service s Team to track progress and outcomes to serve the needs of our members better . In 2022, PCS plans to enhance this process by embedding the flexible funds form in the platform. This will remove barriers by allowing sender s to complete a fillable form rather than uploading a PDF. The AHC project provides a statewide lens to see trends in health -related social need disparities to inform Health Equity: Cultural Responsiveness and SDOH -E planning across all P CS's CCO regions . The AHC Study screened 25,000 Oregonians and provided several insights into Medicaid and Medicare members' unmet health -related social needs. Medicaid members' social needs have increased since the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, 47.3% o f Medicaid members reported social needs. Since the pandemic, that percentage has increased to 62.6%. When combined, Medicaid and Medicare members also have higher percentages of social needs since the onset of the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, 38.2% had an unmet social need, and since COVID -19, social needs have increased to 55.2%. Data also indicates that social needs have increased among all racial and ethnic groups, with a notable increase for Asian members (27.1%), 20.5% for Latinx members, and 19.2 % for Multi -racial and other Medicaid and Medicare member populations. Notably, all non - white racial groups have higher social needs rates compared to white Medicaid and Medicare members. Latinx members also have a higher rate of social needs compared to n on-Latinx members. When digging further into social needs, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) members reported houselessness at a rate of 7.5%, food insecurity at 50.9%, and transportation needs at 28.1% (see AHC data graphs below). OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 37 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 The social needs data speaks to how we can affect health inequities by addressing disparities for BIPOC individuals. It starts with accurate data collection of race, ethnicity, language, disability (REALD), and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data on the Unite Us platform, in addition to tracking clients served and responding to gaps by inviting organizations that specialize in supporting specific cultural or linguistic populations to join the network. This will continue to be a focus area as we continue exploration with regional partners in 2022. D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project differs slightly from the other PCS' SDOH and Health Equity: Cultural Responsiveness reports. You will note specific differences in strategy for covering these components in PCS -CG and within the Monitoring Measures. PCS - CG made progress in 2021 to meet its targets around Conne ct Oregon network development as a means to serve members' SDOH -E needs in the PCS - CG region. PCS - CG and Unite Us began meeting in January 2021 to develop a promotion and implementation plan, and invite regional community partners to join the network. PCS identified nine in - network providers, twelve CBOs, and six government agencies for Wave One of outreach. PCS - CG met with Columbia OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 38 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 Gorge Health Council leadership and to explore opportunities for collaboration and identify areas of opportunity, includ ing interoperability with various databases, used by providers and CBOs. In June 2021, PCS - CG hosted a Connect Oregon Community Conversation for key providers and community partners to learn more about the platform. Nine organizations attended this event . PCS - CG surveyed participants after the event to gather their interest and feedback. We had follow -up conversations and demos with Unite Us and PCS - CG for those interested in learning more about the platform. Community Conversation attendees also shar ed key variables to explore for successful Connect Oregon adoption in the Columbia Gorge. This feedback shaped our 2022 strategy and activities. Feedback Mitigation Timing \u2014Providers and community partners have limited capacity as they prioritize COVID -19 response . Postpone full Connect Oregon rollout in the Columbia Gorge. Focus on a pilot with those who would like to refer to PCS Care Management and Flex ible Service s teams. Duplication in member data tracking Invite providers to learn more about intero perability with their electronic medical records (EMR) Explore interoperability with Activate Care , a care management database The Columbia Gorge community consists of Oregon and Washington residents and community resources. A successful network will idea lly need to serve communities on both sides of the river. Explore collaboration with Klickitat County and Skamania County organizations that have joined the Unite Us platform Connect Oregon focuses on referrals to social needs, but a comprehensive platform would allow for bi -directional referrals, including referrals to healthcare providers. Unite Us and PCS are piloting incoming referrals to providers in other CCO regions. This includes referrals to dental care, behavioral health, and specialists. Because of the closed -loop referral capabilities, referrers will be able to track the success of the referral. There is interest in a better process to track referrals to PCS Flexible Services. The Unite Us platform's closed -loop referral capability provides enhanced tracking on referrals. Flexible Services referrals will be re -activated on the Unite Us pl atform when funding is available in January 2022. A system enhancement will roll out in Q2 2022 that will make improvements to the application process. PCS revised its activities for Health Equity: Cultural Responsiveness . In 2021, activities focused on prioritizing Connect Oregon outreach and onboarding to organizations that serve the social needs of specific cultural and linguistic groups and track referrals to and from these priority organizations. However, the Connect Oregon network is still in prelim inary exploration in the Columbia Gorge, and therefore premature to onboard and track a targeted population on the network. PCS will continue to promote Connect Oregon adoption and will pivot from Connect Oregon for the Health Equity: Cultural Responsivene ss activity to focus on improving existing channels to promote organizations that support specific cultural and linguistic member social needs. These key organizations will continue to be a priority as we explore Connect Oregon adoption. E. Brief narrative d escription : In 2022, PCS - CG will continue our SDOH -E efforts and work in partnership with community stakeholders to launch a Connect Oregon pilot in the PCS - CG region. PCS - CG will work to ensure that at least one provider and at least three CBOs wil l join the network and focus on referrals amongst this group.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. In PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge (PCS - CG) CCO, 31.8% of our membership (4,726 members) meet the criteria for having Special Health Care Needs (SHCN). The PCS Care Management ( CM) team offers all members with SHCN a health risk assessm ent (HRA) at several intervals in the continuum of care coordination. All members with SHCN receive multiple opportunities to complete HRAs within the first 90 days of their enrollment on the Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D -SNP) and after triggering ev ents, which are indicators of health status changes . The HRA, while optional for members to complete, identifies existing physical, behavioral, oral, and social needs. The responses members provide in their HRAs inform the development of the Individualized Care Plan (ICP). PCS CM teams develop each member's ICP through collaboration with their Individualized Care Team (ICT). ICT participants will vary according to a member's specific needs and may include external participants such as specialty providers and community service providers, in addition to PCS CM teams, the member , and any other individual the member would like to be involved in their care. The ICT aims to improve member care throug h ongoing coordination across systems , levels, settings, and episodes of care . This includes scheduling Interdisciplinary Team ( IDT) meetings and routine revisi ons to the care plan. In 2020 and 2021, PCS conducted a population health assessment on its Full Benefit Dual Eligible (FBDE) members to prepare for the new 2022 D -SNP. We anticipated that our existing FBDE members would enroll in our new D -SNP; therefore , the curated data from our population health assessment helped inform our Model of Care (MOC) by providing visibility to the unique needs and char acteristics of our FBDE members . This population health assessment described our SHCN -FBDE members' unique needs through demographics, condition prevalence, care gaps, and healthcare utilization patterns . Our average FBDE member is 65 years old, living with at least one chronic health condition, is more likely to have a disability or behavioral health condition, and has more emergency department (ED) visits. Overall, our findings support the need to develo p unique strategies to improve health outcomes among this vulnerable population. D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO Dual -Care regions, except for region -specific data throughout the rep ort. The majority of FBDE members aged 65 and older liv e with one or more chronic conditions and their health -related risks continue to increase with age. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a summary measure that uses age and 19 chronic comorbidities to predict members' mortality risk in 12 months. Higher CCI scores indicate members have more chronic OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 43 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 conditions and higher resource needs. When comparing the distribution of the FBDE Medicare population to the non - dual eligible Medicare population, we fou nd that FBDE members are about 70% more likely to fall into the highest category of a CCI, scoring five or higher. We use CCI scores to improve the quality of members' care coordination by understanding each SHCN member's unique medical complexities and ri sk factors. The CCI quantifies the most prevalent conditions affecting PCS FBDE members. Conditions with the highest prevalence rates among our FBDE members include depression, diabetes or pre -diabetes , severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, substance use, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, one in two FBDE members managing a chronic condition wil l also struggle with depression, se rious and persistent mental illness (SPMI) , or a substance use disorder. Analysis of CCI scores and condition prevalence demonstrates greater medical complexity of and care coordination needs for our FBDE SHCN members. Average Condition Prevalence of Dual Eligible PacificSource Medicaid or Medicare by Region A systematic literature review illustrated associations between loneliness and many prevalent chronic conditions in PCS FBDE members. Loneliness significantly incre ased older adults' odds of death from cardiovascular -related problems and OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 44 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 was cited as one of the ten most predominant characteristics in adults with coronary artery disease.4 The study further states that some chronic diseases also increase the risk for loneliness, namely peripheral vascular disease, heart disease, lung disease, and arthritis. Finally, older adults who experience loneliness have significantly higher rates of hypertension; greater diastolic blood pressure reactivity when experiencing stres s, face doubled odds of mortality from circulatory system ailments, and increased frequency of dyspnea after heart failure.5 Social determinants of health (SDOH) such as income, education, employment, community, safety, and other family and social supports influence a member's daily life , influenc ing overall health and wellbeing. Wheth er perceived or actual, loneliness has recen tly emerged as a recognized SDOH . Research published by the National Academies of Sciences (2020) shows that old er adults are more likely to experience loneliness and social isolation, increasing their risk of detrimental health outcomes.6 Social isolation and loneliness affect the health and quality of life of adults who are 50 and older, particularly among those who identify as being low -income, underserved, and vulnerable. Several research studies evidence a significant association between loneliness and frequency of hospital visits, establishing loneliness as a meaningful predictor of ED utilization.7 Furthermo re, social isolation and loneliness are risk factors for depression and may exacerbate pre -existing comorbidity -related challenges.8 Finally, social isolation increases the risk for functional decline and mortality on a par with factors such as smoking, o besity , and lack of physical activity .9 Targeting loneliness in CM interventions may be preventative for our FBDE members who are 65 and older living with multiple chronic health conditions. According to the National Institute on Aging, lonely older adults are, on average, less healthy, with more frequent hospital admissions and longer inpatient stays.10 This aligns with our population health assessment findings where, comparatively, FBDE members' ED visits and inpatient admissions are more than double than that of our non -dual membership. In addition to the higher number of inpatient admissions amongst FBDE members, the rate of plan all- cause readmissions (as measured using HEDIS specifications ) is consistently higher th an that of non-dual eligible members . There is a significant association between loneliness and ED visits, hospital readmissions, and lon ger inpatient stays. Therefore, loneliness is a meaningful predictor of future ED utilization. CM strategies targeting loneliness for FBDE SHCN members may be an effective preventative measure to reduce ED visits, length of inpatient stays, and the likelih ood of readmissions. 4 Petitte, Trisha et al. \"A Systematic Review of Loneliness and Common Chronic Physical Conditions in Adults.\" The open psychol ogy journal vol. 8,Suppl 2 -132. doi:10.2174/1874350101508010113 5 Petitte, Trisha et al. \"A Systematic Review of Loneliness and Common Chronic Physical Conditions in Adults.\" The open psychol ogy journal vol. 8,Suppl 2 (2015): 113 -132. doi:10.2174/1874350101508010113 6 \"Social isolation and loneliness in older adults; opportunities for the health care system,\" The National Academies Press, https://doi.org/10.17226/25663. 7 Geller J, Janson P, McGovern E, Valdini A.

Across all age groups, the protective measures and recommendations designed to prevent COVID -19 all incorporate varying degrees of social distancing and isolation. Older adults are aware that they face greater morbidity and mortality risk from COVID -19. This heightened awareness may make older adults more diligent and vigilant about protecti ve mea sures against the virus, which simultaneously further limit s social interactions and connectivit y. This heightened distress associated with COVID -19 emphasized the need for innovative approaches to increase social support for older adults with SHCN. E. Brief narrative description : This project will serve the FBDE SHCN population, specifically targeting members who are 65 and older with CCI scores of two or above , with active enrollment in PacificSource Dual Care (D -SNP) plans. PCS will establish a baseline measurement of ED utilization for FBDE SHCN members using data collected within our Hospital Event Notification (HEN) system in 2021. CM teams will use the HEN system to monitor monthly ED utilization for all D -SNP members with SHCN. PCS will assign our D -SNP members with SHCN into comparison cohorts by the type of intervention they receive. Members who enroll and engage with CM and Papa Pals will form Cohort A. PCS will assign members who do not engage in Papa Pals in Cohort B. Establi shing intervention -based cohorts will facilitate ongoing monitoring and evaluation for the purposes of this TQS . CM teams will use members' CCI scores as an indicator of risk to drive care coordination quality improvement through early intervention. CM teams will stratify all D -SNP members with SHCN using CCI scores, systematically prioritizing members with the highest CCI scores for immediate intervention. CM teams will initiate outreach to members to facilitate their completion of HRAs, create ICTs, de velop ICPs, and encourage enrollment with Papa Pals. CM teams provide all D -SNP members with SHCN individualized support, tailoring ICP interventions to their unique health goals and care preferences. CM will track and monitor completion of the ICP for all D-SNP members with SHCN and are ultimately responsible for coordinating members' benefits, monitoring progress toward goals, and maintaining records within our database for reporting purposes. For members who engage with PCS CM teams, we may deploy a co mbination of intervention strategies, including referral(s) to physical or mental health providers, education on disease process, strengthening communication between healthcare providers, increasing support during periods of care transitions, and facilitat ing enrollment with Papa Pals. Papa Pals provides curated companion support to members, including reminders for healthcare appointments, essential transportation, safety checks, reminders about care gaps or treatment recommendations, companionship or group activities, and assistance with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). A recent Papa Pals study shows that 69% of participants who participated in the program felt less lonely post -intervention and 39% reported not feeling lonely at OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 46 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 all.11 All D -SNP members with SHCN will receive education from PCS on the Papa Pals program via telephonic outreach and mailings. CM will encourage members to enroll with Papa Pals and offer support navigating the enrollment process. To ensure members receive care alig ned with their personal preferences, visits with Papa Pals may occur virtually or in person. Papa Pals screen members for loneliness at multiple intervals using the UCLA 3 -item loneliness scale. CM will monitor members' scores on the loneliness assessment to track changes in self -reported isolation and social connectedness. PCS will track and monitor care plan completion, loneliness assessment scores, Papa Pal visits, and ED utilization for members who engage in CM and enroll with Papa Pals (Cohort A). Fo r members who do not enroll with Papa Pals (Cohort B), PCS will track and monitor care plan completion and ED utilization. PCS will use the data collected for each cohort to compare interventions and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the CM and Papa Pa ls intervention in reducing ED utilization for D -SNP members with SHCN. F. Activities and monitoring for performance improvement : Activity 1 description : Identify all D -SNP members with SHCN and establish a baseline measurement of 2021 ED utilization.

Currently, the PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) Care Management (CM) team provides outreach to all members that meet the definition of having Special Health Care Needs (SHCN) , and again when a retriggering event takes place. In the PCS Columbia Gorge CCO (PCS - CG), 31.8% of our membership (4,726 members) meet the criteria for SHCN. In addition to outreach, we also receive referrals from members themselves, providers , and community partners. When the PCS CM team of Member Support Spe cialis ts and Clinicians work s with a member, it screen s for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and chronic conditions. When we identify a member experiencing homelessness, our workflows include referrals through the Connect Oregon platform to local housing agencies, follow -up with any community partner that the team may be working with on housing, and scheduling of interdisciplinary team meetings (IDTs) to bring providers and SDOH staff together to create a shared care pl an for the member. We frequently utilize Flexible Funding to support members with housing and other SDOH needs. For members with SHCN who elect to engage in CM services, we provide a full health assessment, development of a care plan , and goal setting, and we work with both the member and providers to ensure comprehensive and coordinated care across all systems. This includes schedu ling IDT meetings and routine revisi ons to the care plan. For members who do not participate in telephonic Care Management, we continue to coordinate and collaborate with the member's current providers (primary care, specialists, behavioral health, and acu te care settings) to ensure access, facilitate transitions, and strategize means of supporting the member through direct providers. PCS Care Coordinators provide clinical support and advocacy to our members with complex needs , with a focus on members wit h SHCN . They help to reduce SDOH and address barriers to care. Typically , they work as a team of a Clinician and a Member Support Specialist, creating an individualized plan of care for each member through assessments and conversations with the member and their broader healthcare team. These Care Coordination Teams collaborate with community providers and partners to assist in coordinating appropriate and timely care for our members while keeping the members' health needs at the forefront. PCS work s with an interactive voice system vendor (\"Eliza\") to conduct initial outreach to all of our prioritized population members , which includes all members identified as having SHCN . If a member agree s to engage , Eliza will provide a warm transfer to the Medicaid Care Management team , offer to leave a message for a callback , or offer I ntensive Care Coordination services. D.

OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 50 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 Homel essness in the United States is a critical challenge for healthcare systems in promoting basic health and well - being. Despite progress in reducing the number of homeless persons in the US, there has been a steady increase in homeless persons across the US since 2016, with an estimated 580,466 people experiencing homelessness in America.12 Oregon's homeless population lies in stark contrast with a much higher percentage of homeless persons than states on the East Coast and Midwest, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), a report providing estimates of the nation's homeless population, estimated 14,655 Oregonians experienced homelessness (35 in every 10,000 people) in 2020. Of this overall population, a subset of 4,339 individuals identified as \"chronically homeless.\"13 Chronic homelessness describes persons who have experienced homelessness for at least a year or repeated homelessness while als o experiencing a disabling condition such as substance use disorder, serious mental illness, or disabling physical condition. In addition to barriers and burdens caused by homelessness (e.g., food insecurity, safety issues, transportation, poverty), many homeless persons also contend with chronic health conditions and the inability to access routine health care and consequently rely upon emergency room care to treat both complex and routine medical issues. Access and routine care are more complex for thos e living with severe mental health -related conditions (e.g., bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, for example) as these persons grapple both with health -related issues and often untreated and persistent symptoms of mental illness. Persons with serious mental illness, or those meeting criteria for Severe and Persistent Mental Illness (SPMI), have been overrepresented in Oregon's homeless population, making up an estimated 14% of the homeless population in Oregon in 2017, with many of those representing the Chr onically Homeless.14 Through the CCO 2.0 focus on members with SHCN and challenges from the COVID -19 pandemic, PCS CM teams have found that SPMI coupled with homelessness are the primary drivers in our most complex cases. Our teams have found that members experiencing both SPMI and homelessness are less likely to engage in CM, are more likely to lack access to technology, and have unique needs and barriers related to managing their chronic conditions. One specific population that has been particularly chal lenging to engage is members with poorly controlled diabetes who are also experiencing homelessness. Our CM teams have observed unhoused members with diabetes who have had significant negative outcomes, including amputations, permanent disability, and deat h while living on the streets. The stories of these member experiences sparked our passion for improving how we take care of one of our most vulnerable and at -risk member populations. Knowing which members are homeless is a particular challenge as our data has been limited primarily to claims -based Z codes, which providers use inconsistently in documentation. In traditional health care settings, patients with diabetes are encouraged to assume a more dominant role in the self - management of the disease. They learn practical means of managing their conditions, such as diet, exercise, monitoring blood glucose, and the administration of medications or insulin.15 However, those experiencing chronic homelessness face obstacles in self -management not commonly exper ienced by housed persons with the same condition. This includes other SDOH such as lack of social and familial support, inability to store medications safely and securely, and food instability which can adversely affect a person's ability to adhere to trea tment plans (e.g., eating a nutrient -rich diet, exercise, adequate sleep, daily blood glucose testing and self -administration of medications). As noted, rates of persons identified as chronically homeless are high across most of Oregon. Determining how man y members experience both homelessness and poorly controlled diabetes in our CCOs has been difficult . However, one of the OHA Quality Incentive 12 National Alliance to End Homelessness, \"State of Homelessness: 2021 Edition,\" National Alliance to \"The 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress.

The 2020 CCO Metrics Performance Report , published in October 2021 by the Oregon Health Authority , indicates that for the PCS - CG CCO, 26.4% of members aged 18 -75 with diabetes had an A1C score <9.0% during the m easurement period , a rate that is higher than the regional target. Identification of members who meet the criteria for SPMI is readily available. As of Q3 2021, the number of members (including children and adults) who meet the criteria for S PMI was 1,028 members within the PCS - CG CCO. Challenges exist in the identification of CCO members who are chronically homeless and experience SMPI conditions. In 2021, PCS worked closely with Collective Medical Technology (CMT) to add a flag in charts for members li sted with the Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), which is used to collect and track data related to people experiencing homelessness. The PCS - LN CCO now has access to this flag in CMT to identify members experiencing homelessness; however, d ue to challenges related to COVID vaccine prioritization, this flag has not been activated statewide. PCS has also worked to integrate additional data streams into internal algorithms to help flag whether a member has any indicators of housing insecurity, including data from member addresses, Connect Oregon data, and Z - coded claims. E. Brief narrative description : The target cohort for intervention is chronically homeless CCO members who fall into the SPMI prioritized population and have an A1C score above 9%. However, due to the limited availability of specific member -level data that indicates whether a member is chronically unhoused, we may expand the population to members with an i ndicator of housing insecurity and a condition grouper flag for diabetes. The first year of this project will include building a comprehensive plan, including developing tools for potential screening and data collection of eligible CCO members (those who h ave indicators of housing insecurity and diabetes ), in partnership with Patient -Centered Primary Care Home (PCPCH) clinics per CCO region. Data collection efforts may include screening tools, member outreach, and care coordination to determine whether a me mber is experiencing chronic homelessness, uncontrolled diabetes, and SPMI. In future years of project implementation, we plan to marry this data with REALD and SOGI data to further track trends and development interventions to reduce health disparities. P CS will use this information to enhance person -centered interventions to improve health outcomes and well -being. We also intend to collaborate internally and externally with our partners to capture necessary data. We will focus our efforts on those CCO me mbers accessing primary care services with in a PCPCH setting and known to the medical programs as experiencing homelessness. We will build relationships with PCPCH providers as part of this project implementation, and we will work with the PCPCH to align s taffing, survey available resources within the PCPCH and CCO regions, and survey staff to explore the needs and challenges within each region. F. Activities and monitoring for performance improvement : Activity 1 description : Our initial effort will be to bu ild partnerships within our service regions. PCS will focus on identifying PCP clinics that support the chronically unhoused population. We will work together to identify members and build workflows to ensure proper utilization of services and ensure membe rs are well wrapped in care coordination to address their SDOH needs as well as coordinate their healthcare needs.

Identifying this population is difficult due to the complexity and barriers experienced by the chronically unhoused, so it is vital PCS builds the data infrastructure needed to monitor this population. Reliable data will allow us to better facilitate referrals to a PCP and reduce the inappropriate use of the ED for unmanaged diabetes through improved care coordination.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. The PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) Utilization Review (UR) P rogram is an integrated and comprehensive system that evaluate s the medical necessity, appropriateness, and efficacy o f health care services, whether physical, behavioral health, or oral health -related. The UR Program reviews requests for care and services according to PacificSource approved or endorsed policies and procedures and the member's health benefits, in complian ce with federal and state regulatory agencies and industry accrediting standards. PCS uses multiple methods to detect over - and under -utilization of services, including analyzing experience reports and dashboards, convening committees for review, analyzi ng appeals and grievances, and analyzing U R Program data. PCS reviews reporting in several forums, including the Health Council and through an internal Cost of Care Committee, which includes our Medical Directors and line of business vice presidents. In ad dition, PCS review s under - and over -utilization through various quality committees with external providers. Our CCO Quality Incentive Measure (QIM) Team also monitors for over - and under -utilization of services by evaluating monthly utilization data and ta rget graphs to determine where to focus provider outreach. Lastly, each year, the Medicaid Medical Director and representatives from critical departments meet to review data from the previous year regarding utilization, costs, and decision status. This data helps to inform which services should require a preapproval. One area of focus for the UR Program is Emergency Department (ED) utilization over time . As shown in the excerpt from the ED Utilization Dashboard below, the PCS -Columbia Gorge (CG) region began to see an upward trend in ED utilization in 2021, following the rapid decline during the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result of this data, w e worked with our regional provider partners to collaboratively address access to care concerns that may have increased the likelihood of our members seeking care in the ED. This is one example of how PCS leverages internal analytics tools to affect utiliz ation.

In that year, OHA selected three episodes as recommend ed initial focus areas: Asthma, Diabetes, and Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Analyzing areas of over and underutilization, in addition to episode of care costs available in the MEPP tool including variation in Adverse Actionable Event (AAE) costs, guided ou r MEPP team in developing interventions to positively impact health outcomes and reduce avoidable health care utilization (including ED utilization ) over time. PCS implemented a MEPP focused on asthma with an action plan submitted in 2020 and interventions spanning 2020 -2021. PCS is discontinuing this MEPP project in 2022 as we designed short -term interventions, including a one -time educational mailing campaign for members with asthma (please see attachment nine (ATTM 9) for the complete final MEPP closeout report). D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report. For 2022, the PCS MEPP Steering Group convened to explore the data available in the MEPP dashboard, including AAE costs by episode of care, episode subtypes, procedure codes, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, and diagnoses codes. After reviewing the data, P CS adopted asthma as one of three of its episodes of focus. The Steering Group chose this episode of care based on its significant contributions to state -wide costs, broad impacts on Oregon's population, and alignment with state policies. To improve qualit y and episode of care costs, PCS will continue to engage internal workgroups for this episode type to oversee and implement action plans for intervention strategies specific to this chronic condition. MEPP workgroups include Medical Directors, Clinical Qua lity Coordinators, Healthcare Data Analysts, and subject matter experts (SMEs) related to each episode. The MEPP: Asthma Workgroup examined the available MEPP Dashboards for meaningful insights to inform the overall implementation strategy outlined in the 2022 MEPP Project Proposal for PCS-CG. The following information provides a subset of the reviewed data elements. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 56 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS-CG MEPP Dashboard Excerpt CCO Dashboard CY18 Drilldown Dashboard (accessed 12/15/2021) The PCS -CG MEPP data shows that asthma contributed over $1 million of total costs for CY18 -CY20, with over $330,000 of these costs designated as AAE in the dashboard. This means that 30.6% of asthma episode costs were AAE, which is higher than the 26.6% of overall CCO cos ts determined to be AAE according to the \"3. Provider Comparison\" report. I n addition, asthma is one of the most prevalent conditions among our pediatric membership, which is an important group to include in our strategic MEPP interventions . (Note that for this data excerpt of the MEPP Dashboard, we set all filters to active and selected a lower enrollment gap filter threshold to 45 days). Within the MEPP Dashboard Episode Drilldown, ED utilization (99284 and 99285) are the top two procedure codes with the most AAE costs. Medication adherence among members with asthma is an important factor to avoid more costly healthcare utilization (such as ED utilization), as well as improve health outcomes . As part of its project development, the MEPP: Asthma Workgroup reviewed pharmacy denials data and discovered a significant amount of denied pharmacy claims for asthma maintenance inhalers. The data showed that many members who received a denial never received an alternative maintenance inhaler to help with their chro nic condition. About 15% of these members had subsequent ED, Urgent Care, or Inpatient Admits with asthma -related primary or secondary diagnoses. This data points to the denial of claims for maintenance inhalers as an area of opportunity to reduce increase d ED and Urgent Care visits asso ciated with asthma. Cost Benefit Analysis The MEPP dashboard identifies over $330,000 AAE costs for asthma episodes in the PCS -CG region for the CY18 -20 time period when costs are \"split\" among different episodes. There are over $745,000 AAE costs for asthma episodes when looking at \"unsplit\" costs (i.e., fully attributing costs to the asthma episode even when multiple episodes are identified). This means significant savings are associated with improving episodes of care for our members with asthma. There were $63,788 AAE costs for the top two ED procedure codes identified in the MEPP dashboard. When looking at AAE costs by DRG code, there was $23,788 in AAE cost for code 203, \"bronchitis and asthma without complications.\" This data indicates that costly hospital utilization is a driver of AAE costs for this episode. Annualizing the cost of these targeted codes leads to an estimated potential savings opportunity of up to $30,000. There are currently no anticipated additional direct expenses due to the project activities identified for implementation. We plan to use existing staffing, resources, and communication channels to execute the project plan. Therefore, we expect the project's potential savings to exceed the anticipated costs.

Brief narrative description : In 2022, the PCS -CG Asthma MEPP Project will address the underutilization of maintenance inhalers by Medicaid members with asthma. The project team will expand the pharmacy formulary to include more low -cost inhalers and inform providers of the covered benefit changes to achieve th is improvement. This project intends to improve medication adherence and lower avoidable utilization of in -patient, urgent care, and ED visits related to asthm a. In addition, we aim to increase proper inhaler use by offering educational materials to our pr ovider partners .

OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 62 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS-CG MEPP Dashboard Excerpt CCO Dashboard CY18 -20, Episode Drilldown Dashboard (accessed 12/15/2021) In the MEPP dashboard, depression and diabetes episodes are among the top four highest AAE cost epi sodes in the PCS - CG CCO region for CY18 -CY20. Working at the intersection of these two conditions could help reduce costs in both episodes while improving the well -being of a population that includes some of our most medically complex members. Depression and diabetes are comorbid conditions that exacerbate and worsen symptoms of the other, leading to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare utilization. Proper management of this high -risk population could help to reduce the $875K AAE costs associated with diabetes and $375K AAE costs associated with depression and anxiety in the MEPP tool. Note that for these figures, all filters were active and the lower enrollment gap filter threshold set to 45 days. Expansion of Behavioral Health Integration Provi der Incentive Programs (BHI Program) will help drive healthcare transformation by financially supporting participating provider groups to make steps towards fully integrated behavioral health in primary care settings. Involving multidisciplinary teams in t he care for members with diabetes and depression could help lower symptoms of depression, increase healthy lifestyle behaviors, and improve glycemic control of our members \u2014enhancing their quality of life and improving long -term costs. PCS has been working with Patient -Centered Primary Care Home s (PCPCHs ) to support interventions for members with depression and diabetes. In 2021, P CS began gathering data from PCPCH clinics regarding this population and their utilization of integrated behavioral health. PCS will offer and track attendance at L earning Collaborative s for PCPCH clinics that are part of the BHI Program to support efforts t o improve the behavioral health of this population. Additionally, PCS will continue to gather data from PCPCH clinics to help support program evaluation. PCS will develop and monitor behavioral health utilization among members with diabetes and depression for participating provider groups according to available claims data. Over time, the member population served will experience improved well- being and higher engagement in their care. This project intends to increase team -based care for members with diabete s and depression, which can help mitigate improper ED utilization and other long -term complications of depression and diabetes (i.e., kidney failure, ketoacidosis, and poor medication adherence). To better understand the impacts of this work, PCS will also enhance reporting tools for ED utilization to allow for easier monitoring of over -utilization among members with diabetes and depression diagnoses. In 2022, the MEPP team will enhance current reporting tools, monitor the metric to understand any areas of opportunity to drive further MEPP strategies and develop a baseline of ED utilization in this specific population. Cost -Benefit Analysis The MEPP Dashboard identifies over $1,476,000 in AAE costs for diabetes episodes in the PCS -CG region for the CY18 -20 time period (when costs are \"unsplit\" among different episodes). Internal data show that 30.5% of members with a diabetes diagnosis also have a diagnosis of depression. Currently, about 90% of our members with diabetes and OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 63 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 depression have an active assignm ent with a participating BHI PCPCH clinic. Therefore, working with our provider partners at the intersection of these two episodes of care, we hope to make a meaningful impact on the well -being of a significant portion of members with diabetes. Diving int o a more detailed level of AAE costs, some of the top procedure codes are 99284 and 99285 for ED visits. Additional expenses for ED utilization are reflected for codes 99281, 99282, and 99283. There were $96,926 \"unsplit\" AAE costs for these ED procedure c odes identified in the MEPP Dashboard. When looking at AAE costs by DRG code, there were $21,936 in AAE costs for code 639, \"diabetes w/o cc/mcc.\" This data indicate that costly hospital utilization is a driver of AAE costs for the diabetes episode. Annua lizing the cost of these targeted codes and assuming that our intervention population includes about 27.5% of overall members with a diabetes episode (the subset with a diagnosis of depression and assigned to a BHI partner) leads to an estimated potential savings opportunity of up to $11,000. There are currently no anticipated additional direct expenses due to the project activities identified for implementation. PCS has already launched t he Behavioral Health Integration Value Based Payment ( VBP) Program an d funding . This year we are emphasizing the impact of this program's effort more explicitly on our members living with diabetes. We plan to use existing staffing, consulting resources, and communication channels to execute the project plan. Therefore, we anticipate the project's potential savings to exceed the anticipated costs.

Intersections With Health Eq uity The overall impact on health equity outcomes is unclear at this time. There are challenges to evaluating these impacts due to the small population size of those with depression and diabetes and being able to make any definitive conclusions about dispa rities due to statistically insignificant sample sizes. We risk exposing protected health information due to these low sample sizes. Health equity will remain a focal point when evaluating program implementation, but we may not be able to measure dispariti es in a statistically valid way. When we look at our overall member population, current i nternal data suggest that our PCPCH groups participating in the BHI Program excel at offering culturally and linguistically appropriate care to many member groups such as our Hispanic/Latinx members and members requiring an interpreter. Through team -based care for members with diabetes within our PCPCH s, we have historically seen strong e ngagement among key populations such as our Hispanic/ Latinx membership, and hope to continue to move health equity in behavioral health forward. E. Brief narrative description : In 2022, the PCS-CG Depression and Diabetes MEPP Project will focus on Medicaid members aged 12 years or older who have diagnoses of both diabetes and depression. This project aims to improve the utilization of behavioral health services for the target population to reduce long -term complications and potentially avoidable utilization of costly health care services. The project will achieve this by conducting Learning Collaboratives specific to the sub -population identified with diabetes and depression. A licensed clinical psychologist will conduct these Collaboratives to educate provid ers implementing evidenced -based practices of treating and improving quality outcomes related to this specific co-occurring health condition. Providers will be encouraged to identify this subpopulation among their overall patient population and offer BH se rvices when appropriate. These collaboratives will be completed by end of 2022. F.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. The PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) Utilization Review (UR) Program is an integrated and comprehensive system that evaluate s the medical necessity, appropriateness, and efficacy of health care services, whether physical, behavioral health, or oral health -related. The UR Program reviews requests for care and services according to PacificSource approved or endorsed policies and procedures and the member's health benefits, in compliance with federal and state regulatory agencies and industry accrediting standards. PCS uses multiple methods to detect over - and under -utilization of services, including analyzing experience reports and dashboards, convening committees for review, analyzing appeals and grievances, and analyzing U R data. PCS reviews reporting in several forums, including the Health Council and through an internal Cost of Care Committee, which includes our Medical Directors and line of business vice presidents. In addition, PCS review s over - and under -utilization through various quality committees with external providers. Our CCO Quality Incentive Measure (QIM) Team also monitors for under - and over -utilization of services by evaluating monthly utilization data and target graphs to determine where to focus their provider outreach . Lastly, each year the Medicaid Medical Director and representatives from critical departments meet to review data from the previous year regarding utilization, costs, and decision status. This data helps to inform which services should require a preappro val. One area of focus for the UR Program is Emergency Department (ED) utilization over time. As shown in the excerpt from the ED Utilization Dashboard below, the PCS -Columbia Gorge (CG) region began to see an upward trend in ED utilization in 2021, follow ing the rapid decline during the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result of this data, we worked with our regional provider partners to collaboratively address access to care concerns that may have increased the likelihood of our members seeking care i n the ED. This is one example of how PCS leverages internal analytics tools to affect utilization. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 68 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS - CG ED Visit Count Per Thousand Members Per Year (PTMPY) Line: Rolling 12 mo. rate; Circle: Point -in-time rate In addition to PCS' ongoing utiliza tion monitoring, in 2020, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) challenged CCOs to leverage the Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program (MEPP) tool to identify actionable opportunity areas to implement meaningful interventions. In that year, OHA selected t hree episodes as recommended initial focus areas: Asthma, Diabetes, and Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Analyzing areas of over - and under -utilization, in addition to episode of care costs available in the MEPP tool, including variation in adverse actionable event (AAE) costs, guided our MEPP team in developing interventions to positively impact health outcomes and reduce avoidable health care utilization (including ED utilization) over time. PCS implemented a MEPP focused on SUD with an action plan submitted in 2020 and interventions spanning 2020 -2021. PCS is discontinuing this MEP P project in 2022 as we designed short - term interventions, including a one -time educational webinar for providers (please see attachment eleven \"ATTM 11 \" for the final MEPP closeou t report). D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. This TQS project is the same for all PCS' CCO regions, except for region -specific data throughout the report. For 2022, the PCS MEPP Steering Group convened to explore the data available in the MEPP dashboard, including AAE costs by episodes of care, episode subtypes, procedure codes, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, and diagnoses codes. After reviewing the data, PCS adopted SUD as one of three of its episodes of focus. The group chose this episode of care based on their significant contributions to state -wide costs, broad impacts on Oregon's population, and alignment with state policies. To improve quality and epi sode of care costs, PCS will continue to engage internal workgroups for each episode type to oversee and implement action plans for intervention strategies specific to each chronic condition. These workgroups include Medical Directors, Clinical Quality Coo rdinators, Healthcare Data Analysts, and subject matter experts ( SMEs) related to each episode. The MEPP: Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Workgroup examined the available MEPP Dashboards to gain meaningful insights to inform the overall implementation strate gy outlined in the 2022 MEPP Project Proposal for the PCS-CG region. The table below shows that the SUD episode type has the highest AAE costs of any episode in the region. These high AAE costs, in addition to OHA's indicated interest in interventions for the SUD episode of care, led us to pursue strategies to improve care coordination for our members with SUD. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Page 69 of 75 Last updated: 03/15/2022 PCS - CG MEPP Dashboard Excerpt CCO Dashboard CY18 -20, Episode Drilldown Dashboard (accessed 12/15/2021) Providing services for those with SUD may require referrals and lengthy coordination among providers. Barriers to accessing care could be due to patient el igibility, provider or patient knowledge, lack of referral resources and capacity, and issues with communic ation betwee n the referral source and patient.16 These barriers are more complex if the SUD provider is outside of the region where the patient and their provider reside. After considering the high percentage of AAE costs associated with SUD, the MEPP: SUD Workgroup identified improved care coordination for SUD services as an actionable intervention strategy. This work aims to improve the utilization of appropriate SUD treatment services to reduce AAE costs associated with SUD. In developing this strategy, the MEPP: SUD Workgroup coordinated with the Behavioral Health Population Health (BHPH) team to develop a comprehensive SUD Technical Assistance (TA) Toolkit to clarify the roles and responsibilities for providers in coordinating and providing services for PCS members as they access various American Soc iety of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) levels of care throughout Oregon. Education and training may help bridge the gap in substance use treatment and increase the ability of a provider to detect SUD and appropriately refer to treatment.17 We intend for the SUD TA Toolkit to identify gaps or barriers in referral and coordination processes between SUD providers and agencies and how they impact PCS members. Through improved care coordination and education on appropriate treatment referral resources, this project a ims to increase SUD treatment of our CCO members and decrease the high amount of AAE costs in hospital settings demonstrated in the MEPP tool in DRG codes 897 (Alcohol/Drug abuse or dependence w/o rehabilitation therapy w/o MCC) and CPT codes 99285 and 992 84 for ED services. Throughout the project, MEPP project leaders will be monitoring the Initiation and Engagement of Substance Use Disorder Treatment (NQF 0004) Quality Incentive Measure (QIM) to understand potential impacts of the project to the actual rates of SUD treatment for our CCO members. Current QIM reporting allows internal project leaders to understand performance both at the CCO and the provider group level, which will help support programmatic outreach strategies. In addition, PCS will modify current reporting to allow project leaders to monitor ED utilization for SUD among CCO members aged 13 and older. This monitoring measure will help PCS project l eaders understand baseline utilization and look for opportunities to drive MEPP strategies directed at lowering the costs of the SUD episode. 16 Abdalla, S.

There are over $1,838,000 AAE costs for SUD episodes when looking at \"unsplit\" costs (i.e., fully attributing costs to the SUD episode even when we identify multiple episodes) . This project partners with regional Patient -Centered Primary Care Home (PCPCH) Provider Groups with at least 50% of the assigned CCO membership, which means that there are significant savings associated with working with our PCPCH Provider Groups to impr ove episodes of care for our members with SUD. Diving into a more detailed level of AAE costs, the top procedure codes in terms of costs are 99284 and 99285 for ED visits. Additional expenses for ED utilization are present for codes 99281, 99282, and 99283 . There were $206,828 \"unsplit\" AAE costs for these ED procedure codes identified in the MEPP Dashboard. When looking at AAE costs by DRG code, there were $192,976 in AAE costs for code 897, \"alcohol or drug abuse or dependence w/o rehabilitation therapy or MCC\" and $36,159 in AAE costs for code 918 \"poisoning and toxic effects of drugs w/o MCC.\" This data underline that costly hospital utilization is a driver of AAE costs for the SUD episode. Annualizing the cost of these targeted codes (and assuming a po pulation reach of 50%) leads to an estimated potential savings opportunity of up to $73,000. There are currently no anticipated additional direct expenses due to the project activities identified for implementation. We plan to use existing staffing, provid er partnerships , and communication channels to execute the project plan. Therefore, we expect the project's potential savings to exceed the anticipated costs.

Intersections with Health Equity Disparities exist in the treatment and coordination of care for members with primary health care needs than members with a SUD diagnosis. The SUD TA Toolkit will increase alignment and integration to ensure members and their providers can receive the same standard and experience of care for SUD services they would for the primary care referral process. It also aims to decrease the stigma of seeking SUD services, di agnosis, referral, and treatment of substance use by supporting education and resources of the process. Therefore, this project intends to improve health equity for members with a substance use disorder. The overall impact of the SUD TA Toolkit o n other health equity outcomes is unclear at this time. However, health equity continues to be a critical perspective as we design and implement intervention s. For example, PacificSource's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) team will review the SUD TA Toolkit to ensure that we are following Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services best practices when applicable . The TA Toolkit will also offer information to providers on how to access interpreter vendor services to help ensure that we are meeting our mem bers' linguistic need s. Additionally, one key audience of this SUD TA Toolkit is our PCPCH Provider G roups. Internal data suggests that these groups excel at engaging and offering culturally and linguistically appropriate care to many member groups , such a s our Hispanic/Latinx members and members requiring an interpreter. Through boosting education and resources within our PCPCH Provider Groups where we have seen strong engagement, we hope to continue to move health equity in behavioral health forward. E. Brief narrative description : In 2022, the PCS -CG SUD MEPP project will work to reduce AAE and costs associated with SUD by working with PCPCH Provider Groups in coordinating and providing services to adult PCS members as they access various ASAM levels of care throughout Oregon. The BHPH team will distribute the SUD TA Toolkit to providers to help identify gaps or barriers in referral and coordination processes between SUD providers and agencies to ensure adult PCS members receive the appropriate level of care and achieve their treatment goals. Additionally, t he BHPH team will provide TA to support providers in streamlining the referral to appropriate services process , as well as coordination of services for the member upon entering and exiting treatment to ensur e successful reintegration into their community , which includes transportation, housing supports, and follow up supports.

Project short title: Improving Access to Care and Monitoring B. Project unique ID (as provided by OHA) : 143 C. Criteria for project discontinuation: CCO's and/or organizations' resources must be reprioritized and shifted to other bodies of work D. Reason(s) for project discontinuation in support of the selected criteria above (max 250 words): In late 2020, PCS launched a healthcare access survey to monitor member accessibility. Each month, PCS ma ils out 4,000 surveys to members who have had a recent appointment with a physical, behavioral, oral healthcare provider or a traditional health worker (THW). Response rates are lower than anticipated despite increasing the sample size in mid - 2021. However , the work is still meaningful as we can collect direct member feedback and work with individuals to resolve barriers to care. For example, we are still able to work directly with members who request an interpreter/translation help and provide education to members who indicate they are unaware of Non -Emergent Medical Transportation services. PCS decided to discontinue the Access to Care and Monitoring project, given the challenges of gaining statistically significant data from surveys. Without meaningful d ata, PCS could not identify actionable improvement opportunities to increase members' access to care. In addition, PCS fully completed and adopted the project's site visit initiative to centralize visit information into one system. For these reasons, we de cided to reprioritize project resources to serve new access initiatives. Regardless of discontinuing this TQS, PCS will continue efforts to improve access data, including contracting with a vendor in 2022 to increase response rates in our Provider Access t o Care Survey and adding additional language translations to our member access to care surveys.

Criteria for project discontinuation: CCO's and/or organizations' resources must be reprioritized and shifted to other bodies of work D. Reason(s) for project discontinuation in support of the selected criteria above (max 250 words): The initial goal of the U tilization Review TQS project was to monitor the utilization of specialty healthcare services by Intensive Care Coordination (ICC) m embers and observe if the use of specialty care seemed to affect the use of emergency care for these members. Unfortunately, the COVID -19 severely impacted the utilization of healthcare services, which drastically slowed down after March 2020. Below is a visualization of the emergency department to Specialist visit ratios over time, a metric we hoped to use to monitor the use of specialty and emergency care for our ICC and non -ICC members. We can see that within the CCO region, healthcare utilization decrea sed enormously after the beginning of the pandemic , and t he inability to establish a baseline f or utilization made measuring progress in this project challenging, if not impossible. After further consideration and evaluation of the feedback provided by OHA , PCS decided to retire this project and reprioritize resources to a project that will have a more significant impact on our membership and measurable data support with achievable outcomes.

Performance improvement projects iii. Quality Incentive Metrics (QIM) - Collection and submission of performance measurement data iv. Mechanisms to detect both underutilization and o verutilization of services v. Mechanisms to assess the quality and appropriateness of care furnished to members with special health care needs, as defined by the State in the quality strategy under 42 CFR 438.340 c. The Quality Program of PacificSource Community Solutions ( PCS) is designed to ensure that the m embers of our CCOs have access to high quality health care that is safe, effective, provides a positive experience, and results in positive outcomes. The quality program is driven by our mission, values, str ategic goals, and objectives. d. PacificSource's Clinical Quality and Utilization Management Committee (CQUM) is the advisory body for quality, utilization management, and performance improvement activities under the direct authority of the Chief Medical Off icer (CMO) or a delegated Medical Director. The Chief Medical Officer collaborates with, and receives input and recommendations from the Committee regarding quality, utilization management, appeals and grievances, and performance improvement activities. Re gular reports of Committee's activities will be made to the internal Quality Improvement Committee. e. PacificSource's Quality Improvement Committee (QIC) consists of PacificSource staff who work together to provide consistency in the oversight of clinical and service quality for the Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial, and Exchange lines of business. The QIC's areas of oversight include new and changing medical, dental, and behavioral technology, clinical policies and programs, member and provider satisfaction, and quality initiatives. The QIC reviews clinical care events and other identified quality concerns, recommending finalized QI program content to the Executive Management Group (EMG) for approval. The QIC provides oversight and accountability for the QI Program across all LOB. Strategic initiatives, as they pertain to QI programs are reviewed and approved by this Committee. As such, the QIC oversees the development of the Transformation and Quality Strategy and makes recommendations to EMG for review and approval. f. Additional committees within PacificSource that support health transformation and quality improvement within our CCOs include the Medicaid Leadership Team , the Community Advisory Councils, the Provider Engagement Panels or Clinical Advisory Panel s, the Quality Incentive Measures (QIM) Steering Committee, the Behavioral Health CQUM Committee, the Government Operations Committee, and the Cross Departmental Medicaid Committee. II. Transformation and Quality Strategy a. The Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) is a means by which PCS develops transformative, innovative, and member -driven strategies to improve member experience, increase efficiencies, address SDOH -E, and integrate care across the systems. b. The TQS is a reporting requirement to the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) that aim s to move health transformation forward, reduce duplication of efforts, align CCO priorities, and enhance innovation supported by targeted activities. c. TQS Development Process: i. The development of the TQS is a collaborative effort involving multiple depart ments within PacificSource and input from many external partners including the CCO's health council governing board s and Community Advisory Council s (CACs) . The PacificSource Executive Management Group (EMG) , Medicaid Leadership Team (MLT) , and TQS Advisory Committee have ultimate oversight of the TQS and provide adequate resourcing through an annual strategic planning and information technology support process. A charter, annual work plan, and multi- year work plan are developed and refined through multiple iterations of review and feedback by internal and external stakeholders. ii. The TQS is composed of projects that are representative of the CCO's activities related to health care transformation and quality. Th e TQS Quality Team and Project Leads utilize the following data sets to identify ongoing or new initiatives in the component areas specified by the Oregon Health Authority: 1. Regional /Community Health Assessment 2. Regional /Community Health Improvement Plan 3. PacificSource Strategic Plan 4. Delivery System Network (DSN) Evaluation 5. External Quality Review 6. Information Systems Capability Assessment 7. Office of Inspector General Audit Utilizing these sources, the T QS Quality Team and Project Leads identif y a short list of potential projects for inclusion in each year's TQS . This list, with project descriptions, is then proposed to internal stakeholders , including the MLT and QIC for input, feedback, and approval. The proposed list goes to the health council board s and the CACs for input and guidance. Once drafted, the projects under go a thorough review by the TQS Advisory Commit tee, which is comprised of department directors and subject matter experts (SMEs). The TQS Advisory Committee reviews each project to assess feasibility, transformational qualities, resource needs, and project scope. Once approved, the project descriptions are finalized for inclusion in the TQS. The final TQS is then reviewed in totality by the MLT, EMG, QIC, and local health co uncil board s for final approval. The TQS Quality Team meets throughout the year to manage projects, collect feedback, and address any concerns with the reporting requirements. The MLT and QIC continue to have oversight of the TQS, receiving regular status updates. Status updates are provided to the health council boards and CAC s at regular intervals. The CAC s are consulted on all aspects of member experience as it relates to projects within the TQS. d. CCO Organizational Structure for Developing and Managing the TQS : i. PCS CCOs are operated by PacificSource and the health c ouncil s throug h formal Joint Management Agreement s. PacificSource has responsibility for managing OHP benefits and quality improvement activities, including developing and implementing the TQS. While PacificSource staff take lead on the management of TQS projects, the de sign of the TQS and the project work is shared between PacificSource staff, health c ouncil staff and committees, and other community partners. These groups provide input on setting priorities, TQS program development , and evaluation . ii. The T QS is part of the PacificSource Strategic Plan, demonstrating the commitment of the company's EMG to its success. The TQS Advisory Committee provides subject matter expertise, oversight, and delivers regular updates to senior leadership. The health c ouncil board s and CAC s also receive updates on the status of the TQS. e. TQS Oversight Committees : PacificSource's Internal QIC consists of PacificSource staff who work together to provide consistent oversight of clinical and service quality and accountability for impleme nting the Quality Improvement Program for the Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial, and Exchange lines of business. As such, the QIC oversees the development of the TQS and makes recommendations to the PacificSource EMG for review and approval. f. Evaluation of t he impact and effectiveness of the TQS i. The TQS is an annual deliverable to the OHA due in March . . The TQS Quality Team meets with TQS Project Leads throughout the year to assess program effectiveness and identify areas for continued improvement. PacificSource evaluate s the effectiveness in meeting project outcomes and deliverables and includes this i nformation in the following years' TQS report . ii. The QIC and the CQUM Committee review and approve the TQS annually and offer guidance on improvement strategies and defining the following year's goals. The TQS Quality Team meets to review the progress of TQ S projects to determine impact and course correct if there are deficiencies in meeting set targets and activities. III. Performance Improvement Projects a. As part of the CMS 1115 Medicaid Waiver and 42 CFR 438.330(d) , all CCOs are expected to participate in a statewide Performance Improvement Project (PIP) and three additional PIPs on a topic of the CCO's choosing. b. The intention of the PIPs is for CCOs to cover a wide array of clinical improvem ents that are important to meet identified community needs and CCO strategic direction in meeting the Triple Aim. c. PIP topics are selected from eight Focus Areas: i. Reducing preventable re -hospitalizations ii. Addressing population health issues iii. Deploying care teams to improve care and reduce preventable or unnecessarily - costly utilization by super -utilizers iv. Integrating primary and behavioral health v. Ensuring appropriate care is delivered in appropriate settings vi. Improving perinatal and maternity care vii. Improving primary care for all population through increase d adoption of the Patient -Centered Primary Care Home Model of care throughout the CCO network viii. Addressing Social Determinants of Health and Equity d. Four of the above focus areas will be addressed for each CCO through one Statewide PIP, and three PIPs of the CCO's choosing. Topic selections among the Focus Areas is arrived at from the following criteria: i. Review of data and quality measures to identify areas of low performance against a benchmark. 1. Including rev iew of data by language, ethnicity, race, and gender ii. Alignment of projects with state and federal strategies and the health plan quality strategy. iii. Review of internal utilization data to identify areas of need for the population. iv. Input from panel providers and consideration of topics relevant to all lines of business. e. Reports are submitted quarterly to OHA per contract deadlines. f. The PIPs are reviewed and approved annually by PacificSource's QIC and by a panel of providers on the CQUM Committee . g. The PIP reports include data on race, ethnicity, language, and gender when applicable to support project outcomes, determine health disparities, and in selection of a PIP's target population. h. The PIPs undergo continuous quality improvement and evaluation to ensure the goals and interventions are effective and creating a positive impact for our CCO members. IV. Quality Incentive Me trics (QIM) - Collection and submission of performance measurement data a. Quality Incentive Metrics (QIMs) are tools to track the quality of health care services provided to our members. PacificSource works collaboratively with our provider partners to ensure our members receive quality care. b. An integral component of the QIM Program is to ensure CCOs collect and report quality, cost, and utilization data in a consistent way so performance across state CCOs can be compared. c. PCS collects and performs data analysis on the OHA QIM on a monthly basis. The QIMs are tracked and trended each month to ensure the success of the Program across the CCOs. The measurements cover various aspects of care and are measured using administrative and/or hybrid method, and aggregate electronic health record data. The organization follows specifications defined by NCQA and OHA and uses certified software. i. Measures fall into one or more categories: 1. CCO Incentive measures, for which CCOs are eligible to receive payments based on their performance each year; and 2. State Quality measures, which OHA has agreed to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices (CMS) as part of Oregon's 1115 Medicaid waiver. d. PCS staff responsible for QIM meet monthly to review trends and areas of concern, sharing with Internal and External Stakeholders. i. The external Health Council Operations Committee, CCO Clinical Advisory Councils, CCO QIM Collaborations, QIM Regional Improvement Team s and QIM Regional Advisory Teams, and internal QIM Steering Committee review the QIM Program monthly to evaluate its effectiveness and implement strategies in areas of im provement. ii. The QIM Program Manager and regionally based QIM Practice Coaches meet with clinic staff to review clinic level performance, assist with mitigation planning, support providers to successfully submit qualified codes via claims submission, implem ent QI initiatives, and troubleshoot any issues that arise in complying with QIM reporting. 1. Providers are responsible for pulling data from their EHRs according to Oregon Health Authority (OHA) technical specifications for each eCQM measure. 2. Reports to i dentify gaps by providers and clinic are used to drive performance improvement and identify areas of underutilization . iii. Joint Steering Committees comprised of executive level PCS and clinic staff meet quarterly to monitor quality performance, oversee improv ement strategies and endorse mitigation/escalation plans to improve quality performance. e. Evaluation and Effectiveness of the QIM Improvement Work Plan and Initiatives i. Program evaluations are conducted annually and presented to the QIM Steering Committee an d Quality Improvement Committee. This evaluation includes annual results, detailed trends, review of annual work plan progress and initiative effectiveness/outcomes. The annual review is used to inform program planning, identify focused efforts/initiative needs for the upcoming year's work plan. V. Mechanisms to detect both underutilization and overutilization of services a. PacificSource utilizes a variety of reports produced by the analytics and actuarial departments to detect over and underutilization. These reports include analysis and trending of all health services broken down by categories (such as inpatient, outpatient, physician, pharmacy, etc.), as well as more specific services, such as ED use rate and readmissions. Examples of recurring r eports used to detect utilization trends include: i. Medicaid Utilization and Experience Report ing ii. CCO Dashboard s iii. QIM Dashboards iv. DCO Dashboard (Dental Utilization Report) v. Behavioral Health Dashboards (SPMI Dashboard, SPMI ED_IP Dashboard) vi. CAP Steering Report (Hospital CAP Dashboard) vii. OHP Readmission report (FUHMI Readmit Dashboard ) Examples of reports that have been genera ted ad hoc to investigate specific utilization trends include: i. Pre-post CAP Analysis ii. Out of area transfers (Air Ambulance Claims) b. These reports are reviewed in a number of forums, including the internal Cost of Care Committee, which includes all company medical directors and line of business vice presidents . In addition, specific dashboards are produced to monitor our capitated contracts and these are reviewed in meetings specific to those leadership individuals. Lastly, ad hoc reports are used to assess trends that may need to be addressed as a result of payment methodology or market conditions. c. Specific trend reporting is achieved using the Medicaid Quarterly Experience and Utilization report, which provides data on utilization with comparison for same period in prior year, as well as pharmacy data that identifies medications with high cost and utilization. The Dental Quality Measure and Utilization report details utilization of dental services and the Behavioral Health dashboard monitors ED and IP stays for members with BH diagnoses. d. In addition to the above, PSCS has a Quality Incentive Me tric (QIM) Team that monitors for over - and underutilization of services. The QIM CCO Summary Report provides monthly utilization data and target graphs to determine where targeted outreach to provide rs is needed. e. The Clinical Quality Team monthly reviews CCO, QIM, Behavioral Health, and Dental dashboards . As noted above, other reporting is reviewed in the Cost of Care meetings and in specific venues that address specific populations or contracts. Trends in underutilization are identified by analyzing ou r internal administrative data and comparing the monthly data points to our quarterly goals. Follow -up actions can include provider or member outreach/ education, provider contracting changes, community partnership s and other strategic activities. VI. Mechan isms to assess the quality and appropriateness of care furnished to members with special health care needs a. Members with \"Special Health Care Needs\" means individuals who have high health care needs, multiple chronic conditions, mental illness or Substance Use Disorders and either 1) have functional disabilities, 2) live with health or social conditions that place them at risk of developing functi onal disabilities, or 3) are a m ember of the Prioritized Populations listed in the OHA CCO contract. b. Members wit h special health care needs are identified, are offered Case Management and screened for Intensive Care Coordination Services (ICCS). i. ICCS is a specialized care management service available to members who are aged, blind, or disabled, and/or who have complex medical needs, multiple chronic conditions, severe and persistent behavioral health issues and those receiving Medicaid -funded long -term care or long -term services and supports. ii. Early identification and intervention can positively impact the qualit y and cost associated with care, while also improving health care appropriateness and member satisfaction. PCS ICC Services is family and youth driven, strength based, culturally responsive and linguistically appropriate and is provided in a way that Membe rs are served in the most natural and integrated environment possible and that minimizes the use of institutional care. c. Individualized Care Planning i. Each care manager follows, coordinates, and maintains no more than 15 members in ICC care management serv ices. In consultation with the member, the ICC Care Manager is responsible for compiling a list of Care Team members, including name, organization, contact information and role in addition to creating an individualized plan of care. PacificSource Care Mana gers create an individualized plan of care for members identified and prioritized with intensive care coordination or special health needs within 10 days of enrollment in ICC services. The plan of care is shared and coordinated with providers and specialis ts to ensure consideration is given to incorporate unique needs, including cultural and linguistic factors, as appropriate and in compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Member and member representatives participate in the development and implemen tation of the plan of care when possible. ii. The plan of care for enrollees with special health care needs are reviewed and revised at least monthly or when the enrollee's circumstances change or the enrollee's needs change, or when the member requests it. In addition, members are reassessed at least annually to determine whether their care plans are effectively meeting their needs. Members receive an updated list of care team participants at least semi -annually, upon request, or when members of care team ch ange. This list includes names, contact information, and roles of each team member and is documented in the member's health plan electronic medical record. iii. Care management and coordination activities include: 1. Early identification of members eligible fo r ICCS and other care management services 2. Assistance to ensure timely access to providers and capitated services 3. Coordination with providers and community partners to ensure consideration is given to special health care needs in treatment planning 4. Assista nce to providers in complex coordination of capitated services and transitions of care 5. Aid with coordinating necessary and appropriate linkage of community support and social service systems with medical care systems 6. Collaborative care planning with Medica id Long Term Care or Long Term Care Support Specialists and referrals of mutual members prioritized for ICCS within 30 days 7. Contact with m ember's PCP within one month of ICC assignment, then additionally no less than once a month to ensure integrated care, or sooner if m ember's needs indicate. d. The PacificSource Care Management team provides an integrated physical health/behavioral health approach to comprehensively address member care needs. The team collaborates internally, as appropriat e, with the medical directors overseeing Physical and Behavioral Health, Pharmacy, Dental and Medicare/Commercial departments to create a comprehensive and individualized plan of care. e. Additionally, the Care Management PacificSource staff collaborates and provides training externally with providers and community partners to best utilize and build member resources, promote awareness of care coordination services for the ICCS and special health care needs population, prevent duplication of services, and to involve these partners/providers in the members' individualized plans of care when appropriate. f. To ensure direct access, members who are designated as eligible for Intensive Care Coordination Services are not required to have a PCP referral request for an initial specialist visit. More information about access is available in the Member Handbook and through the PacificSource Community Solutions website. g. Care Managers and Care Coordination staff are trained and demonstrate skills in cultural awareness and c ommunication with sensitivity to the unique barriers faced by ICCS and other special health care needs populations. Care Managers are encouraged to obtain their care management certification after two years of employment Appendix 438.340; 42 CFR 422.152; OHA CCO Contract Exhibit B - Part 10 - Transformation Reporting, Performance Measures and External Quality Review; OHA CCO Contract Exhibit G - Part 1 - Delivery System Network Provider Monitoring and Rep orting Overview; OHA CCO Contract Exhibit M - Part 11 - Care Coordinat ion/Intensive Care Coordination; OAR [External Entities Affected] Approved by: Modification History Date Modified Reviewed By Modifications 7/23/2019 Stevi Bratschie Erin Fitzpatrick , Lizzy Lizzy Randleman, Cody Phelps, Martin Stukel, Andrea Ketelhut Updated citing and updated processes . 10/18/2021 Lindsay Atagi Shonda Dahl, Andrea Ketelhut, Cody Phelps, Sarah Holloway Updated regulatory citing and processes.

Email us at PCPCH -BHIProgram@pacificsource.com 2) Integrated Behavioral Health VBP Program Participation The purpose of this p rogram is to provide financial and operational support for behavioral health integration at Patient -Centered Primary Care Homes (PCPCH) . A minimum level of PCPCH functioning is nec essary to effectively implement integrated behavioral healt h. Therefore, c linics must be PCPCH recognized as Tier 3, 4, or 5 to be eligible for the integrated behavioral health VBP program. PacificSource supports the effective integration of behavioral health (BH) services into primary care as a key component of health system transformation. This program will specifically identify and provide additional support to those clinics that meet a fidelity level of integratio n based on Oregon's PCPCH program and the Integrated Behavioral Health Alliance (IBHA) minimum standards . NOTE: For 2022, PacificSource is offering two levels of PMPM payments. Payments will be made retrospectively on a quarterly basis and will be based on meeting program metric benchmarks , along with successful participation in a site visit assessment. For the purposes of this program, integrated behavioral health is defined as care provided to individuals and their families in a PCPCH by primary care providers (PCP), behavioral health clinicians (BHC), and other care team members working together to address the following: mental illness, s ubstance use disorders, health behaviors that contribute to chronic illness, life stressors and crises, developmental risk/conditions, stress -related physical symptoms, preventative care, and ineffective patterns of health care utilization. Behavioral health clinicians (BHC), adapted from ORS 414.025, include: A licensed psychiatrist; A licensed psychologist; A certified nurse practitioner with a specialty in psychiatric mental healt h; A licensed clinical social worker; A licensed professiona l counselor or licensed marriage and family therapist; A board -registered associate or psychologist resident. BHC same -day open access services include following activities as defined by the IBHA minimum standards for integration : Prevention and early in tervention for common behavioral health issues Same -day brief patient consultations, assessments & interventions Warm hand -offs between the primary care team and BHC(s) Consultations between the primary care team and BHC(s) BHC(s) participation in pre -visit planning, team meetings, and huddles Care management and care coordination with entities outside the PCPCH including specialty behavioral health clinicians, psychiatrists, other specialist providers, hospitals, schools and teache rs, etc. PacificSource Community Solutions 2022 Value -Based Payment Programs for PCPCHs Program Description 6 Questions? Email us at PCPCH -BHIProgram@pacificsource.com Co-located specialty behavioral health services delivered at primary care clinics are not eligible for the integrated behavioral health payment program but may establish a separate contract with PacificSource as a panel behavioral health provider . Specialty behavioral health services are provided by mental health professionals on an episodic, repetitive basis for mental health and substance use disorder conditions that often are more severe or complex than can be handled by a primary care team. Clinics providing specialty services will score lower than 5 on the IBHA standards found in the Assessment Tool for Integrated Behavioral Health Services (See Appendix A). However, it is possible for clinics to provide both integrated and specialty behaviora l health services.

PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) submitted t he first round of action p lans in 2020 for episode interventions taking place between 2020 and 2021. PCS selected three episodes of focus for these action plans: asthma, diabetes, and substance use disorder ( SUD ). We chose these episodes for their significant contributions to state -wide costs , broad impacts on Oregon's population , and alignment with the OHA, organizational, and community -based goals . PCS elected to send patients an action plan to optimize their asthma management , in conjunction with a conversation with their primary care physician , for the asthma project . Asthma action plans help patients understand which medications to use based on a measurement of their peak flow. This tool may initiate a new prescription of pre ventative asthma inhalers and a peak flow meter if the patient does not have these already. PCS set a target of mailing the asthma action plan to at least 70% of PCS members with an asthma diagnosis, along with a letter explaining its purpose. In addition, the PCS Population Health Team conducted provider education on the asthma action p lan and sent letters to providers to make them aware of the project and prepare them for conversations with their patients. Intersections with Health Equity The PCS MEPP : Asthma Workgroup confirmed the prevalent languages within each PCS region (as defined as meeting a prevalence of 5% of the membership or 1,000 members). In each PCS region , the prevalent languages are English and Spanish. We translated all m ember materials into Spanish , and internal teams and the OHA reviewed them to ensure that they met plain language and reading level standards. Members who indicated Spanish as their preferred language received the materials in Spanish. Additionally , the MEPP: Asthma Workgroup worked to make sure we offered culturally and linguistically appropriate materials . These efforts included positive steps to advance health equity. Due to the relatively small volumes of inpatient admits and population sizes, we are not sp litting out the asthma -related Inpatient Admissions Per Thousand Members Per Year ( PTMPY ) by Race, Ethnicity, Language, and Disability ( REALD ) segment at this time as variation in outcomes will likely not have the sample sizes required for statistically me aningful differences. Changes to the Opportunity Given the severe impact of COVID -19 on the medical community, there was a decline in bandwidth for our provider partners to focus on projects that are not directly COVID -19-related. Due to this, the MEPP: Asthma Workgroup had less engagement than anticipated from provider partners. Updated Estimate of Potential Costs and/or Savings OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge The final cost associated with the project w as close to the estimates in the initial action plan. PCS spent $3,209.11 on the member educational mailings. Since the initial submission, the updated CY18 -20 MEPP Dashboard shows even highe r AAE costs for a sthma episodes, signaling that this area of opport unity remains high. PCS believes the outcome of this intervention to have a positive return on investment, considering the relatively low project costs and large AAE opportunity identified in the MEPP tool. Attestation on Project Completion Milestone 1: Analysis and outreach strategy development. PCS identifies t he Impact of AAE from asthma episodes, including top diagnostic and procedure codes associated with AAE. Develop a method for identifying the target population for asthma patients and their contact information. Status: Completed in CY2021 . Milestone 2: Member Education Materials & Staff Training. PCS develops m ember education materials on asthma management. Member Support Specialist staff receive information on asthma education mailer in order to respond to member questions or inquiries. Targeted employees receive the information contained in member education materials on asthma management. Status: Completed in CY2021 . The OHA approved the developed asthma education materials . PCS provided train ing to the Member Support Specialist team on how to respond to member questions regarding the asthma- related material. Miles tone 3: Member Contact. At least 70% of target asthma members and their providers are sent educational materials via appropriate channels (mailing, email, discussion with CM, etc.) Status: Completed in CY2021 . PCS mailed members with an asthma diagnosis the asthma -related educational materials in April 2021. PCS Provider Service staff shared the asthma materials with all providers in PCS CCO regions.

PCS Population Health and Quality Improvement staff track dissemination of asthma education materials and continue to assess its impact. Milestone 5: Report submitted to OHA. Status: Completed 3/15/2021 . Performance Measure Descriptions : Percent of Members with Asthma Provided Educational Materials Measure Description Percent of members with asthma provided with educational materials on asthma management Numerator Number of members with asthma provided with educational materials on asthma management Denominator Number of members with asthma identified in the target group for outreach Measurement Period PCS sent m ember educational materials in the spring of 2021, the measurement period for this MEPP action plan metric. Baseline Period N/A Data Source The Quality team tracked t he number of members provided with educational mailings during the member mailing process. We generated t he OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge member with asthma mailin g list using our internal Member Insight Data Access Layer using an algorithm for asthma condition. Definition of success The original action plans identified a target of outreaching at least 70% of the members in the targeted population . Performance Measure Outcome In PCS - CG, there were 143 members on the list identified to receive the asthma educational materials. Of those members, 16 had a REALD reading language of Spanish , and we sent member materials to members in their preferred language. We did not send the member mailing to one member on the do not contact list. Therefore, this outcome measure was 142/143 or 99.3%, which exceeds our initial target of 70% of members provided with a mailing. Measurement Challenges and Strategies There were no measurement challenges to report on this metric. Interpretation of Outcomes At the onset of this project, the MEPP: Asthma Workgroup aimed to send asthma educational materials to at least 70% of members with asthma identified for outreach. Ultim ately, the team was able to send the mailings more widely . Except for a few members on the do -not-contact list, everyone in the target group was on the final mailing list to send the member materials. Therefore, the outcome of this project exceeded our target for success. Performance Measure Descriptions: Inpatient Admissions for Asthma -Related Diagnoses per Thousand Members per Year (PTMPY) Measure Description Inpatient Admission s for Asthma -Related Diagnoses per Thousand Members per Year (PTMPY) Numerator The n umber of inpatient admissions for members with asthma where the admission has an urgent or emergent admit type with admission or primary diagnosis beginning with J4. Denominator PCS used m edical member month exposure for members with a diagnosis of asthm a to calculate admissions PTMPY . Measurement Period Calendar year 2021. Baseline Period Calendar year 2020. Data Source Internal enrollment data and claims information (including inpatient admissions and an asthma condition algorithm that incorporates medical, pharmacy, and risk score data). Definition of success This metric was used as a reporting measure only to monitor potential impacts since , at the onset of the efforts , we defined success via the process measure of the number of members provided asthma materials . Measurement Challenges and Strategies The COVID -19 pandemic affected the baseline for this metric, which created downward pressure on healthcare utilization and access. We used a comparison population to compare baseline to OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge measurement period trends , which means we need to adjust for population risk scores to account for potential differences in age or morbidity. Finally, due to the timing of the final MEPP reporting, the claims d ata for the measurement period of 2021 will not be fully complete. Therefore , we will apply an inpatient admit completion factor calculated by our PC S Actuarial team. As part of the measurement, we pulled member month exposure for the baseline of 2020 and the measurement period of 2021 for members with an internal conditional asthma flag indicator. The members were categorized as part of the intervention group if they appeared on the point -in-time mailing list used to send the member educational materials. If the member s did not appear on the mailing list, we considered them part of the comparison group. We computed the average risk score for the intervention and control groups for the baseline and measurement period. We then pulled data for inpatient admits of admit type \"emergency\" or \"urgent\" with an admitting or primary diagnosis indicating asthma (J4*) for both the baseline and measurement periods. We matched t hese inpatient admit counts to the control and intervention groups based on whether or not the member appeared on the mailing list to receive the educational materials. For the final measurement, we applied a completion factor to the 2021 measurement period since the available data included claims paid through December 2021. Since we used claims pa id through December 2021, we assumed t he 2020 baseline period is complete. Then w e calculated the number of completed inpatient admissions PTMPY by dividing the completed inpatient admit counts by the appropriate member month exposure for the control and m easurement groups to calculate the PTMPY rate. Finally, we divided the rates by the average risk score to account for differences in age and risk between the two populations. Performance Measure Outcomes Measurement for PCS - CG shows an increase in the risk -adjusted inpatient admissions for asthma - related reasons among members diagnosed with asthma in the control group between the baseline and OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge the measurement period. Conversely, the members with asthma in the measurement group w ho received educational materials had declining inpatient utilization for asthma -related reasons. This means that the provision of the member educational materials correlated with a decrease in inpatient utilization for reasons regarding asthma. Interpret ation of Outcomes The MEPP: Asthma Workgroup defined success for this process measure by tracking the number of members who received asthma -related educational materials mailing. We achieved the definition of success for th is project by meeting the target we identified in the MEPP: Asthma Action Plan . The overall goal of selecting an outcome measure on inpatient utilization for asthma- related reasons was to reduce costly inpatient admissions through member education. Although many confounding factors among our Medicaid population make causality difficult to prove, we s aw a reduction in the number of inpatient admissions correlated with the educational materials provided between the baseline and measurement periods. OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge 2020/2021 MEPP: Diabetes Episode Closeout Report Brief Description The Oregon Health Authority's (OHA) Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program (MEPP) challenge s CCOs to leverage the MEPP tool to identify actionable opportunities where they c an implement meaningful interventions to lower A dverse Actionable Events (AAE) and episode costs . PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) submitted t he first round of action p lans in 2020 for episode interventions taking place between 2020 and 2021. PCS selected three episodes of focus for these action plans: asthma, diabetes, and substance use disorder (SUD ). We chose these episodes for their significant contributions to state -wide costs , broad impacts on Oregon's population , and alignment with the OHA, organizational, and community -based goals . For t he diabetes episode intervention, PCS developed a strategy to create educational materials on the importance of dental care for members with diabetes. PCS offer ed these resources to providers with the highest AAE dollars associated with diabetes. In addition, there will be member newsletters that focus on oral health and dental screenings. Intersections with Health Equity For t he MEPP d iabetes intervention , PCS aimed to increase dental care utilization for members with diabetes regardless of race, language, heritage, gender identity , or sexual orientation. We expected the project to have a neutral impact o n health equity. One way we can monitor the health equity outcomes for dental care among members with diabetes is to stratify the oral evaluation for members with diabetes quality metric. We re port this metric by the primary race integrated into our M ember Insight Data Access Layer. Columbia Gorge CCO 2020 2021 Primary Race NUM DEN RATE % DIFF FROM TOTAL NUM DEN RATE % DIFF FROM TOTAL Asian or Pacific Islander 4 14 28.6 20% 4 16 25.0 -24% Black or African American 0 1 0.0 -100% 2 2 100.0 206% White 83 368 22.6 -5% Hispanic or Latinx 27 96 28.1 18% 54 134 40.3 23% American Indian or Alaska Native 1 7 14.3 -40% 4 10 40.0 22% Not Provided 16 62 25.8 8% 29 79 Total 131 548 23.9 0% 196 599 32.7 0% Among member populations with at least 30 members in the denominator (bolded in the table above), we see that Hispanic/Latinx members had favorable outcomes relative to White members. In general, metric outcomes for small populations were volatile over tim e, but outcome patterns by race were mostly unchanged between CY 2020 and CY 2021 during the timeframe of this intervention. The project OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge likely had minimal impacts o n health equity. However, health equity is an increasing area of focus for PCS and will continue to be a core consideration in our future efforts. Changes to the Opportunity In the first quarter of CY 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic led to access restrictions for most dental care offices, which significantly affected the ability to access dental care. In addition, many members, especially those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, may have be en hesitant to access dental care services for fear that it may put them at risk of contracting COVID -19. The decline in members with diabetes receiving periodontal care between CY2019 and CY 2020 elevated the need for this project. Given the severe impact of COVID -19 on the medical community, we anticipate d a decline in bandwidth for our physician partners to focus on proj ects that are not directly COVID -19-related. In addition, many of our dental provider partners fac ed staffing shortages. Due to this, we were unsure how many physicians w ould utilize the educational materials. Updated Estimate of Potential Costs and/or Savings The final cost associated with the project w as close to the estimates in the initial action plan. PCS spent $418.13 on printing and postage for educational materials. Since the initial submission, the updated CY2018-2020 MEPP Dashboard shows even higher AAE costs for the diabetes episode, signaling that this area of opportunity remains high. PCS believes the outcome of this intervention to have a positive return on investment, considering the low project costs and large AAE opportunity identified in the MEPP tool. Attesta tion on Project Completion Milestone 1: Analysis and outreach strategy development. Patients with diabetes who complete periodontal treatments have reduce d AAE dollars associated with overall medical costs, as well as hospital admissions. We will identify providers with the highest AAE associated with diabetes for outreach. Status: Completed 7/14/2020 . PCS developed l ists of provider groups comprising the top 50% of AAE dollars to outreach as part of this project. Milestone 2: Content Creation. PCS will c reate educational materials on the importance of dental care with diabetes. We will offer this content to providers to disseminate to their patients. Additionally, we will develop an educational article on dental screenings to include in a member newsletter. Status: Completed in CY2021. PCS created a Dental Care \"Rx Pad\" for primary care providers to give to their patients. The \" Rx Pads\" provide recommendations for people with diabetes to access oral health care , and we provide clinics the material with their branded information . To date, we have provided dental \"Rx Pads\" to 29 clinics representing 12 provider partners across PCS CCO regions . Additionally, provider partners in the PCS - LN and PCS - CO region have requested the informational brochure on Oral Health and Diabetes for physicians to give to their patients. PCS also developed a template letter for physicians to send their patie nts on diabetes and oral health . Provider partners in the PCS - CO, PCS - LN, and PCS - CG region took advantage of these letters. P CS supported providers by mailing letters on behalf of providers to 500 patients who had a n annual oral health evaluation fo r patients with diabetes OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge gap in care in June 2021 and 418 patients with a gap in November of 2021 throughout our CCO regions . Finally, P CS developed educational material on dental screening , which w e included in the winter 2021 member newsletter . Milestone 3: Provider Contact. PCS will provide o utreach to at least 50% of the identified providers to acquaint them with the materials and disseminate them. Status: Completed in CY2021 . PCS Provider Network and Population Health staff provided outreach to all contracted Primary Care Provider (PCP) clinics in each PacificSource CCO region. Milestone 4: Follow up. Follow -up and progress assessment for each provider completed and documented. Status: Completed in CY2021 . All of the key provider partners identified at the onset of the project engaged in the project and requested educational materials to send to their patients. Milestone 5: Report submitted to OHA.

Success would be offering educational materials and support to all of the identified provider groups in the early phases of the project . Performance Measure Outcome: Percent of Provider Groups Supported by Oral Health & D iabetes MEPP Efforts PCS offered e ducational materials widely to provider groups. At the onset of the project , PCS identified three key partners to contact based on member assignment and tools from the MEPP Dashboard . These provider groups were contacted, making this outcome measure (3/3) or 100%. Gorge CCO Partner Outreach Confirmed One Community Health Y OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Waters Edge Medical Clinic Y MCMC Family Medicine Y Measurement Challenges and Strategies This process measure was easy to track , and there were no significant measurement challenges. Interpretation of Outcomes PCS planned t his MEPP project before the COVID -19 pandemic. We met the definition of success for this interve ntion by contacting each of the identified provider groups to offer them free materials designed to boost dental care for members with diabetes. Due to the significant unforeseen challenges faced by our provider partners, the provider partners might not ha ve used the materials as much as they might have in a typical year.

Measurement Period Implement ation began in the first half of 2021 , and the me asurement period will be the 12 -month rolling rate calculated for December 2021. Baseline Period PCS calculated t he baseline with data as of December 2020, reflecting a 12 - month lookback period to the beginning of 2020. Data Source PCS calculated t he m easure using the internal Member Insight Data Access Layer , which leverages claims and enrollment data. The measurement is calculated using December 2021 data, reflecting a 12 -month lookback period to the beginning of 2021. Definition of success This metric is a reporting measure to monitor potential impacts. At the onset of the efforts , PCS defined success via the process measure \"Number of Provider Groups Supported by Oral Health & Diabetes MEPP Efforts.\" Performance Measure Outcomes OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge The percent of members with diabetes who had a dental visit in the calendar year increased between CY2020 and CY 2021 fro m 35.7% to 42.8%, outpacing the trend of other PCS members who did not have a diabetes diagnosis. The trend between the CY 2020 baseline and CY 2021 measurement period shows a slightly more pronounced increase in the percent of members with diabetes with a d ental visit compared to the control group within the same risk category in the \"struggling\" and \"in -crisis\" categories. Measurement Challenges and Strategies Lowered dental utilization during the COVID -19 pandemic affected the CY2020 baseline and CY 2021 measurement periods . Fear of exposure to the COVID -19 virus, office closures, stay -at-home orders , and staffing shortages means that dental access and utilization ha ve not been consistent over time. Thus, to monitor for changes in utilization, we wanted to include a comparison group including PCS members without diabetes. To look at dental utilization trends between members with diabetes and a comparison group, we opted to show the trends by our internal risk score segments. This helps to control the differences in age and chronic condition prevalence between the two groups. Interpretation of Outcomes The 2020 MEPP Action Plan for the d iabetes episode was to increase dental utilization among PCS members with diabetes. According to this reporting, the p rogram correlated with increasing dental utilization among members with diabetes. However, we cannot attribute the increase in dental utilization among members with diabetes to this project directly. OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge 2020/2021 MEPP: SUD Episode Closeout Report Brief Description The Oregon Health Authority's Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program (MEPP) challenge s CCOs to leverage the MEPP tool to identify actionable opportunities where they c an implement meaningful interventions to lower A dverse Actionable Events (AAE) and episode costs . PacificSource Community Solutions (PCS) submitted t he first round of action p lans in 2020 for episode interventions between 2020 and 2021. PacificSource Community Solutions selected three episodes of focus for these action plans: asthma, diabetes, and substance use disorder ( SUD ). We chose these episodes for their significant contributions to state -wide costs , broad impacts on Oregon's population , and alignment with OHA, organizational, and community -based goals . For the SUD episode intervention, PCS developed, marketed, and implemented educational webinars for the use of M edication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) . Alcohol use disorder was a focus of the webinar because they are the most common substance use disorder subtype with the highest AAE cost in the MEPP tool. PCS invited all primary care provider groups with assigned CCO membership to the webinar offerings. Through these efforts, the group promoted MAT's effective use to lower the overall medical costs and AAE costs of one of the most costly episode subtypes of SUD. Intersectio ns with Health Equity The provider training focused on educat ing attendees on the use of MAT for patients with AUD s with the overall goal of improving the treatment of AUD regardless of a member's race, language, heritage, gender identity, or sexual orient ation. When we consider health equity through the lens of our members struggling with substance use disorder, who often experience unfair treatment due to the stigmatization of SUD conditions, this intervention advances health equity. When we view health equity through the lens of race, the impact of the intervention is unclear. Reviewing the performance on the initiation and engagement of alcohol and other drug (A OD) treatment by member race in 2020 ( close to when the intervention took place ), we see some variation of rates in performance outcomes . For example, when considering races with at least 30 members in the denominator, rates of initiation of AOD treatment in PCS - Columbia Gorge (CG) as of December 2020 were higher for Hispanic/Latinx members (51.5%) than Caucasian members (at 41.7%). As of December 2021 , the rate of initiation of AOD treatment for Hispanic/Latinx members (at 30.3%) was lower than the rate for White/Caucasian members (at 38.7%). Importantly, the denominator for the Hispanic/Latinx population was 33 members in these periods , and we may expect to see volatility in performance over time. Therefore, the impac t of this intervention on health equity is unclear . The differenc e in quality measure outcomes necessitates further monitoring . It emphasizes the importance of our ongoing efforts to advance culturally and linguistically appropriate care and reduce barriers for BIPOC and other member populations. (Note that Asian/Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, Black or African American, and American Indian/Alaska Native member populations included less than 30 members in 2020 and 2021) . OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge However, there are many layers to health equity. The outcome variation by race in the initiation of AOD treatment would not reflect, for example, that some member population s may be less likely to seek care due to various barriers such as the availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Therefore, quality measures may not capture some member populations . It remains critical to continue our work to advance Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) and health equity for our CCO members. Changes to the Opportunity Due to the complexities of a global pandemic, an increasing number of our CCO members are likely experiencing heightened stress , which may increase the use of substances as a coping mechanism, including alcohol . A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association on alcohol use during the pandemic shows increase d alcohol consumption frequency and heavy drinking and alcohol - related problems .1 Likewise, The Lund Report released an article in February 2021 stating that hospital admission rates for alcohol -related liver disease have increased by 30% -50% since the pandemic began.2 We feel this lends to the importance of the project more than ever. PCS' data does not reflect a n increase in diagnosed SUD prevalence, likely due to the competing trends of the suspension of redetermination and a re duced likeliness to seek care during the pandemic , which could be a barrier to SUD diagnoses that are the foundation of our prevalence reporting. However, SUD remains one of the most prevalent conditio ns in our member population. A necdotally, we can expect our members with SUD are facing more challenges than before, as the pandemic increases stress, isolation, and economic challenges for our members. Again, increasing the access and quality of SUD treatment remains a critical project for the CCO to improve member well- being. Updated Estimate of Potential Costs and Savings The cost for the educational webinar for MAT use for members with AUD was greater than the initial estimates at $6,600 due to the higher than anticipated hourly rate of partnering provider presenters. Since the init ial submission, the updated CY18 -20 MEPP Tool shows an even higher AAE cost for AUD episodes, signaling that the area of opportunity is still significant . Educational web inar participants received training via discussion, presentation , and educational materials to increase MAT awareness for A UD. Medication -Assisted Treatment effectively lower s medical costs yet remains underutilized as a treatment method. The educational p rogram helped expand awareness of MAT's effectiveness for AUD within the provider groups serving PCS members. The outcomes of these efforts are consistent with the original estimates provided in the action plan submission. Attestation on Project Completion Milestone 1: Analysis and outreach strategy development. Medication- Assisted Treatment (MAT) has been shown to reduce medical costs for those with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD). Current evidence shows 1 Pollard, M. (2020).

Definition of success All provider groups with assigned CCO membership were invited to participate in the educational webinar . Performance Measure Outcome: Webinar Reach among Key Provider Partners Invitations to the provider training were distributed widely through existing channels including, provider newsletters and email distribution lists. All primary care provider partners received communications inviting them to the educational opportunity , meeting our definition of project success . In tota l, there were 68 attendees of \"Medication -Assisted Treatment for AUD in the Primary Care Setting ,\" representing a diverse set of organizations. In the PCS -CG region , three out of the nineteen primary care provider groups selected as key partners at the beginning of the project attended for an outcome measure of 15.7% of provider partners represented . Measurement Challenges and Strategies The most significant measurement challenge was capturing all the provider groups rep resented at the training. However, the P opulation Health Team successful ly captur ed attendee lists to facilitate this measurement. Interpretation of Outcomes We developed this project before the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic , and we had initially envision ed the provider training to have slightly higher attendance . However , at the time , it was not a requirement of the MEPP project to define a specific target. Due to the unprecedented challenges our provider partners faced during the COVID -19 pandemic, we co nsider the overall attendance rate \u2014and the richness of the conversations it stimulated \u2014a success. OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge Performance Measure Descriptions: Initiatio n & Engagement of AOD Treatment Measure Description Initiation & Engagement of AOD Treatment Numerator Numerator for initiation & engagement of AUD treatment is consistent with defined CCO incentive measure specifications for 2020/2021 measurement. The measure will be split out for participating provider groups and non - participating provider groups to evalu ate potential impacts of the education. Denominator Denominator is consistent with defined CCO incentive measure specifications for 2020/2021 measurement. The measure will be split out for participating provider groups and non -participating provider group s to evaluate potential impacts of the education. Measurement Period Webinars were offered to participating provider groups in November of 2020. The measurement period will be December 2020 to December 2021. Baseline Period The baseline is defined as Ja nuary - November 2020. Data Source Internal quality incentive metric measures and training attendance rosters. Definition of success This metric is intended as a reporting -only metric to monitor for the impacts of the intervention. During the creation of action plans there was no concrete target identified. However, a successful outcome would be if provider groups attending the training improved in Initiation and Engagement of AOD rates and/or had a favorable trend in outcomes compared to provider group s who did not attend. Performance Measure Outcomes In PCS - CG, we compared the Initiation and Engagement of AOD Treatment metric performance between provider organizations represented at the training to the provider groups who were not present: Measurement Challenges and Strategies An update to the measurement algorithms for the measurement year in 2021 ma de pre and post -metric performance difficult to assess. However, we applied these differences to both the attending provider OHA Medicaid Efficiency and Performance Program CCO: PacificSource Community Solutions - Columbia Gorge groups and the pro vider groups who were not present. This means that the metric specification changes had a similar impact o n both groups. Interpretation of Outcomes There is a more pronounced decline in performance in 2021 in the Initiation of AOD Treatment for participating provider groups and a less favorable performance in this metric compared to provider groups who did not participate in the training. However, p articipating provider groups did outperform non-participating groups in the engagement metric. Due to confounding factors , we cannot attribute the difference in performance among these two groups to participation in the class alone.

Improve adolescent HPV immunization rates in youth ages nine to fourteen through targeted interventions focused on increasing compliance between doses. Pregnant women who are assigned to the CCO who delivered a baby and were assigned to a DCO, who had a dental visit (based on global claims data). Increase the number of CCO members who are screened for SDoH either through the AHC grant or internally by PacificSource Case Management Support Specialists and develop a closed loop referral system to track member's screened and provided navigation services. PS will continue to move health transformation forward to meet the triple aim of better health, better outcomes, and lower costs. The TQS will support the sharing of CCO's best practices, health transformation through innovation and quality methods, and state monitoring of CCO's progress. Chronic Care Improvement Project topic: Type 2 Diabetes: Develop a Diabetes Care Management Program to provide members with accurate information and the support needed to make positive lifestyle changes to achieve full body health. Medicare Advantage Quality Improvement Plan created and maintained yearly to explain the goals, strategies, structure, and evaluation processes identified to promote quality heatlh care. The document outlines how compliance elements related to quality care met with relation to the seven required components of a quality program. The Medicare Advantage Quality Review is in conjunction with the Program Plan, and is used to evaluate work that occurred in the year prior for all departments within the health plan that directly impact the Medicare Advantage members and provders. This tool is utilized to address current functionality and any current or future needs for the program that may need to be adjusted throughout the next plan year for quality improvement and the improvement of CAHPS/HOS/STARs ratings.

Responsible 2021 Annual Telephone & Email Functionality Report Lindzee Prasch Lindzee Prasch presented the 2021 Telephone Access for Member Services and Email Turn Around Time Report to the committee stating that this 2021 report reflects our 2020 data. The Customer Service call center serves all Commercial and Exchange plans in in Oregon, Idaho and Montana. The department maintains high standards for accessing services by telephone and email. SSRS and Outlook reports are run daily, weekly, and monthly to gather statistical information. Results are analyzed and reported to the Customer Service Lea dership Team, on a weekly and monthly basis. The leadership team reviews the data to ensure goals are being met, and to address any deficiencies, if applicable. The analyzed results and any identified actions are then shared with our Executive Leadership T eam on a monthly basis and reviewed annually as a whole. The overall goals are as follows: Telephone Service: 80% or more of calls answered within 30 seconds or less 5% or less abandonment rate Email Turnaround Time: 95% or more of emails answered within 1 business day Telephone and Email Stats: The stats below reflect our 2019 and 2020 service levels for telephone and emails. The average number of calls per month for 2020 was 30,840. This resulted in a slight decrease from 2019 which averaged 32,77 0 per month. January and December have had the highest call volume per month for the last several years. There was an 18% increase in call volume from December 2019 to January 2020, which is the highest increase in call volume when comparing month to month . In 2020, our annual average service level was 80.00%, answer speed was 0.38 seconds, and our abandonment rate was 3.75%. Overall average stats decreased in 2020 from the previous year in 2019. We fell short of meeting our service level for several months, both at the beginning of the y ear and at the end of the year, call volume and increased talk time directly affected our stats . January and December typically always prove to be challenging months or us, h owever , we are now also starting Approved Lindzee Prasch PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 to see an increase in call volume early in the month of November, as we head into our open enrollment season. The call volume tends to increase due to a large number of groups that renew during that time frame. Providers call to get updated benefits and membe rs call to inquire about their new plans. In addition, due to COVID mandates, and our work ultimately being completely virtual work from home, our overall average stats decreased, due to technical and connectivi ty issues. We also replaced our phone system during the month of October, which contributed to some lower stats for both November and December. Due to the challenges this transfer brought, we developed more specific stat tracking, and individual production tracking for each of our representatives. T his has helped us zone in on any and all technical issues, productivity, connectivity, etc., as well as using this reporting to help us make changes around staffing, hiring, and training. Dr. Montoya asked what percentage of the overall volume is telephone, versus emails. Lindzee Prasch stated that the majority falls under telephone. While we had an increase of approximately 3% in membership from January 2019 to January of 2020, our call level in January increased by about 7.5%. This increase could be attr ibuted to expanding our business into Washington, with a new population of members. While the re was an increase in call volume in 2020, it was not as much as we have seen in previous years. This may be due to a process improvement that was put into place in t 2019 that increased the number of auto renewals. We continued to utilize this process in 2020 for both our small groups, and a handful of larger groups . This process allowed the team to focus more on new groups and groups with benefit changes which in turn enabled benefits to appear in the system sooner, new members were enrolled quicker, and ID cards were sent out faster, therefore reducing the number of calls, and return calls for members trying to obtain information. Opportunities a nd Action Plans: Continue to implement more specific tracking/reporting Continue to evaluate staffing needs Continue to help identify cross departmental process improvements to assist wi th improving our service levels Dr. Montoya asked if we had any updates regarding the ability to offer \"live chat\" to our members. Lindzee Prasch stated that this is still on the horizon, and being looked into further for when this may be able to be deployed. T here were no additional questions raised by the committee. A m otion was made, seconded, and passed to approve the 2021 Annual Telephone & Email Functionality Report. 2021 Annual Evaluation of Accuracy of Benefit Information Report Lindzee Prasch Lindzee Prasch presented the 2021 Annual Customer Service Quality and Assurance Report to the committee stating that the purpose of this report is to maintain standards for accuracy and timeliness for all of the service routes (telephone, email, and our self -service website) and take action to monitor the quality and accuracy of information provided to our members via all of the above mentioned service methods. The following audits are performed to ensure accuracy and quality: Telephone and Emails: 2 random calls and/or emails audited per week Self-service website (InTouch): 5 random audits per month Audits are performed by specially trained mentor/auditors using standardized audit tools focusing on accuracy, quality of service, and functionality Calls/emails consist of specific questions within sp ecific categories that are either scored, or provides written feedback Approved Lindzee Prasch PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 o Greeting o Quoted Information o Closing o Subjective Overview o Additional Opportunities Website is audited against 5 standards: Ability to order ID cards Update or select a primary care provider Referral requirements are shown; and, Authorization requirements are shown Accurate member financial responsibility for specific services with a specific provider Goals: 95% or greater in all areas, for the department as a whole and on an indivi dual basis Continuously seek out and identify opportunities to maintain or improve our service to our clients Telephone and Email Audit Scores: Overall we had strong scores in both the Greeting and Closing sections. These scores continue to support that our representatives are providing a high quality level of service by listening and answering all the member questions and maintaining a friendly tone throughout the call. We also exceeded our goal of 95% or more in the quoted section. We held strong scores regarding quoting benefits accurately, network status, and provider status, w hich is very important , as it is directly related to member financial responsibility. Our lower scores again were related to the exclusion section when quoting benef its. During the second and third quarter of the year is where we saw lower scores in this area. We have continued our specific tracking in this area, which is discussed with the Leadership and Training team to discuss methods for improvement. Based on these findings we continue to include this information in weekly huddle topics, mentor lessons, and monthly department meetings. We implemented more specific tracking to help determine what is lacking, this data showed us that overall in regards to exclusions, we have a few very specific areas that we need to focus on. We also implemented additional resources for our department to assist with quoting this particular exclusions. This is the third year that we have continued to work and improve this area, and all though we fell short of this goals around exclusions, we have continued to PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 gain more clarity and what exactly needs to improve, and how we can really work towards meeting this goal in the future. We held strong scores of 100% in all elements, but two, ending the year with a 96.39% annual average score. Treatment Cost Navigator (TCN) which shows member patient financial responsibility fell below goal during the third quarter, t his was due to a system update that was made during September, that was not al lowing our members to compare providers vs service cost. However once this was corrected, our scores continued to hold strong throughout the rest of the year. During the third quarter it was also reported that that PCP function was not working properly, however this was an incorrect markdown, and gave us some opportunities for more t raining, and updated resources. All other search options functioned as expected. Barriers: Telephone and Email Service Exclusions Virtual Environment Large amount of staffing hired at once Self-Service Web (InTouch) Audits not being performed appropriately Opportunities for Improvement: Telephone and Email Service Continue to discuss audit scores in team meetings Continue to expand and streamline our Audit/Mentor Program Create better and more specific tracking for areas that need improvement Continue to track common trends and meet regularity with Training and Leadership Teams. Continue to evaluate staffing needs vs volume of emails be ing received Self- Service Web (InTouch) Work to provide both additional training, and resources to help streamline the process in regards to a system limitation vs true errors or set up barriers Work to have the same person perform these monthly, to create better consistency Dr. Montoya inquired about the types of exclusions we are referring to in these stats. Lindzee Prasch stated that these are typically related to a handful of benefits that wh ile there is coverage for specific services, there are certain services that fall under these benefits that are not covered (i.e., physical therapy - take home supplies or educational benefits). Dr. Montoya asked where the CS rep's go to find this informat ion to see what is covered or excluded. Lindzee Prasch said, they use PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 our online auth orization grid. There were no additional questions raised by the committee. A motion was made, seconded, and passed to approve the 2021 Annual Evaluation of Accuracy of Benefit Information Report. 2021 Annual QI Program Presentation: 2021 QI Program Description 2021 Annual QI Work Plan 2021 Annual QI Evaluation Carmel Miller Carmel Miller presented the 2021 QI Program Presentation to the committee stating that this presentation will highlight the QI Program highlights, and provide an overview of the QI Program to include review of : 2021 QI Program Description 2021 QI Work Plan 2021 QI Program Evaluation PacificSource is operationally guided by the principle of continuous improvement, and in that spirit engages in an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the QI program to ensure our members have access to high -quality health care tha t is effective, safe, and results in positive outcomes. The QI Program Description and Annual Work Plan are used together as the basis for the 2020 QI Program Evaluation. All quality improvement activities found in the QI Program Description and QI Work Plan are addresse d within the QI Evaluation, however, the sequence and organization of the activities is not the same among the three documents. The slide below reflects the QI Program Goals and Objectives. 2021 Quality Improvement Program Description The PacificSource QI Program extends to all departments within the organization, and all levels in the recognition that teamwork and collaboration are essential for quality improvement. Department directors, and managers are responsible to develop and overse e quality improvement activities aimed at optimal clinical care, service, and organizational efficiency within their own departments as well as coordinate interdepartmental quality improvement activities as applicable. The organization clearly defines its quality improvement (QI) program structure and processes, assigns responsibility to appropriate individuals and operationalizes its QI program. The organization has the infrastructure necessary to improve the quality and safety of clinical care and service s it provides to its members and to oversee the QI program. The QI Program Description specifies: Approved Carmel Miller PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 The QI program structure The behavioral healthcare aspects of the program Involvement of a designated physician in the QI program Involvement of a behavioral healthcare practitioner in the behavioral aspects of the QI program Oversight of QI functions of the organization by the QI Committee Objectives for serving a culturally and linguistically diverse membership 2021 Quality Improvement Evaluation To assess the effectiveness of the QI program PacificSource produces and Annual QI Program Evaluation which depicts the plan's measurable performance achievements over the course of the year, with trended data when available, and includes: Identification of the barriers which make quality improvement difficult to achieve The interventions recommended to overcome these barriers A summary of the overall effectiveness of the program with consideration given to the adequacy of resources Committee structure and leader ship involvement The organization uses its QI Program Description and Annual QI Work Plan as the basis for the evaluation. These documents provide the program's framework and guides its quality initiatives, and therefore embody the performance expectations used in the evaluation. 2021 Quality Improvement Program Work Plan The organization documents and executes an Annual QI Work Plan that reflects the ongoing activities throughout the year. The work plan is a dynamic document that encompasses all planned activities and objectives each year. The QI work plan lists each planned initiative or ongoing activities that are addressed and includes a brief description of the: Program scope Yearly objectives Planned activities, and timeframes within which each act ivity is to be achieved Staff members responsible for each activity Monitoring of previously identified issues and new activities Evaluation of the QI program PacificSource updated the QI work plan frequently during 2019 and 2020 to reflect progress on QI activities and maintained the QI work plan as a clear and useful guide to the organization's QI activities. The full Program Description, Work Plan, and Evaluation of the QI Program were provided to the committee. Additionally, these documents are available at all times and are stored in the internal SharePoint site for our NCQA Accreditation. There were no other questions raised by the committee. A motion was made, seconded , and passed to approve the 2021 Annual QI Program Description, 2021 Annual QI Work Plan, and 2021 Annual QI Evaluation.

The program is a three year long program, based on the \"Plan -Do-Study -Cat\" model that requires the health plan to promote effective management of chronic diseases, and improve care and health outcomes for our members with chronic conditions , and to improve and/or carry out change within the program. The program population and goals are outlined below: Date range: 1/1/2019 - 12/31/21 Type 2 Diabetes: Managing the Whole Person to Improve Outcomes Target group (MiPi Report 5/2021) Approximate Medicare diabetes and depression: 1,645 (33%) Demographics: 50% male, 50% female, with an average age of 72 Ethnicity, language, location - not available; 2 members w/ primary language other than English; 42% live in Idaho, 53% live in Oregon, 1.6% in Montana, 3.6% in Washington Average risk score: Struggling: 58.6%, In Program a Comprehensive Diab etes Care Program (CDCP) for Medicare Members with Diabetes 2. Screen Medicare Members with Diabetes for Depression 3. Meet the needs of Medicare Diabetic Members with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) concerns Goal # 1: Develop a Comprehensive Diabetes Car e Program (CDCP) for Medicare Members with Diabetes 2019/2020 - planning & design Operated through the Condition Support team Phone support, motivational interviewing, goal setting, newsletter, PAM survey, PHQ -2, connection to other program benefits Length: 90 days w/ option for add'l 90 days 5/2020(start date)/2021- enrollment and sustainability Three phase roll out March 202 1, 300- 400 invite letters/month until all 5,000 identified members are reached The program mirrors our Condition Support Diabetes Program for our Commercial population. Program eligibility is as follows: Members with a diagnosis of Diabetes, who have P S Medicare as their primary coverage, and are able to actively participate in health coaching. Members who have depression , and/or anxiety, or gaps in care related to diabetes are prioritized Note: Excludes pre-diabetes, m embers that are currently in our TOC program, members that have ESRD , or who are on dialysis, and members who are active organ or bone marrow transplant recipient s, or receiving active cancer treatment Other program offerings include: RN Line Silver & Fit Program Reviewed Sherri Sturko PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 Think Nourish Move RD consultations Addressing gaps in care Dental screenings Phase 1 ~ 5/1/20: Referra ls from MCR CM/MSS team through Dynamo.

Goal # 2: Screen Medicare Members with Diabetes for Depression 1/2019- CM added PHQ -2 screens to member calls Results are reviewed w/ members. Positive screens (3) are encouraged to follow up with their PCP for further screening CM notifies PCP via letter to encourage provider outreach on all positive screens. Offer PHQ -2 screens to 80% of calls Hospitals and health clinics conduct depression screenings. To avoid screenin g fatigue, members can opt out According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 66% of all cases of depression go undiagno sed and thus untreated. People who have depression and another medical illness tend to have more severe symptoms of both illnesses. They may have more difficulty adapting to their co -occurring illness and more medical costs than those who do not also hav e depression. Goal # 3: Meet the needs of Medicare Diabetic Members with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) concerns Identify members with SDOH concerns through internal CM screens and Matrix Diabetic Program assessment results. Link members with Member Support Specialists to assist with navigation Increase the success rate for concerns met by 3% each year Similar to depression, limitations in any one of the SDOH areas directly affects an individual's ability to care for oneself or obtain access to care when needed. We want to help resolve SDOH barriers so the member can focus on controlling their diabetes. Matrix - is a vendor we use who deploys nurse practitioners to the member's home. The nurse practitioner is able to gain insight into the members health , and environment , and is able to share this assessment with the member's PCP and PS. The goal is to ensure that the provider has the most complete picture of the member's health and healthcare needs including SDoH so that optimal care can be provid ed to achieve better outcomes. Note : Matrix has a separate diabetes program for Medicare members. PacificSource identifies members for this program by the frequency of primary care or preventive care visits, diabetes management and testing, and with the assistance of Matrix. Program Results PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 . When CM started the depression screening program on the commercial side, a postcard went out to all par providers to inform them and a section of the PS provider webpage was developed to educate on the depression screening. Now we are screening across all LOB. Circling back with providers to learn how they respond, what's working and what isn't. The team worked with Patty and Sarah in analytics to develop a robust report for program tracking and outcomes for the DCCP. 2021 Plan ahead Continue to share project and provide updates internally and w/ providers; obtain feedback, make needed adjustment s. Finalize systematized processes to ensure program achieves long term success. Provide support to the CS/CM team where needed. Lessons learned Solving 100% of SDOH concerns is admirable, but not attainable. Understand the data - where it comes from and if there is enough to draw conclusions. SDOH - Programs/resources come and go as funding is available, offerings vary by location, and can have a variety of requirements to be eligible. While we would love to resolve 100% of the identified needs, we are lim ited to the assistance available at the time. We are using the Minnesota Method with a goal of increasing the goal met PacificSource Health Plan s Quality Improvement Committee Minutes CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY July 27, 2021 catego ry by 3% of benchmark each year, which we accomplished with an 11% increase over baseline year data- We are learning to examine ex isting reports thoroughly, the best questions to ask when working with analytics, making requests clear and concise, and that some requests aren't warranted. There were no additional questions or concerns raised by the committee regarding the 2021 CCIP program.
