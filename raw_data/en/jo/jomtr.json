Free Shipping $50+! [](https://organicindiausa.com) [ Back ](/blog) You've heard of yoga, meditation and sound healing to realign your chakras, but what about herbs for the chakras? Herbs have been a central part of chakra healing and balancing for centuries. Herbs are an ancient, organic way for humans to connect directly with the vibration of the earth, and utilize powerful roots, petals, leaves, and stems to balance the spiritual and energetic centers of one's being. Contents: [What are chakras?](#what-are-chakras) [What Chakras](#herbs-for-the-chakras) What are chakras? Chakras are spinning disks of subtle energy located throughout the spiritual body. There are 7 major chakras, but as many as 114 chakras have been identified. The 7 major chakras span from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. They are correlated with different organs and glands, and can influence spiritual, emotional, mental and physical wellness. The word chakra (traditionally spelt cakra) was first mentioned more than 3,000 years ago in the Vedas - the most ancient of Hindu Scriptures. The word literally translates from Sanskrit to Wheel, and they are understood to be spinning energy vortexes in your spiritual energy field that, when balanced, spin freely and vibrantly in a clockwise direction. What happens when chakras are out of balance? When the chakras are out of balance, energy in the body becomes stagnated, which can lead to a slew of physical, emotional and spiritual issues. One may experience lethargy, headaches, muscle stiffness, stress, immune ailments, stifled creativity, moodiness, mental fog and much more. Over time, energy blockage can result in chronic issues like anxiety and various illnesses. Luckily, often when that root imbalance is addressed and the energy is freed, it can help restore health and harmony in the body and mind.* The chakra-herb connection Herbs have played a central role in chakra balancing for centuries. Herbs themselves contain bioactives and prana (life force), that work powerfully not only on the physical body, but the spiritual body as well. Herbs, full of life, have access to those subtle energies and therefore are utilized by traditional healers in oils, capsules, teas, tinctures and salves. They are typically recommended by holistic practitioners alongside different lifestyle shifts, yoga postures, energy therapies, breathing techniques and meditative practices. Herbs for the chakras Herbs work on both a vibrational and scientific level, bestowing both seen and unseen benefits. They can help enhance your vibration and frequency, which is an amazing start to propel any healing journey. If you think of times you've sipped organic herbal tea, or even times you've smelt herbs as you walk through a wild meadow, you know the instant harmonizing effects herbs bring to the human system. It's a love story as old as time. Learn about herbs to help clear and activate each chakra, starting at the base of the spine all the way through to the crown of the head.
