Samsung smart 4-door Flex refrigerator with Family Hub: Save $1,300 \"This design is brilliant,\" wrote a Samsung customer. \"Each door is small enough to open. There are no handles which makes it being against the wall so much easier. There's no ice maker on the left side of the door to hinder how much you can see on the left side. Opening it at a 90-degree angle is all you need to do everything that you need. It's completely flat which makes opening it to the wall so much easier (if you notice a lot of fridges are domed at the front which does not give you space to open door against the wall).\" Measures 29 cubic feet.

For example, unlike a top-mount refrigerator (which has a smaller freezer compartment), a side-by-side refrigerator has an equal amount of space in both the fresh food compartment and the freezer compartment. However, that space is mostly vertical, meaning the respective compartments are usually very narrow. If you often cook meals or baked goods that take up a lot of horizontal space in the fridge (or if you're like me, and you have a tendency to put the entire box in the fridge when you order pizza), a side-by-side fridge wouldn't work very well for you.\" How to shop for a refrigerator like an appliance expert Want to shop for a refrigerator like an expert? \"The best advice I can give when looking at a specific [refrigerator brand](https://www.cbsnews.com/essentials/best-refrigerator-brands-in-2023-03-21/) is to visit their website,\" DuHaime shared. \"A brand's website can tell you a lot about what it might be like to own an appliance made by that brand. Does their website have customer service easily accessible, or is it difficult to figure out how to get in contact with them? Can you look up a PDF version of their appliance manuals easily, or are they nowhere to be found? Do they offer extra advice on how to get the best out of their products, or does their website focus more on sales? This can all make a big difference in the kind of support you'll receive from that brand should your appliance ever have an issue that you need resolved.\" Shop more of the best refrigerators of 2023 Many of these CBS Essentials reader-loved refrigerators are on sale now.
