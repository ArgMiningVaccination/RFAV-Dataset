In the wake of an ongoing pandemic, UCI Health Affairs - comprised of the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences, UCI Health, and the UCI Centers and Institutes of Health - improved lives by advancing research at the frontiers of knowledge, by educating the next diverse generation of investigators and providers, and by embracing all people. Vice Chancellor's Message Steve A. N. Goldstein, M.A., M.D., Ph.D, FAAP Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs Distinguished Professor, Departments of Pediatrics, Physiology & Biophysics, and Pharmaceutical Sciences DISCOVER: In February, we launched the much-anticipated Institute for Precision Health (IPH). This endeavor ushers in a new epoch in healthcare with UCI in the lead based on institutional prowess as a powerhouse in health and computational science. IPH is using big data to advance clinical practice (for superior treatments that are personalized), inform health policy (to save lives and fortunes), and create health equity (so all are afforded access to good care). TEACH: The state-of-the-art Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences building and Sue & Bill Gross Nursing and Health Sciences Hall progressed full steam all year despite supply chain challenges. This fall we welcome the very first groups of medical, nursing, pharmacy, and public health students to classes, and will see patients in the new home for the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute, in beautiful space designed with sustainability (LEED Platinum) and the wellbeing of people in mind. HEAL: Our pioneering plans for growth on the north edge of the main campus are going strong. Construction of the new UCI Health \u2014 Irvine medical center on Jamboree Road is on schedule. In June, we announced the $20 million naming gift for the Joe C. Wen & Family Center for Advanced Care. That five-story, 168,000-square-foot outpatient facility will open in late-2023 to offer adult and pediatric specialty care, urgent care, digestive health, neurosciences and comprehensive laboratory and radiology imaging services. It will be joined by the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory Care building and a 144-bed hospital in late 2023 and 2025, respectively. The complex will attract top talent to UCI and enhance access to world-class care in south Orange County (OC). UCI is the only university-based health system serving OC and supports 100 regional hospitals by offering world-class care to patients in the region. The unique benefit of the UCI discovery, teaching, and healing mission is that it is a virtuous cycle, empowered by astounding breakthroughs across the university, the vibrant entrepreneurial culture of OC, and the remarkable generosity of our donors. The result is continuous quality improvement that offers our patients the best care available each and every day. Of course, the annual impact report can provide only a small sampling of the revelatory work that is transforming wellness and healthcare for our loved ones and generations to come. We offer it with pride in the determination, brilliance and passion of the people who bring UCI Health Affairs to life.

Or perhaps a lot more. Hundreds of scientists spanning the globe worked persistently and usually in obscurity for more than 30 years before, finally, in 2021 mRNA COVID vaccines materialized and commanded the attention of the world. Parsing the history of the mRNA vaccine, a handful of scientist heroes stand out for key contributions. The science journal Nature called out UCI biochemist Philip Felgner, director of the university's Vaccine Research and Development Center, as among those key contributors who made a difference in the trajectory of mRNA vaccines. In the late 1980s, Felgner helped develop liposomes to deliver mRNA into human cells - research that this year landed him among the recipients for Spain's prestigious Princess of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research. \"It's thrilling for me to see this,\" Felgner told Nature. \" All of the things that we were thinking would happen back then \u2014 it's happening now. \" Top News in National Media UCI Big Hits List UCI Health Affairs had more than 6,000 placements in the media across the region, nationally and abroad this year. With 30.98 billion impressions over the 12 month period, UCI dominated with a 44% share of voice in the Orange County market.

Fel gner was one of two scholars t o win the prestigious 2022 Robert Koch Prize for fundamental contributions to the transfer of nucleic acids into cells. Felgner pioneered the use of lipids (positively-charged lipofectin or liposome-based transfection, the con tribution would ultimately allow scientists to move DNA or RNA where they want it to go. Liposome-based transfection played a crucial role in the development of messenger RNA COVID- 19 vaccines.In addition, the gene therapy technology holds promise for creating preventive vaccines that will help avoid future pandemics and fight HIV and other infectious diseases. The technology may also offer possibilities for treating cancer and Alzheimer's disease and correcting genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease. Felgner, who directs UCI's Vaccine Research and Development Center, shared the Koch prize with Dr. Drew Weissman, a professor in the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.13 2021/22 Annual Impact Report Biomarkers Hold a Clue to Suicide Risk A team of nine UCI researchers, along with members of the Pritzker Research Consortium, have developed an approach to identify blood biomarkers that could predict the suicide risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Publishing in the journal Translational Psychiatry, the researchers performed the first study to analyze matched blood and brain samples in a well-defined population of MDDs, demonstrating significant differences in gene expression associated with completed suicide. Results strongly suggest that blood gene expression is highly informative to understand molecular changes in suicide. Suicides have increased to some 48,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. Developing a suicide biomarker signature in blood could help health care professionals identify who is at highest risk. One Step Closer to Symptom Relief for Parkinson's Patients Thanks to UCI Health neurologist Dr. Claire Henchcliffe and colleagues, we may be one step closer to a breakthrough for the nearly 10 million people worldwide living with Parkinson's disease. Henchcliffe, chair of the Department of Neurology, is principal investigator in MSK-DA01. Animal studies have already shown the next-generation stem cell treatment restores the brain's ability to produce dopamine. An inability to produce dopamine leads to Parkinson's hallmark tremors, stiffness, slowness and lack of coordination. Participants in the human trial phase will now have embryonic stem cells transformed into dopamine-producing neurons surgically transplanted into the putamen, the area of the mid brain that is no longer producing dopamine. Over the next two years, researchers will track participants to determine if the treatment provides long-term symptom relief.UCI Researchers Pave the Way for GPCR Breakthroughs School of Medicine researchers Krzysztof Palczewski, Ph.D., Tamar Getter, Ph.D., and David Salom, Ph.D., teamed up with Oxford researchers to make a discovery that may usher in a new paradigm for drugs that target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The researchers, who published their findings in Nature, uncovered the impact of native lipids on rhodopsin signaling and regeneration. Rhodopsin absorbs light striking photoreceptors, and initiates processing essential for vision. Capturing signaling events of a wild-type receptor in real-time, across a native membrane to its downstream effectors, had previously remained elusive. The team's findings will enable new potential targets of therapeutic value for the visual system. And since diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to blindness are all impacted by the function of GPCRs, researchers expect analogous work to be done on other GPCR systems. 14 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing Nursing Welcomes New Dean In January, the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing welcomed new dean Mark Lazenby, R.N., Ph.D., FAAN. Dean Lazenby is a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing and the American Psychosocial Oncology Society. He earned a Ph.D. in philosophy of religion at Boston University in 2001 and a Master of Science in Nursing from the Yale University School of Nursing in 2009. Most recently before joining UCI, he was a professor of nursing and philosophy, and associate dean for faculty and student affairs at the University of Connecticut. Q: You've been a professor of both nursing and philosophy, which is a unique path, tell us more about that. Dean Lazenby: I'm a philosopher first and I was very happy teaching philosophy. When my parents died of chronic illness fairly close to one another, it was a nurse who helped us understand what was going on with my mother and what it would mean to provide a peaceful death for her. After that experience, I decided to go back to school and become a nurse. Nursing is a way to work with my hands as a philosopher in those big moments that people encounter when they need nursing care.Q: What drew you to the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing? Dean Lazenby: The school of nursing's focus on social justice and its leadership in nursing philosophy is what originally drew me to the school. This focus really resonated with me and my past work. I grew up in California and began my work as a community organizer with underserved youth in East Los Angeles. I believe that the profession of nursing is a powerful driver of social transformation, particularly for social and racial justice. Q: What is your vision for the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing? Dean Lazenby: My vision for the school includes continuing to develop aspiring nurse leaders for clinical practice and the future of nursing science. In doing this, it is critical to prioritize social and racial justice, and expand interdisciplinary research. As we look ahead, the school will leverage its strengths in interdisciplinary research and practice, community engagement, and interprofessional education to set a blueprint for the profession and the nation on how to achieve health equity today and prepare nurse leaders for the future of health.Dean Mark Lazenby15 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Dawn Bounds Awarded Nurse Leader Fellowship Dawn Bounds, an assistant professor of nursing, was one of 12 nurse leaders accepted to the Betty Irene Moore Fellowship for Nurse Leaders and Innovators. As part of the three-year fellowship program, fellows receive $500,000 to conduct an innovative project. Bounds' project will focus on how pandemics impact youth and how digital spaces can offer support. Through Project REVIVE (Resilience Empowered Villages in Virtual Environments), Bounds aims to: Dev elop healthy digital spaces where youth can learn self-regulation techniques. C reate a think tank for youth-friendly, user-centered design for just-in-time adaptive interventions. C ontinue to build pathways for marginalized youth to become peer leaders and future scientists.Generous Gift Expands Nurse Training and Scholarship A $3 million gift from the Sue J. Gross Foundation expanded training and education opportunities in the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing. The generous gift supported: A high-t ech, state-of-the-art simulation center for team-based interprofessional exercises. The center features four suites, each with a different focus, including women's health and pediatrics, surgery, critical care and community health, a hospital bed unit and an examination room. Nursing Ph.D . scholarships through the establishment of the Founding Dean Adey Nyamathi Endowment. In recognition of her gift, a 2,290-square-foot, 200-seat auditorium - connected by a bridge to the Sue & Bill Gross Nursing and Health Sciences Hall - has been named the Sue Gross Auditorium, where UCI faculty can now present research findings and share insights with the campus and community. Sue Gross and Founding Dean Adey Nyamathi Tackling the Stress of Dementia Caregiving Jung-Ah Lee, associate professor of nursing, hopes to help those involved in the \"invisible profession\" - that is, dementia caregivers. Lee is the lead researcher for a study that focuses on Korean, Vietnamese and Spanish-speaking caregivers. The study includes a team of community education specialists who make home visits to listen to the struggles of caregivers and connect them with valuable resources. As part of the study, the caregivers wear smart watches or rings that track their sleep quality, activity levels and additional indicators of stress. The aim of the study is to uncover ways to help caregivers in underserved communities using tech-driven behavioral interventions. A side benefit, says Lee, is that caregivers can use her research team as a resource even after they are no longer in the study. 16 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health SciencesUCI Welcomes First Pharm.D. Class!School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences The School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences proudly welcomed its first Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) class at an inaugural White Coat Ceremony. Founding Dean Jan Hirsch, B.S.Pharm, Ph.D., told the 41 students \u2014 the Class of 2025 \u2014 that their commitment, collaboration and leadership will set the foundation for the program. Pharm.D. Grads will be prepared to serve as medication experts for patients and other members of the healthcare team ensuring safe, effective and optimal use of medications. With UCI's dedication to precision medicine, they'll also be on the forefront of the exciting field of personalized medicine, Vice Chancellor of Health Affairs Dr. Steve A.N. Goldstein, M.D., Ph.D., FAAP , said in his address. Additional speakers included Rear Admiral and Assistant Surgeon General Richardae Araojo, associate commissioner for minority health and director of the FDA 's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity; Provost Hal S. Stern, Ph.D.; and Dr. Allen Chao, founder, chairman and former CEO of Watson Pharmaceuticals and Tanvex BioPharma. Dr. Chao advised students to \"love what you do and follow your heart. \" Associate Dean of Pharmacy Student Affairs Megan Nguyen, Pharm.D. presented the white coats, which were made possible by Anteaters in Pharmacy alumni chapter. Donors added a special quote inside the collar of each coat, a constant reminder that students are supported by alumni from the beginning of their UCI journey. Pharm.D. joins UCI's Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Master of Science in Pharmacology and Ph.D. in Pharmacological Sciences programs. 17 2021/22 Annual Impact Report UCI Researchers Awarded for Framework Encouraging Patient Voice & Personalized Care Founding Dean Jan Hirsch, B.S. Pharm, Ph.D., and Associate Dean of Pharmacy Assessment and Quality, Jonathan Watanabe, Pharm.D., Ph.D., along with UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Professor Derjung Tarn, M.D., Ph.D., received a Value Assessment Challenge Award from the PhRMA Foundation. The team developed a framework for shaping treatment goals based on patient values and shared decision making between patients and clinicians that is continuously refined with a population-based evidence assessment repository. Patient centered health services research has revealed gaps between the outcomes that patients report are most important to them and the outcomes traditionally measured in value assessments. The new framework's aim is to encourage a stronger patient voice in healthcare and more personalized approaches to care. UCI Research Points to Possible Solution for Opioid Addiction A team led by neuropharmacologist Olivier Civelli, distinguished professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, appears to be one step closer to an answer to opioid addiction. An interdisciplinary research team including members from Pharmacological Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Anesthesiology, published findings in the journal of Pharmaceuticals. Their research showed that in animal studies the extract of the plant Corydalis yanhusuo, a painkiller used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, prevents morphine tolerance and dependence while also reversing opiate addiction. Corydalis yanhusuo plant Keck Foundation Backs RNA Research Team Andrej Luptak, professor and chair of pharmaceutical sciences, along with Jennifer Prescher, professor of chemistry, and Oswald Steward, Distinguished professor of anatomy & neurobiology, received a $1 million grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation to develop new molecular tools to identify ribonucleic acids essential in learning and memory formation. The team's project involves building luminescent RNA molecules, allowing the researchers to observe the position and activity of the molecules in the brains of living, learning mice. The research will further the understanding of the roles of RNA and could contribute to discoveries for conditions like Alzheimer's disease.18 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health SciencesResearchers Delineate How Climate Impacts Vulnerable PeopleProgram in Public Health Future School of Population and Public Health UCI-led efforts are continuing to shine light on climate- intensified health risks in California, particularly for our most vulnerable populations. Using a combination of big data, advanced spatial analysis, statistical methods, fieldwork and community participation, Jun Wu, Ph.D., professor of environmental and occupational health, Shahir Masri, Sc.D., associate specialist in air pollution exposure and epidemiology, and other team members examined the relationship between wildfire impacts and socioeconomic vulnerability. The researchers found that a greater proportion of low-income, elderly and Native American populations reside in areas hardest hit by fire. Between 1980 and 1999, catastrophic wildfires happened an average of one and a half times per decade. From 2000 to 2019, incidents increased to seven per 10-year period and cumulative costs jumped from $10 billion to $75 billion.Working with UC Davis researchers, the team published their findings in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The findings should prove important to policymakers and state agencies in charge of allocating resources. In another study, Environmental Health Sciences Ph.D. student Yi Sun, Professor Wu and colleagues looked at how heat, air pollution and green space impact pregnancy. Their findings, published in Environmental Research Letters suggest that reducing exposure to extreme heat for pregnant women is important. Doing so before delivery appears to lower the risk of preterm birth for pregnant women with high exposure to air pollution and low exposure to green space. Babies born prematurely have a higher risk of health problems both at birth and later in life than babies who are not premature. 19 2021/22 Annual Impact Report Public Health Informatics Program Garners Major Award The Program in Public Health is a member of a newly funded interdisciplinary program led by Tim Bruckner, Ph.D., professor of health, society, and behavior and Sora Park Tanjasiri, Dr. P .H., professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. The program's aim is to strengthen U.S. public health information technology (PHIT) efforts, and increasing representation of underrepresented communities within the public health IT workforce. UCI was one of 10 awardees funded by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) as part of its Public Health Informatics & Technology Workforce Development Program. UCI will partner with the Orange County Health Care Agency and others to develop a robust, inclusive and sustainable workforce development program with a national impact. The program at UCI is expected to train 445 students over four years, with more than 80% of those students coming from ethnically diverse communities.UCI-UCLA Collaborate on Major Health Disparity Research Center Representing a boon to research into the disparity of cardiovascular disease, UCI and UCLA were awarded a $17.9 million grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to establish the UCLA-UCI Center for Eliminating Cardiometabolic Disparities in Multi-Ethnic Populations (UC END-DISPARITIES). For the next five years, researchers will study the factors that cause hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and other heart-related disease. Their focus will be on low-income and Latinx, Black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian communities, which have some of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease and related deaths in the nation. The center, co-directed by Dean Bernadette Boden-Albala, will function through three integrated core groups (administrative, investigator development and community engagement) along with two research projects. An infrastructure will also be developed that supports small pilot projects to reduce cardiometabolic disparities, which community organizations and early career investigators can apply for. UC END-DISPARITIES also aims to mentor the next generation of health equity scientists. IISBR & CNLM Team Up for Better Way to Detect Early Cognitive Decline The Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research (IISBR) and the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory have teamed up to develop a method that may help clinicians detect and treat Alzheimer's and dementia earlier. Investigators are looking at the associations between salivary cytokines - proteins that influence interactions between cells - and imaging biomarkers in elderly participants who suffer from the disorders. Research shows that cytokines can play an active role in initiating neurodegeneration by producing inflammatory responses. Pilot studies led by IISBR faculty member and researcher with the UCI Program in Public Health, Beth Thomas, Ph.D., and Program in Public Health epidemiology postdoctoral fellow, Georgia Parkin, Ph.D., have validated a salivary immunoassay to simultaneously measure 10 different cytokines. Preliminary research has demonstrated a correlation between salivary IL-6 and imaging markers in the cortex that are early signs of cognitive decline.

Inaugural Samueli Scholars Award recipients21 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Integrative Health at the Forefront Chad Lefteris is the CEO of UCI Health and Shaista Malik, M.D., is a professor in the School of Medicine, associate vice chancellor of the College of Health Sciences and executive director, Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute. Here CEO Lefteris and Dr. Malik discuss UCI's commitment to integrative health and how patients have embraced the offerings. Q: How has the patient experience at UCI been impacted by integrative health? CEO Lefteris: Patients recognize that UCI Health is leading the way with cutting edge evidence-based care. We've trained thousands of our nurses and other clinicians in elements of integrative care. We continue to invest in hiring and training skilled integrative health professionals to further our Discover, Teach, Heal mission - and patients are very receptive. Dr. Malik: Patients are increasingly choosing the Samueli Institute to support their individual health journeys because they trust the evidence-informed, whole health services our expert providers offer. They like that integrative services are part of the fabric of UCI Health, even in the hospital setting. We believe UCI Douglas Hospital may be the only academic hospital in the United States that continuously trains its inpatient nursing team to offer integrative services at the bedside. Our success in inpatient acupuncture and integrative nursing services are shown through positive patient experience surveys as well as recognition by the Joint Commission surveyors who visited UCI and noted that some of these practices, specifically providing non-pharmacological options for pain management, were examples of best practices. Q: What kind of response are you seeing from patients? CEO Lefteris: After opening our first new site in Newport two years ago, the response from our patients has been outstanding! The new Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute building on campus will further support that growth, making these unique services more easily accessible to our community.Dr. Malik: We are also noticing an increase in demand for professional education - from programs like our new Academic Integrative Medicine Health and Wellness Coaching course to the Health Education to Advance Leaders in Integrative Medicine curriculum that prepares tomorrow's physicians to incorporate integrative concepts into their practices. In recent years, we've seen tremendous growth in visits to our clinics, demonstrating a real interest in whole health options across our community. In the past three years, patient visits have increased by more than 70 percent. We are also seeing more patients request treatments in the hospital setting, primarily to reduce pain, anxiety and nausea. Q: A new flagship clinic is opening at UCI this fall. What can we expect from the new flagship location? Dr. Malik: The Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute's new flagship clinic will have significantly more space than our current Costa Mesa hub and allow us to serve more patients. We are especially excited about the Nutritional Education Center, which includes an expansive, state-of-the-art teaching kitchen, where nutrition education and culinary medicine skills will be facilitated by our executive chef and offered to patients, learners, and the community. Q: As UCI integrative health continues to thrive, what we can look forward to? Dr. Malik: As an academic institute, we are laser-focused on producing scientific evidence that increases understanding of how integrative treatments improve outcomes, who benefits and in what circumstances. To this end, the institute is excited about opening our research core in the coming year. This shared space and resource will foster collaborations among researchers across the UCI campus. We were also selected to be the data coordinating center for a 19-site integrative health practice-based research collaborative, BraveNet. As a member of the consortium, we can also look forward to participating in multi-site integrative health clinical trials at UCI. 22 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences Blazing Trails in Stroke Care & DetectionUCI Health Stroke is among the leading causes of death and disability in adults worldwide, killing about 140,000 Americans each year. That's why UCI is proud of its stellar commitment to stroke care and detection. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recognized UCI Health Comprehensive Stroke and Cerebrovascular Center with its 2021 Get With The Guidelines\u00ae Stroke Gold Plus with Honor Roll Elite Plus and Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll award for providing the highest standard of stroke care according to nationally recognized, research-based guidelines. UCI researchers also continue to blaze trails with stroke detection and treatment. A new five-year study, Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Based Large-Vessel Occlusion Solutions, will examine how the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can expedite the detection of stroke in diagnostic imaging, optimize clinical workflows for stroke care, and improve patient outcomes. The study, sponsored by Canon Medical Systems USA, will evaluate acute stroke triage and identify areas for improvement. 23 2021/22 Annual Impact Report Stem Cells May Offer Hope for Parkinson's In a first-in-human clinical trial, UCI Health neuroscientists are assessing the safety of dopamine-producing stem cells surgically implanted in the brains of patients whose advanced Parkinson's disease has progressed to the point where existing medications no longer work to control symptoms. The treatment, MSK-DA01, consists of embryonic stem cells that have been grown and developed into neurons that produce dopamine, a naturally occurring brain chemical that decreases with Parkinson's disease. Claire Henchcliffe, M.D., D.Phil., is chair of the UCI School of Medicine's Department of Neurology and principal investigator for the trial. In pre-clinical study animal models, Parkinsonian movement symptoms \u2014 problems of slowing and coordination \u2014 were treated and sustained with the stem cells. Establishing the treatment's safety and efficacy are the goals of the phase 1 clinical trial, which is sponsored by BlueRock Therapeutics. Over the next two years, researchers will examine whether the implanted stem cells survive and whether they improve participants' motor functions. Epilepsy Center Gives an Artist a Second Chance UCI Health Comprehensive Epilepsy Center is OC's only academic epilepsy program and one of the leading epilepsy centers in Southern California. Daily, some of the nation's best seizure specialists work to drastically improve the lives of patients like Alan Powell. Powell, a fine artist, was diagnosed with a seizure-disorder that was poorly controlled by medication. His seizures and the side effects of the medications meant that Powell could no longer paint. In fact, he often landed in the hospital due to the severity of his seizures. Powell had all but given up hope when a doctor near his Joshua Tree home encouraged him to make the trek to UCI Health. That's where he met neurosurgeon Dr. Sumeet Vadera and Dr. Mona Sazgar, a nationally regarded neurologist and epileptologist. After a series of tests, the UCI doctors were able to pinpoint Powell's seizures to his right temporal lobe, a part of the brain responsible for visual and spatial memory, and offer a surgical solution. Two surgeries later, Powell became seizure-free. Gradually, he's been able to reclaim his life as an artist and reports that he's doing some of the best work of his life. Bravo, Alan Powell! Alan Powell UCI Provides a Resource for COVID Long Haulers Responding to a community need, UCI Health launched the COVID Recovery Service at outpatient offices in Tustin and Costa Mesa. The program's aim is to help the estimated 10% to 30% of people who have COVID-19 symptoms or complications well after their initial illness. People with persistent symptoms, also known as \"long haulers,\" continue to experience complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, joint pain, anxiety and depression sometimes months after their infection. Often, the patients are uncertain where to turn. COVID Recovery Service provides that resource. The program offers a comprehensive evaluation, referral to specialists, follow-up care and monitoring throughout the course of recovery. In addition to treatment, patients are often offered helpful tools such as free mindful and exercise classes and access to support groups. COVID Recovery Service also educates community doctors on how to identify and treat long COVID. 24 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences Phase One of New Medical Complex Nears CompletionUCI Health - Irvine A long time in the making and finally it's here - well, at least phase one is. UCI and UCI Health's new $1.3 billion medical complex on the north end of the Irvine campus will start serving its first patients soon. Here's what the community has to look forward to: Phase One (2023 opening) The 168,000-square-foot Joe C. Wen & Family Center for Advanced Care, which will include adult primary and specialty care services, comprehensive laboratory and radiology facilities, imaging services and urgent care.

In addition, the facility will advance UCI's longstanding commitment to the region's autism community when the Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders relocates there. The 225,000-square-foot Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory Care building, which will offer 10 outpatient operating rooms and a state-of-the-art cancer center, rooted in the innovation and excellence of Orange County's only National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Phase Two (2025 opening) A 3 50,000-square-foot, 144-bed acute care hospital with an emergency room and 8 operating rooms. It will be the future home of Orange County's only adult hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplant program. Key clinical programs at the new complex will include diabetes care, oncology, neurology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, spine surgery and advanced digestive health services. The new medical center also will be a hub for participation in OC's largest clinical trials portfolio \u2014 including early-phase trials \u2014 in cancer, neurosciences, stem cell-derived treatments, internal medicine and more.25 2021/22 Annual Impact Report Extraordinary Philanthropists Ralph and Sue Stern Support New Cancer Center Ralph and Sue Stern have given more than $12.5 million to the School of Medicine and UCI Health. In 2014, their gift established the Sue and Ralph Stern Center for Cancer Clinical Trials and Research at the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. In 2008, the Sterns turned to UCI Health for help when Sue Stern was diagnosed with a spinal cord tumor. Following her successful treatment, they made two generous gifts in support of ongoing research by UCI Health Drs. Mark Linskey and Daniela Bota for malignant spinal cord and brain tumors. In recognition of a recent gift and Ralph and Sue Stern's longtime support, a cancer clinic floor located in the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory Care building, set to open in late 2023 at the new UCI Health \u2014 Irvine medical complex, will bear their names. The Ralph and Sue Stern cancer clinic floor will include 36 private exam rooms integrating research, prevention and advanced diagnostics, treatments, and rehabilitation programs. Ralph and Sue Stern UCI Health Joins Forces with Kindred for New Irvine Rehab Hospital UCI Health and Kindred Rehabilitation Services (KRS), a business unit of LifePoint Health, have entered a joint venture to construct and operate a 52-bed, 68,000-square-foot inpatient rehabilitation hospital at 17931 Von Karman Ave., in Irvine. The UCI Health Rehabilitation Hospital, slated to open in late 2025, will treat patients recovering from conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, as well as trauma, burn and orthopedic patients. KRS will manage the hospital's day-to-day operations, and patients will receive leading-edge care provided by UCI Health physicians and clinical staff, all in private rooms and state-of-the-art rehabilitation facilities. This new facility will considerably expand the UCI Health inpatient rehabilitation capacity from its current rehabilitation unit at UCI Medical Center in Orange. It will also enable clinicians to conduct clinical research, including clinical trials, and advance new rehabilitation technologies. This new facility will further support the new UCI Health \u2014 Irvine medical complex and draw patients from across Orange County. UCI Health is pleased to announce a $2 million gift that will benefit the emergency department in the new $1.3 billion UCI Health \u2014 Irvine medical campus being built on the corner of Jamboree Road and Birch Street in Irvine. The gift, funded by the Nancy and Geoffrey Stack Family Foundation, will name the patient welcome areas in the emergency department of the planned acute care hospital and at the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Care and Ambulatory Care building. \"UCI Health is a beacon of hope in Orange County,\" said Nancy Stack. \"The new medical complex will bring hope and healing to our region and will save lives. Jeff and I are honored to support such a worthwhile cause. \" Nancy and Geoffrey Stack (center) with UCI Leadership at the UCI Health \u2014 Irvine groundbreaking ceremonyNancy and Geoffrey Stack Family Foundation to Support UCI Health Hospital, Cancer Center in Irvine26 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences Research Centers and Institutes of HealthResearch Centers and Institutes of Health Center for Clinical Research The UCI Center for Clinical Research is a premier clinical research organization providing life-saving clinical trials by strengthening and accelerating the pathway of discovery from bench to bedside.

The UCI Health Cancer Center is among 53 NCI-designated U.S. comprehensive cancer centers and the only one based in Orange County. An NCI designation means patients have access to leading-edge treatments, personalized therapies and clinical trials. UCI Health cancer physicians are specialists in their respective cancer fields who collaborate with researchers to develop new approaches to detecting, preventing and treating cancer for all populations. Recent cancer center initiatives include establishing Orange County's only Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Program for adults with blood-based malignancies and increasing early detection rates for cancer through its Advancing Cancer Care Together program, which was developed by the Cancer Center's Office of Community Engagement to improve care for underserved communities in Orange County. NCI Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center28 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health SciencesResearch Centers and Institutes of Health CCR Helps Launch ACT@POC to Diversify and Streamline Clinical Trials Through the Center for Clinical Research, UCI is home to one of the leading health centers on the West Coast conducting clinical research. Now we are also proud founding members of the Advancing Clinical Trials at the Point of Care coalition. ACT@POC will generate high-quality clinical research evidence in real time to better evaluate treatments and therapeutics, including those to treat COVID-19. Its members will engage a broader, more diverse group of patients and providers and develop digital health tools that make clinical trials simpler to run and more accessible to patients. The multi-stakeholder coalition aims to drive implementation of large-scale clinical trials at the community level - in the doctor's offices and care facilities where most of the U.S. population receives care. Founding members of ACT@POC also include the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, the MITRE Corp., the Cure Drug Repurposing Collaboratory, Duke University Health System, Emory University's Morningside Center for Innovative and Affordable Medicine, Intermountain Healthcare, the Mayo Clinic and the Broad Institute. 29 2021/22 Annual Impact Report IPH: Make Way for a Transformation UCI launched the Institute for Precision Health, a campus-wide, interdisciplinary endeavor that merges the university's powerhouse health sciences, engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence, clinical genomics and data science capabilities. IPH's objective is to identify, create and deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each individual person and, in doing so, confront the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care. The three interacting domains of impact through IPH are Practice Redesign, Deployable Equity and Informed Policy on the bed of enhanced patient experience and outcomes. Considered the next great advancement in healthcare, IPH will offer breakthroughs in understanding diseases in subgroups of patients that incorporate their genetics, environment and other factors that influence health so that clinicians can define diseases better, understand them better and treat them better.Skin Bio Resource Center Awarded Grant for Next Gen Research The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases awarded a team from the UCI Skin Biology Resource Center a five-year, $970,000 grant to launch an interdisciplinary skin biology training program. The program takes advantage of the expertise of UCI faculty in the areas of skin biology, systems biology and imaging. The aim is to develop skin biologists who will integrate bioengineering, imaging and computation into their work to help make breakthroughs in skin biology. The grant funds three graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow, who will pursue a cross-disciplinary project at the intersection of skin biology and either systems biology, bioengineering or imaging, guided by a skin biologist and a mentor from a complementary field. The program includes laboratory-based research, lectures, weekly data presentations, a seminar series and a yearly symposium, as well as career development activities tailored to trainees' interests and career goals. UCI's Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center is administering the grant.$5.5M Grant Supports Spinal Cord Injury Therapeutic The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine awarded Aileen Anderson, director of UCI's Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center and professor of physical medicine & rehabilitation, a 30-month, $5.5 million grant for development of a new human neural stem cell therapeutic for treating chronic cervical spinal cord injury. In the U.S. there are about 285,000 individuals living with paralysis due to traumatic spinal cord injury and there are no FDA-approved treatments. Anderson's work involves integrating transplanted human neural stem cells to improve locomotor function. Increasing a single level of spine function can make a significant positive impact on both quality of life and the economic burden of disease for patients. ICTS Welcomes Director Eric Vilain This fall, Eric Vilain, M.D., Ph.D., joins UCI as professor in the School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics, associate vice chancellor for Clinical and Translational Research, and director of the Institute for Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS). Dr. Vilain will ensure ICTS fulfills the broad NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards program mission, which means serving as one of the nationwide hubs dedicated to improving the translational research process to quickly get more treatments to more patients.

Amin, M.D., MBA, chair of medicine and executive director of hospital medicine. At the core of IPH is the collaboratory for health and wellness (powered by Syntropy), which houses the dynamic analytics platforms and patient-controlled data. Precision health endeavors will tap into campuswide resources - health sciences, engineering, statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, clinical genomics, data science, public health, and healthcare delivery system capabilities - to confront the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care. Operating as an institute without walls, IPH aims to eventually have a brick-and-mortar home on campus, which will serve as a hub to educate data-informed clinicians so they can practice at the top of their licenses, train data scientists to collaborate with clinical practitioners to develop the analytic tools that will drive the field, house personnel to facilitate translational research, and serve as a location for both community outreach and industry collaborations.31 2020/21 Annual Impact Report \"What we are doing in the Institute for Precision Health is perhaps the most important step that we will take in this generation to improve health and well-being. The ever-evolving capabilities of IPH herald a future of personally-tailored care that fundamentally alters the healthcare landscape to place the patient at the center and in control. \" \u2014 Steve A. N. Goldstein, M.A., M.D., Ph.D., FAAP UCI Health Affairs Vice Chancellor Alpesh N. Amin , M.D., MBA 3 Questions for IPH's New Medical Director Alpesh N. Amin, M.D., MBA professor and chair of medicine, founded and developed UCI Health's innovative hospitalist program. Now he has taken the lead as co-director & medical director of the new Institute for Precision Health, an endeavor that marries UCI's powerhouse health sciences, engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science capabilities. Here Dr. Amin answers a few questions about IPH and its mission. Q: Data is at the heart of precision medicine. Can you explain? Dr. Amin: Data is at the heart of almost anything successful. If I'm developing a new program, there must be financial sustainability. I need data to substantiate that. When I'm doing research, there's obviously data around that. When I'm treating patients, I want to deliver the highest quality healthcare and the best results. I need data to de fine my notion of what quality is. I think we all know by now that data is essential. It's just with precision medicine, we'll be able to do mor e with data, and eventually it will lead to better care and more medical breakthroughs. I'm in the business of creating resources that will allow us to further innovate in health and patient care, and ultimately translate that knowledge and approach forward. IPH' s work, which hinges on using data, will do this. Q: You've said IPH is purpose-driv en. What do you mean? Dr. Amin: Every one who is w orking with IPH sees the goal as healing patien ts. W e will focus on projects that produce impact. And by that, I mean better health in people and the community. Our goal is to deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each person - and, along the way, confront the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care. Q: Do you expect breakthroughs from IPH quickly? Dr. Amin: The speed at which we advance always depends on resources, vision, culture and so many other fact ors. The university's commitment and very formation of IPH is a catalyst to deliver speed and agility, that l eads to health data deliv ering value in a way that creates disruptive innovation for the betterment of patients and the community . With eight functional units, I expect IPH to have quick breakthroughs l everaging the creation of processes, tools, outcomes, and experie nce impacting the sp ectrum of care d elivery.32 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences All Together Now: The Future of Interprofessional Education Interprofessional Education (IPE) - healthcare professionals learning and working together - is a top priority in the College of Health Science. Jan Hirsch, professor of clinical pharmacy and founding dean of the School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Mark Lazenby, professor of nursing and the dean of the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing, teamed up to answer a few questions about IPE and why it's integral. Q: What is Interprofessional Education and why is it important to the future of team-based care?Dean Hirsch: If you think about many healthcare settings, patients get care from a team of different specialists - doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and more. Since this is the case, IPE can expand and hasten a positive impact on patient care since students are training together with other healthcare and public health professional students long before working together in a patient care setting. Students learn the specific roles of each profession - the expertise, responsibilities, protocols, and the workflow - as well as how to capitalize on synergies to create positive, patient-centered outcomes not possible when working in silos. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and when our students learn together, they will develop new ways to provide comprehensive, coordinated care to improve patient overall health and wellbeing. Q: What IPE opportunities does the COHS provide for students?Dean Hirsch: For our students, there are opportunities for interprofessional development and training within courses and during experiential learning activities delivered by faculty across all four schools. Because of our unique structure, students also have the opportunity to work and learn from professionals within the UCI Health and the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute. Q: What impact do you anticipate the new high-fidelity simulation center will have for students?Dean Lazenby: The new center will offer high-fidelity simulation experiences and give our students the opportunity to work in extremely realistic spaces, watch recorded simulations to improve performance, engage more students and standardized patients and create simulations that mimic the home environment. Q: How will the new center facilitate IPE for all students within COHS?Dean Lazenby: The new simulation center will offer spaces that mimic the hospital setting, including a space designed as a pharmacy with the potential for compounding medications, collaboration spaces where \"family meetings\" can occur and examination rooms. These spaces will enable us to engage all professions together in areas that are identical to the hospital and clinic to allow more realistic interprofessional interactions promoting communication and collaboration. Interprofessional Education and Practice New high-fidelity simulation center33 2020/21 Annual Impact Report The Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences and UCI Health are building bridges across disciplines to advance a transformative model of discovery, teaching and healing. Our health sciences students benefit from a unique team-based, interprofessional approach to education. Health Sciences Pitches in to Vaccinate Nearly 400 Students Against Flu Volunteers from the Program in Public Health, the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing, the School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the Student Health Center worked together to provide flu shots to nearly 400 students in a three-day, pop-up clinic at Anteater Plaza. The idea for the pop-up clinic started with the need to conveniently administer flu shots to students who hadn't found the time to visit their healthcare provider or the UCI Student Health Center. A UC Policy, implemented in October, stated that all students, faculty, and staff were required to receive a flu vaccine to stave off a flu outbreak amid the ongoing pandemic. Students Train to Confront Discrimination An interdisciplinary research team dedicated to helping students recognize, respond to, and prevent microaggressions in the clinical setting has come together for the new program: READ What is SAID: An Inter-professional Approach to Clinical Assessment. The program trains students across the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences about empathy, awareness, and communication skills needed to recognize and confront discrimination in ways that supports the needs of both the patient and provider.34 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences Breaking Ground on a Bright Future for Translational Research Big things are happening on the southwest side of campus. That is the site of Falling Leaves Medical Innovation Building, a future 200,0000-square-foot facility that will be used for translational health sciences research. Made possible by a $30 million donation from from Dr. Adeline Yen Mah and Professor Robert Mah's Falling Leaves Foundation, the building will be the largest research facility on campus and one of the largest in the western United States. The building will offer state-of-the art wet labs for basic and translational research and training, and teaching spaces that bring UCI's collaborative health alliance model to life - with experts across health disciplines working side-by-side. Michael J. Stamos, M.D. is the dean of the School of Medicine. He came to UCI in 2002, serving as a professor and the John E. Connolly Chair in Surgery before being named interim dean of the School of Medicine in 2016 and dean in 2017. Here Dr. Stamos weighs in on the importance of scientists working across disciplines to bring innovation to the world. Q: How involved is the College of Health Sciences in interdisciplinary research across the UCI campus and beyond? Dean Stamos: There are many collaborations between COHS schools and other schools, as well as with other universities beyond our campus. We truly believe in the power of interdisciplinary research. In fact, we incentivize collaboration. We hold joint retreats - for example Biological Science and School of Medicine retreats - as well as offer grants specifically for faculty who cross schools or sites to work together. Q: How will the new Falling Leaves Foundation Medical Innovation Building provide opportunity for growth and scientific advancement for the COHS and UCI? Dean Stamos: The Falling Leaves Foundation Medical Innovation Building is a perfect example of how much we're doing to encourage interdisciplinary work. That building will be used to bring together seemingly disparate disciplines to join forces to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible for a scientist in a single discipline to do. I expect we'll see much impressive work coming out of that building. Q: Will the new building also impact translational research? Dean Stamos: The entire focus of the building will be translational research \u2014 bringing t ogether basic scientists and physician scientists to work on a common problem. Translational research is where the bench meets the bedside. It is the catalyst that transforms basic science research into actional innovations to improve the human condition. Phil Felgner's work, that ultimately led to the mRNA vaccine, is a great example. The building will certainly encourage more of this, which is phenomenal. Interdisciplinary Research35 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Researchers Look at New Ways to Predict Addiction Vulnerability An interdisciplinary research team including the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medicine and the Irvine Center for Addiction Neuroscience, is part of a five-year project to understand the opioid crisis. The researchers are investigating how early-life adversity influences epigenetics, or experience-induced changes in gene expression, and how they affect the likelihood of adult addiction. Researchers will compare vesicles (cell-produced droplets containing proteins and microRNAs), in blood samples and the cerebral spinal fluid of rodents to learn if the blood holds clues about an individual's risk of addiction or other mental disorders. If so, it could mean a blood screening might be able to prevent addiction vulnerability. Researchers Use AI to See Color in the Dark It all started with this question: Is there a way to do everything in the dark? That's what led Andrew Browne, Ph.D., M.D., clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology in the School of Medicine, and computer scientist Pierre Baldi, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor in the department of computer science, to use artificial intelligence to train a night-vision system to identify the infrared fingerprint of colors in the dark. The researchers, who published their findings in PLOS ONE, experimented with a camera that was sensitive to both visible and near-infrared light and connected to a convolutional neural network. They used this system to analyze 140 images of faces printed using cyan, magenta, yellow and black inks lit under multispectral illumination spanning both visible and infrared wavelengths. In effect, they successfully predicted and reconstructed how faces in pitch-black settings would look in visible light. The technology may be useful for military and medical uses - and of course recreational.Researchers Discover How to 'Turn Off' Certain Skin Cancers It's elegant, but it took a decade-plus of research made possible by National Institutes for Health and the UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge. Anand Ganesan, M.D., UCI Health dermatologist and School of Medicine professor of dermatology and biological sciences, and Marco De Vivo, group leader of the Molecular Modeling & Drug Discovery Lab at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Genoa, have discovered how to flip the \"off-switch\" for certain chemotherapy-resistant Stage III melanomas. Their work, based on computational models, used a genetic approach to find out which signaling pathway was integral for the cancers and then how to use medication to interfere with the signal. The researchers and two other partners have now launched Alyra Therapeutics to develop the medication further. Researchers Explore Links Between Enzyme, Viruses and Cancer A study led by R\u00e9mi Buisson, Ph.D., assistant professor in the UCI School of Medicine Department of Biological Chemistry, along with graduate student Sunwoo Oh and postdoctoral fellow Elodie Bournique, Ph.D., has revealed different ways that cells regulate the enzyme APOBEC3A. Their work illustrates how viral infection triggers a specific innate immune response to activate APOBEC3A expression in human cells and how this is important in the elimination of the virus. The enzyme is linked to genetic changes that present in up to 80 percent of certain cancer types \u2014 including lung, breast and bladder cancers. By understanding how cancer cells and viral infections regulate APOBEC3A expression, the researchers are poised to take the next step toward finding new therapeutic strategies to fight cancer.36 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health SciencesCapital Projects This fall 2022, UCI is planning a soft-opening of the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences (COHS) and the Sue & Bill Gross Nursing and Health Sciences Hall (N&HSH). Construction on the state-of-the-art complex began in February 2020.

Dean Boden-Albala is a renowned researcher and administrator whose efforts to reduce health disparities for America's disadvantaged became a blueprint for community-based stroke and heart disease prevention. Here she answers a few questions about health equity, a topic at the very center of her life's work. Q: Why is health equity critical to society? Dean Boden-Albala: We know that while there are genetic factors that influence health, it is mostly influenced by social and environmental factors. As a society, we've placed some people and communities in positions where access and resources to all the things needed to optimize health are simply not equal. For example, we know that when we look at heart disease, an affluent white male will have a very different experience with the disease when compared to someone who is not affluent and perhaps a minority in Orange County. The disease experience, the disease prognosis, the access to resources, and many other factors are different. That's how health equity or inequity manifests itself. Of course, meanwhile, everything that we stand for in this country is about our right to a good and healthy life. So, rooting out inequity when it comes to health is fundamental to our country's values.Q: Can you explain a bit about 'deployable equity'? Dean Boden-Albala: Absolutely. Deployable equity means that we're out engaging community stakeholders and health-equity groups so that our researchers and clinicians work with the community to create solutions that truly work. Public health has really led the call to build these meaningful relationships because we know it's the only way to create sustainable change. Q: How does the call for health equity impact all of UCI Health Affairs?Dean Boden-Albala: Everybody in the College of Health Sciences understands that our aim is to narrow the disparities gap in the health and wellbeing of underserved and at-risk populations. Only in true partnership with our communities can we begin to realize optimal and sustainable solutions where everyone can achieve health and wellbeing in Orange County and beyond. Nursing, pharmacy, public health, medicine...we've worked to ensure that everyone is highly aware of how structural bias impacts health and wellbeing. UCI researchers and clinicians are focused on different strategies to overcome bias and create a healthier Orange County. Awareness and focus on equity play a key role in everything - from how someone designs a clinical trial to how nurses are trained or which initiatives we undertake. Health equity is our fundamental goal and at the core of our mission. Health Equity39 2021/22 Annual Impact Report Confronting Racism in Healthcare Dr. Sora Tanjasiri shares her parents' immigration story from Korea to the U.S. and how they faced racism on their route to achieve higher education and success. Tanjasiri reports how these same prejudices have invaded America's healthcare system and how biased narratives can cause physical harm. Tanjasiri addresses how the recent launch of the Institute for Precision Health tackles these biases. Disparities in Marginalized CommunitiesProfessor Cheryl Wisseh, clinical pharmacist, highlights the importance of breaking down the barriers of structural racism in primary care, offering solutions to address some of these disparities through clinical practice, research, community solutions, and advocacy. High-Quality Care in FQHCs Joyce Yu-Chia Lee, Pharm.D. and Sarah McBane, Pharm.D., advocate for the importance of improving the quality of care in underserved areas. Solutions expanded upon include increasing access to digital care and increased education.Climate Change as a Social Determinant of HealthWith growing concerns around unhealthy conditions caused by climate change, Professor Jun Wu says that if society does not act now, the devastation caused by fires, floods, rising temperatures, and mass displacement will be catastrophic to millions of people. Healthcare in Latinx Communities Led by Dr. Charles Vega, the UCI PRIME-LC program has been used as an exemplary model to address healthcare disparities in the Latinx community. This program's goal to achieve better healthcare is tackled through putting the primary focus on shaping the healthcare workers who will serve this community. COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Countering vaccine hesitancy is the key to reducing infection and hospitalization rates. Bernadette Boden-Albala, dean of the future UCI School of Population and Public Health, provides strategies for healthcare providers to utilize to encourage vaccination and to better reach those in underserved communities. Transgender Health Equity Many transgender children avoid medical care for fear of discrimination. Brit Cevantes highlights the healthcare challenges that gender-nonconforming children face and the policies and programs UCI has put in place to confront this issue. 40 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health SciencesAdvancement and Engagement \"UCI Health is building Orange County's next chapter of healthcare in Irvine.
