When you take charge of your well-being, you'll feel healthier inside and out. Small efforts every day add up to a big impact. \"By taking specific steps each day, you can optimize your beauty hormones,\" says [Dr. Shelena Lalji](http://www.drshel.com/dr-shelena-lalji/), founder of Dr. Shel Wellness & Aesthetic Center and medical advisor to Douglas Laboratories. \"These hormones help boost your overall appearance. Features like your skin, hair and nails suddenly look stronger, younger and more radiant than ever.\" Dr. Shel says the following five steps can help jump-start your beauty hormones so you can look your best whether you're in your 20s or 60s: Step 1: Follow a plant-based paleo eating plan. Your diet directly affects how you feel on the inside and how you look on the outside. Cut out dairy, sugar, gluten and alcohol to reduce inflammation internally and externally. Boost your intake of fresh organic produce, striving for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. A simple rule is, the more variety of colors you eat, the more nutrients your body receives. Step 2: Balance your hormones through supplementation.* Talk with your health care practitioner about adding nutritional supplements that can help support beauty hormones and skin health.* Some of Dr. Shel's favorites include: Ultra HNS, a blend of high dose biotin, methylfolate, vitamin C, zinc and Cynatine(R) HNS, a patented, solubilized keratin for the health of hair, nails and skin. Cynatine(R) HNS has demonstrated that it can improve the strength, brightness and appearance of hair, nails and skin, as well as reduce hair loss associated with washing.* Skin Nourish, a special skin nutrient blend containing polyphenolic compounds from grape seed, superoxide dismutase (SOD) from melon, vitamin C and zinc which are primary and secondary antioxidants that support the appearance of radiant skin color, contrast and integrity.* Skin Protect, a clinically studied combination of the antioxidants carnosic acid, lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene to promote smooth, healthy skin from the inside out, while helping to protect from damage caused by UV sunlight exposure and environmental stresses.* Hydrolyzed Collagen Plus, a unique formulation for skin and joint health. Collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and co-factors support the appearance of healthy skin by promoting collagen production, skin elasticity and hydration, while lessening the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.* Finally, daily probiotics and vitamin C support overall well-being while supporting a healthy immune system.* Learn more at [www.douglaslabs.com/HealthyAging](http://www.douglaslabs.com/HealthyAging). Step 3: Identify and avoid food sensitivities. You're likely sensitive to some foods and don't even know it. Pay attention to how you feel after eating certain foods. Does cheese make you feel sluggish? Does processed food make you feel bloated? To learn more, ask your doctor about running an allergy and food-sensitivity test. Then make adjustments to your nutrition as needed. If a test is not readily available, begin by cutting out processed foods including sugar, gluten and dairy. Step 4: Focus on daily detoxification activities. Start each day with a cup of room-temperature water with lemon to eliminate toxins from the liver and balance the body's PH levels and get alkalinized. Exercising each day also supports detoxification, getting the heart pumping and organs working to flush pollutants that come from daily exposure. Step 5: Keep calm. Stress impacts cortisol levels, suppresses the immune system and causes hormonal imbalance. Plus, it affects your overall happiness. Fortunately, managing stress is in your control. Simple deep breathing techniques and daily meditation can help you feel centered and in control. In addition, make adequate time for rest and sleep each night (at least 7 to 8 hours per night) so your body can heal and recharge. Your cortisol will start balancing out. \"Transforming your health both inside and out will boost your self-confidence so you feel your best,\" says Dr. Shel. \"From smart supplements to daily detox, you'll look amazing no matter your age.\" *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
