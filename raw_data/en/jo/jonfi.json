Main outcomes were average asthma severity (0-10, primary outcome); symptoms (1-4); and asthma-related quality of life at 12-month follow-up (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] overall score, 1-7, for adults; KINDL Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents, asthma module, 0-100, for children) at 12-month follow-up.Results: Ninety patients (54 adults, 36 children) were included. Anthroposophic treatment modalities used were medications (88% of patients, n = 79/90); eurythmy therapy (22%); art therapy (10%); and rhythmical massage therapy (1%). Median number of eurythmy/art/massage sessions was 12 (interquartile range 10-20), median therapy duration was 120 days (84-184). From baseline to 12-month follow-up, all outcomes improved significantly (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Average improvements were: average asthma severity 2.61 points (95% confidence interval CI: 1.90-3.32); cough 0.93 (95% CI: 0.60-1.25); dyspnea 0.92 (95% CI: 0.56-1.28); exertion-induced symptoms 0.95 (95% CI: 0.64-1.25); frequency of asthma attacks 0.78 (95% CI:0.41-1.14); awakening from asthma 0.90 (95% CI: 0.58-1.21); AQLQ overall score 1.44 (95% CI:0.97-1.92); and KINDL asthma module 14.74 (95% CI: 9.70-19.78). All improvements were maintained until last follow-up after 24 months.Conclusions: Patients with asthma under anthroposophic treatment had long-term improvements of symptoms and quality of life.Keywords: anthroposophy, art therapy, asthma, combined modality therapy, drug therapy, eurythmy therapy, prospective studies, quality of life", "sitename": "Journal of Asthma and Allergy", "date": "2009-11-24", "cleaned_text": "Back to [Journals](browse_journals.php) \u00bb [Journal of Asthma and therapy for asthma: A two-year prospective cohort study in routine outpatient 111\u2014128 DOI [https://doi.org/10.2147/JAA.S7184](https://doi.org/10.2147/JAA.S7184) Review by [Single anonymous peer review](peer-review-guidelines) Peer reviewer comments 2 Harald and Medical Methodology, Freiburg, Germany; 2Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology, and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 University Medical Center, Berlin, Germany; 3Internal Medicine Practice, Cancer Research, Arlesheim, Switzerland Background: Anthroposophic treatment for asthma includes special artistic and physical therapies and special medications.
