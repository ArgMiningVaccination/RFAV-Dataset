You will have an arsenal of naturally beautiful, restorative tools at your disposal the next time you're feeling unfocused, exhausted, or overwhelmed. (Talk about a gift that keeps on giving!) In this article, I want to introduce you to another ritual, laying of stones, which has been practiced for thousands of years. The ritual involves placing stones at points on the body that correspond to the chakras, or energy centers. This is known as \" clearing,\" \"opening,\" or \"balancing.\" Balancing your chakras through the laying of stones not only keeps both blood and energy flowing throughout the body, but it also infuses the body with the energy of the gemstones, supporting its natural healing process. The ritual comes to us in the present day through the teachings of Indian Vedic texts written more than five thousand years ago. Today, healers lay chakra crystals to relieve stress, particularly during times of change; improve self-esteem; sharpen concentration; aid in creative and personal growth; and promote inner harmony and balance. I experienced the power of crystal healing through the laying of stones shortly after my father passed away suddenly in 2011. I felt deeply off center and out of balance. My [Heart chakra energy](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/heart-chakra-opening-meditation/) was low, which at first I sensed more than rationally knew. What I didn't realize at the time is that when one or more of your energies is running low, it can affect all aspects of your life, from the free flow of thoughts and ideas to relationships, health, and spiritual connection. I was familiar with balancing from the sj\u00e4l facial, which seeks to generally align the body's energy as part of the treatment. During the facial, I had always responded most powerfully to the rose quartz placed on my Heart chakra. After my father passed, I found myself thinking about the Heart chakra more and more. One evening, I set aside some quiet time by myself. After setting an intention, \"Please allow my Heart to open,\" which I repeated several times, I lay down and placed a pink rose quartz and a green malachite on my Heart chakra. I visualized my heart expanding, making room for love and acceptance. As I let go, I felt a subtle yet [powerful surge of energy](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/aura-reading-cleansing-energy-field/) around my heart from the chakra crystal that blanketed me with warmth as it expanded outward like the sun's rays. Afterward, I felt at peace, and the heaviness in my heart dissipated. As with any successful healing or opening, having the right tools on hand is key. In this case, chakra crystals and gemstones are the keys to the kingdom. And laying the stones couldn't be simpler: you simply place one or more of the 7 stones outlined below or crystals of a color that corresponds to one of the seven chakra points on or near that point, then leave them there for a period of time to help open the chakras. Don't let the simplicity of the ritual fool you; I find using [healing crystals](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/crystal-healing-guide/) incredibly effective for moving stagnant energy. If you don't experience movement, small clear quartz apexes placed strategically around your body can assist in amplifying another stone's energy. You may, as I did, feel your chakras open after just one clearing session. But if you don't, keep at it. Moving energy that has been stagnant for months or even years is a process, a practice, and a slow build. As with exercise, you've got to keep at using the crystals to see and feel the changes in energy flow, which at times can be subtle. How long should you set aside to perform the laying of chakra stones rituals outlined in this chapter? I suggest at least fifteen to twenty minutes, although leaving them on longer is fine. If you feel uncomfortable at any point remove the stone, cleanse it, and try again at another time. After the first week, during which you'll start slowly by laying just one crystal each day on a corresponding chakra point, aim for three sessions a week. Remember, clearing out the residue from physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual imbalances can lead to positive opportunities personally, professionally, and spiritually, so the time you invest in yourself can yield valuable dividends.
