Byung Jun Park* Department of Pathology, College of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon University, Daejeon, 300-716, Korea Opinion It has been 200 years since the disease was named after James Parkinson. However, the cause and treatment for the disease haven't been known yet. I intend to express my opinion from my experience and knowledge that I have gained from treating numerous patients for the last years. Most patients experienced fatigue, stress, argument, surgery and excessive medication before the outbreak of Parkinson's disease. These symptoms seem to affect substantia nigra by functioning as toxin in the body and mind. That is, fatigue and toxin in the physical and mental health cause oxidant stress, malfunction of mitochondrial complex and inflammation, and then the symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear by lack of dopamine in substantia nigra and corpus striatum. The synapse between nerves needs some sort of medium, which is called 'neurotransmitter' . The neurotransmitter is secreted nigra dies naturally by 5% every 10 years, and theoretically, 60% dies at the age of 120. From that point, humans lack neurotransmitter including dopamine, resulting in appearance of the symptoms of Parkinson's diseases. In other words, when the symptoms appear, the age of the brain is over 120 years old. Nevertheless, current medical field executes supply of dopamine or deep brain stimulation. Supply of harmonious neurotransmitter results in side effects such as *Corresponding author: Byung Jun Park, Department of Pathology, College of University, Daejeon, 300-716, January 22, 2016; Accepted January 24, 2016 ; Published January 27, 2016Citation: Park BJ (2016) How Should We Deal with Parkinson's Single Cell Biol 5: 129. doi: 2016 Park BJ.

This phenomenon is very similar to the case of Viagra, which improves sexual function temporarily but causes to age muscles and ossature. That is, Parkinson's disease needs to prevent death of substantia nigra that creates harmonious neurotransmitter including dopamine, and activate it in addition to activating the body. Hepad blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hepad treatment significantly increased the attenuated circling behavior relative to the 6-OHDA-treated disease group. This research means that Hepad has protection effect of nerve cells, anti-inflammatory effect and antioxidative effect, activating dopamine cells in substantia nigra. \"5 kind-therapy' , the combination of Hepad and 4 treatment methods including meditation, acupressure, stride length and brown rice diet, activates physical functions, resulting in more fundamental treatment. In the future, solving Parkinson's disease should be from activation of substantia nigra and physical function, rather than supply of dopamine drugs. *Hepad (Healing herbmedicinc of parkinson disease) "}
