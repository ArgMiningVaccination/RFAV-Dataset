Video: 8 Home Remedies for Stomach Pain in Toddlers Natural Remedies for Stomach Ache in Toddlers If you have experienced sleepless nights because your child complains of tummy pain, then don't worry. Here are some remedies for stomach pain in toddlers. These remedies will cure his stomach pain, and soon he will feel better. 1. Keep Your Child Hydrated. Offer any unsweetened form of tea, like mint or ginger ale tea, to your child to keep him hydrated. This will soothe the aching nerves of his stomach and help lower his stomach pain. Avoid giving him dairy products or fried/oily products until he feels better. You can give him toast or oatmeal when he feels hungry. If his stomach pain is accompanied by vomiting, do not feed him any solids; let him be on a liquid diet until the pain subsides. 2. Try a Warm Compress. One of the safest and most effective remedies for stomach aches is a warm compress. The best thing about warm compress is that it does not have any side effects, and it provides quick relief. If you are using a heating pad, select the lowest level of heat and keep it on your child's abdomen. But don't place it directly. If you don't have a heating pad, use a bottle filled with warm water; wrap it in a cloth, and your warm compress is ready. Make sure that the heating pad or the water bottle you use is warm and NOT hot. You don't want to hurt your child. A warm compress is very effective. The heat will relax his muscles and provide relief from stomach pain. 3. Apply Asafoetida Paste. Asafoetida or hing is also an effective remedy for stomach pain in toddlers. It eases stomach pain by aiding the release of gases from the body. Mix some hing powder in water to make a paste and apply it around the child's belly button. Ensure that he is lying in a horizontal position while you do so to make sure that the paste does not enter the navel. Mixing hing powder with olive oil and massaging the baby's abdominal area with it for some time can also provide him with quick relief. 4. Make Him Eat Yoghurt and Other Probiotic Foods. Probiotic foods are also known to help soothe stomach pain. For example, yoghurt, which has probiotics in it, can provide relief from diarrhoea and cramps. Yoghurt is also full of good bacteria, which compensates for the loss of microbes in the gut. Fenugreek seeds also help treat stomach pain in toddlers. Grind a handful of fenugreek seeds, add in the yoghurt, and give it to your child if he has stomach pain. Instead of giving him any heavy food, give him khichdi or plain rice. Khichdi is light on the tummy and will soothe your child's upset tummy. 5. Offer Herbal Teas. Herbal teas can also are known to soothe tummy aches in toddlers. Grate some ginger and let it soak in warm water for some time. Then strain and give it to your child if he is two years or above. If he is below two years of age, you can apply ginger juice around his navel area. You can also give him a cup of tea with a few mint leaves and a few drops of lemon juice in it, as it helps ease [stomach pain](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/baby-stomach-pain-symptoms-causes-and-treatment/?ref=interlink). Mint can help remove harmful bacteria from the gut, while lemon can help with constipation. However, before giving herbal teas to your child, do consult with a doctor. 6. Give Him Honey. Honey is a good source of carbohydrates, sugars, and antioxidants. It can be given to babies by adding it to herbal teas or in warm water. Kids also love eating it simply. However, do not feed honey to your child if he is younger than 2 years. 7. Massage Him Gently. The aching nerves and muscles of the stomach area can be relieved by enhancing the blood circulation around it and this can be easily achieved by giving a gentle massage. Using your palms and fingers, gently massage in circular motions in the clockwise direction around the navel area of your child. Massaging from the chin downwards to the lower portion of the abdomen can also provide relief. 8. Try Foot Reflexology. There are many nerves in our hands and feet which, when pressed lightly, can have a therapeutic effect on specific areas of the body. Hold your child's left foot with the palm of your right hand. With your left hand under the ball of his foot, apply steady pressure using your thumb. Apply pressure on the central arch of his left foot for a minute and repeat this 4-5 times. Do this before mealtime for an immediate effect. 9. Get Him Moving. Although it is not a home remedy, it can help. Any action that can help stimulate the gastrointestinal tract is recommended if your child complains of a stomach ache. Moderate activities like walking and running without any twisting or turning can provide relief to your little one's stomach. 10. Try the BRAT Diet. If you are a parent to a toddler, you must be aware of the BRAT diet. However, if you aren't, then find out what it is because it can provide relief from an upset stomach. Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT) diet can provide your kiddo much relief if he has diarrhoea. These foods do not contain any spices, hence won't aggravate the condition. Furthermore, this bland diet is perfect for kids when they are sick and want something to eat that agrees with their taste buds. How to Prevent Stomach Ache in Toddlers?
