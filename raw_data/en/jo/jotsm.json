more than 45 million children in federal fiscal year (FFY) 2015, representing more than 1 in 3 children in the United States and covering nearly half of all births. As the HHS agency responsible for ensuring quality health care coverage for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plays a key role in promoting quality health care for children in Medicaid and CHIP. CMS's 2015 core set of health care quality measures for children in Medicaid and CHIP (referred to as the Child Core Set) supports federal and state efforts to collect, report, and use a standardized set of measures to improve the quality of care provided to children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. The 2015 Child Core Set includes 24 measures that address the following domains of care: Primary Care Access and Preventive Care Maternal and Perinatal Health Care of Acute and Chronic Conditions Behavioral Health Care Dental and Oral Health Services This Chart Pack summarizes state reporting on the quality of health care furnished to children covered by Medicaid and CHIP during FFY 2015, which generally covers care delivered in calendar year 2014. The Chart Pack includes detailed analysis of state performance on 19 publicly reported measures. For a measure to be publicly reported, data must be provided to CMS by at least 25 states and meet internal standards for quality. More information on the Child Core Set is available at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality -of-care/performance -measurement/child -core- set/index.html .About the 2015 Child Core Set 24 measures that address key aspects of health care access and quality for children and pregnant women covered by Medicaid and CHIP 5OVERVIEW OF STATE REPORTING OF THE 2015 CHILD CORE SET 6Number of Child Core Set Measures Reported by States, FFY 2015 Sources: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports and Form CMS -416 reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

ADHD = Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; C&M = Continuation and Maintenance. 12Medicaid and CHIP provide access to well -child visits and other preventive health care services, including immunizations, screenings, and counseling to support healthy living. The Early and Period Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment ( EPSDT ) benefit is key to ensuring that children and adolescents covered by Medicaid receive appropriate preventive, dental, mental health, developmental, and specialty services. Access to regular primary care services can prevent infectious and chronic disease and other health conditions, help people live longer, healthier lives, and improve the health of the population. Nine Child Core Set measures of primary care access and preventive care were available for analysis for FFY 2015. These measures are among the most frequently reported measures in the Child Core Set. Child and Adolescent Access to Primary Care Practitioners Well-Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life Well-Child Visits in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Years of Life Adolescent Well -Care Visits Childhood Immunization Status Immunizations for Adolescents Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine for Female Adolescents Chlamydia Screening in Women Body Mass Index for Children and AdolescentsPrimary Care Access and Preventive Care 13Primary care visits offer the opportunity for routine care, such as determining whether children are up to date with immunizations, measuring height and weight, gathering vital signs, offering age -appropriate counseling, and generally assessing a child's wellbeing. A basic measure of access to primary care practitioners (PCPs) is whether children ages 1 to 6 had a visit in the past year and children ages 7 to 19 had a visit in the past two years. Child and Adolescent Access to Primary Care Practitioners The median percentage of children with a visit to a PCP ranged from 88 percent to Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children and adolescents ages 12 months to 19 years who had a visit with a PCP. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.

These visits should include a health history, physical examination, immunizations, vision and hearing screening, developmental/behavioral assessment, an oral health risk assessment, as well as parenting education on a wide range of topics. In the Child Core Set, state performance is measured on the basis of the percentage of children receiving six or more visits by 15 months. Well-Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life A median of 60 percent of children received six or more well -child visits in the first 15 months of life (45 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children who turned 15 months old during the measurement year and had six or more well -child visits with a primary care practitioner (PCP) during their first 15 months of life. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.Percentage of Children Receiving 6 or More Well -Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life, FFY 2015 (n = 45 states) 19Well-Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

These visits should include a health history, physical examination, immunizations, vision and hearing screening, developmental/behavioral assessment, and an oral health assessment (at ages 3 and 6). In addition, these visits should include age -appropriate anticipatory guidance on a wide range of topics to engage parents in promoting their child's healthy development. Well-Child Visits in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Years of Life A median of 67 percent of children received at least one well -child visit in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years of life (47 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children ages 3 to 6 who had one or more well -child visits with a primary care practitioner (PCP) during the measurement year. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure-eligible population.Percentage of Children Receiving At Least One Well -Child Visit in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Years of Life, FFY 2015 (n = 47 states) 21Well-Child Visits in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Years of Life (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

A key indicator of the continuity of primary care is whether children are up to date on their immunizations. The childhood immunization measure includes 10 individual vaccine rates and 9 combination rates; the most common combination rate reported is \"Combination 3,\" includes VZV, and PCV.Childhood Immunization Status A median of 67 percent of children were up to date on recommended immunizations (Combination 3) by their second birthday (39 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children who turned 2 years old during the measurement year and had specific vaccines and combinations of vaccines by their second birthday. This measure is reported as 10 separate immunization rates and 9 combination rates. State performance is assessed on the basis of the Combination 3 rate. This chart excludes three states (TX, WI, and WY) that used Child Core Set specifications to calculate the measure but did not provide data for Combination 3. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.Percentage of Children Up to Date on Recommended Immunizations (Combination 3) by their Second Birthday, FFY 2015 (n = 39 states) 25Childhood Immunization Status (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

However, most people have no symptoms and are not aware they are infected. Left untreated, chlamydia can affect a woman's ability to have children. Recommended well care for young adult women who are sexually active includes annual screening for chlamydia. The Child Core Set reports chlamydia screening rates for women ages 16 to 20. Chlamydia Screening in Women A median of 48 percent of sexually active women ages 16 to 20 were tested for chlamydia (41 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of women ages 16 to 20 who were identified as sexually active and had at least one chlamydia test during the measurement year.

Despite improvements in access to coverage and care, the rate of births reported as preterm or low birth weight among women in Medicaid is higher than the rate for those who are privately insured. The health of a child is affected by a mother's health and the care she receives during pregnancy. When women access the health care system for maternity care, an opportunity is presented to promote services and behaviors to optimize their health and the health of their children. More information about CMS's efforts to improve maternal and infant health care quality is available at Set measures of maternal and perinatal health were available for analysis for FFY 2015. Timeliness of Prenatal Care Frequency of Ongoing Prenatal Care Live Births Weighing Less Than 2,500 Grams Central Line- Associated Blood Stream Infections in Neonatal Intensive Care UnitsMaternal and Perinatal Health 35Initiation of prenatal care during the first trimester of pregnancy facilitates a comprehensive assessment of a woman's health history, pregnancy risk, and health knowledge. Early screening and referrals for specialized care can prevent pregnancy complications resulting from pre- existing health conditions or promote access to recommended care. The measure indicates how often pregnant women received timely prenatal care (during the first trimester or within 42 days of Medicaid/CHIP enrollment). Timeliness of Prenatal Care A median of 82 percent of pregnant women had a prenatal care visit in the first trimester or within 42 days of Medicaid/CHIP enrollment (37 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of deliveries of live births between November 6 of the year prior to the measurement year and November 5 of the measurement year that received a prenatal care visit in the first trimester or within 42 days of Medicaid/CHIP enrollment. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.Percentage of Pregnant Women with a Prenatal Care Visit in the First Trimester or within 42 Days of Medicaid/CHIP Enrollment, FFY 2015 (n = 37 states) 36Timeliness of Prenatal Care (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

Infants weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth may experience serious and costly health problems and developmental delays. Pregnant women are at higher risk of a low -birthweight baby if they have chronic health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure or diabetes), low weight gain during pregnancy, high stress levels, or high- risk behaviors (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or using drugs). Live Births Weighing Less Than 2,500 Grams A median of 8.9 percent of live births financed by Medicaid or CHIP weighed less than 2,500 grams (25 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of live births that weighed less than 2,500 grams during the reporting period. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.Percentage of Live Births Weighing Less Than 2,500 Grams, FFY 2015 (n = 25 states) [Lower rates are better] 40Live Births Weighing Less Than 2,500 Grams (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Note: When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.Geographic Variation in the Percentage of Live Births Weighing Less Than 2,500 Grams, FFY 2015 (n = 25 states) [Lower rates are better] 41Central Line- Associated Blood Stream Infections ( CLABSIs ) are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in hospital neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs ). Premature infants in NICUs are particularly susceptible to infection because of their immature immune systems. This measure reports the rate of CLABSIs in NICUs . The CLABSI measure is obtained from data reported by hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Healthcare Safety Network. The Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) compares the number of infections reported in a facility or state to the baseline U.S. experience, adjusting for several risk factors. This measure includes all neonatal CLABSI incidents in NICUs , not just those for infants covered by Medicaid/CHIP. The statistic reported indicates whether the rate of infections increased, decreased, or did not change significantly relative to the baseline U.S. experience (calculated using data for 2006- 2008). Among the 41 states with CLABSI rates for 2014, the SIRs ranged from 0.187 to 0.849. An SIR less than 1 means that fewer infections occurred relative to what would have been predicted given the baseline data. An SIR greater than 1 means that more infections occurred relative to what would have been predicted given the baseline data. An SIR equal to 1 means that the number of infections is no different than the baseline period. For further information on the methods used to assess state performance, see http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/progress -report/hai -progress -report.pdf . Pediatric Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections 34 states had a significant decrease in infections since the baseline period (41 states) 42Pediatric Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections (continued) Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014 National and State Healthcare-Associated Infections Standardized Infection Ratio Report, Table 3d, available at http://www.cdc.gov/hai/excel/hai-progress -report/HAI-Progress-Tables.xlsx . Note: This figure indicates whether the rate of infections increased, decreased, or did not change significantly (based on a 95 percent confidence interval) for each state relative to the baseline U.S. experience (calculated using data for 2006-2008). No states had a significant increase since the baseline period.Geographic Variation in State Performance on Central Line- Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSIs) in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), 2014 (n = 41 states) 43The extent to which children receive safe, timely, and effective care for acute and chronic conditions is a key indicator of the quality of care provided in Medicaid and CHIP. Visits for routine screening and monitoring play an important role in managing the health care needs of people with acute and chronic conditions, potentially avoiding or slowing disease progression, and reducing costly avoidable hospital admissions and emergency department visits. Children covered by Medicaid have higher rates of physical, developmental, and intellectual health problems than privately insured children. Ensuring that children receive timely, quality care may reduce the need for more costly care later and improve their chances of leading healthy, productive lives. Two Child Core Set measures of care of acute and chronic conditions were available for analysis for FFY 2015. Ambulatory Care: Emergency Department Visits Medication Management for People with AsthmaCare of Acute and Chronic Conditions 44Unnecessary visits to a hospital emergency department (ED) may indicate lack of access to more appropriate sources of medical care, such as primary care providers or specialists. Excessive visits to the ED can result in overcrowding and increased ED wait time. Understanding the rate of ED visits among children covered by Medicaid and CHIP can help states identify strategies to improve access to and utilization of appropriate sources of care. Ambulatory Care: Emergency Department Visits Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the rate of ED visits per 1,000 enrollee months among children up to age 19. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used.Number of Emergency Department Visits per 1,000 Enrollee Months Among Children Up to Age 19, FFY 2015 (n = 39 states) [Lower rates are better]Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries up to age 19 had a median of 44 emergency department visits per 1,000 enrollee months (39 states) 45Ambulatory Care: Emergency Department Visits (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

Children with persistent asthma who regularly take their prescribed controller medications experience fewer asthma episodes, resulting in less frequent trips to the emergency department and decreased costs associated with care. This measure is an indicator of consistent use of asthma controller medications among children with moderate to severe asthma. Medication Management for People with Asthma A median of 24 percent of children ages 5 to 20 remained on asthma controller medication for at least 75 percent of their treatment period (33 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

For the purpose of the Child Core Set, the term \"behavioral health care\" refers to treatment of mental health conditions and other behavioral conditions, such as attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Improvement of benefit design and service delivery for behavioral health care in Medicaid and CHIP is a high priority for CMS, in collaboration with other federal agencies, states, providers, and consumers. Two Child Core Set measures of behavioral health care were available for analysis for FFY 2015. Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness Follow -Up Within 7 Days of Discharge Follow -Up Within 30 Days of Discharge Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Medication Initiation Phase Continuation and Maintenance PhaseBehavioral Health Care 49Follow -up care after hospitalization for mental illness helps improve health outcomes and prevent readmissions in the days following discharge from inpatient mental health treatment. Recommended post -discharge treatment includes a visit with an outpatient mental health provider within 30 days of discharge and ideally, within 7 days of discharge. Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness A median of 46 percent of children ages 6 to 20 who were hospitalized for mental illness had a follow -up visit within 7 days of discharge and Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of discharges for children ages 6 to 20 hospitalized for treatment of selected mental illness diagnoses who had an outpatient visit within 7 days of discharge and within 30 days of discharge. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used. Data displayed in this chart include children ages 6 to 20 for 24 states, and age 6 and older for 10 states.Percentage of Children Ages 6 to 20 Hospitalized for Treatment of Mental Illness Receiving a Follow -Up Visit Within 7 and 30 Days of Discharge, FFY 2015 72 percent had a follow -up visit within 30 days of discharge (33 34 states) 50Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness Within 7 Days of Discharge Source: Mathematica analysis of MACPro reports for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.

Follow -up care for children prescribed ADHD medication is an indicator of the continuity of care for children with a chronic behavioral health condition. Among those newly prescribed an ADHD medication, clinical guidelines recommend a follow -up visit within the first 30 days (the Initiation Phase) for medication management. Among those remaining on ADHD medication, two additional visits are recommended during the 9- month Continuation and Maintenance (C&M) Phase for ongoing medication management and assessment of the child's functioning.

Children's oral health is important to their overall health, both in childhood and later in adulthood. Improving children's access to oral health care in Medicaid and CHIP continues to be a focus of federal and state efforts. Two measures of dental and oral health services were available for analysis for FFY 2015. Preventive Dental Services Dental Sealants for 6- 9 Year Old Children at Elevated Caries RiskDental and Oral Health Services 56Tooth decay, or dental caries, is one of the most common chronic diseases of children, and is almost entirely preventable through a combination of good oral health habits at home, a healthy diet, and early and regular use of preventive dental services. This measure assess the percentage of children ages 1 to 20 that received preventive dental services.Preventive Dental Services A median of 47 percent of children ages 1 to 20 received a preventive dental service (51 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of Form CMS -416 reports (annual EPSDT report), Lines 1b and 12b, for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle. Note: This measure identifies the percentage of children ages 1 to 20 who are covered by Medicaid or CHIP Medicaid Expansion programs for at least 90 continuous days, are eligible for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services, and who received at least one preventive dental service during the reporting period.Percentage of Eligibles Who Received Preventive Dental Services, FFY 2015 (n = 51 states) 57Preventive Dental Services (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of Form CMS -416 reports (annual EPSDT report), Lines 1b and 12b, for the FFY 2015 reporting cycle.Geographic Variation in the Percentage of Eligibles Who Received Preventive Dental Services, FFY 2015 (n = 51 states) 58Clinical evidence suggests that sealants should be placed on children's primary and permanent teeth when it is determined that a child is at risk of experiencing caries. This measure assesses the percentage of children at elevated risk for dental caries that received a sealant on a first permanent molar.

Trends are presented for measures reported by at least 20 states in all three years and that met internal standards of quality . Many factors may affect changes in the performance rates reported by states on the Child Core Set measures. While shifts in access and quality may account for some of the changes in performance over time, other factors noted by states include changes in: The method and data used to calculate the measures The populations included in the measures (such as managed care versus fee-for-service) Other aspects of their Medicaid program that could affect reporting (such as transitions in data systems or delivery systems ).Trends in State Performance, FFY 2013- 2015: Introduction 62Trends in State Performance, FFY 2013- 2015: Primary Care Access and Preventive Care Sources: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2013- 2014 CARTS reports and FFY 2015 MACPro reports.

When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rate for the larger measure-eligible population was used. BMI = Body Mass Index; HPV= Human Papillomavirus. Rates of recommended preventive care for adolescents increased slightly over the three- year period for Adolescent Well-Care Visits, Immunization Status for Adolescents, and HPV Vaccine for Female Adolescents. The increase in the median rate for BMI Assessment for Children and Adolescents may be due in part to the use of medical chart review to more accurately capture the information for this measure. 64Trends in State Performance, FFY 2013- 2015: Maternal and Perinatal Health Sources: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2013- 2014 CARTS reports and FFY 2015 MACPro reports.

The Central Line- Associated Blood Stream Infections ( CLABSI) and the CAHPS Health Plan Survey measures were excluded from this table because the measures use a summary statistic different from those in this table. a Combination 3 includes four doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP); three doses of polio (IPV); one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); two doses of H influenza type B (HiB); three doses of hepatitis B ( Hep B), one dose of chicken pox ( VZV); and four doses of pneumococcal conjugate ( PCV). b Combination 1 includes one dose of meningococcal vaccine and one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) or one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) vaccine.Measure Measure DescriptionNumber of States Reporting Using Core Set Specifications Mean Median25th Percentile75th Percentile Care of Acute and Chronic Conditions (continued) Medication Management for People with Asthma: 12- 18 YearsPercentage Dispensed Appropriate Medication And Remained on Medication for at Least 75 Percent of Treatment Period32 28.6 24.1 21.3 34.0 Medication Management for People with Asthma: 19- 20 YearsPercentage Dispensed Appropriate Medication And Remained on Medication for at Least 75 Percent of Treatment Period16 29.5 27.9 22.6 36.2 Medication Management for People with Asthma: TotalPercentage Dispensed Appropriate Medication And Remained on Medication for at Least 75 Percent of Treatment Period33 29.6 24.3 22.1 34.0 Behavioral Health Care Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness: 6- 20 YearsPercentage of Discharges with a Follow -Up Visit within 7 Days33 49.1 45.7 32.7 67.0 Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness: 6- 20 YearsPercentage of Discharges with a Follow -Up Visit within 30 Days34 68.1 71.8 58.7 78.8 Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication: 6- 12 YearsPercentage with 1 Follow -Up Visit During the Initiation Phase37 44.9 48.0 35.5 53.6 Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication: 6- 12 YearsPercentage with At Least 2 Follow -Up Visits During the Continuation and Maintenance Phase37 53.3 59.0 44.4 64.2 Dental and Oral Health Services Preventive Dental Services: 1- 20 Years Percentage with At Least One Preventive Dental Service 51 45.9 47.4 40.1 50.0 Dental Sealants for 6- 9 Year Old Children at Elevated Caries RiskPercentage Who Received a Sealant on a First Permanent Molar25 22.2 23.4 18.1 25.4 73Changes in Performance Rates on Frequently Reported Child Core Set Measures, FFY 2013- 2015 MeasureNumber of States Reporting Using Core Set Specifications FFY 2013- 2015FFY 2013 (Median)FFY 2014 (Median)FFY 2015 (Median) Primary Care Access and Preventive Care. . . .

Notes: The term \"states\" includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This table includes measures that were reported by 20 or more states using Child Core Set specifications for all three years (FFY 2013- 2015). Means are calculated as the unweighted average of all state rates. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the mean and median rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure-eligible population. The results for each measure reflect only the states that reported on the measure for all three years. Data from previous years may be updated based on new information received after publication of the 2015 Report.Measure-specific tables are available at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality -of-care/performance-measurement/child -core -set/index.html .MeasureNumber of States Reporting Using Specifications FFY 2013- 2015FFY 2013 (Median)FFY 2014 (Median)FFY 2015 (Median) Behavioral Health Care (continued) . . . .
