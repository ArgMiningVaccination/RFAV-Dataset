ICH S5(R3) 4Outline Background Guideline Objectives Scope of the Guideline Introduction& ProposedGeneral Principles Content of the Guideline Annex Summary of Proposed Guidance Revision ICH S5(R3) 10/6/2017 3 5Background Experience with standard and novel testing paradigms as well as scientific, technological and regulatory knowledge has significantly evolved since the S5 guidance was first adopted over 20 years ago, which offers numerous opportunities to: enhance human risk assessment reduce animal use when executing developmental and reproductive toxicity testing ICH S5(R3) 6Guideline Objectives Re-focusing the guidance on human risk assessment strategies, while acknowledging the value of the study d esign recommendations in ICH S5(R2) Aligning with recommendations in the ICH M3(R2), S6(R 1), and S9 guidancesand expansion on the principles The revised ICH S5 Guideline is intended to provide h uman safety assurance at least equivalent to that provided by current testing paradigms. ICH S5(R3) 10/6/2017 4 7ICH S5(R3) Pharmaceuticals, including biotechnology-derived products Vaccines (and their novel constitutive ingredients) for i nfectious diseases Novel excipients Does not apply to cellular therapies, gene therapies an d tissue- engineered products. Whether and when non-clinical studies are warranted is determined by ICH M3(R2), ICH S6(R1), and ICH S9. Scope of the Guideline 8Introduction & Proposed General Principles Identify hazard and characterize reproductive risk for hum ans Flexibility in testing strategy is proposed, including p otential use of alternative assays (in-vitro , ex-vivo assay(s) intended to evaluate a developmental endpoint) Proposed considerations for an overall integrated testin g strategy (ITS): the target population (reproductive potential and seve rity of disease) the formulation and route(s) of administration the use of any existing data on toxicity, PD, PK, and similarity to other compounds in structure or activity selection of specific studies, test species/test system and dose l evels ICH S5(R3)10/6/2017 5 9Proposed Strategies for Reproductive Toxicity Assessment Evaluate the needfor reproductive toxicity testing. Proposedconsiderations: a) the target patient population and duration of do sing, b) the known pharmacology of the compound, c) the known toxicity of the compound, d) any existing knowledge of the impact of the target( s) on reproductive risk, e) data from alternative assays that could be relied up on to identify hazard and/or risk ICH S5(R3) Content 10 Proposed Strategies for Reproductive Toxicity Assessment Strategy to address Fertilityand Early Embryonic Development: ToexaminestagesA in dogs, n on- human primates(NHPs) Outlines thevalue ofrepeat dose toxicity studies oforhistopathological importancetoevaluate reversibility ofeffectsforri sk assessment ICH S5(R3) Content 10/6/2017 6 11 Proposed Strategies for Reproductive Toxicity Assessment Strategies to address Embryo-Fetal Development (EFD) oRoutine Approach (stages C to D) Expands on thenumberofspecies tobetestedforon- andoff- target effects, depending on PD ofpharmaceuticalsuch as small surrogatesandtransg enic models, also in placeofNHPs.

Evaluation of Data \u0001Outlines Data Handling, Data Presentation and Statisti cs forin vivo Studies ICH S5(R3) Content 10/6/2017 12 23 Proposed Principles of Risk Assessment Factors to estimate the likelihood of increased reproducti ve or developmental risk for humans to determine the level o f concern: oanimal-human exposure ratio, level of maternal toxi city, dose-response relationship, type of observed effect(s), cross-spe or similarity of pharm / tox mechanisms . Comparison of exposure at the NOAEL is a critical determ ination oProposal for decreasing concern over an exposure ra nge of 10 to 25 x (animal NOAEL to human MRHD) ICH S5(R3) Content 24 Proposed Principles of Risk Assessment Risk Assessment for Reproductive andDevelopmental Toxicities In this guideline, the term teratogenicity is in refer ence to malformations. In general, teratogenicity and embryo-fetal lethalit y (TEFL) are the critical endpoints in assessing developmental toxicity Reversible or minor manifestations (eg, changes in fetal weight, skeletal variations) by themselves are of lesser concern, al though their presence can influence the risk perspective. ICH S5(R3) Content 10/6/2017 13 25 Proposed Qualification of Alternative Test Systems for Regulatory Acceptance Provides a framework to facilitate the qualification of alternative assays. Assays qualified based on performance (reliability and predictivity) with known developmental toxicants Some compounds have been identified for inclusion on the ICH Reference Compound List (see next slide) Selection factors for the ICH Reference Compound List Performance Factors ICH S5(R3) Annex 26 Proposed Qualification of Alternative Test Systems for Regulatory Acceptance ctd.
