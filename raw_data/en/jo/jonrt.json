Employers will find resources and recommendations for protecting employees, clients, and customers. Workers will find resources for staying safe in the workplace, information about financial assistance (including options for health insurance and no- and low-cost health care). Four steps to stay safe Effective August 11, 2022, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has released new guidance emphasizing a four-step plan for individuals to protect themselves from COVID-19. These also apply to the workplace. They are: 1. Know your risk. People of older age, those with disabilities, or anyone with a weakened immune system, or people with other underlying medical conditions (including pregnancy) are at higher risk for severe infection. During times of medium and high COVID-19 Community Levels, people with high risk and their close contacts should consider wearing a well-fitted filtering mask, such as an n-95, or respirator. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), workers with disabilities may be legally entitled to reasonable accommodations that protect them from the risk of contracting COVID-19 if, for example, they cannot be protected through vaccination, cannot be vaccinated, or cannot use face coverings. Employers should consider taking steps to protect these at-risk workers as they would unvaccinated workers, regardless of their vaccination status. 2. Protect yourself. The best way to protect people from severe COVID-19 infection is to make sure they are fully vaccinated and have received their booster shots. Employers can encourage boosters and vaccinations by offering them at work, by giving time off for vaccinations, or by making policies that require vaccination. Many employee vaccination requirements have been very [effective at raising vaccination rates.](https://www.healthaction.org/updates/10-14-21-digest-requirements) See the [Wisconsin Vaccine Guidance for All Businesses](https://wedc.org/vaccine-guidelines/) from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) for more ideas on promoting vaccination in the workplace. 3. Take action if exposed. People who have been exposed to COVID-19 should wear a high quality (n-95 or similar) mask for five days, and then take a screening test to make sure they aren't infected. 4. Take action if you're sick or test positive. Support your workers by giving them paid time off when they are sick. Offer them a COVID-19 screening test, or encourage them to test on their own. [Individuals can order free COVID-19 tests.](https://SayYesCovidHomeTest.org) People who are infected with COVID-19 need to isolate for a minimum of five days. Companies that took steps during the pandemic to implement Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) rules should not be discouraged by these changes. Your organization is more resilient as a result of policies like paid time off for vaccination, vaccination requirements and masking or testing of unvaccinated employees. Although these steps should be taken by every individual, employers can still take steps to protect the health of their workforce and business by: - Keeping people in your workplace up-to-date on your local COVID-19 Community Level. [You can find the level for your county on the DHS COVID Data webpage.](/covid-19/data.htm) - Making your own masking and hand-washing policies that protect employees, customers, or clients. - Encouraging workers to prioritize their health by staying home when sick.

Please note that WI DHS will not play a role in the coordination of these events, and all details should be coordinated with the vaccination partner directly.

A quick [guide to COVID-19 prevention in the workplace, P-03297](/library/collection/p-03297) (PDF) from Wisconsin Occupational Health Surveillance. Frequently asked questions The four steps for limiting the spread of COVID-19 are: - Know your risk. - Protect yourself - Stay up-to-date on vaccines and boosters, and consider wearing a mask if your area's COVID-19 Community Level is High. - Take action if exposed. Wear a mask for five days, and take a COVID-19 test on day five. - Take action if you're sick or test positive. Isolate from others if you have symptoms, and take a COVID-19 test. People who test positive should isolate for at least five full days. Every business and organization should have a plan to prevent COVID-19 by protecting employees, educating customers, and keeping your building or environment safe and sanitary. Policies and programs - Analyze sick leave policies and consider modifying them to make sure ill workers are not in the workplace. Make sure employees are aware of and understand these policies. - Analyze and consider modifying any policies that penalize employees for taking sick leave. - Analyze additional flexibilities, which might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other. Ventilation The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people indoors, especially in poorly ventilated areas with limited air exchange. Effective ventilation systems can help reduce viral particle concentrations and reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading in your facility. In most cases, new building ventilation systems are not required. However, ventilation system upgrades or improvements can increase safety by reducing the potential for COVID-19 to spread through the air. Consult experienced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment. Here are some tips for ensuring your facility is properly ventilated. - Make sure air filters in your HVAC system are properly sized and within their recommended service life. - Open windows and doors, when weather conditions allow, and use fans to increase the effectiveness of open window. - Review DHS's [COVID-19 Ventilation Checklist, F-02771](/forms/f02771.pdf)(PDF) for additional considerations. - See CDC's webpage for [detailed guidance on building ventilation to prevent COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html). Cleaning and disinfecting According to the CDC, the virus that causes COVID-19 can land on surfaces. It is possible for people to become infected if they touch those surfaces and then touch their nose, mouth, or eyes. In most situations, the risk of infection from touching a surface is low. The most reliable way to prevent infection from surfaces is to regularly wash hands or use hand sanitizer. For more information, see the: Employees who test positive for COVID-19 or has symptoms of COVID-19 should: - Stay home and isolate from other people for at least five full days. Day 0 is the first day symptoms began or the day that the positive COVID-19 test was taken (if they do not have symptoms). If the employee has symptoms, they can end isolation after five full days if they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and their other symptoms have improved. They should continue to wear a well-fitting mask around others in their home and in public for an additional five days after their five-day period of isolation. See the CDC's [webpage on ending isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html) for more information.
