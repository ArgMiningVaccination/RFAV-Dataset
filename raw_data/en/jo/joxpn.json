Hospital from other hospitals in the area was its creation of a stroke teamcomprised of physicians, pharmacists,technicians, nurses and adminis-trators, who can be mobilized quicklyto provide rapid medical diagnosisand treatment of stroke patients in theemergency room. \"Rapid treatment ofstroke can save lives and preventdisability,\" said TarakadRamachandran, MD, stroke directorat University Hospital. \"The ability todeliver clot-busting drugs within thefirst three hours of the onset of strokesymptoms can mean the differencebetween life and death or seriousdisability.\" A dedicated stroke team brings all the players to the emergency room in amatter of minutes. The CT scannerlocated in the emergency room isquickly made available to provideappropriate scans for diagnosis, and apharmacist stands ready to mix thetissue plasminogen activator (tPA) todissolve the blood clot, if appropriate.\"Much needs to be accomplished in ashort period of time, and that is why astroke team is so important to the careand treatment of our patients,\" saidDr. Ramachandran. Dr. Ramachandran said that while tPA is an appropriate response formany stroke patients, especially thosesuffering ischemic strokes (caused by blood clots), surgery may be thecourse of treatment recommended forpatients with hemorrhagic stroke(caused by bleeding in the brain). It is expected that within an hour of a suspected stroke patient's arrivalto the emergency room, the initialphysician evaluation, stroke teamintervention, CT scan and interpre-tation, and recommended treatmentcan occur. Once admitted to University Hospital, stroke patients will receivecare either in a neuro-intensive careunit, a neuro-stepdown unit or regularpatient floor depending on the severityof the stroke. Patients also receiveextensive physical therapy andrehabilitative services throughUniversity Hospital's Department ofPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation. As requested by the state, University Hospital has notified areaemergency medical service (EMS)providers of its designation as a strokecenter, following through on thestate's Suspected Stroke Protocol thatrequires EMS providers to transportpatients to a state designated strokecenter if the patient can arrive withintwo hours of the onset of strokesymptoms.Stroke Center \u2014continued from page 1 4 MAY 17 THROUGH MAY 31, 2006 Visit Upstate Update on the web at: www.upstate.edu:80/hr/update/SUNY Upstate Medical University Awareness is the key Even with the advanced level of stroke care now available at UniversityHospital, physicians warn that theability to effectively treat stroke beginswith increasing public awarenessabout stroke symptoms. \"It is imperative that the general public begin to treat stroke as amedical emergency just as they do aheart attack or chest pain,\" saidNeurology Department Chair JeremyShefner, MD, PhD. \"At the first sign ofstroke, call 9-1-1 immediately.Symptoms can be reversed if theappropriate medical care is receivedquickly.\" Stroke symptoms can include: Sudden weakness Paralysis Numbness Dimness or loss of vision Unexplained dizziness Unsteadiness or sudden falls Loss of speech Sudden severe headache or loss of consciousnessTo mark May as National Organ Tissue Donor Awareness Month(NOTDAM), University Hospitalofficials and representatives fromvarious organ donation groups areurging members of the public toconsider organ donation. The issue isespecially timely since the wait for newkidney in Central New York nowstands at three and a half years, up from18 months in 2000. \"For someone in need of a new lease on life, this wait is interminable,\" saidDilip Kittur, MD, chief of TransplantServices at University Hospital. \"Thelonger people wait for a kidney, themore likely they will continue to suffersetbacks in their health.\" There are two types of donors: cadaveric and living donors. Cadavericdonors are deceased. \"We are so grateful for families who have had discussions about being organdonors in the event of a sudden death,\"Dr. Kittur said. \"Many, while mourningthe loss of a loved one, feel thatdonating a kidney or other organ is away for some goodness to come out oftragedy.\" But cadaveric kidney donation cannot meet the needs of all patients onthe wait list, which is why officials wantto raise awareness of the need for livingdonors. Dr. Kittur admits that making the decision to be a living donor is not aneasy one and should only be arrived atafter careful discussion with familymembers and physicians. In celebration of NOTDAM, University Hospital officials andrepresentatives from Finger LakesDonor Recovery Network, the Councilfor Donation of Organ and Tissues,planted two rose bushes in the gardenin front of University Hospital. The garden serves as a visual reminder of the need for organ donorsand honors those who have given life toothers through organ donation.
