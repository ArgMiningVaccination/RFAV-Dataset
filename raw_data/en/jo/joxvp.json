HISTORY OF MYRRH OIL USAGE Also known as Bol, Bola, Hirabol, Merra, and Gum, Myrrh is a natural, aromatic, sap-like resin or \"gum\" that is derived from the small, thorny Commiphora myrrha tree, which is related to the Frankincense tree. Native to Egypt, Myrrh is commonly used in Africa and the Middle East. The name Myrrh comes from the Arabic word \"murr,\" which means \"bitter,\" as its scent is sometimes bitter. Having been a prized, invaluable trade commodity along the ancient spice routes, Myrrh was so esteemed that legends were centered around it. One such Syrian and Greek legend about how the tree received its name tells of the Syrian king Thesis' daughter, whose name was Myrrha, being transformed by the protective gods into a Myrrh tree to escape her father's homicidal fury. It is believed that the tree's resin is actually Myrrha's tears. Historically, Myrrh's scent symbolized suffering, and it came to be associated with somber occasions such as funerals. During these and other solemn ceremonies - especially ones with religious distinctions - Myrrh resin was traditionally burned over hot coals, and the smoke produced a sweet, warm, and woody aroma that was often considered to have an enigmatic property that was conducive for spiritual practices. For this reason, Myrrh was often used in meditation and prayer, sometimes combined with Frankincense. Myrrh has also been blended with the lighter scents of citrus essential oils for more heartening effects that are known to inspire and boost emotional perception and understanding. For its numerous versatile uses, Myrrh has become one of the most extensively used essential oils around the world. For centuries, it has been used by many cultures in traditional medicine, religious observances, fumigation, culinary applications, funeral rites, purification rituals, and perfumery. Specifically, Myrrh and its essential oil was customarily used as part of the embalming process, as a spice to flavor food, as a fixative ingredient in the production of fragrances, as an anti-aging and skin-enhancing cosmetic product, as a remedy for hay fever, and as a disinfectant for wounds that also facilitated their healing and reduced bleeding. According to traditional Chinese medicine, Myrrh - or Mo Yao, as it is referred to in China - the first record of Myrrh's medicinal use in China dates back to A.D. 600 during the Tang Dynasty. It is considered to be a spicy and bitter essential oil with a temperature that is neutral as well as a particular effectiveness on the liver, spleen meridians, and heart. Myrrh is reputed to have stimulating action for blood circulation, thereby soothing pain and offering relief from the discomforts of blood stagnation, swelling, sores, carbuncles, bruises, dysmenorrhea and cramps, abdominal pain, post-partum pain and spotting, amenorrhea, arthritis, chest pain, and other circulatory problems. By facilitating the regeneration of skin, it is known to accelerate the healing of skin ulcers, sores, and lesions. Myrrh Oil is used for similar applications in Ayurveda, which attributes revitalizing and tonic properties to the resin. In 1540, when Myrrh Essential Oil was being distilled, Conrad Gesner and Valerius Cordius classified it as vulnerary and deemed it fit for external application, establishing ways in which the resin could be used to prepare ointments. Also based on the use of Myrrh were many French remedies that were meant to soothe burns, cuts, and wounds. The remedies were also used in fumigation and, for Myrrh's expectorant properties, they were used to address bronchitis and catarrhal discharge. In 1608, Dr. Philippe Guybert's 'Medecin Charitable' established Myrrh's ability to clean, dry, strengthen, warm, encourage the onset of menstruation, and eliminate coughs. In 1699, Nicolas Lemery's 'Traite des Drogues Simples' established Myrrh's emmenagogue property and its advantages for quickening labor and birth. In 1765, Cartheuser's 'Matiere Medicale' confirmed the same while adding Myrrh's ability to address skin disorders, suggesting that is anti-septic properties were able to strengthen the gums by eliminating harmful bacteria from rotten teeth. In the 'Officine de Dorvault' of 1928 - a list of drugs that were legitimately distributed over a particular course of time - Myrrh was documented as having been used by hospitals to treat bed sores. For its anti-inflammatory and anti-septic properties, Myrrh Oil became an integral part of combat gear for Greek soldiers, who took vials of it to clean and disinfect their wounds as well as to stem the flow of blood. For its ability to elevate and enhance the experience of enlightenment, the Hebrews mixed Myrrh into their wine and drank the mixture before taking part in religious rituals. Criminals were given the same concoction to ease their mental and physical anguish before they were executed. According to historical sources, Queen Hatshepsut wanted to earn the pleasure of the god Amon by surrounding his temple with existing Myrrh trees. To fulfill her mission, the Queen sent an expedition to a region known to grow Myrrh trees in abundance. According to legend, after a successful quest, the pleased god promised the Queen \"life, stability and satisfaction forever.\" The story of the voyage was later portrayed on the temple walls that enclosed her tomb, and the Egyptian people were introduced to the Myrrh tree. As the tree came to be revered, the wealthy began wearing small pouches of Myrrh pellets around their necks for its enticing perfume. Myrrh came to be used in embalming compounds, and its pellets were commonly burned to function as a flea repellant. Myrrh Essential Oil and Resinoid remain relevant today for many of the abovementioned uses and especially for cosmetic applications, due to their cleansing, brightening, soothing, and rejuvenating properties.

As illustrated, Myrrh Essential Oil is reputed to have many therapeutic properties. The following highlights its many benefits and the kinds of activity it is believed to show: - COSMETIC: Anti-microbial, Pulmonary Tonic. CULTIVATING AND HARVESTING QUALITY MYRRH OIL The thorny, stunted Myrrh tree - or spiky Myrrh shrub - is also known as the Gum Tree, the Guggal Gum Tree, the Guggal Resin Tree, the Didin Tree, and the Didthin tree. Growing in the world's desert regions, the harsh winds and weather conditions of the tree's environment may sometimes be responsible for causing its thick, light grey trunk to grow in its distinctly twisted, knotted shape. Native to the eastern Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and North India, it requires dry, sunny, hot climates in order to thrive and may grow to a height of approximately 12 feet. The tree produces few leaves on its jagged and angled branches. At the end of summer, it produces orange-red flowers and knots. From these knots, the tree produces a clear or pale-yellow sap - also called Myrrh Gum - that is released when the tree bark is cut or when the bushes have their shoots and stems cut. As the waxy sap \"bleeds\" it appears to be glossy like tears. When the drops of sap dry and coagulate on the tree trunk, they harden into walnut-size lumps and turn reddish-brown in color. Hardened sap is referred to as resin. It is hard, brittle and granular. Once harvested, the resin granules are either clear or opaque with a yellowish tint. With age, the color of the resin darkens and white streak-like markings usually begin to develop. The resin is then harvested to produce an essential oil or a resinoid. HOW IS MYRRH OIL EXTRACTED? Myrrh Essential Oil and Myrrh Resinoid are both produced when Myrrh resin undergoes Solvent Extraction; however, sometimes they undergo Steam Distillation instead. The resultant oil is thick and viscous in consistency, ranging in color from yellow to amber to dark brown. Its aroma is warm, dry, musty, woody, herbaceous, and smoky. Alternatively, the oil may have a strong balsamic scent that is pungent and bitter. Myrrh Oil is often used as a base note in perfumery, as it blends well with the fragrances of citrus, spicy, and floral oils. The scent profile of this essential oil has also been described as having nuances of vanilla, mushrooms, and licorice. Myrrh Resinoid has a thicker consistency and different scent profile than the essential oil, exuding strong but warm notes reminiscent of roasted cocoa and licorice. Myrrh can also be bought in the form of a powder and a tincture. For its anti-septic and analgesic qualities, Myrrh is a common ingredient in pharmacy products, which include: toothpastes, powders for toothaches, mouthwashes, and topical salves and liniments for bodily aches and sprains. MYRRH OIL USES The uses for Myrrh Essential Oil are abundant, ranging from medicinal and odorous to cosmetic. Its many forms include oils, gels, salves, lotions, soaps, shampoos, sprays, and candles. Used in aromatherapy applications, the scent of Myrrh Oil is reputed to reduce tension and negative moods, which in turn supports emotional and physical well-being. Adding a few drops of Myrrh Oil to an electric diffuser will support the respiratory system by soothing cough and cold symptoms. This method also supports overall immunity and digestion. Alternatively, Myrrh Oil can be diffused to elevate the spiritual ambience as well as inspiration while meditating.
