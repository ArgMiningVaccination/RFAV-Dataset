At Re:Qi Nature Getaway retreat, Jun shares 10 basic acupuncture points from head to toes, that support a good flow of qi in our bodies. Each organ in our bodies has a meridian like the train (MRT) lines and stations. These acupoints are the large and small train stations where we need to focus on regulating the flow. The pressing of these points is like being a traffic controller to move the qi in the meridians. These turn out to be handy self-care tips on maintaining our health. The recommendation of simply pressing each point for merely 30 seconds a few times each day, makes it even more doable. Jun also emphasizes that doing it with a relaxed state of mind, ideally in a quiet space, taking a deep breath and concentrating on the energy onto each point, will make a difference in how our bodies can receive the benefits as well. By pairing this with something you're already doing on a daily basis, for example doing it after brushing your teeth, or sitting down before you have your morning tea, will also help cultivate it into your life without feeling the stress that it's another exercise you have to do. Tapping on the quality of receptivity and inward sensing on the Day of Yin, the invitation here is to tune into and connect with the internal traffic of our physiology. What is an Acupuncture point? Acupuncture is an ancient healing practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are placed at specific points in the body. Acupoints lie on the organ's energy pathway called the \"Meridians\". Image the meridian as a train line and acupoints as train stations. Did you know that acupuncture is recognized by the World Health Organization? It is effective for over 100 conditions including: pain management, rhinitis, fertility, gut health and many more. Why press Acupuncture points? The goal is to clear obstacles and recharge the qi in the meridians Restore the flow of energy throughout the systems Usually you will feel energised or relaxed after the treatment How do Acupuncture points work? Analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects Directly initiate a process called purinergic signalling, which is used for signalling and regulation in all tissues and organ systems. Directly affect the central nervous system. These include spinal reflex effects, where acupuncture stimulates muscle relaxation and changes in visceral organs. Improve the regulation of the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal axis, the primary system that the body used for regulating hormones. Modulates parasympathetic activity, associated with rest, relaxation, digestion and tissue healing.
