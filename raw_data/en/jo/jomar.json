Cats may like to laze around, but they are also curious and love to explore and jump on furniture to see what's going on around them. But like humans, constant exposure to allergens such as pollen, dust, and environmental pollutants can quickly weaken your kitty's immune system. This may result in lower energy levels and increased susceptibility to diseases.
