Natural remedies for ADHD, like nutrition and supplements have been something [we have worked on](https://www.fuzzymama.com/our-adhd-story-part-one/) for years. I have tried many different things and can honestly say, that I have found the best proven natural remedies that help my kids' ADHD, tremendously. Be sure to keep reading for our updates one and two years later and how we were able to reduce my sons medication by half and then take him off completely, using only natural remedies for ADHD. Also, if you have a picky eater, scroll to the end for special supplement recommendations that taste yummy. ***This post contains affiliate links. See our full policy [HERE](https://www.fuzzymama.com/disclaimer/).*** 2 First Steps in My ADHD Parenting Journey: - The goal is for my boys to have healthy bodies, overall. I am pretty vigilant about sticking to [an adhd diet](https://www.fuzzymama.com/adhd-diet-for-kids-2/)for both my teenage boys with ADHD. We stay away from gluten completely. We limit processed sugar to a once or twice a week treat. I buy organic fruits and vegetables as much as [the budget allows](https://www.fuzzymama.com/adhd-diet-a-month-of-groceries/). We are low on grains and eat mostly grass fed meat. Dairy is also limited. Both boys drink water or unsweetened almond or coconut milk, pretty much exclusively. - I have read tons of [parenting books](https://www.fuzzymama.com/3-great-books-families-struggling-adhd/)to help our struggles, as well. I fully acknowledge that I can be part of the problem when it comes to my kids' behavior. I have learned so much about how my actions can directly affect my kiddo's ability to cope, remain calm - you name it! [These two steps alone](https://www.fuzzymama.com/adhd-diet-for-kids-2/) have made a big impact on both of my boys. And HEY, We are not perfect!! My teens do stray from their ADHD Diet at parties and friends' houses etc. But at home I serve food that helps them stick to [an ADHD Diet](https://www.fuzzymama.com/adhd-diet-for-kids-2/). [Related: The Night that changed my ADHD Parenting](https://www.fuzzymama.com/how-to-parent-adhd-child/) My son transitioned from meds to supplements That being said, even with excellent nutrition, my son took prescription medication to help him focus at school for about a year and a half. We gradually moved to 100% natural remedies to help my son's ADHD symptoms for many reasons, which are covered in our [ADHD STORY](https://www.fuzzymama.com/our-adhd-story-part-one/). But, whether your kiddo takes prescription medicine for ADHD or not, these natural remedies for focus and attention can be an important and a vital part of treating the whole child. Important Points About ADHD Natural Remedies - Every kid is different. Unfortunately, there is not one size fits all solution when it comes to finding natural remedies for ADHD. Finding what works may take a bit of trial and error, as it did with us. - If you can get professional help from an integrative doctor or wholistic nutritionist, it could save you lots of time. These professionals can run tests and figure out if there specific things that are going on with your child. It was not until my boys hit puberty, that I sought the help of a [wholistic nutritionist](https://www.fuzzymama.com/adhd-mama-stories-with-cris-brown-of-allboutbalance-com/). - Certain supplements, like magnesium can have the opposite effect on people with certain genetic compositions, like the mthfr gene. Stop taking any supplement, obviously, if your child has an adverse reaction. Genetic tests are fairly easy to get these days as well as [simple blood tests](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/a-genetic-test-you-dont-need/)run by a functional doctor. - Find a reputable source for your supplements. Your local drugstore is most likely, not the place to purchase supplements. I mention great brands in this article with reliable links, but also, check your local health food store or Whole Foods for reliable brands. I am not a physician or certified nutritionist - just an overly zealous mom who has tried so many things to naturally help my sons' ADHD symptoms. These supplements were what we landed on after trying many other things. These worked for us (and still do at 13 and 15!) I share them in the hopes that it may help you in your search to find the best natural supplements for your ADHD Kiddo. The BEST natural \"remedy\" is a weighted blanket Okay, I will get to the supplements in a second. But, first, I have to share that one of the best things to help my son's ADHD was - and still is, 7 years later - [a weighted blanket](https://www.sensacalm.com/?rfsn=2465004.3d4baf93f&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2465004.3d4baf93f). A lot of ADHD kids have trouble settling into sleep, and staying asleep. My oldest was one of them. From the very first night we [got a weighted blanket](https://www.sensacalm.com/?rfsn=2465004.3d4baf93f&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2465004.3d4baf93f), I knew it was gold. Under his weighted blanket, my son falls asleep in 10 minutes and does not get up at all during the night. You can read more about it [ here](https://www.fuzzymama.com/getting-kids-adhd-sleep/) and [check out the clearance section](https://www.sensacalm.com/pages/clearance-weighted-blankets?rfsn=2465004.3d4baf93f&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2465004.3d4baf93f) where we have now purchased two blankets - one for each of my kids. Okay, now on to the supplements we have found great success with. Remember, this is a description of what has worked for us and not a prescription for all kids with ADHD. Natural Remedies for Focus and Attention [Bluebonnet Animalz Multiple](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WP2MJ6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004WP2MJ6&linkId=3a4eec154b20ac628d45ebfa16e09ff6) When our standby, [ KidsCalm Multi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B003OF1WYG/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new), was discontinued, I went on a search for [ a replacement multivitamin.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WP2MJ6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004WP2MJ6&linkId=3a4eec154b20ac628d45ebfa16e09ff6) My standards are strict and sadly, it's hard to find a vitamin without added sugar or other icky things. You can follow my search [ on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/heyfuzzymama/) and read other's suggestions from lovely readers in the comments below, too. I landed on [Bluebonnet Animalz Multiple](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WP2MJ6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004WP2MJ6&linkId=3a4eec154b20ac628d45ebfa16e09ff6) and my kids take it without even a reminder - a plus of our low sugar diet - these taste yummy to them! These have a lot of B Vitamins and also Inositol(B8) - which has [been shown](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/inositol#mental-health) to help with brain function and the balance of serotonin and dopamine(two important mood chemicals ADHD kids seem to be deficient in). [Barlean's Fish Oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PRMACQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003PRMACQ&linkId=32dd0e3a99306a977581e215ecc90808) We have been hearing about the beneficial effects of fish oil for kids with ADHD for awhile now-especially boys, who's [ brains seem to be starving](http://deeprootsathome.com/could-boys-be-suffering-from-brain-starvation/). Some fish oil supplements taste icky or make you burp up a fishy taste- [Barleans ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PRMACQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003PRMACQ&linkId=32dd0e3a99306a977581e215ecc90808)does not. The flavors are yummy and both my boys take a healthy dose of this every morning. Some of the flavors have added sweeteners, like xylitol, which are made from corn. While we try to avoid corn in our diet, this small amount does not seem to effect my boys. Just a word of caution if you are avoiding corn completely for an allergy - check the label. This [ fish oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PRMACQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003PRMACQ&linkId=32dd0e3a99306a977581e215ecc90808), has also had an overall great effect on my boys' health, too. They are rarely sick and miss school one or two days a year for illness. [Now Foods Berrydophilous](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Supplements-BerryDophilus-Probiotic-Sweetened/dp/B0768BGQY2?crid=NT51CUYGFS50&keywords=now+foods+berry+dophilus+kids+2+billion+60+chewables&qid=1648573831&sprefix=now+foods+berry%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fuzzymama-20&linkId=8f9441a8b064e2faa7430eeba16b0bb3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Gut health is another topic that has gotten so much press lately. Our gut, it seems, is like our [second brain](http://www.mindful.org/meet-your-second-brain-the-gut/), with it's massive amount of neural tissue capable of affecting our mood and overall well-being. A [healthy gut is vital for overall health](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/gut-health/), the absorption of nutrients, protecting the body from foreign invaders, and the regulation of many hormones. Yogurt can help to introduce good bacteria into the gut, but watch out for high sugar content and other added icky ingredients. [These chewable tablets by NOW Foods](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Supplements-BerryDophilus-Probiotic-Sweetened/dp/B0768BGQY2?crid=NT51CUYGFS50&keywords=now+foods+berry+dophilus+kids+2+billion+60+chewables&qid=1648573831&sprefix=now+foods+berry%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fuzzymama-20&linkId=8f9441a8b064e2faa7430eeba16b0bb3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) , taken every day can help to get a good dose of healthy gut bacteria. These taste great, there is no complaining. Be careful what you purchase! Many probiotics, [tested by third parties](https://consumershealthreport.com/probiotic-supplements/bestprobiotics/), have zero beneficial strands left in them from sitting on the shelf. I love the [NOW Foods brand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LTHNAW2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01LTHNAW2&linkId=c21efe53b040a7fe31fe07f45692ecc9) because they made [Mamavations BEST](https://www.mamavation.com/health/childrens-supplements-probiotics-ranked.html) list.(Leah tests the heck out of everything on [ her website](https://www.mamavation.com/health/childrens-supplements-probiotics-ranked.html).) What I notice: My boys rarely get sick or have a need for antibiotics. Their day to day physical health is pretty amazing. Their overall wellness contributes greatly to all aspects of their life, including reducing the symptoms of ADHD. Like the fish oil, these have Xylitol - a sweetener derived from corn. I have not noticed any ill effects in my kids who normally stay away from corn in general, but some people steer clear of all corn sweeteners. It's hard to find a good chewable without it, sadly! As soon as my youngest can swallow big pills, we'll transition off chewables. [Simple Spectrum Nutritional Support](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Spectrum-Nutritional-Support-Supplement/dp/B08FXQJ2YR?crid=2I62RY8REC2U0&keywords=simple+spectrum+supplement&qid=1648689662&sprefix=simple+spe%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=fuzzymama-20&linkId=3f04c391f064a79e341e8ae7a629cbaa&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) This multi vitamin is brand new to us and I love it!!!! The company reached out to me and sent me the first jar cost free to see if I would try it. [The supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Spectrum-Nutritional-Support-Supplement/dp/B08FXQJ2YR?crid=2I62RY8REC2U0&keywords=simple+spectrum+supplement&qid=1648689662&sprefix=simple+spe%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=fuzzymama-20&linkId=3f04c391f064a79e341e8ae7a629cbaa&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is made for kids on the spectrum because of its super safe formula that is designed to support enhanced neurological function. While neither of my boys carry an ASD diagnosis, this supplement is so high quality and packed - I mean packed- with good stuff, I have now ordered two more jars on my own. It is [a powder ](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Spectrum-Nutritional-Support-Supplement/dp/B08FXQJ2YR?crid=2I62RY8REC2U0&keywords=simple+spectrum+supplement&qid=1648689662&sprefix=simple+spe%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=fuzzymama-20&linkId=3f04c391f064a79e341e8ae7a629cbaa&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)that mixes easily with applesauce, smoothies, etc so for my kiddo who still can't take pills, it's perfect!! Simple Spectrum helps help fill the vitamin and mineral gaps when you have a hard time getting your kiddo to eat all the right foods. Just read the testimonials [HERE](https://simplespectrumsupplement.com/pages/testimonials). [Just Thrive Probiotics](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) My oldest (15) is currently taking [Just Thrive Probiotics](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) - my kids are older and can mostly take capsules now. (Although, these can be opened up and mixed into just about anything - even baked into [our oatmeal casserole](https://www.fuzzymama.com/best-breakfasts-adhd/) and [cowboy cookies.](https://www.fuzzymama.com/best-breakfasts-adhd/)) I learned all [Just Thrive](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) brand on [The Wellness Mama podcast](https://wellnessmama.com/podcast/just-thrive/) and was sold on them very quickly. Turns out, a lot of the good bacteria in killed in the stomach by the digestive acids. Makes sense, right? So [Just Thrive's Probiotics](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) are spore based, which means they can survive in the stomach. In fact, the survivability rate of this product is INCREDIBLE. The probiotic strands have 1000x higher rate of survival than greek yogurt! Wow. My kids take one a day and often pair it with [ a prebiotic](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) from Just Thrive, too. [Just Thrive PREbiotic](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) We take this yummy [PREbiotic](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) also by [JustThrive](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) to give those little bacteria something they love to eat. Here's the thing about probiotics - they need [to be met in the gut](https://www.mayoclinic.org/prebiotics-probiotics-and-your-health/art-20390058) with good food to help them survive - or they won't last very long. You can naturally eat lots of prebiotics in fruits and veggies, but with two teens in the house, I don't always want to fight with them about food. [This product](https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=3838914.48ebfa) is a bit of an insurance policy for me. No use spending lots of money on probiotics if they starve to death once they hit the gut. [Jarrow MagMind Magnesium](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LEO4Y6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B007LEO4Y6&linkId=b9d51890c864da605d321b46db9e1125) I can not sing the praises enough for [MagMind by Jarrow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LEO4Y6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B007LEO4Y6&linkId=b9d51890c864da605d321b46db9e1125) for my oldest son with ADHD. (He used to take one of these in the morning to help keep him calm enough until his ADHD meds kick in for school. It takes about 20 minutes to see the effects, so I made sure he got one on rising.) Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in our body, needed for over 300 metabolic reactions. Now, as a teen, I now give him two [MagMind capsules](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LEO4Y6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B007LEO4Y6&linkId=b9d51890c864da605d321b46db9e1125) about 30 minutes before bedtime. I see a noticeable difference in his ability to settle and fall asleep much faster. The MagMind, combined with our [weighted blanket](https://www.fuzzymama.com/using-weighted-blanket-adhd/) makes our evenings so much easier - and he rises in a much better place! I take [MagMind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LEO4Y6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fuzzymama-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B007LEO4Y6&linkId=b9d51890c864da605d321b46db9e1125) myself, before bed, and it has an incredible effect on my ability to have a really good night's sleep. Seems that most of the population is [suffering from a deficiency ](https://wellnessmama.com/54128/signs-of-magnesium-deficiency/)of this very important mineral. This one is great for the whole family. [Magnesium L-Threonate](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-types#7.-Magnesium-L-threonate) is shown to be the form of magnesium that crosses the blood brain barrier the easiest, making it super effective for brain function. Related: [The Best Weighted Blanket for ADHD](https://www.fuzzymama.com/using-weighted-blanket-adhd/) ADHD vitamins for Picky eaters (This is an update as of September 2022) My oldest started refusing to take his vitamins last summer and to make a long story short, in therapy, we uncovered that he hates how the vitamins taste. (He took them for a few years without saying anything, but, you know, our kids do love to keep us on our toes!) So, I searched for a yummy multi to pair with the Barlean's Fish Oil (the only thing he continued to take this summer because it tastes SO GOOD). I opted for [Garden of Life's MyKind Organics ](https://amzn.to/3B1I4wH) by Alicia Silverstone. They are pretty clean and super delicious.(They do have organic cane sugar in them.) There have been no arguments about vitamins since [we started them](https://amzn.to/3B1I4wH), so I'd say it's a WIN. has [Kids' Gummies](https://amzn.to/3Azwybu), too.

A Sneaky Boost of Nutrition and Protein! My kids are getting pickier the older they get, especially in the protein department.

Natural remedies have noticeable results, but not a miracle These supplements are meant to be used as part of an overall nutrition plan and they are not miracle pills. Both of my sons still have [struggles with their emotions](https://www.fuzzymama.com/how-to-parent-adhd-child/) from time to time. BUT, I have seen a huge difference with these supplements. The calm times far outweigh the crazy ones. These supplements can be a great compliment to ADHD meds, too. I am not a doctor, but I am a mother who has learned from experience and a lot of trial and error. Every ADHD kid is different in what works for them, but these supplements stand to benefit ANY kid. Their quality is outstanding. Other Ways to Parent ADHD Naturally This ADHD parenting journey can be really difficult and I often find myself standing in front of one of my kids not knowing how to react to something they have just done or said.
