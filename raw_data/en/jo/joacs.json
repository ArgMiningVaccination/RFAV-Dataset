That includes offering all the vaccinations your little companion needs to stay healthy and happy by your side. As a major part of preventative care, vaccines are one of the most important parts of pet ownership. My mobile veterinary clinic makes getting your canine and feline friends vaccinated that much easier. Core and Non-Core Vaccines Core vaccines are those that are considered vital to the well-being of all pets, regardless of their lifestyle. These include protections against life-threatening illnesses and diseases that can be passed on to humans. For dogs, core vaccines are those for canine parvovirus, distemper, canine hepatitis and rabies. Common non-core vaccines for pups are often dependent on their exposure risk, and protect against Bordetella and leptospirosis, among others. For cats, core vaccines are those that protect against panleukopenia (also known as feline distemper), calicivirus, herpesvirus type I (also called rhinotracheitis) and rabies. Like dogs, cats can get non-core vaccinations for feline leukemia virus, depending on their environment. My goal is to be a partner in your pet's care When I arrive for an appointment, I'll ask questions about your pet's day to day habits and for information on their overall health. Together, we'll determine the best vaccination schedule to help keep your pet healthy, including booster shots and regular revaccinations. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask at any time. For any owners who are unsure of their pet's vaccination status, I also offer vaccine titers to check your pet's current protection level. This helps prevent the administration of unnecessary vaccines. "}
