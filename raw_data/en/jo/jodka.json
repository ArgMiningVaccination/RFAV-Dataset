Undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) participate in a wide range of experiential learning both inside and outside the classroom. Our data indicate that many of our majors participate in at least one study abroad, undergraduate research, internship and/or other experiential learning activity. The actual numbers are likely higher, particularly for undergraduate research, as many students and faculty do not report their involvement through the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR). Over the past two years, CAS has worked with OUR, the Office of the Registrar, and Beyond the Classroom Matters (BTCM) to develop online forms that will allow us to better capture these data in future years. For a description of the various experiential opportunities offered in individual CAS departments and programs, please see the Appendix. The college strongly encourages undergraduate students to study abroad, which research has shown to positively correlate with student engagement and completion. We provide robust support for students studying abroad, including conscientious advising designed to ensure that courses taken transfer back into the UofSC curriculum, minimizing any potential delays in graduation. From 2016 - 2019, an average of 5-6% (approximately 450-475 students) of CAS majors engaged in study abroad each year. In 2020, participation rates fell substantially due to travel restrictions associated with the COVID pandemic: In Spring 2020, 205 students studied abroad; In Summer and Fall 2020 combined, only 3 students participated, all in virtual programs, and 145 students' planned study abroad experiences were cancelled. This past year, the numbers began to rise again but were still lower than in pre-pandemic years, with 14 students participating in spring 2021, 26 in summer 2021, 36 in fall 2021 and 119 in spring 2022. Once the pandemic has fully subsided, we expect participation rates to increase significantly. To this end, the Office of Undergraduate Studies has designated a staff member to serve as Study Abroad Liaison, who will work closely with the Education Abroad office to promote Study Abroad offerings to CAS students and to ensure accurate advising and rapid credit transfer upon their return to the university. It should be noted that the expense of Study Abroad trips is a major impediment for many CAS students, limiting participation. The college has therefore been actively seeking external funds to support students studying abroad and encouraging students to apply for funds available through the Education Abroad and CIEL offices. Undergraduate research is common among natural sciences and mathematics majors and approximately 65% of students in these majors participate in undergraduate research activities during their degree program\u2014including for-credit, paid, and volunteer experiences. Many arts and humanities disciplines are also experiential by nature; however, many of these activities are difficult to capture in data collection. Undergraduate majors in fine arts, music, dance and theater are typically active in multiple performances, plays, or exhibitions as these students work towards graduation. To support undergraduate research projects for students in all majors, CAS offers a competitive undergraduate research grant for all students enrolled in Independent Study. Faculty may apply for up to $1000 to support lab supplies needed for undergraduate research. All students who fail to receive Magellan Research funding have their applications forwarded to CAS to facilitate the application process. University of South Carolina Page 43 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Initiatives Some of the most innovative experiential learning opportunities offered in CAS are interdisciplinary. For example, in fall 2021 CAS hosted our second annual Theme Semester, on \"Climates\" in fall 2021. The purpose of Theme Semester is to encourage students to pursue connections between classroom learning and beyond-the-classroom experiences. Like our successful inaugural semester on \"Justice\" held in fall 2020, the \"Climates\" semester offered encompassed a variety of opportunities for students to engage with the topic, including 34 courses, a keynote lecture, film series, exhibits, talks, and service projects. The college provided small grants to support curricular and co-curricular activities associated with the theme and supported two undergraduate internships to incorporate student involvement in the initiative. Selected student projects produced during the semester were published in an online gallery on the college website. Participation in Theme Semester events was robust despite the pandemic, and we expect it to increase next year, when the theme will be \"Play.\" As another example, in spring 2022, our Baruch Institute collaborated with the SC Honors College to offer the inaugural \"Semester at the Coast\" program. Six students and five faculty members and independent researchers are spending the spring semester at the Institute, located at the North Inlet Estuary in the South Carolina Lowcountry, where they are completing experiential academic coursework, independent research, and local service projects. We are committed to continuing to offer these kinds of unique opportunities to our students, and we expect our new annual McCausland Innovation Fund grants program, introduced in spring 2022, will enable the creation of exciting new experiential programs. Many CAS students participate in career preparation and internships, activities that are closely linked to academic engagement and successful employment upon graduation. The Office of Undergraduate Studies is working hard to strengthen the support we offer to students in these areas. In fall 2021, we partnered with the Career Center to launch the CAS Career Center Studio in Flinn Hall. Four afternoons each week, professional career coaches offer individual consultations, webinars and workshops to assist CAS students with resume development, finding internships, interviewing skills, and many other career readiness topics. The Studio has also sponsored several virtual talks by guest speakers, including Cliff Hudson, former CEO of Sonic Corporation and author of a book how his liberal arts background contributed to his corporate successes. Our new CAS Ambassadors Program will provide 20 selected students with hands-on experience representing the college at community events, as well as regular workshops on career readiness skills including networking, public speaking, and professional etiquette. The college has also worked with various outside entities to establish and promote internship opportunities for our students. In summer and fall 2021, we partnered with the South Carolina Afterschool Alliance to offer internships to CAS students to work with academically at-risk K-12 students in academic enrichment programs as part of a statewide initiative endorsed by the Governor's office. We also regularly offer two courses, COLA 390 and COLA 391, that allow students participating in internships external to the university to receive credit; a total of 12 students completed COLA 390-391 internships in 2021. The college also encourages students to participate in the university's nationally recognized Graduation with Leadership Distinction program. In academic year 2019-2020, 124 CAS majors (approximately 6.9% of the graduating class of 1786) received this distinction, approximately the same number as the prior year. In 2020-2021, the number of students earning GLD fell slightly to 107, likely due to the curtailment of many beyond-the-classroom experiences during the pandemic. We are working to increase these numbers and over the past year have partnered with CIEL to promote faculty and student awareness of the program. College faculty are actively involved in leadership roles at CIEL, including Executive Director University of South Carolina Page 44 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Initiatives Lara Ducate (Professor of German, Department of Literatures, Languages and Cultures) and six of the ten GLD Faculty Fellows, which we anticipate will bolster student participation over time. This year, we also worked with the Office of the Registrar and CIEL to list all GLD- approved courses in the Academic Bulletin entries for each of our majors, to make information about the program more readily accessible to students and advisors. In addition, we have worked with CAS units to have course offerings that include a significant experiential component formally approved as Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELOs), so that they will appear on students' official My UofSC Experience transcript. We now have 24 official ELO courses\u2014more than any other college. Finally, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies Christy Friend and Associate Dean of Instruction and Community Engagement Claudia Benitez Nelson were actively involved in developing the university's new Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), launched in fall 2021, which focuses on strengthening resources and support for experiential learning in CAS and across the university. Benitez- Nelson served on the steering committee, and Friend co-chaired the subcommittee that drafted recommendations for professional development associated with the QEP. To increase CAS students' awareness of and access to experiential learning opportunities, the college continued to strengthen its advising and student support services in 2021. A multipurpose meeting room in the Office of Undergraduate Studies at Flinn Hall was renovated in 2019 to provide space for workshops, help sessions, meetings and presentations related to beyond-the-classroom opportunities. Although in-person events were curtailed in 2021 due to the pandemic, the Office of Undergraduate Studies in Flinn Hall continued to serve as a hub for activities related to experiential learning. Our multipurpose meeting space hosted a number of virtual and socially distanced events in 2021 \u2014including demonstration sessions for students interested in the Cardiovascular Technology major hosted by Providence Hospital, MUSC, and Prisma Health; undergraduate research groups, visits from local employers offering internships, major- information sessions, career workshops, and a college open house held during Family Weekend. The college also collaborated with CAS faculty to offer a special COLA 298 course focused on engagement with community issue in spring. This course, focused on COVID-19 impacts, enrolled 249 students. The college plans to expand this type of programming in the upcoming year. Experiential Learning For Graduate Students Initiatives, improvements, challenges, and progress with Experiential Learning at the Graduate or Professional level. The different fields found in the College of Arts and Sciences departments, schools and programs bring quite different and broad experiential learning for graduate students. Arts and Sciences departments include the physical sciences, life sciences, the social sciences, and humanities and the arts. Due to the large variation in the type of departments and the uniqueness of many of the graduate programs, a summary of the experiential learning is presented here (Details for each department can be found in the supplemental information). Completion of a thesis or dissertation is most often an experiential learning opportunity, particularly in STEM - in the physical and life sciences, thesis/dissertation completion requires substantial hands-on work in the laboratory, field, or clinic, with the details of the experience differing across disciplines. Thus, for many Arts and Sciences programs, such as the sciences, there is a strong emphasis on hand-on experimental studies. For others, beyond-the- University of South Carolina Page 45 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Initiatives classroom internships and assistantships at historical sites or national agencies (e.g., National Park Service and the Smithsonian) as well as short conference trips and extended research visits at remote locations are experiential opportunities. Almost all graduate programs include student-teaching experiences, either in the classroom or in an undergraduate laboratory environment, including foreign language labs, while others include unique experiences such as editorial assistantships to faculty editing major journals, or the completion of an art or historical project involving museum collections or an art exhibition. In addition, it is not uncommon to find student-teaching experiences in K-12 classrooms, either in the form of assistantship to K-12 teachers or in the form of presentations or science demonstrations. In virtually all programs, it is common for graduate students both to give presentations at local, national and international venues and to publish or exhibit the scholarly products of the graduate studies. Finally, most of our programs have a graduate student association that provides opportunities for engagement with outside professionals, building professional networks, and intellectual interactions beyond the classroom/laboratory setting. The COVID pandemic continue to affect much of these experiential learning activities. Activities in research laboratories are now largely back to near normal. Performances and exhibits that had required more limited attendance or virtual options as well as internships that had been extensively modified are returning to a near normal situation. This return to a 'new normal' is helping us address learning objectives and respond to shifting COVID safety guidelines. Affordability Assessment of affordability and efforts to address affordability. Undergraduate Students At the undergraduate level, the college offers 220 merit- and need-based scholarships to help students with their educational expenses. Most are major-specific but several are available to eligible students college-wide. To reduce the costs associated with individual courses, many academic units encourage faculty to use open access materials or have created affordable textbooks in house. For example, this year Women's and Gender Studies program published the first edition of the Introduction to Women's Studies for its popular Carolina Core introductory course. Our departments also use course-associated lab fees to fully cover hands-on learning experiences and specialized equipment, to ensure that all students can participate without paying additional costs. During the pandemic, for example, the Chemistry department purchased and mailed home lab kits to students enrolled in its introductory courses. For more details about departments' efforts to enhance affordability, please see the Appendix. Graduate Students Graduate assistantships include a stipend and tuition support and, although the stipend typically falls short of fully covering students' living expenses, the affordability of graduate study is greatly enhanced by assistantship support. Especially in the sciences and social sciences, continuing and in some cases additional support is provided by research grants. In many departments, however, the available support is often barely enough to cover tuition and a very modest living allowance. Continuation of the $1000 subsidy toward health insurance and coverage of the remainder from college funds has greatly improved life quality for our graduate students by effectively removing these costs from their stipends. Additionally, many students can get summer funds for stipends through grant awards or through teaching University of South Carolina Page 46 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Initiatives assistantships, albeit the latter are quite limited. All of these increase affordability of our graduate programs. Though at first glance it seems that these stipends are sufficient to make graduate education affordable, in most cases these stipends continue to be 30 percent or more below the stipends offered by our competing institutions, making graduate student recruitment a challenge. The college increased stipends for all new incoming PhD students in 2019, so we are now in year 3 of this program which will eventually raise average stipends for all Arts and Sciences doctoral studies by $2,000. In addition, because we prioritize recruiting excellent graduate students to our terminal degree programs, the college introduced its own graduate stipend enhancement program for the incoming 2018-19 class; these fellowships offer up to 30 top prospective students in the college a modest stipend enhancement for four years (currently $4,000). We intend to continue this enhancement program for as long as it is financially sustainable for the college. We also strongly encourage faculty to budget research assistantship support at higher levels, which can raise overall average stipend levels across units, particularly in STEM where grant funding is common. Such additional support is crucial because virtually every unit in the college indicates that they lose these high-end students to institutions that have higher stipends. Most departments have programs in place to support research/conference travel, supplementing those offered by the graduate school. Nonetheless, the support is again very limited when compared to the overall graduate student population in CAS. Reputation Enhancement Contributions and achievements that enhance the reputation of UofSC Columbia regionally and nationally. As the most departmentalized college on campus, the College of Arts and Sciences cannot separate its reputation from the reputations of its diverse disciplines and units. We refer readers of this Blueprint to the relevant details provided for each unit in the supporting information. As these departments, programs, centers, and institutes enhance their individual reputations, the college enhances its own reputation writ large. That being said, the College of Arts and Sciences, the university's foundational college, is well- known for its outstanding faculty and their achievements. Our faculty is comprised of productive artists and scholars who have achieved regional, national and international reputations in their fields, thereby enhancing the reputation of the University of South Carolina. Many of our faculty members have garnered prestigious awards including local (Governor's awards, campus-wide teaching awards, etc.) national and international awards in their disciplines (American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellows, among others), prestigious research fellowships (ACLS, Guggenheim, Fulbright, NEH), memberships in the top scholarly societies (e.g., the American Academy of Arts and Science,, International Academy of Ceramic Art, Geophysical Society, and others) or via notable exhibitions, such as the prestigious Scripps Annual exhibition curated by faculty in SVAD. Additionally, many of our faculty edit national and international journals and serve on executive boards and committees of major national professional organizations. In addition to cutting-edge research, our collective record of scholarship remains impressive: faculty in the sciences actively publish in top-tier journals; faculty in the humanities and social sciences produce nationally and internationally recognized scholarly journal and book publications; faculty in the creative arts are recognized for their many contributions to society University of South Carolina Page 47 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Initiatives through art, dance, and theatre; and both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in research and scholarship. Our faculty, graduate students, and even the occasional undergraduate student visit many institutions of higher learning in the United States and abroad, giving invited talks at those institutions as well as at premier national and international conferences. Challenges Challenges and resource needs anticipated for the current and upcoming Academic Years, not noted elsewhere in this report and/or those which merit additional attention. Faculty Challenges The College of Arts and Sciences continues to develop strategies for recruitment and retention of both tenure-track and professional faculty. As enrollment grows, faculty are necessary to meet the curricular needs of students across the university. Replacing these faculty members will require significant resources for salaries, startup, offices, and laboratory space. Aligning our faculty and curriculum in support of a diverse student population continues to be a top priority of the college. Several of our departments, in the arts particularly, are committed to the important work of decolonizing their curricula. Furthermore, it is well documented that student persistence and success improve when students identify with faculty members by whom they are taught and mentored. We have made hiring diverse faculty a top priority during this and subsequent hiring cycles; we have also explicitly informed our units that we support all efforts to diversify the graduate and undergraduate populations. The college continues to identify opportunities for the close faculty-student relationships that define the educational experience through research opportunities and beyond-the-classroom experiences. Approximately one-fifth of the faculty in the college is composed of professional faculty members. The college continues to work on devising strategies to better integrate these faculty members into their home departments and programs and to enhance their professional experience both in the college and across the University. Student Challenges - Undergraduate The traditional population of college-aged students is projected to decrease over the next decade as the total number of high school-aged students declines. These developments will place significant pressure on colleges and universities to compete for students. This is a pressing challenge, as the College of Arts and Sciences provides the majority of Carolina Core and general education courses but houses just 30-35% percent of the university's majors. To maintain and grow enrollments, we must continue to strengthen our efforts to recruit incoming first-year students, not only through participation in university-wide recruitment efforts but also by expanding our outreach to K-12 students throughout the state. We must also continue to expand and diversify our academic offerings so as to increase majors and attract students from other colleges and schools. One important means to do this is by creating new degree programs in cutting-edge and interdisciplinary fields, as we have recently done with our Cyberintelligence (launched in fall 2021) and Neuroscience (launching in fall 2022) majors. The college must also remain cognizant of the prevalent skepticism toward the value of a traditional liberal arts degree, especially as higher education is increasingly valued for the pre-professional training it offers. Strategic course bundling in the University of South Carolina Page 48 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Initiatives form of minors, such as Medical Humanities and Culture (launched in 2020) and Medical Anthropology (launched in 2021), provides a unique opportunity to bring more students into the college and demonstrate the value of an Arts and Sciences degree. In addition, efforts to promote concurrent BA/MA degree programs should be increased. These opportunities become more attractive and viable as incoming students matriculate with more AP and IB credits. Finally, we must increase the accessibility of our degrees to community college students who wish to complete a four-year degree. We have established two 2+2 degree pathways in partnership with Midlands Technical College this year and in partnership with the UAC intend to establish five more in the upcoming year. Once students have been recruited into the college, we must make every effort to retain them and support their academic success. The college must pursue funding and other resources to enhance beyond the classroom experiences for students, specifically through undergraduate research opportunities, internships, and service-learning projects. Although programs such as the new CAS Career Center Studio are a good start, our CAS has fewer resources to devote to these areas than many of the pre-professional schools and colleges, and we need to actively seek funding support so that our students have access to the same opportunities as their peers in other colleges. Undergraduate advising support is another challenge. While we have built a strong partnership with the UAC and have added several new advising positions during the past year, we are understaffed, and many of our departmental advisors still advising caseloads significantly above nationally recommended standards. In addition, staff salaries across the college are low, meaning that we regularly lose our best staff to higher-paying equivalent positions in other colleges. We must address these issues in order to retain our majors and support them in successfully completing their degrees. Student Challenges - Graduate Graduate student recruitment continues to be a growing challenge due to the level of stipend funding and benefits the college is able to provide. Financial packages offered to incoming graduate students are lower than those of peer and peer-aspirant universities and compared to other schools in the SEC. Quality graduate students are essential to our instructional and research missions, and market competition for these students is very strong. A number of departments and programs across the college are hard-pressed to offer sufficient assistantships and other units cannot provide competitive stipend packages. The college has sought to remedy this situation somewhat through its competitive graduate stipend enhancement program for outstanding prospective students but can only afford to fund at most 30 of these fellowships, which amounts to only a small portion of our total graduate student population. The college also recently increased by $2K the stipends of all incoming graduate students in an effort to address these inequities, but there is a long way still to go to make our graduate programs competitive in the current market.

In FY2021, the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) continued to advance grant funding, with many new and renewal awards this year as outlined in Appendix 2. Our efforts are focused on becoming more successful with independent grant submissions and leveraging the breadth of our disciplines for joint and programmatic funding applications. This effort included increasing pre-award and post-award support for extramural grant awards, with doubling staffing for our Grants Operations Team and restructuring that office. We are seeing some return on this investment now in terms of saving faculty effort to focus on research/scholarship that has resulted in significant increase in funds requested on grant applications and a modest increase in federal awards for FY21 over FY20. Notably, our efforts to enhance the colleges productivity for research/scholarly works will be a multi-year effort. Our faculty continue to be recognized as high caliber and for their strong national and international reputations. The COVID shut down from 2020 is still impacting research expenditures in the College, but our faculty, students, fellows and staff continued to be productive by generating more than 1300 scholarly works over 2021 (see Appendix 2). These works include peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book chapters, published poetry and fiction pieces, films, performances, and exhibits. With the pandemic, countless invited lectures, performances, exhibits, and presentations were postponed or cancelled, but many faculty, students and fellows pivoted to online venues to highlight their scholarship. The current state of research laboratory space continues to be an impediment to the recruitment of high-quality faculty, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. The University is cognizant of the significant renovations needed to optimize research space in a tech savvy environment and we are working to address this. Faculty Development Efforts at Faculty Development, including investments, activities, incentives, objectives, and outcomes. Faculty Development Program (FDP) Faculty development, mentorship, and retention are top priorities for the College of Arts and Sciences, a commitment we have demonstrated through numerous programs and activities throughout the year. In 2019, the college began a new Faculty Development Program (FDP) to support tenure-track faculty through the tenure and promotion process and expanded the program in 2020 to University of South Carolina Page 53 College of Arts & SciencesFaculty Information include mid-career faculty. This past year, led by Associate Deans Todd Shaw and Qiana Whitted, the FDP program was further expanded and re-organized to include four tracks: Orientation/New Faculty, Junior Faculty, Mid-Career Faculty, and Faculty of Color. Each track offers targeted sessions covering a range of topics including college and university resources, strategic planning, teaching and research productivity, work-life balance, and building healthy and supportive relationships. 2021-2022 FDP PROGRAMS Orientation Track Facilitated by Associate Dean Qiana Whitted Introduction to CAS and University Research and Grant Support; Finding a Mentor Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Resources Teaching and Advising Resources Junior Faculty Track Facilitated by Dr. Tammi Richardson (Department of Biological Studies) and Dr. Elaine Chun (Department of English Language and Literature) \"Every Semester needs a plan...\" Navigating Tenure and Promotion Maintaining Work/Life Balance Writing Successful Research Grant Proposals Mentoring Graduate Students Mid-Career Faculty Track Facilitated by Dr. Linda Shimizu (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry) and Dr. Marius Valdes (School of Visual Art and Design) Finding New Mentor and Networking Promotion Criteria Fresh Start: Putting your research and writing first in the new semester Work-Life Balance \"Wrapping Up\": Maintaining momentum over the summer months Faculty of Color Track Associate Deans Shaw and Whitted conducted multiple exploratory sessions with college faculty of color this past year to discuss the best ways to support faculty of color within the college. This new initiative will develop a series of sessions across a range of retention and career advancement topics. NFCDD Fellowships and Other Incentives College faculty who complete at least five CAS FDP program sessions throughout the year will be given priority for a small number of fellowships to be awarded by the College for the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD) Faculty Success Program. Associate professors are also given priority for either a fellowship to the NCFDD Post-tenure Pathfinders Program or a \"service sabbatical\" (i.e., one academic year with no service University of South Carolina Page 54 College of Arts & SciencesFaculty Information commitments) plus a $5000 research fund. CAS Chair and Director Training This year, the college developed an expanded college-level training program for chairs and directors. College leadership conducted a survey of chairs and directors during the summer of 2021 to identify training needs and key areas of focus. In addition to a four-hour facilitated workshop (How to Face Conflict with Confidence) on leadership communication skills and having difficult conversations, CAS associate deans and directors have presented at each bi- monthly chair and directors meeting this academic year. Presentations have included overviews of Dean's Office administrative areas, a review of current and proposed college- level policies and procedures, and open discussions about improving communication with unit academic leaders. The sessions have been very productive, and the program will be further refined this summer in preparation for the coming year. Unit-Level Faculty Development and Mentoring Activities At the unit level, faculty development activities are introduced in a variety of ways, including mentorship. Many departments have internal programs that appoint faculty mentors to new professional and junior faculty. By doing so, the faculty in the College are able to share their knowledge and prepare their peers for what lies ahead. In addition, many of our departments and programs hold faculty retreats at the outset of the academic year. (COVID-19 required most of these retreats to be conducted via Zoom or other videoconferencing platforms over the past year.) Examples of recent faculty development programs in CAS units: Several research groups in the Department of Biological Sciences have initiated grant review/presentation panels or seminars where research proposal aims are presented and critiqued; these have proven useful for both junior and senior faculty, and in terms of crafting competitive grants. The seminar series has returned to being in-person, but the department offers a hybrid virtual option for those uncomfortable with attending in person. The School of Earth, Ocean and Environment incorporated a diversity workshop in their August 2021 faculty retreat. The workshop was planned by the SEOE Diversity Committee and delivered by Dr. Jennifer Gunter with the CAS Collaborative on Race. The English Language and Literature department had to postpone some of their regular faculty development activities due to COVID-19, including the reception to celebrate authors publishing books in 2021. In the Department of English Language and Literature, Dr. Ed Madden was nominated for an SC Governor's Award for the Arts and a Breakthrough Leadership in Research Award; he won both. In addition to this, Dr. Liz Countryman, a newly tenured faculty member, won a McCausland Fellowship. The Department of History used their monthly faculty meetings as a time for faculty development, offering presentations about resources for student mental health, assessment, and travel protocol/policy. The Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures strives to make theirs an environment in which faculty can easily find opportunities to voice their needs and grow their scholarship, using the following methods to encourage this: departmental teaching and research awards, instructor town hall, tenure-track town hall, faculty mentor programs, a distinguished scholar lecture series, and travel funding and support. The Department of Psychology has recently established a Departmental Director of University of South Carolina Page 55 College of Arts & SciencesFaculty Information Research who coordinates the research support in the department, and we are working with the college to bolster pre-award support for all faculty members. The department also supports faculty sabbaticals which allows faculty to achieve personal goals which could not be reached under the demands of regular university duties. From Fall 2021 to Spring 2022, three faculty members have taken a sabbatical. During 2021, many SVAD faculty have been occupied with professional development opportunities and have been participants in international and national conferences. Meena Khalili attended the Southeastern College Art Conference's University and College Designers Leadership Training and participated in workshops in California and North Carolina. Anna Swartwood House participated in a webinar to further her scholarly publications. Lydia Brandt has taken an active role in the Society of Architectural Historians, currently serving as the organization's president. The WGST Program offers WGST Faculty Affiliate opportunities to any UofSC faculty who wish to affiliate and who are conducting research, teaching, and/or service related to the goals and mission of the WGST Program. Each year, the WGST program offers three faculty teaching and research awards: The Josephine Abney Faculty Fellowship Award ($5,000) for research, the Carol Jones Carlisle Faculty Award ($1,000) for research, and the Women's and Gender Studies Teaching Award (1,000) for teaching. Also, the WGST Program is an institutional sponsor of the Duke Feminist Theory Workshop and invites USC WGST faculty and graduate students to attend. Each March, the Feminist Theory Workshop provides seminars and keynote lectures to develop a diverse and interdisciplinary community of scholars. The McKissick Museum has supported faculty curator Lana Burgess continuing to build her expertise with the Reacting to the Past experiential learning program and serving as the liaison for other faculty wanting access to this experimental teaching resource. The museum also supported her participation in the Southeastern Museums Conference, where she served as the moderator for the \"Student Work in Museums\" session. In addition to this, Curator of Collections Christian Cicimurri took the initiative to secure grant funds to engage a professional textile conservator to provide staff and student with a series of hands-on workshops to better steward McKissick's substantial textile collection. In Fall 2021, a course release funded by the Ann Johnson Institute for Science and Technology Studies (AJI) enabled Agnes Bolinska (Department of Philosophy) to expand her research into a new area. She connected with structural biologists in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and on this basis developed an ASPIRE-I research proposal (submitted in January 2022). Throughout the semester, she met bi-weekly with Leah McClimans, who mentored her through different stages of this process. University Faculty Development Activities A number of CAS faculty members take advantage of our institutional membership in the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity, which includes several resources regarding the best practices of time-management, writing/research objectives, career/life balance, etc. Dr. Nada Goodrum, one of our newest Assistant Professors, is currently enrolled in the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity Success Program. This program teaches faculty members strategic planning skills to achieve writing and research productivity while maintaining a healthy life on and off campus. College faculty members regularly participate in leadership development programs at the university level, including the Academic Administrators Academy, Pipeline for Academic Leadership (PAL), LEAD Supervisory Essentials Certificate Program, and the Academic University of South Carolina Page 56 College of Arts & SciencesFaculty Information Leadership Development Program (ALDP). Many also participate in or facilitate leadership development programs associated with their national professional associations. At the university level, CAS faculty members regularly facilitate and participate in workshops and certificate programs offered by the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE), including New Faculty Academy, Teaching Towards Inclusive Excellence, Creating Productive Learning Environments, Teaching Tune-Up, and Getting Ready to Teach Online. Several faculty members received CTE grants for innovative teaching, online/blended course development, and virtual reality. Five CAS faculty members currently serve as 2021 Faculty Fellows with the Center for Integrative and Experiential Learning (CIEL, formerly USC Connect). The college supports the essential sharing of knowledge and engagement with other faculty across the nation. We support and encourage attendance and presentations at relevant conferences, including through our CAS faculty travel awards program (which has given over 150 awards in the past four years), which increases the visibility of our faculty and the University of South Carolina. Department chairs and directors are also encouraged to nominate eligible faculty for internal and external awards that recognize faculty contributions to research, scholarship, teaching, and community.

University of South Carolina Page 57 College of Arts & SciencesTeaching Faculty to Student Ratio The following data was provided by UofSC's Office of Institutional Research, Assessment, and Analytics. The formula used to compute the ratio uses data from Faculty Population by Track and Title and Student Enrollment by Time Basis, as follows: Analysis of Ratio Analysis of the ratio, agreement with the data, and plans for the future to impact this ratio. The use of a standard formula to determine the faculty to student ratio is not always the best measure of educational quality. While the data supports our assertion that we do our best to recruit high-quality instructors and part-time faculty, the college is concerned that it does not accurately provide data to support those disciplines that require smaller class sizes. The College of Arts and Sciences is committed to providing a superior educational experience for our undergraduate and graduate students. We are working closely with other units on campus to be proactive in recruiting tenure-track faculty. The Faculty/Student ratio reflects the number of faculty in our college relative to the number of majors. However, it does not reflect the large numbers of undergraduate students our college teaches from other colleges. We teach 94% of the Carolina Core credit hours, along with gateway and pre-requisite courses for many majors outside the college, as well as a number of popular minors. Therefore, this metric does not fully account for the large and essential teaching load our college carries for the university as a whole. Table 4. Faculty-to-Student Ratio.

The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) is actively involved in the recruitment of students. Through a partnership with the Admissions Office and Enrollment Management, the college participates each year in Open Houses targeting rising high school seniors. Open House was not held in spring 2021 due to the pandemic. In fall 2021, the college participated in three open houses attended by a total of 3,058 prospective students and their parents from both within and outside the state. To provide for a wide range of interests, we offered attendees the opportunity to interact one-on-one with faculty, staff and students representing a variety of degree programs and departments. The final Open House for the 2021-2022 academic year will be held on April 23, 2022. Each spring, the Admissions Office and college also host visitors for Admitted Student Day weekends. These events are designed for students who have been admitted to USC but have not yet fully committed, and we play an important role in helping to guide their final choices. As with the Open Houses, we offered the students and parents varied opportunities to engage with our faculty, advisors and current students. During spring 2021, Admitted Student events were held in both virtual and in-person formats due to the pandemic; prospective students and their families were offered a choice of which to attend. The virtual format included a website with on-demand informational videos accompanied by eight live chat sessions consisting of a student panel and Q&A facilitated by college advisors (attendance numbers unavailable). The in-person format consisted of a socially distanced informational presentation followed by a panel discussion with CAS faculty, advisors and students. We hosted seven of these in-person sessions attended by a total of 530 guests. In spring 2022, Admitted Student weekends were all held in person. The first was January 28-29. CAS faculty and advisors greeted students and their families during Friday evening Scholars Social and Meet the SC Honors College receptions, attended by 680 and 178 guests respectively. On Saturday, we hosted four college information sessions that included a faculty and student panel, with a total attendance of 1774. The final Admitted Students weekends for this year will be held on March 25-26 and April 8-9. Each spring the Admissions Office also hosts two Top Scholars Weekends. These events are for highly distinguished students who interview for the University's most prestigious merit awards. In spring 2021, these weekends were held virtually; 18 faculty and advisors from the college met individually with 91 students to discuss their majors and academic interests. In spring 2022, the events were held in person; 12 college faculty and advisors met in small groups with a total of 87 students and their parents. Each June we join the Admissions Office in welcoming and recruiting South Carolina high school students from underrepresented minority groups in the Summer Seniors program. In 2021, the college hosted an information table and presentation staffed by faculty, advisors and students; 188 prospective students attended. In addition to these recurring events, this year the college has undertaken several new initiatives. Our communications team has redesigned our printed recruitment materials in response to undergraduate student feedback and increased our outreach to prospective University of South Carolina Page 59 College of Arts & SciencesStudent Recruiting and Retention students via social media. We have created a part-time faculty appointment for Special Recruitment Initiatives, who is working with Gamecock Media to produce promotional videos for ten of our most popular majors and to explore collaborations with Housing and other university offices that work with prospective students. In spring 2022, the Office of Undergraduate Studies also launched a new College of Arts and Sciences Ambassadors Program. Twenty competitively selected students representing a range of majors and backgrounds are now helping us to represent the college at student recruitment and community events. The ambassadors receive professional development and communication skills training as part of the program, and we anticipate that they will be an essential and dynamic component of our outreach to prospective students moving forward. In addition to these college-wide activities, individual programs and departments engaged in a variety of student recruitment efforts, including major-specific information sessions and K-12 and community outreach. These activities are described in the Appendix. Student Retention Efforts at retaining current students in College/School programs. Research has documented that quality academic advisement is key to student success, retention, and progression. The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) provides undergraduate students with systematic, supportive and mandatory advisement throughout the academic year and during the summer session. Our college advising capacity is organized into three groups. The CAS Office of Undergraduate Studies in Flinn Hall provides overall management of advising and serves as the liaison to the University Advising Center (UAC). University Academic Advisors (UAAs) from the UAC, who are jointly supervised by and housed within the college, advise students during their freshman and\u2014in some cases--sophomore years (depending on major). Students then transition to a staff or faculty advisor within their degree program for their final two years of study. During the past two years, we have significantly enhanced advising support and resources in the college. We have partnered with the UAC to fund six additional UAA positions, to bring advisor caseloads in several of our largest and fastest-growing majors closer to nationally recommended standards. In spring 2021, the Office of Undergraduate Studies redefined a senior staff position to serve as the college advising liaison; this position jointly supervises all UAAs in the college and provides regular training sessions, mentoring, and support resources to all college advisors, as well as working with academic units to encourage best advising practices. Faculty and advisors are encouraged to reach out to disengaged and academically struggling students via intervention initiatives coordinated by the UAC and Student Success Center. This academic year, we also developed and launched a new online forms portal to streamline the processing of routine advising forms for advisors and students. The role of the Office of Undergraduate Studies and college academic advisors is especially vital during summer orientation for incoming students, held from June - August each year. During orientation in summer 2021, the university brought in an incoming first-year class of 6,234 students, 2,204 (35.4%) of whom were CAS majors. We also hosted transfer student orientations attended by 760 students. Our mid-year orientations for students entering the university in Spring 2022 served 27 first-year and 172 transfer students. Each orientation session included an informational presentation, question-and-answer opportunities with academic advisors, and individual registration appointments. University of South Carolina Page 60 College of Arts & SciencesStudent Recruiting and Retention To streamline the orientation and registration process for incoming transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Studies has partnered with the UofSC Office of the Registrar this year to hire and train eleven new part-time employees to articulate university equivalencies for coursework they bring in from other institutions. This effort has significantly shortened wait times to process incoming transfer students' transcripts, enabling them and their advisors to more efficiently chart their pathway to graduation. Ensuring that students have timely access to the courses they need is crucial to retention and timely graduation. In addition to orienting and registering our own majors, the College of Arts and Sciences schedules classes that serve all undergraduate students at the university, particularly freshmen and sophomores completing their Carolina Core requirements. CAS teaches approximately 94% of the Carolina Core credit hours offered on the Columbia campus each year, including courses that fulfill all ten of the Core outcomes (CMW, ARP, SCI, GFL, GHS, GSS, AIU, CMS, INF and VSR). We monitor enrollments closely to ensure that our course offerings and availability of seats align with student demand, so that students can make timely progress towards graduation. This year, we continued several special initiatives to provide students with more varied and flexible course options\u2014especially in the area of online learning. In summer 2020, with the support of the Provost's Office, we sponsored a course development cohort that assisted faculty teams with developing high-quality online and hybrid versions of over two dozen of our highest-demand courses. In 2021 we also created a new Director of Assessment and Distributed Learning position and established two faculty task forces to develop recommendations for online learning in the college. As a result of these efforts, in the past two years, our units have secured approval for and developed 54 courses for online delivery. A grants program supported by the McCausland Innovation Fund was launched in spring 2021 to provide designated funds to support development of online courses and degree programs; the selection process is ongoing and awards will be announced in late spring and summer 2022. Plans for a summer 2022 cohort to support the development of 25 additional courses for online delivery are also underway. We anticipate that the flexibility and increased access these new course options provide will increase retention and on-time degree completion rates. We have also expanded course offerings during winter and summer terms, which many students use as opportunities to catch up, retain financial aid, or work towards early graduation. In collaboration with On Your Time, we tripled the number of winter term courses we offered from 2020 to 2021\u2014all of which filled to capacity. We have similarly tailored our summer course offerings to reduce enrollment bottlenecks in high-demand courses and provide students with opportunities to accelerate their academic progress. For example, our summer 2022 offerings will include a variety of Carolina Core courses in both online and in- person formats, several popular minors (psychology, sociology, political science, and criminal justice) that can be completed online, and a suite of pre-med prerequisite courses for students planning to apply to medical school or graduate programs in the health sciences. These efforts have been successful: our summer enrollments have increased over the past two years. Individual units within the college engaged in a variety of activities to retain students in their courses and degree programs, many devising new events and forms of outreach to engage students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These activities included targeted outreach to University of South Carolina Page 61 College of Arts & SciencesStudent Recruiting and Retention disengaged and struggling students, special events to build virtual community among students, nominating students for scholarships and other financial aid, and expanded advisement activities. These efforts are detailed in the Appendix.

Effectively increased social media traffic to the College of Arts and Sciences' (CAS) social media platforms \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Increased the visibility of faculty on local, state, national and international stages as subject matter experts, with regular appearances in The Conversation as well as in the @UofSC Today newsletter. To encourage involvement and input from the college's supporting community, the Dean's office hired a new Director of External Relations and Events Manager in the fall of 2021. The Communications team has also grown enabling improved strategic messaging across the college and with alumni and donors. Together with the Development team, these three groups have formed a strong relationship to serve as an advancement team for the College. The college's Board of Visitors and the Columbia, South Carolina and Washington, DC Alumni Councils continue meeting twice a year, and finally back in person in the spring of 2022. The CAS Board of Visitors garners community and financial support to enable the college to progress along a broad range of activities, including funding research and scholarships, creating endowed chairs, improving faculty salaries, attracting a larger number of more qualified students, and strengthening the college's reach and visibility in the state and nation. The Alumni Councils suggest and develop ways to encourage alumni to stay connected to the College through programs, projects, and communication strategies. The Councils also assist with mentoring students and identifying internships, job, study abroad and scholarship opportunities for CAS students. The college's advancement team connects the dots between alumni who want to help Arts and Sciences students explore and apply their studies in the world and students who are eager to work, study, and conduct research beyond the classroom. The Communications team provides consistent and meaningful recognition, communication, and engagement with more than 88,000 donors and alumni, providing stewardship of the college's financial resources. Maintaining contact with our community is also important. An alumni email newsletter was started in 2019 and will resume as part of the new strategic communications plan as a quarterly publication. Its purpose is to increase engagement with alumni and friends, provide an outlet for graduate updates and inform our audience of upcoming events (increase attendance) and new developments in the college. We continue to strengthen our media presence and have added an online form to our website where alumni can update their contact information. We believe these efforts will increase the number of alumni who stay connected. Many units have their own alumni newsletters, which the CAS communications team supports. Some highlights of alumni activities in the last academic year include: University of South Carolina Page 89 College of Arts & SciencesAlumni Engagement & Fundraising African American Studies Program's 50th anniversary celebration - including an alumni homecoming tailgate in Fall 2021 and many other events. School of the Earth, Ocean, and Environment established a new lecture series \"After 5\" targeted primarily at alumni as an opportunity to present career experiences and opportunities. Film and Media Studies has been cultivating alumni to engage as speakers for the Study Away in L.A. program. The History Department celebrated the areer of Dr. Robert Weyeneth with a zoom party with over 50 alumni and students of Dr. Weyeneth's. Languages, Literatures, and Cultures invites alumni back as guest speakers. Mathematics hosted a virtual retired faculty celebration for three recently retired faculty and many alumni attended. Philosophy sent an end of year newsletter to all known alumni encouraging their continued engagement. Physics and Astronomy distributes an annual Quantum Leap newsletter which highlights departmental news, accomplishments, and updates to all alumni. Psychology maintains a list of alumni and look forward to inviting them back for an alumni & friends campus gathering when it feels safe to do so. Many alumni remain actively engaged in work and collaborate with the department. Theatre and Dance alumni are a point of pride for the department and are often used to connect the current student body to the profession. The School of Visual Art and Design does a superb job of maintaining relationships with alumni after graduation and have many meaningful relationships with professionals in the various related fields as a result. The Walker Institute looks to cultivate alumni in the future now that they are an undergraduate home. Women's and Gender Studies regularly contacts and features alumni in their semi-annual digital newsletters. Development, Fundraising and Gifts Substantial development initiatives and outcomes, including Fundraising and Gifts. In FY2021, the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) raised over $5,000,000 which was consistent with previous years (FY16 and FY18). FY17 and FY19 served to be record-breaking years (not in a capital campaign) with cumulative giving averaging $9,000,000 each year. Through establishing endowed scholarships, fellowships and new program funds, the college has been able to lead the charge as the academic unit grossing the most of all units on- campus (other than Athletics) in years between university-wide, capital campaigns. Projections for FY22 has the college looking to complete the year at $8,000,000 with principal gifts going to support the Center for Civil Rights History and Research and a large gift of equipment to the Chemistry Department. The college has also completed three crowdfunding campaigns focused on a one day giving models to support all units on-campus, Give 4 Garnet (2018, 2019, 2021), and collectively raising over $200,000 from these two campaigns with an additional anonymous gift of $500,000 in FY 2019 and $100,000 in FY2021. Planning for the upcoming capital campaign will be the priority for FY23 and FY24. With a projected public launch in 2025 or 2026, it is anticipated the silent phase of the campaign, University of South Carolina Page 90 College of Arts & SciencesAlumni Engagement & Fundraising where approximately 50% of the money raised in total for the campaign will need to be secured, will launch in 2023. For the last capital campaign, Carolina's Promise, the college raised the most money of any academic unit on-campus with over $10,000,000 in unrestricted and endowed funds. In addition to preparing for the upcoming capital campaign, current high-priority projects for FY23 are as follows: 1.Renovate remaining portion of old law school building for science labs - $25,000 (spendable) 2.Named Graduate Scholars Program (focused on Humanities and the Liberal Arts) - $5,000,000 (endowed) 3.Securing endowed support for the African American Studies Program in honor of their 50 years anniversary - $1,000,000 (endowed) 4.Named scholarships for first generation college students - $1,000,000 (endowed) With new leadership in the Dean's Office and a refocused effort on principal giving (gifts over $1,000,000), strategic efforts are being made to identify current or future donors with deep affinity to the college and engage them in areas where we believe they would have inclination to leave a legacy. Through working with the Advancement Services team in UofSC Central Development, research requests and data mining can be completed to identify many of these prospects. Additionally, we are working closely with a strong group of college donors and volunteers that includes the Board of Visitors and Alumni Councils (Columbia and Washington DC), and giving them strong goals of engaging deeper on the college's priorities. These groups also have the potential of connecting us to their own personal networks and assisting in the further identification of major gift donors. UofSC Central Development is currently conducting a national search for a new Vice President for Development to lead the upcoming capital campaign and build a robust development team after years of turnover and budget cuts. Recently completed consulting report by Marts and Lundy, senior consulting company that specializes in higher education evaluations and reports to assist in staffing and campaign planning, have given university leadership the guidance they need to thoughtfully prepare for the future of the university as it pertains to development. In spring 2021, university development presented to university leadership and the board of trustees as future plans are made. As the report pertains more directly to the college, it is anticipated that the office will need to grow its staff to support the obtainable goals of raising over $150,000,000 and appropriately supporting the strategic fundraising efforts of the Dean, all 19 academic departments, and additional institutes, centers and groups within the college. Other important development goals include the increased focus on planned giving, annual giving and corporate/foundation philanthropy. Securing immediate cash in the form of a major gift is often challenging for the demographics from which the development team seeks support. Some of the college's most robust groups of prospects are unable to do major gifts of cash so making annual gifts or thoughtfully planning to leave future gifts in their estate plan are often the best options. Additionally, the opportunity to leave a retirement plan is a gift opportunity that works well for this group. The CAS Office of Development works closely with University of South Carolina Page 91 College of Arts & SciencesAlumni Engagement & Fundraising the Central Development team to collaborate and solicit these potential donors. Much of what can be done to raise support for the college is preparing for the future and documenting planned gifts to create more scholarships and endowed funding opportunities for the future. Working collectively with the UofSC Office of Corporate and Foundation Philanthropy is another priority that is extremely important to the success of raising money for programmatic support or scholarships that would thereby be more challenging to secure if working one-on- one with a particular donor. Individual donors often prefer to focus their philanthropic planning on leaving a legacy through an endowed fund and therefore the immediate need for cash to support high priority program that do not have sustainable funding becomes more challenging. By working with the Office of Corporate and Foundation Philanthropy, the development team can work collectively with program officers and faculty to identify transformational projects to further the research intent of our Research I institution and secure programmatic support for programs that need it in a timely manner. With the diverse areas of academic excellence that the college supports, there continues to be many potential opportunities to work with more foundations and companies to raise money.

University of South Carolina Page 92 College of Arts & SciencesCommunity Engagement Community Engagements and Community - Based Activities Community engagement and community based research, scholarship, outreach, service or volunteerism conducted, including activities at the local, state, regional national and international levels. The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) is committed to community engagement activities throughout the university and at the local, state, national and international levels. Even with the challenges of the COVID-19, our faculty, students and staff have continued to work extensively with the community in a suite of activities, ranging from online art and dance workshops to health and wellness programs to promoting science innovation and literacy. College faculty, staff and students frequently partnered with government agencies and local community groups to participate in and promote service and volunteerism. The College further worked with various K-12 schools to provide mentorship and educational opportunities for students and teachers. We are committed to encouraging the academic success of underrepresented populations, and specific activities focused on the recruitment of minorities into the STEM disciplines. The college is internationally renowned for our faculty, who serve as board members of various industry groups and are peer-reviewers and members of editorial boards and non-profit organizations in their various fields. The community engagement activities in CAS are numerous and diverse and include the college's own annual fall Theme Semester, launched in 2020, which in addition to a range of courses related to the annual theme offers numerous events, exhibits, workshops, and other programming that are open to the public. Through all of its outreach activities, the college strongly supports and pursues innovative ways to serve the university and community at large (See Appendix 6). To enrich the educational experience and provide opportunities for students to engage with the community, this past year the CAS Office of External Relations collaborated with the office of Undergraduate Studies to implement the Student Ambassadors program. As front-line advocates for the college, CAS Student Ambassadors represent the college to their peers, to prospective students, and to the community. Ambassadors demonstrate leadership and professionalism, play a key role in events, and help to inspire the next generation of Arts and Sciences students. Organizing and hosting events fosters an engaged college community. With a flexible approach to programming in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the college and various units hosted a number of events remotely or in a hybrid format creating new opportunities for engagement. During the spring 2022, we began to see a welcome shift back to opportunities for in-person events and engagement. The information contained in the Appendix is only a snapshot of the wide-ranging community engagement activities and public programs conducted by college units during the 2021-2022 academic year. Community Perceptions University of South Carolina Page 93 College of Arts & SciencesCommunity Engagement How unit assesses community perceptions of engagement, as well as impact of community engagement on students, faculty, community and the institution. The College of Arts and Sciences does not have any formal mechanisms to assess community perceptions of engagement. The sheer number and diversity of our engagement activities renders assessment of community perceptions, engagement, and impact exceedingly difficult. Individual units do not report formal assessments of their engagements as individual faculty, staff and student groups lead our many initiatives. Incentivizing Faculty Engagement Policies and practices for incentivizing and recognizing community engagement in teaching and learning, research, and creative activity. The College of Arts and Sciences encourages all faculty, staff, and students to participate in community engagement and actively supports involvement by funding lectures, workshops, and events. Individual departments, programs, and institutes are actively engaged across the country, state, and city of Columbia to ensure that our communities are vibrant places to live, work, play, and learn. Supplemental Info - Community Engagement Any additional information on Community Engagement appears as 'Appendix 5. Community Engagement' (bottom). University of South Carolina Page 94 College of Arts & SciencesCollaborations Internal Collaborations Our most significant academic collaborations and multidisciplinary efforts characterized as internal to the University. The College of Arts & Sciences (CAS) strives to foster collaboration and interdisciplinary research within the college and across campus. College departments have numerous grants, publications and programs that involve other units within the college. We also are home to several interdisciplinary programs including African American Studies, Comparative Literature, Environment and Sustainability, Film and Media Studies, Jewish Studies, Linguistics, Public History, and Women's and Gender Studies. The college also hosts cross-unit centers and institutes including the Center for Digital Humanities, Center for Civil Rights History and Research, The History Center, Center for Geographic Education, Parenting and Family Research Center, Institute for African American Research, Ann Johnson Institute for Science, Technology and Society, Baruch Institute, Confucius Institute, Institute for Mind and Brain, Southern Studies, the Walker Institute, and South Carolina Institute for Archaeology and Anthropology.

Examples of internal collaboration projects and activities over the past year include: Terrence Weik and Eric Jones, the Department of Anthropology's two historical archaeologists, partnered on a study featuring the history of African American reparations from 1800-2000 in Hilton Head, SC. In the Department of English Language and Literature, Mark Minett is collaborating with faculty in English, African American Studies, Media Arts, Film and Media Studies, University Libraries, and at UofSC Sumter on a Comics Studies Working Group. Their current project involves collaborating with Timothy Simmons in the Libraries on a \"Comics Studies Library Guide\" that will also serve as a more general informational hub. Lana Burgess, in support of the CAS Climate theme semester in fall 2021 and the Climate Ready Columbia event that faculty member Matt Kisner is organizing for spring 2022, engaged multiple CAS units and UofSC's Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion to bring cutting-edge museum activist Stephanie Johnson-Cunningham to Columbia to speak to \"The Changing Cultural Climate in Museums,\" and Giordano Angeletti curated Inheritance: Sustainable Farms in the South, and arranged for a traveling exhibit about wild bees to coincide with the Climate Ready conference. Sara Schneckloth (PI, School of Visual Art and Design) and Melanie Palomares (co-PI, Department of Psychology) received the Humanities Collaborative Research Group Grant for (in)Visibility: Aesthetic Dimensions of Perception. The group brings together faculty from SVAD, Psychology, Geology, Philosophy, and Music. A public symposium/exhibition is forthcoming from this research group next year. External Collaborations University of South Carolina Page 95 College of Arts & SciencesCollaborations Our most significant academic collaborations and multidisciplinary efforts characterized as external to the University. The College of Arts and Sciences is known locally, regionally, nationally and internationally for our research and community engagement, as evident through the numerous collaborations with other colleges and universities, government agencies, nations, foundations and organizations. College units have collaborated with over 190 US colleges and universities and over 100 international colleges and universities over the past year. Project partners have included the SC Department of Juvenile Justice; SC Department of Natural Resources; Arts Commission; Nation in Oklahoma; Catawba Indian Nation; National Institutes of Mental Health; National Park Service; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; US Department of Defense and the Smithsonian. Examples of external collaboration projects and activities include: Katherine Goldberg (Anthropology) and Adam King (Director of SCIAA) co-directed the Diversifying Archaeological Education Collaborative Group seeking partners at area HBCUs, Community Technical Colleges, and High Schools. The Center for Civil Rights History and Research is collaborating with the Richland Library, Historic Columbia, the South Carolina State Museum, Duquesne University, and the Collaborative on Race at UofSC on Our Vulnerable Democracy: Past, Present, and Future, Race and Democracy Today. Lori Ziolkowski (School of Earth, Ocean and Environment) is working with the City of Columbia, leading an effort for the city, UofSC, Richland One, Columbia Housing, and Richland County to build a large-scale solar installation through a custom deal with Dominion Energy. This requires the School and the collaborators to go through a yearlong training program with the World Resources Institute. Brent Simpson (Department of Sociology) is collaborating with faculty at Stanford, University of Toronto, Ohio State, University of Groningen (Netherlands), Stockholm University, Institute for Future Studies (Sweden), and a group of 57 scholars from all over the world on a large project on international norms. The first publication from this collaboration was published in Nature Communications and a second publication is currently under review. Steve Smith, Chester DePratter, and Jim Legg (South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology) collaborate with the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, the Florida Museum of Natural History, and the Cobb Institute of Mississippi State University on grants and publications relating to 16th century Spanish entradas. Smith also collaborates with Francis Marion University on research on Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion, and the South Carolina American Revolution Sestercentennial Commission on the archaeology of the Revolutionary War in South Carolina. Jodi Salter, the Program Manager for CYBR, created a number of external collaborations at Check Point CPX, a large conference on cyber issues that provided opportunities for students to talk about jobs and internships and to liaise with the Columbia Chamber of Commerce, SC Compete, and the City of Columbia Economic Office. The program also hosted two SC Cyber days for SC Competes to share information about the CYBR program with thousands of SC high school students and their guidance counselors. The WGST Program is an institutional sponsor of the Duke Feminist Theory Workshop and invites USC WGST faculty and graduate students to attend. Each March, the Feminist Theory University of South Carolina Page 96 College of Arts & SciencesCollaborations Workshop provides seminars and keynote lectures to develop a diverse and interdisciplinary community of scholars. In 2021, one WGST faculty member attended virtually. In 2022, two WGST faculty and one graduate student will attend. The Belser Arboretum (Biological Sciences) works closely with many community organizations, including the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and the SC Native Plant Society. Science Educations works with teachers in the Charleston County School District to develop curricula that teach middle school students to share information about flood resilience and hurricane preparedness with local community organizations and churches. Given the state functions assigned to SCIAA, our staff, particularly State Archaeologist Jon Leader and State Underwater Archaeologist Jim Spirek, collaborate with various state and federal agencies on matters of archaeology. Mark Smith (Institute for Southern Studies) was appointed Advisory Board Member for Professor Stephanie Marie R. Coo, Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, Universidad de Granada; Assistant Professor of History, Ateneo de Manila University (History), European Research Council.

University of South Carolina Page 97 College of Arts & SciencesEquity and Diversity Plan Improve Under-Represented Minority (URM) Student Enrollment In its effort to advance the University's Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) has developed both College-level programming and initiatives, spearheaded by the CAS Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Social Sciences. Dr. Tracey Weldon held this post until December 2020 and then Dr. Todd Shaw assumed this post from January to December 2021 as Interim Associate Dean. In January 2022 Dr. Jennifer Gunter became the interim director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Our efforts continue to be led by a 40+ member CAS Diversity Committee, the Collaborative on Race (which joined the Dean's office in the fall of 2020 as led by Dr. Jennifer Gunter, Director) as well as a variety of unit- level activities organized by the Colleges' various departments, programs, centers, and institutes. The summary below provides a high-level overview of these efforts, particularly at the College level. More specific information about unit-level activities is provided in the appendix to this report. Under the leadership of the CAS Diversity Committee's Student Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement subcommittee is exploring ways for the College and the Office of Undergraduate Student Admissions, Diversity & Inclusion Team, to make better appeals to URM student populations outreach efforts to Latino/Latinx and Native American/Indigenous communities. The Student Caucus is actively recruiting students to engage with the CAS Diversity Committee and is looking to become an official student organization. In his capacity as the Interim Associate for DEI, Shaw participated in outreach activities to high school students/prospective undergraduate students of color, most specifically African American students, as sponsored by the Office of Admissions' Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team - headed by Director Mike Davis. During the months of June and July of 2021 he (and other members of the CAS Undergraduate Student Services office) spoke with prospective students and their parents at the \"Summer Seniors\" events. During the spring of 2021, Shaw spoke with the leadership of the JROTC program about a scholarship opportunity directed at prospective cadets of color. The Dean's Office will continue to explore ways to recruit such students more effectively. In June of 2021, the Collaborative on Race hosted the third annual South Carolina Youth Collective Summer Fellows, which hosted thirteen teenagers from eleven different Midland's area high schools. The virtual program included featured speakers, workshops on leadership, resource mapping, and communication skills. Beginning in August of 2021 the Collaborative hosted monthly teen focused meetings in a program called Second Saturdays for Social Justice. Every second Saturday they gather in different spaces to learn about history, art, and civic engagement. For example, they have visited the Columbia Museum of Art and taken a walking tour of Civil Rights historic makers on Main Street Columbia. A shared DEI listserv is regularly used to forward information to faculty, students, and staff about participation in campus events that directly appeal to URM prospective and admitted students as well as highlight the inclusivity of our campus climate. Dr. Gunter has been building relationships with different Native American nations. In November 2021, the Collaborative on Race co-hosted a drive-in movie screening with the University of South Carolina Page 98 College of Arts & SciencesEquity and Diversity Plan Waccamaw. A companion event was scheduled at Russell House but then canceled due to COVID. They collaborated with the SC Indian Affairs Commission on these events. She has also been building relationships with the Catawba. At the unit-level, activities reported included recruitment at on-campus events and professional conferences, as well as outreach to local HBCUs, rural K-12 school districts, schools with high URM enrollments, and local community events. Units in the College offered courses counting towards the Diversity and Social Advocacy GLD pathway; sponsored talks focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Improve The Number Of Full-Time URM Faculty Across Academic Units As described in detail elsewhere in the Blueprint, the college expanded the Faculty Development Program, built upon the resources of the University's Institutional membership to the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD). This program was created on the recommendation of the CAS Diversity Committee's subcommittee on Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement. Select participants will be eligible for a small number of fellowships to the NCFDD's Faculty Success Program (FSP). In 2021, we continued the twin-track Junior Faculty Development Program as well as Mid-Career Faculty Development Program that in part provide resources to faculty members who are women and/or from URM backgrounds to help them in achieving tenure and/or promotion. Shaw, in conjunction with Interim Associate Dean Whitted initiated a Faculty of Color Discussion group as a unique opportunity to have faculty across the college discuss and make recommendations to Dean's office about issues of retention, recruitment, and equity. At the unit-level, departments participated in search committee training, conducted targeted outreach, and were successful in hiring a small number of URM faculty into the college. Enhance Outcomes For URM Undergraduate and Graduate/Professional Students Per the recommendation of the CAS Diversity Committee's Diversity Training subcommittee, we launched continued the CAS Diversity and Inclusion Academy that incentivizes more CAS instructors to take advantage of the training resources offered by the CTE and other offices on campus (e.g., EOP, OMSA, HR, etc.) For the 2021-2022 year, this academy is offering sessions on: Anti- bullying, Anti-racism, GreenZone Ally Training, Intercultural Training, SafeZone Ally Training, Sexual Harassment Prevention and Reporting, and Trans Advocacy Training. Unit-level activities in this area included student mentoring, awards and fellowships, the creation of unit-level diversity committees and student affinity groups, professional training workshops, consultations with the student success center, orientations on student support services, symposia, gateway programs, student surveys, recognition of student achievement, and research and travel support. Improve Post-Graduate Outcomes For URM Undergraduate and Graduate/Professional Students For the past two years, the college has been in conversation with representatives from a small University of South Carolina Page 99 College of Arts & SciencesEquity and Diversity Plan group of universities within the SEC about setting up a minority recruitment consortium for PhD candidates that would facilitate recruitment of UofSC graduates into faculty positions within the SEC, while also assisting in our own efforts to hire more URM faculty. In mid- February 2021, Interim CAS Dean Joel Samuels, Dr. Shaw, and Dr. Gunter of the Collaborative on Race made a presentation to the SEC deans of Arts & Sciences colleges and their associate deans for diversity and inclusion. These associate deans for diversity continue these conversations monthly, exchanging ideas on improving post-graduate outcomes for URM students. Of course, the college, its departments, and units fully intends to participate in the many URM- targeted post-doctoral fellowship opportunities provided by the Office of the Provost, most especially as connected to the university strategic plan. Unit-level activities contributing to improved post-graduate outcomes for URM students at UofSC include unit efforts to prepare students for the job market, to assist in their professional development, to write letters of recommendation, to participate in one-on-one mentoring, and to facilitate internship placement. Increase the engagement of students, faculty, staff, administrators in Equity and Inclusion At the university level, Dr. Shaw and Dr. Gunter served on the Council of Academic Diversity Officers and the Presidential Commission on University History. Dr. Gunter collaborated with the Office of Multicultural Student Affairs to construct a university wide calendar of events that highlight issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Within the college, the CAS Diversity Committee, now in its fifth year of operation, provided students, faculty, and staff from across the College a variety of opportunities to actively engage in its equity and inclusion efforts. Also at the college level, the Collaborative on Race (COR) led training sessions and Effective Equity series of healing circles with a group of Chairs and Directors and the faculty of SEOE. The process consists of a series of scaffolded activities that lead to increased sense of personal power and group cohesiveness. Participants learn about the personal, structural, and systemic effects of racism and work together to develop a common goal to work towards. First developed in Mississippi in the early 1990s, abbreviated versions of this program were conducted with nine units to date. COR also hosted the fourth annual Equity and Inclusion Summit, virtually, November 3-5, 2020. This year marked the first year that CAS was a co- sponsor. The theme for the conference was Equity in Education and was attended by faculty, staff, and students. Panelists came from national and local platforms as well as from universities across the southeast. In its fourth year, the conference serves as a space where activists and academics come together to marry theory to action. Participants come from across the southeast and represent numerous sectors including academia, nonprofits, state and local government, law enforcement, public health, and others. The 2021 event was attended by over 200 participants due to its virtual nature. In addition to the plethora of talks and activities hosted by various units on campus (see appendix), unit-level engagement included programming in partnership with the Collaborative University of South Carolina Page 100 College of Arts & SciencesEquity and Diversity Plan on Race; administrative appointments in programs, centers, and institutes committed to advancing equity and inclusion; participation in student and faculty affinity groups; unit-level training, retreats, social events, and discussions focused on equity and inclusion; workshops and performances engaging the local community; and meetings with members of the upper administration to discuss the University's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Improve The Sense Of Inclusion Amongst All University Community Members Finally, Dr. Shaw is actively working with Vice-President Julian Williams as well as CADO colleagues to ensure gender-neutral facilities are more widely available across the campus. Other inclusion activities at the unit-level, which may be found in the appendix, include particularly noteworthy contributions by departments in the Arts and Humanities, interdisciplinary programs, and several of the college's centers and institutes, including the Center for Civil Rights History and Research, the Institute for African American Research, and the McKissick Museum.

The Faculty/Student ratio reflects the number of faculty in our college relative to the number of majors. However, it does not reflect the large numbers of undergraduate students our college teaches from other colleges. We teach 94% of the Carolina Core credit hours, along with gateway and pre-requisite courses for many majors outside the college, as well as a number of popular minors. While university student enrollment has increased by ~ 4% over the past five years, enrollment in the College of Arts and Sciences has increased by more than 30%. At the same time, the size of the college's faculty and classroom space has remained the same. This rapid growth has placed a significant burden on Arts and Sciences faculty to maintain a high-quality student learning experience while continuing world-class research. Cool Stuff Describe innovations, happy accidents, good news, etc. that occurred within your unit not noted elsewhere in your reporting. In the last year the faculty and students in the College of Arts & Sciences have continued to find new and creative ways to thrive and remain productive while grappling with the consequences of a global pandemic: AFAM Studies celebrated 50 years at UofSC in 2021-2022 with a year of activities including community lectures, roundtable discussions, film screenings, dance performances, and day trips across South Carolina. The program's former directors were honored during half-time at a Women's Basketball game. They plan to conclude the year with the Annual Robert Smalls lecture featuring renowned civil rights activist Angela Davis and a screening of an AFAM 50-year documentary film. In February 2022 DLLC faculty member Professor Alanna Breen and her SPAN 305 class were featured on the front page of a newspaper in Minnesota. Six high school athletes who were featured in a documentary series visited the class where they were able to take a leadership role and speak in Spanish with Professor Breen's students. Rosamond Kent Sprague, a longtime member of the Philosophy Department, now emerita, will turn 100 years old in May 2022. The department marks her contribution to its history each year with its Rosamond Kent Sprague Lecture in Ancient Philosophy. In 2021 the Lecture was delivered by Katja Vogt of Columbia University. Marius Valdes, a professor in the Studio Art program was selected as \"One of the 20 Most Exciting Illustrators to Follow in 2022\" by UK's Creative Boom online magazine with a readership of six million. After 61 years of existence, for the first time the Walker Institute of International and Area Studies is home to undergraduate programs (Global Studies B.A. and Cyber Intelligence B.A.). University of South Carolina Page 106 College of Arts & SciencesAppendix 1. Academic Initiatives Appendix 1. Academic Initiatives University of South Carolina Page 107 College of Arts & Sciences1 2022 BLUEPRINT - UNIT -LEVEL DATA EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING ACTIVITIES African American Studies & Research, Institute for (Submitted by Qiana Studies is in the fourth year of a successful internship program with the Central Carolina Community Foundation. Our majors and minors work closely with the Foundation's Community Investment team to provide support for grantmaking and scholarships. Interns are exposed to all aspects of philanthropy including financial management, community engagement, communications and donor relations. Anthropology (Submitted by Jennifer Reynolds , jreynold@mailbox.sc.edu, 8037775527) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: The Department of Anthropology (ANTH) continues to offer a Directed Undergraduate Research Track (DURT) which requires faculty mentored research for undergraduates, results in a thesis based on an empirically grounded study, and confer s graduation with distinction in anthropology. Most of the research that UGs undertake requires fieldwork and therefore qualifies as experiential learning. In 2021, we also successfully added an internship course, ANTH 497, to the course curriculum. It was designed according to the Experiential Learning outcomes to ensure that students are able to apply subfield specific content in unpaid (or even paid) internships in and around the region and obtain course credit for doing so. Spring 2021, the Department also offered a service learning course through the Honors College (SCHC 232) titled, \"Complicated Histories: Community Archaeology. Public Heritage and Social Justice.\" In that course, students took a field trip to Cumberland Island as part of a group proje ct to build an interactive website curating oral histories, images of historical buildings and material culture along with scenic shots of the island. Before COVID -19 ANTH had an approved CIEL Global Carolina ethnographic field school that was to run thr ee consecutive summers in Kazakhstan. We are hopeful that once a vaccine is widely available in the US and in Kazakhstan that we will be able to resume that EL opportunity. Another faculty member secured a Beyond the Classroom Engagement (Student Research) CIEL grant to fund a student researcher in interested in public history and heritage interpretation to work on an ongoing project on the Brown Family's property on James Island, South Carolina. The Department in collaboration with SCIAA, also submitted a McCausland Innovation proposal to help fund a field school that would be held on the horseshoe that would make highly visible and accessible the archaeology field school that we were able to offer during Spring semesters, but had to be temporarily disconti nued due to a staffing shortage. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: All graduate students enrolled in MA and PhD programs (though not the Certificate in Historic Archaeology and Cultural Resource Management) are required to undertake mentored fiel d research which involves out of classroom learning. University of South Carolina Page 108 College of Arts & Sciences2 Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine & Coastal Sciences (Submitted by James Pinckney, pinckney@sc.edu , 8035460768) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: The BI does not award academic degrees; however, we recognize that our research and BMFL's location present a tremendous educational opportunity. We welcome university- level academic classes for field experiences and provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to pursue their research interests. For over two decades, BMFL has coordinated, hosted, and taught the UofSC Marine Science program (MSCI) course \"Field and Laboratory Investigations in Marine Science\" (MSCI 460). Currently, this is a two - credit course that involves about 28 undergraduates per semester via intensive weekend field excursions focused on the North Inlet estuary. BMFL is also offering two Maymester sections of MSCI 460 (28 students total) in 2022 and thereafter annually. Prior to 2021, MSCI was a four -credit course with two sections running in May and June, taught by Erik Smith (NI -WB NERR) and Matt Kimball (BMFL). In addition, in partnership with the UofSC Honors College, BMFL created and is running a \"Semester@TheCoast\" program that involves 10 in- residence Honors College undergraduates taking multiple interrelated courses during the Spring 2022 semester; 14 base credit hours by non- tenure (BMFL: Bill Strosnider, Matt Kimball) and non -UofSC adjunct faculty. In addition, two 3- credit independent study experiences are being mentored by another non -tenure -track UofSC faculty member (NI -WB NERR: Robert Dunn) and three non- credit paid internships are being coordinated by Strosnider and Szewczyk. In all, BMFL has moved from instructing 4- 8 credit hours per year over the last decade to 26 credit hours per year currently (Figure 8), which could be a new steady -state if it is sustainable. While all teaching opportunities noted above are open to tenure -track campus -based faculty, all associated courses are taught exclusively by non- tenure -track faculty on adjunct contracts. Currently BMFL hosts no other courses but does support course -related field trips for Invertebrate Zoology (BIOL/MSCI 510) and Biology of Marine Organisms (MSCI 311) for SEOE. However, far fewer course -related field trips have been hosted in recent years t han in decades past, a decrease that has tracked with the reduction in the number of tenure -track UofSC faculty engaged in estuarine and coastal research. The NI -WB NERR, conducts a variety of education and outreach programs with local (county) K -12 school s, the general public, and agencies and organizations engaged in resource management. The BI offers a variety of summer internships and fellowships for both graduate and undergraduate students. Funding is provided through spendable allocations on endowments managed by the UofSC Educational Foundation. Total annual funding available for these programs is ca. $50k per year. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: The BI does not award academic degrees; however, we recognize that our research and BMFL's location present a tremendous educational opportunity. We welcome university -level academic classes for field experiences and provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to pursue their research interests. For over two decades, BM FL has coordinated, hosted, and taught the UofSC Marine Science program (MSCI) course \"Field and Laboratory Investigations in Marine Science\" (MSCI 460). Currently, this is a two- credit course that involves about 28 undergraduates per semester via intensive weekend field excursions focused on the North Inlet estuary. BMFL is also offering two Maymester sections of MSCI 460 (28 students total) in 2022 and thereafter annually. Prior to 2021, MSCI was a four -credit course with two sections running in May and J une, taught by Erik Smith (NI -WB NERR) and Matt Kimball (BMFL).

Biological Sciences (Submitted by Tammi Richardson, richardson@biol.sc.edu, 8037776389) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: We have three courses approved for Experiential Learning opportunities: BIOL 302 Labs, BIOL 303 labs, and BIOL 398 Peer Teaching Course. In BIOL 302, Dr. Schumpert has a capstone project in which they develop their own project based on concepts they learned earlier in the course. In BIOL 303 lab we have an out of the classroom activity where they interview faculty members to discuss their experiences in genetics. In the same course, students also have the opportunity to do a project on the diversity of faculty and their research in our department. In BIOL 398, students learn about peer -led team learning. They work with a grad assistant to develop teaching skills by working with the grad students and teaching their peers. We also encourage study abroad opportunities, and we host as many students as possible in faculty laboratories for research, within the constraints of our relatively low faculty numbers. Our undergraduate coordinator regularly sends out internship and/or job opportunities to our undergraduates. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: We have initiated BIOL 704 (not yet approved for EL), Scientific Teaching and Pedagogy, which is offered to BIOL graduate students as a way to provide them with a course in best practices in teaching. Many who take this course are interested in pursuing a career in university teaching at the undergraduate level. Completion of this course allows them to be Instructor of Record in a course the following semester. Graduate students in BIOL by default get hands -on experience through their own thesis or dissertation projects. Chemistry and Biochemistry (Submitted by Daniel Reger , reger@mailbox.sc.edu, 8037772587) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: 1. A high percentage of our majors participate in undergraduate research. Usually, we have around 100 undergraduate student researchers in a year. However, with the restrictions due to COVID, we only had 40 undergraduate researchers last year. 2. CHEM 401 is an experiential learning experience that provides professional training for future University of South Carolina Page 110 College of Arts & Sciences4 careers in chemistry and the sciences. Each week the students attend a lecture by a leader in industry and have the opportunity to interact outside of the class room. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: 1. This year the department coordinated an American Chemical Society professional development seminar and workshop for our graduate students. We had around 25 students participate. 2. The department hosts a weekly seminar that invites faculty and researchers from around the nation and world to UofSC. Graduate students attend the seminars and also have the opportunity to meet the speakers over lunch. 3. SACS is our graduate student ACS organization. One of the primary activities of SACS is to organize a lunch with the departmental seminar speaker where the students and post -docs can sit down with a lunch with international and national leaders in chemistry and biochemistry research and from industry. Criminology and Criminal Justice (Submitted by Brandon Applegate , applegate@sc.edu, 803- 777-7065) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: During the year students participated in supervised internships, working in the community while learning first -hand about criminal justice professionals, populations, and processes. A second prominent experiential learning option for CRJU students is the Adolescent Mentoring Program (AMP), a collaborative partnership with Lexington District Two Scho ols through which UofSC students in Criminology and Criminal Justice provide mentorship to at -risk high school students. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: During the year graduate students were able to participate in supervised internships, worki ng in the community while learning first -hand about criminal justice professionals, populations, and processes. Graduate students also participated in experiential learning through guided research projects and independent study experiences. Earth, Ocean and Environment, School of (Submitted by Alicia Wilson , awilson@seoe.sc.edu , 7-1240) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: The SEOE has many active experiential learning opportunities. We have extensive listings on the CIEL site (https://sc.edu/about/initiatives/center_for_integrative_experiential_learning/choose_experiences/recommendations_by_major/arts_and_sciences.php) for the Environmental Science and Environmental Studies degrees. These include listings for Community Service, Diversity and Social Advocacy, Global Learning, Peer Leadership, Internships/Professional Practice, Research, and Integration. The CIEL listings for the Geology and Marine Science degrees are not as extensive on the webpage, but both of these degrees incl ude a tremendous amount of experiential learning through laboratory and field work in every introductory and 300- level major core course as well as through research experiences in faculty labs. Notably, the capstone class for the Geology major is GEOL 500, a 4 -credit field course that operates out of a field camp in Colorado. Marine Science majors are required to obtain significant field experience through MSCI 460, which is hosted at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL), or other research experiences. A new addition this year is the Semester at the Coast, A goal for the coming year will be to update the CIEL listings for Geology and Marine Science. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: All SEOE graduate programs require either a thesis option to conduct research, or an internship option to acquire real life hands on training. University of South Carolina Page 111 College of Arts & Sciences5 Electron Microscopy Center (Submitted students from UofSC Sumter (One of the students was a female minority student, Magellan Scholar and the other female student was a recipient of Palmetto College research grant) conducted summer 2021 research at the EM center and they were trained to run Scanning Electron Microscopes and were able to analyze research specimens under the microscope. English Language and Literature (Submitted by Susan Courtney , courtney@sc.edu, 777-7120) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: We have a couple of courses that meet experiential learning requirements, and each year we have a number of students with Magellan grants. We would like to develop more robust internship opportunities for our students. This will require adminis trative support as well as developing more courses that foster community engagement/service - learning opportunities, and we're hopeful that the college's Office of Undergraduate Studies can help us with this initiative. We'd also like to do more to publiciz e opportunities for student research and study abroad, and create opportunities within the college to augment university funding. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: Our English graduate students are highly visible and active across the country, presenting each year at the most important national conferences in their disciplines, speaking, chairing panels, and working at meetings of the Modern Language Association (MLA), the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), and the Association of of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP), as well as at smaller conferences and the annual Carolina Rhetoric conference that they run here in Columbia. This high level of activity within these scholarly organizations speaks to the caliber o f these students, but their efforts are also made possible by the department's commitment to funding graduate student travel. This is part of a concerted effort in recent years to provide our students with opportunities for professionalization. Departmenta l workshops and courses devoted to academic publishing, for instance, have also encouraged an increase in the number of students that publish academic work while in our program. In recent years our students have placed academic essays in edited collections and journals including PMLA, African American Review, Modern Fiction Studies, Nineteenth Century Studies, Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, Victorian Studies, the Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, the Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, and Philosophy and Rhetoric. Film and Media Studies (Submitted by Lauren Steimer , lsteimer@mailbox.sc.edu, 9496830702) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: The members of our faculty that are more production- oriented have disproportionately felt the difficulties of providing experiential learning opportunities during a pandemic as working with students beyond the classroom on their production assignments has been increasingly challenging as many organizations and entities do not want to interact with students right now. Our more studies -oriented faculty have created multiple ways for students to engage in experiential learning via coursework, particularly thr ough the facilitation of one of our core courses, FAMS 300 Film and Media History. Dr. Cooper helps maintain the Columbia Screens project (http://www.digitalussouth.org/columbiascreens/) which is a continually improving resource co - developed by students in FAMS 300 Film and Media History whereby students learn Columbia's University of South Carolina Page 112 College of Arts & Sciences6 media history by writing about it for the public. In addition to this, Dr. Wolf includes content that encourages students to pursue internship opportunities at UofSC's Moving Image Research Collections and facilitates field trips to local businesses as means of learning about how course content is directly related to real -world scenarios. She also routinely encourages students to attend outside events and exhibitions whose content and purpos e intersects with course materials. Members of the faculty are also in the early development stages of a Study Away in L.A. Program that will be linked with an interdisciplinary minor in Media Industries between Film and Media Studies and Media Arts. This kind of program plans on facilitating internships and providing students with hands -on experiences, field visits and opportunities for professional development. More broadly, faculty also encourage experiential learning outside the classroom. Dr. Maureen Ryan facilitated, in her role as Associate Director of the Humanities Collaborative, a Museum Learning program in partnership with the CMA (AY 2021- 22). Participating faculty from the School of Visual Art and Design, Physics, and elsewhere across the university bring their students to the CMA to access the collections for a variety of learning goals and outcomes, and 350 students in the program also have access to the CMA for a full year. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: The Film and Media Studi es does not currently have a graduate program and thus does not have the resources to foster experiential learning in this way. Geography (Submitted by Jerry Mitchell, mitchell@sc.edu , 8037770238) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: Geography majors must take GEOG 495, a capstone course that involves \"learning by doing\" by combining academic content with a community project. Our internship program remains active with twenty community partners including the SC Audubon Socie ty, Palmetto Cycling Coalition, and others. Our Study Abroad courses are still on hold due to COVID -19. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: Minimal in the past year. Field work and conference experiences were curtailed by COVID -19. We did take our new graduate student cohort out in the field for a welcome to South Carolina field study in August 2021. History (Submitted by Jessica Undergraduate Germany led a course with SCHC with History Outdoors, focused on the Palmetto Trail which was recognized for excellence.

Depending on the health situation, the course has planned the following experiential activities: 1. A cooking demonstration with an experienced chef of an Asian American cuisine; 2. Onsite visits to local Asian grocery stores and at least one restaurant; 3. A field trip to Charleston Tea Garden and Charleston Museum to explore South Carolina's Asian connections. Moreover, the instructor is c urrently exploring the possibility for the class to engage with local Asian communities, particularly the community of refugees from Burma, with the aim to learn how food and culinary practices help diasporic communities to preserve traditions Graduate Ex periential Learning Activities: Tourn\u00e9es French & Francophone Film Festival - annual event since 2008, now virtual, co- directed joint community and university French- language film festival, which screened 6 films virtually, followed by Zoom discussions & director Q&As.

She was awarded $6,000 from the UofSC Center for Integrated and Experiential Learning to pay the student interns a modest stipend of $500. each for their work. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: Through its three graduate assistantships, McKissick Museum offers extensive hands -on experience in collections and curatorial practices. While grad assistants are assigned specific areas based on their professional interests -one to collections; one to exhibitions; and one to the Folklife Resource Center -the team -based nature of the way small museums work ensures they gain experience in multiple dimensions of museum work.

Prof Dave Tedeschi's proposal was accepted by the CMA Pilot Program, \"Museum Learning,\" sponsored by the Humanities Col laborative. This grant provided each of gis students in Physics 153, Physics of the Visual Arts, a membership to the Columbia Museum of Art. Homework sets and laboratory exercises were tailored to use the CMA. The semester culminated with a physics art -show by the students.

Psychology (Submitted by Jessica Escorcia are three types of experiential learning activities available through the department; Independent Study (working in a research lab), Community Practicum (working with faculty in an applied setting), and Internship (working with a community partner). Approximately 250 students are enrolled in one of these three in a typical semester. Five years ago, the Department of Psych ology started an undergraduate internship program whereby students work with community partners for course credit. Until COVID, this program had been expanding every year from a starting point of one student at one internship site to 6 different sites and approximately 25 students. Obviously, COVID has hindered the continued development of this program, but we are confident that once COVID is over, we can continue to grow the program. We have added two new sites in 2021 and we have a faculty member assigned to finding and vetting new partners, as well as maintaining relationships with current sites. In addition, the multiple faculty hires allotted to the department in the last four years have increased the number of active research labs and thus the need for undergraduate lab assistants (Independent Study). As such, we have been able to offer more experiential learning experiences. However, the problem for us always involves the size of our major. We currently have over 1400 majors and each year we get more new majors. We simply do not have the capability to offer experiential learning activities to that number of majors, even with the increased expansion of the internship program. University of South Carolina Page 118 College of Arts & Sciences12 Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: Students in the Clinical- Community (CC) and School (SCH) concentrations of our Psychology Ph.D. program initially learn their clinical skills at our Psychological Services Center which provides hands-on training in assessing and counseling members of the community. Furthermore, we have developed many paid and unpaid externship opportunities with outside agencies, such as the SC Department of Juvenile Justice, the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center, LifeStance Health, North Central High School in Kershaw County, the Dickerson Children's Advocacy Center, Hall Psychiatric Institute (SCDMH), and several inpatient and outpatient clinics at Prisma Health, where advanced students receive additional applied training. Lastly, all students in the C -C and SCH programs are required to do thei r last year as a full -time clinical internship experience, usually at a nationally-accredited site outside of Columbia. All of these experiences provide our students with rich training outside the walls of academia and provide opportunities for them to practice clinical, consultation, and/or research skills in unique environments. Graduate students in the Quantitative and Cognitive and Neural Sciences concentrations of our Psychology Ph.D. program also have many hands-on experiences built into their curriculum. Depending on their research area, students may learn to operate EEGs, fMRI machines, eye-tracking equipment, rodent chambers, and other complex research equipment. The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly been a challenge for all face- to-face experiential learning environments. Another challenge we face is that paid clinical externship locations can be unstable due to their own funding situations and, while they may take our students for a few years, the placements are never guaranteed which introduces some instability in funding options for students. Furthermore, creating experiential learning courses which satisfy the graduate course enrollment requirement is challenging since we sometimes have small class cohorts and courses may be cancelled when fewer than eight students enroll. Lastly, many clinical training opportunities for our graduate students in CC and SCH involve serving extremely vulnerable populations and therefore require a great deal of training and supervision of students from Licensed Psychologists so that we meet ethical and best -practice standards.

In this class, students get hands -on experience conducting sociological research. They analyze General Social Survey data in Stata, collect and analyze in -depth interview data, write reports of their findings, and present their projects in a virtual research symposium. We also involved undergraduates in our research lab groups and research projects. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: All of our graduate students get hands on experience with research. We also supported our graduate students on a number of federally funded grants, as well as internally funded grants. South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology (Submitted by Adam King, aking@sc.edu, 803- 409-9777) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: In November SCIAA funded the attendance of 3 undergraduate students at the Southeastern Archaeological Conference where they attended papers, networked, and staffed a table promoting UofSC's anthropology graduate programs and SCIAA. In January SCIAA faculty took 13 anthropology undergraduates and two graduate students on a 3- day field trip to tour two famous archaeological sites and their museums as well as a museum exhibition on a third site in GA and AL. In January and February SCIAA hired 4 anthropology undergraduates as curation assistants and an assistant for the Maritime Research Division. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: In the summer, SCIAA hired Johnny Dodge (Anthro graduate student) as a lab assistant to gain ceramic analysis experience for his thesis. In November SCIAA funded the attendance of 2 graduate students at the Southeastern Archaeological Conference where they attended papers, networked, and staffed a table promoting UofSC's anthropology graduate programs and SCIAA. In January SCIAA faculty took 2 anthropology two graduate students on a 3 - day field trip to tour two famous archaeological sites and their museums as well as a museum exhibition on a third site in GA and AL.

Mindi is a Co -Investigator on this grant, which covers 10% of her salary (2020- 2025; Total = $1,689,633). Her role is to serve as the Professional Development Coordinator for the SC -ADAR Program, working directly with URM undergraduates from our partner HBCUs. The SHARE project certainly fits into this category too (please see above) University of South Carolina Page 120 College of Arts & Sciences14 Theatre and Dance (Submitted by Jim Hunter , hunter@sc.edu, 803- 777-1203) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: The nature of our artistic discipline means that the vast majority of our courses have an experiential component. Our department is committed to providing a learning environment that supports the development of real -world skills in a space that allows students to try, fail, and grow in their practical competencies. The skills learned in the classroom culminate in participation in our department productions . For undergraduates, this primarily takes the forms of dance concerts, student choreography showcases, productions in the Lab Theatre, and productions in our two mainstage spaces, Longstreet Theatre and Drayton Hall. The pandemic brought unique challenges to our field. Our work is physical and traditionally defined by its liveness and shared space. Working with the UofSC School of Public health, the department was able to develop and appropriate set of COVID -19 protocols that allowed us to begin live perf ormances again in February of 2021. Continuing with these safety measures, the department was able to mount a closer to normal slate of performances in both theatre and dance for our 2021 performance seasons. These productions include: Spring 2021 Dance UofSC Dance Spring Concert UofSC Dance presents Excavating Movement UofSC Student Choreography Showcase Spring 2021 Theatre The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) You on the Moors Now Fall 2021 Dance UofSC Fall Dance Concert UofSC Dance Virtual Gala UofSC Student Choreography Showcase Fall 2021 Theatre Constellations Rumors Scenes from Metamorphoses Tiny Beautiful Things Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: If experiential leaning is central to the undergraduate curriculum, and they become even more essential at the graduate level, particularly in pursuit of the terminal degree. Our graduate students continue to hone their skills through real -world projects and experiences through their classwor k, production involvement, and internships. Our graduate students were involved as leaders with all of the productions listed above in the undergraduate section. These students served as directors, designers and technicians. In addition, many of our graduate students participated in professional internship work this year. These students worked at professional theatrical organizations including the American Players Theatre in Wisconsin, the Kentucky Opera, and the Tuacahn Amphitheatre in Utah. Our MAT stu dents on teaching internships also dealt with changes happening in the K -12 teaching environment, which gave them a front row view to the challenges in teaching that have happened during the pandemic. Visual Art and Design, School of (Submitted by Laura Kissel , kissel@mailbox.sc.edu, 777- 4236) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: Undergraduate Students, Experiential Learning University of South Carolina Page 121 College of Arts & Sciences15 Many School of Visual Art and Design undergraduate courses and degree learning outcomes are designed around experiential learning. For example: Studio Art BFA students are expected to mount a public exhibition of their artwork in their senior year and complete an internship (graphic design); Media Arts students in advanced media production courses prepare a public screening of their work at the end of each semester; Art Education students create art lessons for the Young Artists' Workshop, a community based, public program. The SVAD also programs a yearly Visiting Artist and Scholar Series, which invites top scholars and artists to give talks, workshops, and critiques for students (all beyond- the-classroom opportunities). Media Arts screenwriting students ar e mentored in internships with Prof. Northrop Davis where they work on his future publications as co -authors and artists. Dr. Simon Tarr is active in experiential learning as Faculty Principal of Rhodos Fellows Learning Community for Information, Design and Computing, where he develops programs that immerse students of all majors into digital leadership using the Makerspace. In 2021 -22, new initiatives and advancements in experiential learning reported by faculty include: Amanda Wangwright, Advisor for GLD with the Center for Integrative and Experiential Learning, advises and reviews student e -portfolios; Andrew Graciano worke d with the new SVAD DEI Committee to obtain a grant to organize diversity themed charette event, which included a visiting artist and student activities; Stephanie Nace created a digital archive, historical traveling exhibit and website documenting The Fi rst-Year Reading Experience, a 20+ year project that involves working with students on posters and book covers that are published specifically for the University of South Carolina; and Lauren Steimer is exploring a Study Away program in Las Angeles as part of an interdisciplinary minor in Media Industries between Film and Media Studies and Media Arts. Many faculty utilize the cultural resources around Columbia to create beyond- the-classroom experiences for undergraduates; examples include: field trips to T he Statehouse grounds to study and reflect on its monuments (House, Brandt); funded memberships and the creation of a Museum Learning program in partnership with the CMA for students to experience art at a scholarly level (Chametzky and Ryan); explore the architecture of our own campus (Brandt); and an innovative scavenger hunt through the McKissick Museum exhibition Natural Curiosities (Burgess); numerous exhibitions of student work in a variety of venues such SVAD's Stormwater Gallery, online screenings for experimental films (Maur), online exhibitions of original student made video games (Ha), and other UofSC buildings such as the Thomas Cooper Library (Khalili and Nace). Other activities that create content for cultural organizations, such as wayfindin g signage for the Columbia Museum of Art collections (Khalili) and podcast episodes also for the CMA (Swartwood - House); augmented reality interactive posters for TypeHike National Park Poster Series in collaboration with TypeHike.com and the Thomas Cooper Rare Books Room; and conducting culturally relevant art activities for K -8 children in local underserved afterschool programs such as Boys & Girls Club and Ezekiel Center (Ivashkevich); Many faculty report integrating visiting artists, professional speakers, and distinguished critics into their classrooms and/or use professional speakers as a way to engage students beyond- the-classroom; examples include: The Graphic Design and Illustration faculty note 14 unique visiting artist experiences for studen ts, some part of the SVAD Visiting Artist and Scholar series, and some programmed as special opportunities for their BFA majors held online and at McKissick Museum; Lana Burgess utilized several UofSC grant opportunities (Themed Semester, SC Humanities, a nd DEI) to present a multi- discipline lecture on the Changing Cultural Climate of Museums collaboration by collaborating with the African American Studies Program, the Department of History, the Art History division of the School of Visual Art and Design, and the Columbia Museum of Art; Kathleen Robins invited Visiting Critic, Jackie Bates, Art Editor California Sunday Magazine to review student photography. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: Graduate Students, Experiential Learning The School of Visual Art and Design offers generous studio space and a well -equipped workshop for University of South Carolina Page 122 College of Arts & Sciences16 MFA students at the brand new 707 Catawba Street studios. SVAD provides state -of-the-art camera and VR technology for media arts students seeking to hone their production skills and produce MA thesis projects. There are ample campus and local exhibition/screening opportunities in the city of Columbia via the Nickelodeon Theater and the Columbia Museum of Art and the Center for Contemporary Art. SVAD developed and supports a competitive residency program in the summer months at Stormwater Studios for graduate students across the SVAD. This professional opportunity puts graduate students into direct contact with professional artists in Columbia, SC. All MFA students prepare an d mount a solo exhibition of art works in McMaster Gallery and present artist talks at the conclusion of their degree program. As part of curriculum in Art Education, majoring graduate students provided a series of art workshops at Hannah House (a transiti onal home for women and their children) and the Harriet Hancock Center (LGBT+ Center in a local community). These students curated, installed, and de -installed the artworks created by their workshop participants in two local galleries. Walker Institute of International and Area Studies (Submitted by Joshua Grace, gracejr@mailbox.sc.edu, 5178990979) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: Fall of 2021 marked the first time the Walker Institute fully welcomed majors into its mission through two majors The main challenge of this task comes from the transitions under way. CYBR is a new degree with a blossoming student culture while GLST is a mature degree with students still making the move into the institute. We anticipate having a much better str ucture in place for experiential learning next fall. This includes new internship opportunities in CYBR (including for course credit) and a more robust student mentoring structure for these opportunities within the institute for GLST majors. Graduate Expe riential Learning Activities: The institute is one of the only places on campus for graduate students to seek funding for international travel and research. Unfortunately, these programs were suspended due to the pandemic. Women's and Gender Studies (Submitted by Ed Madden, maddene@mailbox.sc.edu, 803- 777-4008) Undergraduate Experiential Learning Activities: The WGST Program requires each WGST major to complete WGST 499, an internship practicum, which requires 80 hours of service learning internship e xperience. In addition to this, we also offer a special honors section of our introductory course, WGST 112, taught by Dr. Mary Baskin Waters, in which students complete service learning hours in addition to other course requirements. In Fall 2021, Dr. Ed Madden taught ENGL 200, Creative Writing, Voice, and Community. The course included service -learning community engagement component in which students developed and implemented projects to incorporate literary arts into daily life. Our faculty also routinel y incorporate undergraduate students into research activities, oversee undergraduate senior honors thesis projects, and offer independent study opportunities. Undergraduate students are also appointed to our Partnership Council, a consortium of local non- profit and community organizations that work together to improve the status of women in South Carolina. The WWBI Program creates ongoing opportunities for faculty and student engagement in experiential learning. Our greatest challenge in this area is facul ty coverage. WGST 499 is limited at present to majors. Because of requests from minors and nonmajors seeking experiential learning, we created WGST 299, specifically targeting nonmajors, but at present we do not have the faculty- staff coverage University of South Carolina Page 123 College of Arts & Sciences17 that would a llow us to offer this course. Graduate Experiential Learning Activities: The WGST Program regularly employs graduate students to serve in service learning positions as Women's Well -Being Initiative Graduate Interns. In their roles as WWBI GAs, graduate stu dents engage in community, arts -based and mentorship programs for homeless women and at -risk youth as well as juvenile justice arbitration for adolescent girls involved with the juvenile justice system. Graduate students are also appointed to our Partnersh ip Council, a consortium of local non- profit and community organizations that work together to improve the status of women in South Carolina. The WGST Program offered a Social Media Training through Auburn Seminary for WGST students and faculty on February 28, 2022. The training focused on professional use of social media and the promotion of social justice. University of South Carolina Page 124 College of Arts & SciencesAppendix A.

The main challenge is the avaliability of funding for faculty working on long-form scholarship and creative endeavors. With the elimination of Provost Grants several years ago, the department lost a vital resource from which many of us had benefitted to produce work that increased the University of South Carolina Page 165 College of Arts & Sciences38 department's national & international visibility.

The numbers in relevant categories are as follows: 5 books + 1 poetry chapbook + 1 paperback edition of recently published hardback book (presses are Cambridge, Oxford, Routledge, among others) 18 journal articles (14 single-authored; 4 co-authored) 11 short creative pieces (1 story, 8 poems, 2 memoir) 2 creative performances (1 national, 1 local) 10 new book chapters (7 single-authored, 3 co-authored) + 1 reprint of jour nal article in book 4 academic journals + 1 creative magazine edited by department faculty; 2 academic journals + 1 creative magazine where one of our faculty members has major editorial responsibility; 1 faculty member is officer of a major national schol arly editorial organization 3 book reviews Books Amadon, Samuel.

Film and Media Studies (Submitted by Lauren Steimer , lsteimer@mailbox.sc.edu, 949-683-0702) During the academic year 2021-2022, the faculty of the Film and Media Studies program produced a variety of scholarly and creative output across multiple media outlets from journals, edited volumes and reviews to interviews, guest lectures, and work on a documentary feature. In terms of the scholarly work, there was one article published in a peer- reviewed journal, five chapt ers published in edited volumes released by university presses, one co-edited volume developed for publishing, one review, one interview, and three guest lectures and presentations. In terms of the creative output, one faculty member worked as part of the cinematography crew for the well- regarded documentary feature film On These Grounds (Zevgetis, 2021). The breadth of the scholarly and creative work produced by the faculty engages in multiple research methodologies and approaches and demonstrates the program's ongoing commitment to the discipline's attention to socio-cultural, political, aesthetic, and industrial concerns. In addition, the faculty engage also in the kinds of public- facing work that instrumentalizes their expertise to promote socially progr essive causes while also building the profile of both the program and the university in meaningful ways.

McKissick Museum (Submitted by Jane Przybysz, jprzybys@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-7251) In the context of cataloging and digitizing McKissick' s historic shell collection (part of the larger Historic Southern Naturalists project), research conducted by Christian Cicimurri confirmed that this collection. Collection was amassed by 19th century naturalist Lewis Reeves Gibbes. Prior to this, it was believed that this collection of mostly snail and clam shells had been donated by noted amateur Charleston conchologist, William G. Mazyck, who was a cousin of and mentor to Lewis Reeves Gibbes. After Gibbes ' death in 1894, his daughters sold the collection of more than 4300 shells to the university and Mazyck organized and identified the specimens. These research findings were presented in the Shell Game exhibit curated by University of South Carolina Page 208 College of Arts & Sciences81 Cicimurri, June 28, 2021-March 5, 2022. With the departure of Folklife Curator Saddler Taylor in February 2021, Jane Przybysz continued the research/fieldwork in support of the development and implementation of the Carolina Knives: The Roots of a Revival exhibition, July 19-December 20, 2021. In fall 2021, faculty curator Lana Burgess co-curated with Brent Dedas the presentation of Hyphenated-an exhibit of work by two SVAD visiting artists- Dan Hernandez and Arturo Rodriguez-on view from September 9 to October 28, 2021. She subsequently conducted the research for the exhibit titled The Artists Inside Outsider Art, November 8, 2021-March 5, 2022. Giordano Angeletti, supported by fieldwork conducted by curated an exhibit by photographer Brett Schenning titled Inheritance: Sustainable Farms in the South, January 10-July 15, 2022. This exhibit was planned to support the Climate Ready Columbia conference that faculty member Matt Kisner has planned for spring 2022 to showcase, in part, the outcome(s) of the climate themed fall 2021 semester. Przybysz wrote an introduction for The Words and Wares of David Drake, a book being published by USC Press in 2022 to coincide with the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's first exhibition of 19 th-century, South Carolina stoneware made by African American. The introduction surveys and summarizes the scholarship on the enslaved potter and poet David Drake since the publication of the catalog that accompanied McKissick 's retrospective of Drake 's work in 1998.

As such, Psychology Faculty members have secured over 7 million dollars in University of South Carolina Page 218 College of Arts & Sciences91 external funding which is a sign of the continuously robust research activity in our department. This year was marked with exceptional accomplishments by our junior faculty and postdocs who received many training grants. Dr. Guillermo Wippold, an Assistant Professor who started with us in 2018, received his first NIH K23 award entitled, Developing a Community-Informed, Peer- to-Peer Intervention to Improve Health- Related Quality of Life among African American Men (2021-2026), under the mentorship of Dr. Dawn Wilson. Postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Stefan ia Conte, was awarded an NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award for her work examining brain activity in infants using electroencephalography with mentorship by Dr. John Richards. Similarly, Dr. Elizabeth Will was awarded an NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award for her project entitled Early Developmental Determinants and Pathways in Down syndrome with primary mentorship provided by Dr. Jane Roberts. In addition, our faculty members have been resourceful in seeking out funding from smaller organizations. For example, Dr. Kimberly Becker was awarded $100,000 from the Esther A. & Joseph Klingenstein Fund for her project entitled Scaling Early Detection and Personalized, Evidence-Based Solutions to Treatment Access: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Online Risk Assessment and Intervention System. Similarly, Dr. Jessica Bradshaw was awarded $250,000 by the James S. McDonnell Foundation for her work which aims to quantify infant behaviors that lead to ASD (2021-2025). Most recently, Dr. Elizabeth Will has recently been awarded $49,592 by the Jerome Lejeune Foundation for her work on Symptom Progression and Diagnostic Stability of Autism in Children with Down syndrome (2022-2024). The Psychology Department also encourages our faculty members to pursue internal awards and we are delighted that Dr. Meeta Banerjee was awarded $15,000 by the VP of Research for her proposal entitled An exploration into conte xtual factors and career -related trajectories regarding persistence in STEM fields: A study based on the experiences of women and underrepresented minorities. Similarly, Dr. Dawn Wilson was awarded $15,000 for her proposal entitled Integrating Cultural As sets & Family Resilience to Address Health Behaviors & Race- Related Stressors Among African American Families. In addition to promoting a strong record of grantsmanship, departmental faculty engaged with the academic community to disseminate their work. O ver the past year, faculty have published over 200 publications (listed below), as well as presented research findings at numerous conferences and symposia. Further, Dr. Rorden, in collaboration with Dr. Fridriksson (COMD) secured two patents on using machine learning to identify locations of brain injury (patent numbers 10916348 and 17141436), while Drs. Gao, Shinkareva, and Desai launched the South CarOlina Psycholinguistic MEtabase (SCOPE), a curated collection of psycholinguistic properties of words fro m major databases. Such scholarly activity is supported by Dr. Dawn Wilson, the Director of Research and head of our research committee, who is dedicated to mentorship and provides pre-award support, establishing resources, receiving recognition, and mot ivating faculty to reach their research goals. One of our greatest challenges is the fact that faculty members must balance research with handling a 2:2 teaching load and meeting service requirements.

This year we had three faculty who were selected, one for PROPEL (Doering- White) and two for STAR (Feliciano -Santos and K. Simmons). All three are are jointly appointed faculty (Social Work, Linguistics, and the IAASR). Two additional faculty members, one Assistant and the other Associate Professor participated in the CAS Junior and Mid- Career Faculty Development Programs. Faculty have earned or in the process of completing the following CTE Certificates: Teaching Towards Inclusive Excellence (3); CTE Fostering Proac tive Learning Environment (2): Diversity and Inclusion Academy Certificate (1); Mental Health and Well Being Competency (1).

University of South Carolina Page 253 College of Arts & Sciences2 Biological Sciences (Submitted by Tammi Richardson, richardson@biol.sc.edu, 8037776389) Faculty development efforts in the past have focused on: 1) improved mentorship of junior faculty; 2) increased awareness of all faculty with respect to issues related to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI); 3) continuing communication and efforts towards establishing a 'normal routine' in light of the seemingly never ending Covid- 19 pandemic. With respect to mentoring, several research groups have initiated grant review/presentation panels or seminars where research proposal aims are presented and critiqued. These have proven useful for both junior and senior faculty, and in terms of crafting c ompetitive grants. We continue to work towards providing opportunities for professional development for our non- tenure track faculty, including the development of clear guidelines for promotion. Our seminar series has returned to being in- person, but we a lso provide a virtual option for those uncomfortable with attending in person.

The museum also supported her participation in the Southeastern Museums Conference, where she served as the moderator for the \"Studen Work in Museums\" session. McKissick supports other members of the curatorial team pursuing diverse kinds of professional development opportunities. For example, the museum supports registrar Mark Smith playing a leadership role in SCFM -the South Carolina Federation of Museums. Over the past year, as McK issick was revising/updating its disaster preparedness plan, the museum supported collections staff participating in webinars specifically focused on current best practices in this arena. Curator of Collections Christian Cicimurri took the initiative to se cure grant funds to engage a professional textile conservator to provide staff and student with a series of hands -on workshops to better steward McKissick's substantial textile collection. University of South Carolina Page 257 College of Arts & Sciences6 Philosophy (Submitted by Chris Tollefsen , Christopher.Tollefsen@gmail.com , 609- 865-7272) As noted above, junior faculty and faculty in post tenure review development plans are assigned a mentor. In Fall 2021, a course release funded by the Ann Johnson Institute for Science and Technology Studies (AJI) enabled Agnes Bolinska to expand her research into a new area. She connected with structural biologists in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and on this basis developed an ASPIRE -I research proposal (submitted in January 2022). Throughout the semester, s he met bi -weekly with Leah McClimans, who mentored her through different stages of this process. Physics and Astronomy (Submitted by Beth Powell , mepowell@mailbox.sc.edu, 777- 8104) The department provides support for some faculty to attend conferences and workshops as needed (although most such funding is expected to come from external sources). Senior faculty are generally involved in advising junior faculty within their research groups. New faculty are assigned faculty mentors for guid ance Some faculty are involved in university- level mentorship, such as the Propel Research Mentor program (from the Office of the Vice President for research) Political Science (Submitted by Kirk Randazzo, randazzo@mailbox.sc.edu, 803- 777-3109 ) Our faculty development efforts focus primarily on junior faculty. We pair all assistant professors with a more senior individual in their field, to provide mentoring throughout their time at UofSC, until they achieve tenure and promotion to Associate Professor. Additionally, the department encourages all faculty, regardless of rank, to participate in the various development programs offered by the College. Psychology (Submitted by Jessica Escorcia , escorcia@email.sc.edu , 803- 576-6798 ) The Psychology Department supports the professional growth of faculty members by ensuring that all members are supported at different levels based on their unique needs. For example, Dr. Nada Goodrum, one of our newest Assistant Professors, is currently enrolled in the National C enter for Faculty Development and Diversity Success Program. This program teaches faculty members the strategic planning skills to achieve writing and research productivity while maintaining a healthy life on and off campus. More broadly, a leadership re treat was established this January of 2022 in which the Executive Committee, comprised of elected leaders from all primary facets of the department, conducted a self -assessment of their leadership profile and were presented with the benefits of a strengths -based leadership model and the development of strategic planning led by an executive coach. To support our Junior faculty, they are paired with senior faculty members who serve as mentors for both research productivity and pedagogical guidance. We have recently established a Departmental Director of Research who coordinates the research support in the department, and we are working with the college to bolster pre -award support for all faculty members. The Psychology Department also supports faculty sabbaticals which allows faculty to achieve personal goals which could not be reached University of South Carolina Page 258 College of Arts & Sciences7 under the demands of regular university duties. From Fall 2021 to Spring 2022, 3 faculty members have taken a sabbatical. When the COVID pandemic arose in Spring of 2020, f aculty members helped one another transition to online teaching and the more technologically adept professors provided substantial guidance to the rest of the department. The Psychology Department also supports the personal development of faculty members by raising awareness of mental health issues and supporting faculty members when they have personal or family needs come up. We have built a cohesive team that is intentional about our focus on collaboration and camaraderie. For example, we hosted socia lly distanced picnics on the horseshoe, lunch get -togethers on the patio of Barnwell, and several social events to help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness during the pandemic. We also provide funds to support faculty and graduate students to at tend conferences for their professional development.

Theatre and Dance (Submitted by Jim Hunter , hunter@sc.edu, 803- 777-1203) Our department has a longstanding tradition of encouraging and supporting the professional development of our faculty. We believe that the continuous professional development of our faculty is essential to the servi ces that we offer to our students. Our field is always changing and working with new forms and technologies. To make our students ready for future careers in this field, our faculty must continue to grow in their personal competencies and make the connecti ons that can benefit our University of South Carolina Page 259 College of Arts & Sciences8 students. As a result, we are committed to supporting our faculty's professional pursuits and work with them to allow them to further continue their professional work. In many cases, this has brought incredible opportunity to our students. In our graduate program, students are often able to accompany their supervisors to work at professional theatres across the country, providing them with networking opportunities and professional experiences at top theatres. In other cases, facult y development experiences have led to collaborations with exceptional guest artists from around the world with our students in Columbia. It has even led to the development of a new theatre space and a collaboration with a world -renowned Shakespeare company. In addition, professional memberships, certifications, and courses have directly benefitted our students in the classroom where they are given insight into our industry and taught the latest techniques and developments in the field. Visual Art and Design, School of (Submitted by Laura Kissel , kissel@mailbox.sc.edu, 777- 4236) During 2021 many SVAD faculty have been occupied with professional development opportunities and have been participants in international and national conferences.

Walker Institute of International and Area Studies (Submitted by Joshua Grace, gracejr@mailbox.sc.edu, 5178990979) Though the institute does not have faculty of its own, it has traditionally supported faculty by supporting international research and travel. It has been unable to do so for much of this year due to the pandemic. University of South Carolina Page 260 College of Arts & Sciences9 In this context, the institute sought new ways to support its faculty. Foremost among this was a new event category which brings guest spea kers directly to students in classrooms. The idea here was to support faculty as they shifted teaching modalities and to expose students to the authors whom they read. Additionally, the institute supported an interdisciplinary working group aimed at creati ng synergy among Walker Institute faculty and graduate students. The working group in Decolonization and Culture is doing just this. Women's and Gender Studies (Submitted by Ed Madden, maddene@mailbox.sc.edu, 803- 777-4008) Each year, all WGST core and teaching faculty receive professional development funding to support travel to conferences and other professional development expenses. (See list of conference presentations in Research and Scholarly Activity above.) The WGST P rogram offers WGST Faculty Affiliate opportunities to any UofSC faculty who wish to affiliate and who are conducting research, teaching, and/or service related to the goals and mission of the WGST Program. Each year, the WGST program offers three faculty t eaching and research awards: the The Josephine Abney Faculty Fellowship Award ($5,000) for research, the Carol Jones Carlisle Faculty Award ($1,000) for research, and the Women's and Gender Studies Teaching Award (1,000) for teaching. The WGST Program sponsors and co- sponsors 10- 20 educational events (focusing on research, teaching, and/or service) that are open to faculty attendance for professional development each year. The WGST Program is an institutional sponsor of the Duke Feminist Theory Workshop and invites USC WGST faculty and graduate students to attend. Each March, the Feminist Theory Workshop provides seminars and keynote lectures to develop an diverse and interdisciplinary community of scholars. In 2021, one WGST faculty member attended virtually. In 2022, two WGST faculty and one graduate student will attend. The WGST Program encourages faculty involvement in university, professional and community service as well as trainings.

We also have have updated the conditions of a gift to support a UG essay contest that offers $100 prize for the next four years. This past year, the department received a major gift $50 ,000 from the Eberhardt family in memory of their son. We suspect that this is a one -time gift given that his parents wanted to invest his death benefit money into his passion for anthropological archaeology. The Department will be honoring their son in the next ANTH ANNUAL newsletter and do something in his honor when celebrating the Department's 50th anniversary, at which time we will invite his parents to attend. The Department Chair and new Administrative Assistant met with the new Development Team in CAS and brainstormed some ideas which were later presented at the first spring faculty meeting.

This is the first time these organizations have partnered on such an effort and the first time such a deal is being struck in the state. This requires us all to go through a yearlong training program with World Resources Institute. Lori pitched this to the City Council who approved the city to join, and she then brought the others to the table. Lori is no longer the chair of the city committee, but she continues to lead this effort. Ziolkowski also led the development, writing and submission of a DOE C -Leap grant in December 2021. If the initiative is funded the award will be through the state energy office (not the University of South Carolina). English Language and Literature (Submitted by Susan Courtney , courtney@sc.edu, 777-7120) Community Engagement Activities: The English department organizes and co- organizes the two most visible literary events on campus each year: The Open Book each spring, funded by the College of Arts and Sciences and organized by English Professor Elise Blackwell; and the Fall Literary Festival each October, directed by English Professor Jim Barilla and organized in collaboration with University Libraries. These series bring internationally renowned authors to campus to read their work and interact with large audiences of students, faculty, and the larger Midlands community in events that are free and open to the public. In 2021, the Fall Literary Festival welcomed audiences via Zoom over the course of three consecutive Wednesdays to listen to readings by and ask questions of: Jacqueline Woodson, a Newbery Honor - winning children's and young adult book author who was recently named a MacArthur Fellow and received the Hans Christian Anderson Award in recognition of lifelong achievement and lasting contribution to children's literature. Robyn Sc hiff, the author of three poetry collections, including, A Woman of Property--a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, named a best book of the year by The New Yorker and the Chicago Tribune and selected as an Editors' Choice at The New York Times. And Aminatta Forna, whose fiction has won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best Book Award and the PEN Hurston/Wright Legacy Award, and has been short -listed for the Neustadt Prize, the Orange Prize for Fiction, the IMPAC Award, and the Warwick Prize. Although The Open Book was canceled due to Covid- 19 in 2020 and 2021, it will return to campus immediately after spring break for eight evenings across four consecutive weeks, featuring a diverse and highly acclaimed group of authors: Ruth Ozeki, a novelist, filmmaker, and Zen Buddhist priest whose books have garnered international acclaim for their ability to integrate issues of science, technology, religion, environmental politics, and global pop culture into unique, hybrid, narrative forms. Edwidge Danticat , an internationally acclaimed and bestselling author of more than twelve books, whose collection Everything Inside won the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Story Prize, and the 2020 Vilcek Prize in Literature and was named a Best Book of 2019 by NP R, Time, and Esquire. Paul Muldoon is an Irish poet, editor, playwright, lyricist and translator, whose many awards include the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the European Prize for Poetry. Emily St. John Mandel is the author of five novels. Her newest book, The Glass Hotel, was selected by former President Barack Obama as one of his favorite books of 2020, was shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize, and has been translated into more than twenty languages. NPR declared it \"a masterpiece,\" and it was named one of University of South Carolina Page 293 College of Arts & Sciences5 the best books of the year by such wide -ranging places as the New Yorker, Time, Elle, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, the Economist, and the BBC. In addition to the department's support of these major events, our MFA program sponsors Shark's Parlor, an ongoing series of live readings that features visiting writers as well as our MFA graduate students and faculty. After being paused for COVID, Shark's Parlor resumed this year. Our faculty are also continually engaged in a variety of community activit ies. They routinely present public lectures and readings, serve on boards and panels, volunteer at local cultural institutions, and more. Below are some of those activities from the last year: Sam Amadon & Liz Countrman, Founding Editors, Oversound, a literary magazine with a national audience.

North American Computational Linguistics 803- Presented at CoMInDS Conference: The workshop of greatest added value to my role with GSI teacher education came from my work with the College Mathematics Instructor Development Source (CoMInDS) workshop at the University of Maine. At the CoMInDS workshop, Sean collaborated with professor s from all over the country who are attempting to also transition their Mathematics Department to improve undergraduate mathematics education by working with TAs and GSIs. Sean was able to bring specific pedagogical resources back to improve my mathematics pedagogy courses, but also understand the current national climate on undergraduate mathematics education. CoMInDS provided a larger understanding of the national culture and tensions inherent with improving mathematics undergraduate teacher education. Moreover, it has provided him with future grant collaborators whose universities are striving for the same improvement in their own teaching and undergraduate mathematics education. Doug Meade, Sean Yee, Jennifer Crooks Monastra all participated in SEMINAL community outreach. We have been asked to be a Phase III Partner to the current NSF Student Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning (SEMINAL) Grant.

For approximately one year (April 2020 to April 2021), the observatory participated in live -streamed stargazing via the Facebook platform. Our department now has a very active group of student volunteers who assists our observatory director with setting up telescopes, managing crowds while handling COVID -19 safety protocols, and allowing guests of all ages to enjoy stargazing in a wide variety of ways. This past December (2021), the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the UofSC School of Music held a collaborative event at the Melton Memorial Observatory entitled, \"Ears Wide Open.\" The event featured a flute quartet (\"Duende\") from the School of Music and attracted a crowd of over 100 guests. Additional details regarding the ongoing program can be found via this website. The Department of Physics and Astronomy regularly host departmental colloquia, which feature talks from renowned scientists across the globe. Colloquia remain in a virtual format for the t ime being. They are open to the public. For the second consecutive year, our annual Midway Physics Day event at the South Carolina State Fair was canceled in 2021 due to COVID -19 concerns. We hope to resume this event in 2022. Political Science (Submitted by Kirk Randazzo, randazzo@mailbox.sc.edu, 803- 777-3109 ) Community Engagement Activities: Our faculty frequently engage the community. These activities include providing media interviews (across all print and broadcast platforms), conducting wor kshops and training sessions, and offering public presentations. Psychology (Submitted by Jessica Escorcia , escorcia@email.sc.edu , 803- 576-6798 ) Community Engagement Activities: Research Labs in the Psychology Department often engage with the community extensively. For example, the Early Social Development and Intervention Lab of Dr. Jessica Bradshaw started a program that provides free childcare for families who are involved in our research. It's called the \"Research Empowering Families Club\" and it takes place about 1x monthly. Parents drop off their children at our lab and can take the morning off. We see on average about 5- 8 University of South Carolina Page 299 College of Arts & Sciences11 kids (or 2- 3 families) per meeting, which includes kids with autism. These kids also have the opportunity to engage with their peers and practice social skills. Their lab also started a mindfulness group for parents of children with autism. This 6- week group is free and open to the community. We started our first group 4 weeks ago which includes 3 parents. We're looking at starting another group in a couple of weeks. This group incorporates mindfulness practices, values based living, and self-compassion practices to support parents' wellbeing. They've par tnered with SC Department of Disabilities and Special Needs to help provide trainings to their early interventionists. Dr. Bradshaw facilitated a training last year and about 90 early interventionists attended on 8/21/21. Lastly, Dr. Bradshaw gave a talk/ webinar for Richland Library You Are Not Alone: BRAIN Matters series on 2/19 and approximately 15 people participated. Dr. Sayward Harrison (Healthy Futures Lab) works closely with community partners across South Carolina to reduce disparities in infectious disease (e.g., Covid- 19, HIV, HPV) in vulnerable communities. Since 2019, she has worked with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, the South Carolina Immunization Coalition, and the South Carolina Adolescent Immunization T ask Force to increase vaccination rates across SC. This includes working closely with community leaders and partners. As one example, Dr. Harrison has partnered with school nurses in Cherokee County to disseminate information and resources on vaccination t o families in rural areas of Cherokee County. This project has involved partnering together to develop flyers, handouts, and a social media messaging campaign to alert families to the importance of vaccination, as well as providing additional training to s chool nurses on vaccination promotion. On February 21, 2022, Dr. Harrison helped to lead a \"Virtual Town Hall\" for the Cherokee County community to provide education and dispel myths about vaccination. This event was live streamed via multiple social media platforms in the community and was viewed 544 times in the first three days following the event! They will be hosting a mobile vaccination van in March, 2022, to bring vaccines to rural community members who have difficulty accessing vaccinations via tra ditional healthcare sites. More generally, the Psychology Department engages undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in several forms of community outreach: consulting, collaboration, health promotion, organizational capacity building, prevention, s ervice learning, and action research. The type, scope, and length of these community -engaged projects varies by activity; however, each project generates research findings and simultaneous community benefit in collaboration with community members. The Department operates the Psychology Services Center that provides training and workshops to local service providers and sees over 180 clients a year. We have worked with local school districts (Fairfield, Richland 1 and 2, Lexington 5, Kershaw) to provide mentoring for students struggling academically (Hills, Kornbluh, McQuillin), health promotion and positive youth development (Zarrett), school assessment (Decker, Hills) and school behavioral health resources (Becker, Hills, Flory, Kloos, Weist). We support loc al agencies capacity in providing services, such as the UNUMB Center (Bradshaw) who serve families whose children have been diagnosed with autism. We provide extensive training in treatment services for over 200 parents with substance abuse problems conduc ted at LRADAC (Prinz). Faculty and students have provided evaluation and program development consultation with several organizations addressing food insecurity (Kornbluh) and homelessness (Kloos) in the greater Columbia area including the Columbia Food Pol icy Council,Transitions, Homeless No More, and the United Way of the Midlands. We have partnered with PRISMA and the WBJ Dorn VA to provide integrated psychological services to address sickle cell disease (Schatz), diabetes (Wilson), HIV, and internal med icine (Burnette, Harrison). While most of our community partnerships are in the greater Columbia area, we have had recent projects in Aiken, Fairfield, Florence, Kershaw, Lexington, Marlboro, Orangeburg, Richland, University of South Carolina Page 300 College of Arts & Sciences12 Sumter, and Waccamaw counties. Our faculty also engage with regional-focused organizations. For example, four faculty are consulting with the United Way of the Midlands to assess community needs and to inform their new strategic plan for community investment in the six Midlands counties (Banerjee, Kloos, Martin, and Zarrett). Faculty have worked to promote the organizational capacity of organizations across South Carolina, such the SC Free Clinic Association, a network of 41 free medical clinics across 25 counties in SC, and the SC Community Health Worker Association (Wippold), consultation on family engagement and mental health workforce development with the Santee- Wateree and Pee Dee Community Mental Health Centers (Becker) and with the PeeDee Resiliency Project (Weist).The USC School Behavioral H ealth Team (Weist) has partnered with Children's Trust of South Carolina and the South Carolina Department of Mental Health to build resilience among children contending with trauma and poverty in Florence and Marlboro counties of South Carolina. Furtherm ore, the USC School Behavioral Health Team has worked to organize the Southeastern School Behavioral Health Community (SSBHC) comprised of state and local policy makers, educators, mental health staff, higher education professionals, graduate students, administrative staff and advocates in the southeastern region of the U.S. who collaborate to improve school behavioral health outcomes for students in the region.

This program is composed of faculty from across the University of South Carolina and includes departments from the School of Medicine, the College of Ar ts and Sciences and the School of Public Health. Students in this program take a common core curriculum in the first year of the Ph.D. The students subsequently select a mentor and join one of the participating departments. o Faculty have a number of joint r esearch grants with faculty in Public Health, the Medical School and Engineering. External Collaborations: o Faculty regularly publish research papers with experts at other Universities in the USA and around the world. o Professors Sutton and Vannucci have joint grants with researchers at other Universities. Criminology and Criminal Justice (Submitted by Brandon Applegate , applegate@sc.edu, 803- 777-7065) Internal Collaborations: Faculty conducted research collaboratively within the department and with six other departments/schools/colleges at UofSC. Twelve published journal articles involved collaborations among UofSC faculty and students. External Collaborations: Faculty conducted research collaboratively with scholars from 48 other academic institutio ns (nationally and internationally). University of South Carolina Page 322 College of Arts & Sciences16 Earth, Ocean and Environment, School of (Submitted by Alicia Wilson , awilson@seoe.sc.edu , 7-1240) Internal Collaborations: The SEOE is inherently multidisciplinary, with many collaborations baked into our structure in the form of joint appointments with Geography, Biology, Anthropology, and Political Science. Our MSCI degree programs have regularly attracted collaboration from Biology, and our MEERM degree involves faculty from Geography and the Arnold School of Public Health (ASPH). Prior larger collaborations with Civil Engineering, ASPH, and the Moore School persist in course requirements and cross listed courses. We hope to revitalize these collaborations and a now lapsed collaboration with the Law School in the future. We are currently working with SVAD to identify possible research collaborations in the area of art and the environment. We have multiple collaborations with in the SEOE itself, including work on environmental justice (Barra, Hardy); Aleutian volcanic processes (Yogodzinski, Bizimis), nitrogen cycling in salt marshes (Bourbonnais, Peng), coastal sediment transport (Torres, Yankovsky), physical oceanography of t he continental shelf (Voulgaris, Yankovsky), sources of iron to the coastal ocean (Leier, Barbeau), nitrogen and stormwater (Bourbonnais, Smith [Baruch]), groundwater -mediated nitrogen delivery to continental shelf ecosystems (Pinckney, Lang, Wilson), and several others. Additional collaborations reach outside the SEOE, including o Arnold Sch of Public Health: Mufaro Kanyangarara, Mohamed Baalusha o o Ioannis Rekleitis, John Regalbuto o Sch of Business: Tamara Sheldon o SVAD: Sara Schneckloth o SCIAA: John Fisher, SCIAA, Castle Pinckney Field School, Charleston Harbor o School of Education: Muller o School of Law: Shelley Welton o Civil Engineering: Enrica Viparelli Two faculty stand out for regular colla borations. Dr. Erik Smith, in his role as the Research Coordinator and now Director of the North Inlet -Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, has collaborated widely with SEOE faculty. His expertise in unlocking SC SeaGrant funding has been partic ularly valuable, with including Drs. Benitez -Nelson (nutrient budgets), Wilson (groundwater hydrology), and now Bourbonnais (nitrogen cycling). Dr. Alicia Wilson worked on collaborations with a wide range of internal colleagues, ranging from chemical oceanographers (Moore, Lang), phytoplankton ecologists (Pinckney), groundwater and climate in low -lying coastal areas (Dow [Geography]), and educational outreach (Dr. Toni Williams [College of Education]). We estimate a total of more than 30 inter nal collaborations. External Collaborations: External Collaborations include participation in such research programs as the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long- Term Ecological Research Site (GCE -LTER) and the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado. We estimate more than 190 individual collaborators from external organizations in 2021. Two of our faculty are particularly notable for their external collaborations, including Dr. Subramanyam Bulusu. In addition to a publication rate averaging 4.5 papers per year, most with multiple external collaborators, Dr. Bulusu's importance to the broa der scientific community is amply demonstrated by his inclusion as a collaborator or member of national and international satellite science teams including no University of South Carolina Page 323 College of Arts & Sciences17 fewer than six NASA teams, (TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason- 1 Altimetry Missions, the Aquarius Salinity Mission, Group for High -Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST), the NASA Ocean Color Team, and NASA's Surface Ocean Water Topography Mission) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission. In addition to this extensiv e work, he served on the U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Phenomena Observations and Synthesis Panel (POS) from 2013 - 2015 and as an Advisory Board member for the Gulf Research Program, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine from 2018- 2020. He currently serves on the US IIOE -2 steering committee (2017 -present). Dr. Susan Lang is also notable for a large number of external collaborators among her six funded projects (two as lead -PI, four as co -PI) and four publications last year, as well as her role as Chief Scientists for a major research cruise funded by the Int ernational Ocean Discovery Program in 2018, from which many research results are still coming out. We also want to highlight the activities of Dr. Lori Ziolkowski in her efforts working with the City of Columbia. She is leading an effort for the city, Uof SC, Richland One, Columbia Housing, and Richland County to build a large scale solar installation through a custom deal with Dominion. This is the first time these organizations have partnered on such an effort and the first time such a deal is being struc k in the state. This requires us all going through a yearlong training program with World Resources Institute. She pitched this to council. They said yes and approved the city to join, and she brought the others to the table. While she is no longer chair of the city committee, she continues to lead this effort. Also, based on her initiative, the city wrote and submitted a DOE C -Leap grant last December. This award will be funneled through the state energy office.

English Language and Literature (Submitted by Susan Courtney , courtney@sc.edu, 777-7120) Internal Collaborations: We count at least 12 internal collaborative activities in the department at present. The three most impactful are the Humanities Collaborative, the Open Book writers' series each spring, and the annual Fall Literary Festival. Each is run by a faculty membe r in English. The Humanities Collaborative is led by Professor Holly Crocker and it facilitates a wide range of collaborations within the college, partly by funding cross -disciplinary Working Groups that several of our faculty are participating in. (This c ollaboration actually goes beyond the college to the university at large and the national community of scholars, since Crocker brings in speakers from other institutions.) The Open Book is a longstanding series, funded by the College of Arts and Sciences ( which has extended support for the 2022- 2023 academic year) and run by Professor Elise Blackwell. It involves her collaborating with and bringing to campus international -and internationally renowned -writers of stature, including (this spring) Ruth Ozeki, E dwidge Danticat, Paul Muldoon, and Emily St. John Mandel. The Fall Festival has been organized on the English side by Jim Barilla for close to a decade in collaboration with University Libraries. It, too, brings to campus each year a group of international ly renowned authors (this past fall, Jacqueline Woodson, Robyn Schiff, and Aminatta Forna). Also within is collaborating with faculty in ENGL, AFAM, MART, and University Libraries, and also at UofSC Sumter, on a Comics Studies Working Group. Eli Jelly-University of South Carolina Page 324 College of Arts & Sciences18 Schapiro was awarded funding from the Walker Institute for a Working Group on Decolonization and Culture; the group includes faculty and graduate students from LLC, English, and History. Our faculty and graduate students are also l eading and engaged in several working groups supported by the Humanities Collaborative, including the Conflict & Culture group (Stan Dubinsky, Mike Gavin, Gareth Rees -White, and Jelly- Schapiro, John Muckelbauer, Rebecca Stern). Gavin and Dubinsky also collaborate on two major digital humanities projects: the Language Conflict Project and Wordification. Elaine Chun, Scott Gwara, and Qiana Whitted are also collaborating on research projects with other faculty on campus. External Collaborations: Collaborations that extend beyond the university include Greg Forter's participation on a large grant at the University of t he Arctic (PI Cassie Falke), which brought together an international cast of scholars for a year -long discussion entitled Literature/History/Human Rights. Forter also served on the organizing committee with scholars (and grad students) across the country a nd in the UK for the annual conference by the Marxist Literature Group (June 2021). In addition, a number of our faculty --including Stan Dubinsky, Mike Gavin, Dianne Johnson, and Elaine Chun--are engaged in collaborative research projects with scholars housed at other institutions. Film and Media Studies (Submitted by Lauren Steimer , lsteimer@mailbox.sc.edu, 949- 683-0702 ) Internal Collaborations: The faculty of the Film and Media Studies Program have engaged in a variety of forms of collaboration from smaller cross -unit work within the College of Arts and Sciences work to larger cross -institution partnerships within the UofSC system that demonstrate their investment in building productive relationships that not only foster the intellectual and professional growth of multiple stakeholders but also raise the public profile of USC as an institution. Faculty members have collaborated at the School and C ollege level to develop new teaching and educational opportunities, including the participation in the early- stage development of a cross -unit graduate degree program in the School of Visual Art and Design and the annual CAS Office of Undergraduate Studies Gamecock Teaching Days. The ways that certain kinds of roles and partnerships maintained by faculty involve numerous unquantifiable forms of collaboration which makes summation difficult. But in total, the faculty of the Film and Media Studies Program has engaged in at least 11 distinct forms of collaboration for the academic year in question. Most notably, in their role as faculty senate chair, Dr. Mark Cooper worked across multiple units at USC Columbia as well as with other faculty leaders in the USC system to add value through shared governance. Within the review period, perhaps their most notable accomplishment was the creation of a structure for faculty participation in governance at the system level. Dr. Mark Minett organized a \"Comics at UofSC\" w orking group that includes faculty from English, Film and Media Studies, Media Arts, African American Studies, the UofSC Libraries, and UofSC Sumter. Their current project involves collaborating with Timothy Simmons in the Libraries on a \"Comics Studies Library Guide\" that will also serve as a more general informational hub. He also met with Holly Crocker, director of the Humanities Collaborative, about the possibility of applying for working group status and funding for the year 2022/2023. Dr. Minett also collaborated with University Libraries Special Collections to produce a \"hands -on humanities\" video that discusses the Gary Lee Watson Collection in relation to his research and teaching. Here is the link to access this video (https://youtu.be/3ephLlO9iiQ) . External Collaborations: Dr. Maureen Ryan, in her role as the Associate Director of Humanities Collaborative, worked with several units across multiple schools to facilitate the bringing of renowned scholars to campus to deliver lectures, book talks, a nd hold workshops. She also, as part of the Humanities Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Group, helped to orchestrate the Carolinas Conflict University of South Carolina Page 325 College of Arts & Sciences19 Consortium, a soon- to-be annual two- day conference linking the University of North Carolina Charlotte with U ofSC.

Punk & Old- Time Radio: Conversations on Community, Conflict and Cohesion featured conversations with yodeler Nick Shoulder s; Asian American old time fiddler Sasha Hsuczyk; Roberto Coronado, who crossed over from Christian punk to the blues; and Alda Smith, who specializes in playing SC Piedmont music on the dobro. In the summer of 2021, McKissick collaborated with Stephen Cri swell, faculty and director of the Native American Studies Center at UofSC Lancaster and UofSC Columbia Anthropology faculty Courtney Lewis to direct three undergraduates and one graduate student conducting research on the history of UofSC's faculty/staff/ student engagement with American Indians and American Indian policy. This research is being used to develop an Indigenous Discovery Tour of UofSC's Historic Horseshoe. McKissick's fall 2021 collaboration with SVAD to host Hyphenated, an exhibit of work by two visiting artists, was a hallmark of the kind of substantive support the museum aims to provide the undergraduate teaching mission of CAS via inter -unit partnerships. In considering how to support the CAS Climate themed semester in fall 2021 and the Cl imate Ready Columbia event that faculty member Matt Kisner is organizing for spring 2022, Lana Burgess engaged multiple CAS units and UofSC's Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion to bring cutting- edge museum activist Stephanie Johnson- Cunningham to Columbia to speak to \"The Changing Cultural Climate in Museums,\" and Giordano Angeletti curated Inheritance: Sustainable Farms in the South, and arranged for a traveling exhibit about wild bees to coincide with the Climate Ready conference. Catesby in the Car olinas -a exhibit curated by Christian Cicimurri drawing on McKissick's extensive natural science collection is scheduled to open 3/21/22 and run through August 13, 2022. This exhibit was born of a collaboration among McKissick Museum, the Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, the A. C. Moore Herbarium the South Caroliniana Library and the Mark Catesby Centre. It will coincide with a Catesby conference that the Catesby Center in planning for May 2022. When the Peabody Museum at Harvard appr oached Mckissick about possibly hosting an exhibit of the controversial Zealy daguerreotypes taken of enslaved Africans in the Columbia metropolitan area, the museum's curatorial team initiated conversations with Bobby Donaldson and Qiana Whitted to determ ine whether this was an exhibit that we would want to undertake and explore what a partnership among CAS units needed to look like for us to responsibly curate an exhibit that included the daguerreotypes. At this point, those conversations have been paused because the Peabody has indefinitely put traveling the exhibit on hold, pending the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit. But McKissick understands the value of internal collaboration with colleagues in CAS, and is proactive in seeking out opportunities to engage in meaningful partnerships. Prior to the formalization of a CAS Pearl Fryar Project Team, McKissick had reached out to CAS faculty and Julian Williams to solicit input and feedback to ideas regarding how McKissick/CAS/UofSC might be involved with the int erpretation of and programming at the garden beyond the year of the current Central Carolina Community Foundation (CCCF) \"Connected Communities\" grant. McKissick also facilitated AFAM celebrating its 50th anniversary by engaging Fryar project staff Mike Gi bson to revitalize the Fryar sculptures in UofSC's Desegregation Memorial Garden, and with a tour of the garden in Bishopville for UofSC faculty/students/staff, completed with a screening of the documentary film A Man Named Pearl and a hands -on topiary art workshop with Mike Gibson. University of South Carolina Page 336 College of Arts & Sciences30 Finally, McKissick Museum regularly partners with CAS faculty to offer guided tours of exhibitions for their students. Anthropology faculty member Kelly Goldberg consistently uses museum exhibits as a teaching resource. In fall 2021, Burgess gave a tour of the Hyphenated exhibit to Naomi Falk's Art Studio Foundations class. Przybysz facilitated AFAM faculty member Nancy Tolson's students touring The Artists Inside Outsider Art. In fall 2021, Lana Burgess collaborated with James Risk, Instructor, History Department, to teach a unit on Enlightenment Era collecting in museums for 14 of 18 sections of the History of Science and Technology (HIST 108) class. For the spring 2022 semester, Burgess created a scavenger hunt and toured 253 students through the McKissick Museum exhibition Natural Curiosities: The University of South Carolina and the Evolution of Scientific Inquiry in the Natural World. External Collaborations: The summer 2021 student research project related to American Indian history involved not only internal collaborations with UofSC faculty, but an external collaboration with DeLesslin George- Warren, a citizen of the Catawba Indian Nation, who is scripting the Indigenous Discover Tour based on the students' r esearch. To amplify the impact of UofSC bringing Stephanie Johnson- Cunningham to UofSC to discuss the changing climate of museums, McKissick partnered with the Columbia Museum of Art to host Johnson-Cunningham's lecture at CMA in a space large enough to ac commodate a high turn- out and still maintain COVID mitigation efforts. The Pearl Fryar Topiary Garden Project has involved a collaboration with the Atlanta Botanical Garden (ABG), The Garden Conservancy (of New York) and the WeGOJA Foundation, formerly the South Carolina African American Heritage Foundation. ABG has brought its horticultural expertise to the project. The Conservancy has brought their institutional knowledge of the previous, but failed effort, to preserve Fryar's Garden, and the WeGOJA Foundation has ensured that the project has engaged the local African American community in conversations about the garden's future. Since the start of this project, the Riverbanks Botanical Garden, Moore Farms (in Lake City), and Brookgreen Gardens have joine d ABG to support topiary artist -in-residence Mike Gibson with staff/volunteers, and the donation of plants and pine straw.

University of South Carolina Page 340 College of Arts & Sciences34 The Department of Psychology also engages in cross -disciplinary collaboration to foster training and development. As such, Drs. Prinz and Booze (PSYC) are co- directors of the Behavioral -Biomedical Interface Program, an interdisciplinary research training program supported by NIH designed for select doctoral students in Epidemiology, Exercise Science, & Psychology. External Collaborations: The Psychology Department engages in rigorous collaborations with external organizations and scholars. One such common mechanism is through subcontracts, many of which are with schools and organiza tions within South Carolina, elevating the research capacity of the state. To this end, the department has active subcontracts with the Medical University of as the Greenville Country School District and the SC Department of Mental Health (IHS -2018C1- 10928, PI: Weist). The Psychology Department also has numerous subcontracts established outside of South Carolina, including with Seattle Children's Re search Institute (R01MH107573, PI: Roberts), the Baltimore (IHS -2018C1- Weist), and Temple University (R01DA013137, PI: Booze). Faculty at the Department of Psy chology are also highly sought out by other universities and organizations to consult on projects and lead subcontracts. Over the past year, Dr. Roberts has served as the site PI on the development of an ASD screening test led by Circa Bioscience (R41MH115642) and on an R01 awarded to the University of Kansas (R01MH079252) investigating emotion regulation as a predictor of adjustment to trauma.

Matt continued to work with Chris Judge of USC -Lancaster's Native American Studies Center on the continued growth and promotion of the Native American South Carolina Archive, a D USS project. External Collaborations: In 2021, ISS embarked on an ambitious collaborative exercise called SHARE. SHARE -- Southern History Archives Research, and Education- is a Consortium made up of a group of universities and colleges dedicated to student generated learning and the dissemination of knowledge about the American South. Students from around the world conduct archival research in order to educate themselves and others about the South. Composed of local, regional, national, and international c ollege and university partners, SHARE is hosted by the Institute for Southern Studies at the University of South Carolina. SHARE disseminates primary documents from various archives in the South, grants students from Consortium members access to these documents, and educates students on how to accurately transcribe the documents. Faculty and staff at Consortium colleges and universities help students curate the material and ensure accuracy. Searchable transcriptions are then uploaded on the University of South Carolina SHARE website and made available to scholars interested in southern studies from around the world. Members of SHARE include: o South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina, USA o Mercer University, Macon, Georgia, USA o University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark o University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA o University of Warwick, Warwick, United Kingdom SHARE, thanks in part to an ASPIRE II grant, is currently under development and Smith is teaching a pilot course this semester for ISS (SOST 405) with undergraduate students to help define the way SHARE will work in practice.

University of South Carolina Page 346 College of Arts & Sciences40 Other Collaborations: Faculty r eported a total of 38 collaborative activities across research, teaching, and service during the reporting period. These research, teaching and service activities ranged across units within the College and University, and some were external to th Walker I nstitute of International and Area Studies (Submitted by Joshua Grace, gracejr@mailbox.sc.edu, 517- 899-0979) Internal Collaborations: Programs in the Walker Institute coordinated 26 internal collaborations. These largely consisted of events that bring international content to the UofSC community through a variety of forms: public speakers, virtual guests to classrooms, and public -facing UofSC collaborations (in public spaces). A list of examples follows the narrative. The Walker Institute collaborated w ith several other units within and beyond the College of Arts and Sciences. Foremost among these was a workshop on Cyber Talent Management held in October of 2021. The Walker Institute spearheaded a partnership with College of Engineering and Computing and the College of Information and Communications on the state of cyber education and training. The conversation welcomed stakeholders from federal, state, and local government to a conversation that revolved around the institute's new major, Cyber Intelligence. The latter is a truly interdisciplinary degree rooted in novel approaches to cyber issues within the College of Arts and Sciences with critical partnerships with the two aforementioned colleges. As a result of this work, the institute is helping lead out conversations about cyber issues on and beyond campus. The Walker Institute also continued its historic relationship with the Center for International Business Education and Research and the Folks Center for International Business, both in the Darla Moore School of Business, to support research and event programming. The institute began working more closely with the Carolina International House, home to many of the institute's majors, to more closely tie the mission of each unit together. Moreover, with Dr. Payal Shah as its Associate Director (College of Education), the institute is taking important steps to work more closely with the College of Education on curricular opportunities for Walker Institute majors. The institute also partnered with the Colle ge of Social Work on a Covid event. It is worth noting that almost every event the institute puts on requires internal collaborations because each of the institute's six programs (African Studies, Asian Studies, European Studies, Islamic World Studies, Lat in American Studies, and Russian and Eurasian Studies) draws from faculty across the college. Affiliates come from 11 UofSC colleges and schools and include four members of the UofSC system. Finally, the Walker Institute, and Jodi Salter in particular, pl ayed a significant role in collaborative efforts to enhance programs and conversations about cyber issues on the UofSC campus. In doing so, the institute worked with, learned with, and drew from partners in the College of Engineering and Computing (especia lly Jorge Crichigno) and the College of Engineering and Computing (especially Karen Gavigan). Indeed, the committee for the major is made up of faculty form three UofSC colleges.

The Walker Institute both continued and grew its external collaborations in 2021. It continued its longtime partnership with the Columbia World Affairs Council of Columbia, including the institute's University of South Carolina Page 348 College of Arts & Sciences42 role hosting the Palmetto Forum - a monthly event series held at the Palmetto Club. In 2021, this included efforts to both revive and rethink the Forum. We witnessed evidence of revival in a recent event on the \"Russian- Ukraine Crisis\" that saw a room packed full of interested residents of Columbia. We will cont inue our rethink of the event in the coming weeks by hosting events on a campus and at other community locations. Our goal is to bring community members, faculty, and students together more consistently. The institute continued its long and productive rela tionship with Taipei Economic and Cultural Office of Atlanta through a grant with the office. The office used the grant to hold a virtual conference in June on the theme of Democratic Governance in Taiwan. The institute welcomed scholars from around the world to the event. The institute created new external collaborations through its October 2021 Cyber Talent Management Workshop. The workshop brought federal and state stakeholders to campus to discuss cyber needs and education. This included collaboration w ith members of US Army Cyber Security, Homeland Security, the National Security Administration, and with representatives of cyber research labs around the region and nation. Jodi Salter, the Program Manager for CYBR, created a number of external collaborat ions through who work at Check Point CPX, a large conference on cyber issues that provided opportunities for students to talk about jobs and internships and to liaise with the Columbia Chamber of Commerce, SC Compete, and the City of Columbia Economic Offi ce. Jodi also hosted two SC Cyber days for SC Competes in which she shared details of the CYBR program with thousands of SC high school students and their guidance counselors. The Walker Institute also hosted a well attended event on art and Soviet life in partnership with the Columbia Museum of Art. The event was part of a transition occurring at the institute to reach more public audiences. Women's and Gender Studies (Submitted by Ed Madden, maddene@mailbox.sc.edu, 803- 777-4008) Internal Collaborations: As an interdisciplinary program with 6 jointly- appointed core faculty, 5 interdiciplinary adjunct faculty, and over 40 affiliate faculty across the university and at regional campuses, WGST is constantly working to facilitate cross -unit collaborations of t eaching, research, and service. Many of our core faculty are active faculty affiliates in the Walker Institute, the African American Studies Program, and other units. WGST Program core and teaching faculty routinely collaborate with the Honors College to offer Honors sections of WGST courses and to supervise Honors Colege student theses (without faculty compensation). We collaborate with OMSA to ensure that our events and programming are listed in the Beyond Diversity events calendar. Our major annual lectures are co -sponsored by the College of Arts and Sciences. Faculty list a total of 16 collaborations. Co-sponsored events for this time period with collaboration across departments include: o Hostiles Climates, Climate Theme Semester events (3 events during Fall 2021 semester) o University Library's Fall Literary Festival Jacqueline Woodson o Feminist Horror Film Festival at the Russell House o \"Easy to Love:\" An Alternative Valentine's Day Event featuring a reading and discussion with Briallen Hopper cosponsored by Humanities Collaborative, WGST, SVAD and School of Music o 2022 Comparative Literature Conference Truth in the Late Foucault cosponsored by Program in Comparative Literature, Dept of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, Anthropology, Philosophy, and WGST.

Arts & Sciences College One Pager 2022 University of South Carolina Page 351 College of Arts & SciencesUofSC COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES OVERVIEW As the oldest and largest college at the University of South Carolina, the College of Arts and Sciences is the intellectual, artistic, scientific, and instructional heart of the university. A strong and vibrant College of Arts and Sciences is critical to the University of South Carolina's mission of teaching, research, creative activity, and community engagement. Everything the college does can be boiled down to a single word: Impact. Everything we do is focused on making an impact on and through our students, faculty, research fellows, and staff \u2014 locally, nationally, and globally. The college's 26 schools, departments, and academic programs span the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. We offer 109 degrees (48 Bachelor's degrees, 40 Master's degrees and 21 Doctoral degrees). The college is home to nearly 9,000 undergraduates and more than 900 graduate students. Over 75,000 living alumni are Arts & Sciences graduates, more than half of whom live in South Carolina. In Fall 2020, 21% of Arts and Sciences undergraduates were first-generation students and 21% were Pell Grant recipients, among the highest rates at UofSC. In addition to the undergraduate majors discussed above, the college's faculty teach classes to virtually every student in the University through the Carolina Core. The college's graduate programs produced more than 100 PhDs in academic year 2020. To serve all of these constituencies and produce research excellence, Arts & Sciences has approximately 450 tenured and tenure-track faculty and 150 professional track faculty. To accommodate all of these programs, students and faculty, the college's footprint covers more than 40 buildings. RESEARCH AND SCHOLARSHIP EXCELLENCE The College of Arts and Sciences is a hub of research excellence and creative activity. Over the past five years, Arts & Sciences has ranked at or near the top of federal research grant awards generated across the University. For fiscal year 2021, annual federal research grant funding for Arts and Sciences totaled more than $28M and extramural proposals totaled over $57M in annual funds. Research in the college is funded by grant awards from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, and other federal agencies, as well as from many private foundations and international granting agencies. While the college has much to be proud of on the research side, there is also room for growth, and the college has made intentional efforts over the past 15 months to spur and support the expansion of research efforts. College faculty receive widespread recognition for their research and service. Last year, they received fellowships and awards from national organizations including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Endowment of the Humanities, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Royal Historical Society. The college has 28 Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, including three who were inducted this year alone. TEACHING EXCELLENCE The College of Arts and Sciences reaches nearly every student at the university, and the college is committed to excellent teaching at all levels. It promotes a dynamic culture of teaching and learning that fosters intellectual community and experiential learning through student-faculty research opportunities, an annual Theme Semester, internships, and other beyond-the-classroom activities.The college has 11 graduate programs ranked in the top 100 by the US News and World Report, including Chemistry, Clinical Psychology, Criminology, Earth Sciences, English, History, Mathematics, Political Science, Sociology, Social Psychology, and Statistics. Arts and Sciences faculty frequently receive university and national awards for both undergraduate and graduate teaching, including more than half of such awards for each of the past several years. University of South Carolina Page 352 College of Arts & SciencesBIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCE RESEARCH IMPACT The college's impact in health sciences is often overlooked, but the Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Psychology Departments make significant contributions to education and research in this area. More than 2,000 current Arts and Sciences students are pursuing degrees in the health sciences. Many graduates from Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biological Sciences, and Psychology programs go on to professional programs in medicine, dentistry, and other health professions as well as earning graduate degrees in the biomedical sciences. Graduates from the programs in Clinical Psychology, School Psychology, and Cardiovascular Technology are highly sought after by employers. Health sciences research programs include those focused on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders, brain imaging, child health and prevention research, cancer pathogenesis and treatment, and immunology and microbiome effects on health. These include extensive collaborations with other UofSC Colleges and Schools as well as other institutions around the globe. INTERDISCIPLINARY FOCUS Interdisciplinarity is a tremendous strength of the college. Here, faculty and students are encouraged to draw on a wide array of subject areas, research methods, and learning outcomes in the arts, humanities, and sciences to engage big ideas and solve big problems. Likewise, the college serves as a model for recruiting jointly appointed faculty and developing cross-listed courses that necessitate partnerships with multiple units on campus. Facilitating interdisciplinary teaching and research is also one of the primary goals of the college's newly launched McCausland Innovation Fund, which aims to provide resources for programs and classroom initiatives that make meaningful connections across fields. Additionally, the college's 16 interdisciplinary centers and institutes foster collaboration in research, public outreach and educational opportunities. PRIMARY CHALLENGES ENROLLMENT TRENDS - Growing the University through the College of Arts and Sciences While university student enrollment has increased by ~ 4% over the past five years, enrollment in the College of Arts and Sciences has increased by more than 30%. Meanwhile, the enrollment growth in other colleges also impacts the college through our role in teaching Carolina Core classes. At the same time, the size of the college's faculty and classroom space has remained the same. This rapid growth has placed a significant burden on Arts and Sciences faculty to maintain a high-quality student learning experience while continuing world-class research. RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF FACULTY, STAFF, AND GRADUATE STUDENTS Like many colleges on campus, Arts and Sciences struggles to recruit and retain top faculty, particularly underrepresented minority faculty, as we face challenges in maintaining competitive salaries, facilities, and more. In addition, unlike other colleges at UofSC, most of our full-time instructors, many of whom hold a PhD, and are paid $42,000 to teach 4:4 loads, which creates significant retention and morale issues not only for those professional track faculty but for the faculty as a whole. (Similar issues exist with regard to staff salaries, and we regularly lose staff members to other colleges in the university to perform similar roles at a higher salary.) Finally, and as noted by each of the external reviewers who have conducted a departmental review in the last two years, graduate student stipends across the college are extremely low compared to competitors, making it difficult to realize the potential impact of graduate programs on the college's research mission. FACILITIES More than 20 buildings occupied by the College of Arts and Sciences need significant renovations. In the past year alone, three Arts and Sciences buildings have required extensive emergency repairs due to mechanical issues, including flooding and power failures. In addition to deferred maintenance issues, outdated research facilities pose a challenge for recruiting and retaining top faculty and students.

Undergraduate Retention : We started a new program for AFAM 50 Student Ambassadors that recruited four of our undergraduate majors and minors to assist with event planning and promotions for the year. The ambassadors were spotlighted in our newsletter and each received $250 book gr ant for their service. AFAM Studies leadership and faculty have also stayed in touch with our majors not only through routine activities such as one-on-one virtual advising, but also by attending OMSA \"Black Space\" and serving as faculty experts on student panels. Anthropology (Submitted by Jennifer Reynolds, jreynold@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-5527) Undergraduate Recruitment : The Department has not historically done any recruitment directly within area high schools about the discipline, though individual faculty have given occasional talks associated with their public facing service work. We have started to seize opportunities when we know there is interest. For example, fall semester 2021, we accepted our first ever High School Intern who was able to gain hands on experience working on two different faculty research projects in historical archaeology and linguistic anthropology. The Chair has also met with several prospective out- of-state students interested in studying anthropology as well, which is a sign that we should consider doing more in the arena in the future beyond the regional draw due to our position as being flagship university in the state. The Department of Anthropology relies heavily upon several foundational Carolina Core courses (ANTH 161 (SCI); ANTH 101 and ANTH 102 (GSS)) to recruit students to the major as many high school students are unaware of the discipline and what career opportunities it offers. All sections of 102 include a unit that makes explicit for students what they can do with a degree in anthropology, including information about the viable career paths as well as concrete ways they can articulate how the skills they acquire can be translated into the needs for different professions. Students often comment that the find this helpful. This year we printed a set of six colorful tarot cards that cluster anthropology courses around a specialization or topic that faculty regularly teach for widespread dissemination in and around campus through partnering units around campus and local businesses. This is a proven strategy for recruiting University of South Carolina Page 355 College of Arts & Sciences2 new majors at two other R1 Anthropology Departments and we hope to see over the next few years of undertaking this strategy if it results in higher visibility of the courses that th e discipline has to offered students in terms of course enrollments, and/or an increase in majors/minors. Undergraduate Retention : Data from Carolina Data Works regarding first time full- time 1st year retention rates between 2012 -2019 for declared anthropology major indicates that 100% male- identified and 90% female identified are retained. It thus appears that once students choose the major, they stick with it though they might come to it late in their time at Carolina. The UG program has now three recurring scholarships/awards, two of which are sustained by Education Foundation gifts. One is for rising seniors who are heavily involved in (bio)archaeology a second for an outstanding student in anthropology who demonstrates excellence in academics and is involved in beyond the classroom and community outreach, and a third is given to the winner of an essay contest which makes a compelling argument as to why they chose the major and how the see the four field training contributing to their professional development. We timed the announcement of these winners with World Anthropology Day (Feb. 17th) as a means to create buzz about the major. We also intend to showcase the winning essay publicaly (only with consent of the award winners) to promote the major in other forums. We also have an UG anthropology association (ASA) which is comfortable reaching out to faculty to give talks, seek advice for internships, and social events. All of these help with UG student major retention. Biological Sciences (Submit ted by Tammi Richardson, richardson@biol.sc.edu, 803-777-6389) Undergraduate Recruitment : Our faculty regularly engage in undergraduate recruitment activities that the College of Arts and Sciences and the University hold, including Admitted Students Day for both Carolina and McNair Scholar programs. Faculty are also engaged in community programs that helps to expose high school students to role models and introduce them to the University and careers in Biology. In addition, many of our Non- Tenure Track Instructional faculty participate in weekly Biological Sciences Informational Sessions for prospective students and their families where they are introduced to the Biological Sciences Department, curriculum requirements, experiential learning initiatives, outreach opportunities, community involvement, undergraduate research opportunities, etc. Our faculty regularly engage in undergraduate recruitment activities that the College of Arts and Sciences and the University hold, including Admitted Students Day for both Carolina and McNair Scholar programs.

University of South Carolina Page 356 College of Arts & Sciences3 Chemistry and Biochemistry (Submitted by Daniel Reger , reger@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-2587) Undergraduate Recruitment : In the Spring and Summer, the Undergraduate Director (Leslie Lovelace) and our First Year Advisor (Lorie White) host a weekly session for visiting prospective undergraduate students who are interested in our Chemistry or Biochemistry (BMB) majors. Undergraduate Retention : The department has been hosting yearly \"Meet your major\" sessions for enrolled undergraduate students thinking of switching into our majors or for students in our majors. The students have the opportunity to ask questions to a panel of faculty and also our Undergraduate Director. The Chemistry majors have an undergraduate association (ACS Student Organization) with a faculty mentor. The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) majors can participate in our student association (ASBMB Chapter). Students interested in polymer chemistry can participate in our student chapter of the ACS Po lymer Student Association. Criminology and Criminal Justice (Submitted by Brandon Applegate, applegate@sc.edu, 803-777-7065) Undergraduate Recruitment : Faculty and advisors met with prospective undergraduate students and parents, including virtual meetings where appropriate. Undergraduate Retention : Advisors in the Department worked closely and collaboratively with advisors from the University Advising Center. Faculty proactively intervened to connect students with campus resources to maxi mize their success and minimize separation from the University. Earth, Ocean and Environment, School of (Submitted by Alicia Wilson , awilson@seoe.sc.edu, 7-1240) Undergraduate Recruitment : Many SEOE faculty regularly participate in College of Arts and Science Admitted Student Days, Open Houses, and Honors College social events. In addition, our Undergraduate Office supports significant recruitment activities. We have now returned to meeting in person with prospective and new students, but in 2020 we developed substantial online visit resources that continued to be heavily used in 2021. These resources include a virtual undergraduate tour of the SEOE. Virtual tour links are posted with the USC Visitor Center for sessions with the SEOE, as well as bei ng advertised in email signature lines. The Visitor Center keeps track annually of their number of visits and those that sign up to meet with us; we are not sure if they had any internal tracking of hits on our links on their websites. We sponsored weekly Q & A sessions. We write extended email responses to inquiries about the degrees and returned phone calls from parents about the program or visits. Also, our department worked with Dean's office (Claudia) to make sure all students admitted get an email re: scholarships, etc. Undergraduate Retention : COVID-19 required substantial new efforts at retention. All advising was moved on line and more opportunities were needed to interact with students. We actively worked with faculty and our first year advisor to contact all SEOE students that were identified as not responsive in class. Over the last two years, our first -year advisor has been woven far more tightly into the SEOE undergraduate office, which has provided valuable insight into where student service- related improvements are needed. We actively co ntacted and worked with students that did not get advised or register in the normal Spring sessions to encourage them to return to school in the Fall and the University of South Carolina Page 357 College of Arts & Sciences4 undergraduate office advised many students over the summer that had not been advised in the spring - lists of students that did not re-enroll were provided by UAA/provost office so we knew who to contact. We worked with students who intended to do study abroad during the changing conditions of COVID, which limited or changed what options were available to them. Our UG office (student services coordinator) writes email to all those who make President and Dean's list as a retention measure. For all students who go on probation, the student services coordinator sends email and asks all students to contact their advisor or the UG Director to discuss their path forward to be successful; UG Director meets with a number of these students to map out a path forward for these students to retain them and keep them off suspension - including frequent meetings with a couple of them to keep them on track. English Language and Literature (Submitted by Susan Courtney, courtney@sc.edu, 777-7120) Undergraduate Recruitment : The Department of English Language and Literature increased visibility of students, faculty, and activities in English, including our undergraduates and their diverse accomplishments, goals, and backgrounds on our departmental Instagram and Twitter accounts. Secondary Education was added as a concentration in the English major and now in the Bulletin (formerly it had been a major track that didn't appear in Bulletin or on transcripts). The department also developed \"areas of emphasis\" in the major to spotlight diverse pathways through the English major and multiple departmental strengths (in process), submitted ENGL 280 for approval as an online offering to increase accessibility of a course that satisfies both AIU and VSR requirements, supported 2 faculty proposals for the McCausland Innovation Fund for Online Learning to develop ENGL 280 and SPCH 150 for online delivery, and closely monitored FYE enrollments in fall and spring to ensure sufficient sections of ENGL 101 and 102 to meet student demand from incoming class. Hired TFACs in summer to cover added sections. Undergraduate Retention : Department efforts led to increased visibility of students, faculty, and activities in English, including celebrating our undergraduates and their diverse accomplishments, goals, and backgrounds on our departmental Instagram and Twitter accounts. We continued to offer online advising (re COVID 19) with new internal system of digitized undergraduate and graduate files. We also worked on developing \"areas of emphasis\" in the major to spotlight diverse pathways through the English major and multiple departmental strengths (in process). Major requirements were updated in Bulletin to improve Degreeworks functionality for students (making ENGL 287 & 288 required rather than \"supporting courses\"). Also, the department supported GTAs in FYE classes with orientation and ongoing mentoring throughout the year, and supported instructors and TFACs teaching core SPCH and SAEL courses with orientation and ongoing support throughout the year.

PHIL now hosts regular meetings of a start-up Philosophy Club. Physics and Astronomy (Submitted by Beth Powell , mepowell@mailbox.sc.edu, 777-8104) Undergraduate Recruitment : Several times per year, our faculty, staff, and students participate in both in-person and virtual recruitment fairs to spread awareness of our undergraduate programs to potential applicants. Our department is represented by a number of undergraduate students who have volunteered to be featured in both student and alumni spotlights by our College of Arts and Sciences. These students are willing to share their own personal stories, such as why they decided to attend UofSC, how their experiences at UofSC have shaped them into who they are today, and much more. Undergraduate Retention : The undergraduate Society for Physics Students has an active chapter, including a Discord server where they provide both support for one another both for academic work in physics and more generally as students. University of South Carolina Page 360 College of Arts & Sciences7 Political Science (Submitted by Kirk Randazzo, randazzo@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-3109) Undergraduate Recruitment : Our undergraduate student recruitment activities center primarily on supporting initiatives by the College and University. We have faculty representatives who attend the College's recruitment weekends and others who help recruit Top Scholars. Additionally, when individuals visit campus we try to make faculty available to meet with them and their parents. Undergraduate Retention : For undergraduate students we have two full-time and one half- time academic advisors who regularly communicate with students, both individually and in groups, to make sure they are progressing well in our program and have the information they need to succeed. Individuals who are experiencing difficulties also get additional time with these individuals and, when necessary, are directed t o other resources on campus. Psychology (Submitted by Jessica Escorcia , escorcia@email.sc.edu , 803-576-6798) Undergraduate Recruitment : The Psychology Department recruits undergraduates by attending UofSC Prospective Student Day each fall and Admitted Students Day each spring. We talk to students and their families about the university and college as a whole, and then more specifically about the Psychology program and the benefits of obtaining a degree in our field. Undergraduate Retention : In order to retain undergraduate students, we listen to their needs and respond accordingly. For example, when we noticed that many students expressed interest in internships, we established the Internship in Psychology course. Similarly, working with Biology and other departments, we created the Neuroscience major to meet the increasing demand and interest from our students. The Neuroscience major will begin in Fall 2022. By seeking to meet the needs of our undergraduates, we hope that they retain their passion for learning and their interest in the field of Psychology. We also ensure that our students have access to well-trained advisors who are knowledgeable about major and minor requirements, study-abroad, cross- training and research opportunities, graduate school applications, and many other facets of advisement. We are currently working to hire another undergraduate advisor to lessen workloads and ensure that we have sufficient time to dedicate to each student (this would give us 4 full- time advisors + our Student Services Coordinator). In addition, we have faculty that engage in unofficial advising by hosting webinars on careers and other topics of professional development. Thus, while course registration is handled by administrative staff, f aculty members provide career mentoring and professional guidance to our undergraduate student body. We have also created a one- credit class called Professional Development in Psychology which launched in Fall 2021 with positive reviews from students. The course is required for all Psychology majors and details the skills and resources needed to reach the various career goals that are available to our majors. The online class does this by using a novel technology platform (Rise360) in which students can access assignments, videos, and lecture materials. Lastly, we put great effort into building a supportive community and typically host undergraduate events in August (Back- to-school), October (Halloween/Midterms), February (Valentine's Day/Midterms), and Apri -of- the-year).

Despite the pandemic, our faculty have been able to complete a number of new recruitment activities in the past year to increase our major numbers. Our faculty support high school teachers with remote learning by offering virtual masterclasses with our faculty. Our faculty were able to support teachers in during the pandemic while making a positive impression of our program and recruiting students to UofSC. Our department has a series of uplifting videos highlighting the work of our current students that was used in recruitment cam paigns for our department. In addition, our faculty attended several events, both in person and virtual to recruit future students. They attended virtual college days for arts programs across the state, such as the Fine Arts Center Greenville or the Gover nor's School of the Arts. They also conducted recruitment at the Southeastern Theatre Conference and the South Carolina Theatre Association. The heads of our graduate programs also recruited for our graduate programs at the University Resident Theatre Associations virtual events. Undergraduate Retention : Our department offers a number of scholarships in both theatre and dance for continuing students. This support students that face financial difficulty and recognize students for their meritorious contrib utions to the department. We made extensive efforts to host orientations, regular events through the year, and graduation events to recognize the work of our students and to provide them with a sense of community in these difficult times. we made extensi ve use of social media, with posting videos of students highlighting their work and encouraging other members of the department to participate. We also offered a number of professional development opportunities in addition to our classwork and production work. We held a number of virtual guest artist masterclasses. We also offered audition workshops for students to get one on one feedback on their pieces for class or for future auditions. Our student organizations also continued to thrive, and we supporte d initiatives from these organizations to continue their activities, pending the practice of safe COVID protocols. Likewise, we continued to make our work accessible by providing free attendance for our majors students to our department's productions. We have also implemented a faculty led mentorship system in both programs where students are advised by trained faculty mentors before meeting with their formal student services advisor. The students have given very positive feedback about this initiative. We wanted to ensure that all students felt like they had a specific faculty contact in their areas of interest to answer questions and provide guidance on their future careers. We know this has been a difficult year for our students. We have made extensive efforts as a faculty to make people aware of the mental and academic health initiatives on campus and have strongly encouraged our faculty to check in with their students and to be proactive in supporting their mental health.

They also participated in the CAS Themed Semester in 2021 and received funding for a visiting designer talk on the ways design professionals are communicating about climate change. Stephane Nace notes extending invitations to multiple design professionals to meet with her students; among them Maria Fabrizio; Jamie Prokell, Creative Director for Health for Oiler, Senior Design Director Fresh; and Jordan Wannemacher, book cover designer. The SVAD Studio Art GD+I faculty are planning a BFA senior exhibition event at the McKissick Museum for spring 2022. Finally, to support staff in the UAN to understand the BFA in GD+I, its faculty have created unique recruitment documents for students, parents and advisors that explain their BFA degree program pathway. They are continuing robust use of their Instagram account to publicize the efforts of the program, its students, and alumni: @uofsc_design. In her role as SVAD Director, Laura Kissel frequ ently meets with prospective students and parents, and sometimes leads the unit's Information Sessions on Fridays. In fall 2021 she hosted, with Anna Swartwood House, Director of Undergraduate Studies, a SVAD information session and building tour for 45 high school art students from Myrtle Beach. SVAD also presented virtually at the South Carolina State Museum's College Art Day, which reaches over 500 high school students. SVAD lost its top advisor to another college at the university last fall, leaving a very large gap in knowledge about the ins- and-outs of all undergraduate programs in the school. The vacancy has been filled with a new staff member who will begin full time with SVAD on March 1, 2022. SVAD also lost its First Year University of South Carolina Page 366 College of Arts & Sciences13 and Second Year UAN advisor in August 2021; this advisor was replaced with a new full time staff person on January 2, 2022. Walker Institute of International and Area Studies (Submitted by Joshua Grace, gracejr@mailbox.sc.edu, 517-899-0979) Undergraduate Recruitment : The institute welcomed undergraduates to its space for the first time in its 60 year history. For GLST, much of this work centered on retention through communication with students. Early on, we recognized a need to focus on managing the student transition into the institute in order to retain students already committed to the major. We believe we have done so successfully and are now transitioning to recruiting students at a variety events (for 2022 report). Jodi Salter has led out the recruitment efforts for the CYBR major. She has represented Walker at a number of admissions events and at regional cyber workshops. So too, Alan Marsee, the institute's student advisor, has played an important role recruiting majors sent to him from other advisors and mentors across campus. Undergraduate Retention : As noted above: For GLST, much of this work centered on retention through communication with students. Early on, we recognized a need to focus on managing the student transition into the institute in order to retain students already committed to the major. We believe we have done so successfully and are now transitioning to recruiting students at a variety events (for 2022 report). For both degrees, interdisciplinarity is the draw for students and the challenge for retention. Perhaps the biggest effort of the last 8 months in this office has been taking steps to improve the way each degree works from a student perspective. We anticipate the fruits of this labor will be the subject of a report in the coming years. Women's and Gender Studies (Submitted by Ed Madden, maddene@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-4008) Undergraduate Recruitment : All core faculty teach cross -listed courses in their respective fields, often thus recruiting students to the major, a second major or a minor. The WGST Program offers an annual undergraduate student recognition award, the Arney Robinson Childs Student Award. This year, the WGST Program will also begin to offer the Dr. Mary Baskin Waters Service Learning Award and a scholarship in memory of Dr. Lynn Weber. We are in the process of developing a more content-driven website as a recruitment and retention tool that includes spotlights on WGST alumni and student research. We are also reviving our social media outreach efforts. Undergraduate Retention : The WGST Program sponsors and co-sponsors 10-20 educational events that are open to undergraduate attendance each year. WGST faculty agree to supervise a number of independent study courses (without compensation) to facilitate our undergraduate students' degree progress. Our program offers membership opportunities for WGST students to join the National Women's Studies Association. The WGST Undergraduate Director, Dr. Stephanie Mitchem, holds weekly office hours to meet with undergraduate students. She ensures students remain informed, engaged and supported. The advising office is helpful for retention, often offering advice to help students through the maze of university red tape.
