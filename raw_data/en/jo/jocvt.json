British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology Prevention of Future Death Reports (Regulation 28) Ref: 2023 -0107 Propranolol prescribed for anxiety by a locum GP 6 months previously, recently changed to sertraline. An overdose of remaining propranolol was taken as an impulsive act, after which help was sought, the provision of which was delayed. Individual rang the Crisis Team and NHS 111 within 30 minutes of taking the overdose. Two opportunities were missed to send an ambulance sooner which may have meant her reaching hospital at least two hours earlier than she eventually did. Cause of death Intentional Propranolol Overdose Anxiety & Mood Disorder Concerns No advice given to safely dispose of propranolol which was no longer required/prescribed -propranolol is known to be cardiotoxic in overdose and the patient was known to be in a potentially fragile mental state (recent prescription of sertraline for depression/anxiety). Prevention of Future Death Reports (Regulation 28) Ref:2023 -0106 The individual inhaled the contents of a number of nitrous oxide cannisters. She started to wheeze and used her blue inhaler. She declined an ambulance and collapsed as she was going outside to get air. An ambulance was called and her friend performed CPR. She was resuscitated but died the next day. Cause of death Inhalation of Nitrous Oxide compounding Asthma Concerns The present legal framework concerning Nitrous Oxide should be reviewed, in the light of this death, having regard to the seemingly increasing use of Nitrous Oxide particularly by young persons. Primary research -Medication Safety Frequency of nursing student medication errors: A systematic review. The frequency of nursing student medication errors is high. The safe administration of medications is an important skill that nursing students should learn. At a theoretical and practical/clinical level, it would be advisable for clinical nurses and academics to jointly develop an educational progr am to acquire correct knowledge and perceptions regarding safe medication administration. (Greece) medRxiv (In press) Is primary care a patient -safe setting? Prevalence, severity, nature, and causes of adverse events: numerous and mostly avoidabl e Knowing the frequency and characteristics of adverse events is key to implementing actions that can prevent their occurrence. A high prevalence of adverse events (1 in 66 consultations) was observed, which was slightly higher than those reported in similar studies. About three out of four suc h events were considered to be avoidable and one out of 13 were severe. Prescription errors, drug administration errors by patients, and clinical assessment errors were t he most frequent types of adverse events. Int J Qual Health Care Medication errors in community pharmacies: Evaluation of a standardized safety program. Using reports to the Canadian AIMS programme the authors found that most frequent event types involved the incorrect drug (19 .5%), concentration (17.2%) or quantity (14.5%). Approximately 25% of events were identified by the involved patient or their agent. When looking at medication class es,antihypertensives, opioids and antidepressants were involved in over one -quarter of overall and higher severity events. Environmental staffing problems and int erruptions were the contributory factor and sub -factor most frequently reported, respectively. Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy The Value of Learning From Near Misses to Improve Patient Safety: A Scoping Review 4,745 articles were identified. Health care assumes that reporting and learning from near misses improves patient safety. The literature provides limited evidence supporting these assumptions and shows that actions as a result of near misses are commonly aimed at the human J Patient Safety Primary research -Medication Safety Implementation status of safety measures to prevent errors with non -oncologic methotrexate: surveys in community and hospital pharmacies. Accidental overdose of low -dose methotrexate can lead to serious patient harm. Safety in relation to methotrexate in pharmacies relies mostly on staff instructions, which are considered weak measures. In light of the serious risk imposed on patients, pharmacies should set a focus on stronger IT -based measures that rely less on human performance. International Journal of Clinical Pharmac (in press) Analysis of the nature and contributory factors of medication safety incidents following hospital discharge using National Re porting and Learning System (NRLS) data from England and Wales: a multi -method study. Medication incidents after hospital discharge are associated with patient harm. A total of 1121 medication -related incident repo rts underwent analysis. More than one in 10 incidents were associated with patient harm. The drug monitoring (17%) and administration stages (15%) were associated wit h ahigher proportion of harmful incidents than any other drug use stages. The most common contributory factors were organisation factors (82%), followed by s taff factors (16%). Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety.

Errors and near misses were attr ibuted to students not adhering to three major patient safety procedures: checking the patient's identification, checking the patient's allergy status, and following therights "}
