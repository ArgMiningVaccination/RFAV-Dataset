I've used homeopathy my whole life for minor things and have gotten surgeries/injections/prescription medication for other things. I got all my shots since childhood and all the recent shots since 2020 as well) and believe Rx/OTC medicine helps many people. Last year, I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis/esophagitis. I had acid reflux that was worsening every year and the belches were becoming painful. A GI doctor scoped and diagnosed me, and put me on Omeprazole at a lower dose and increased it when I told him that the acid reflux was not improving, despite taking it regularly as instructed and changing my diet/exercise for the better. I didn't want to take this medication for the rest of my life, so, after a couple months of no noticeable improvement, I figured I'd look into homeopathic because this was a natural issue, there should be a natural cure, right? I got connected with a homeopathic doctor who spoke with me for a couple hours to assess my symptoms and my lifestyle. He prescribed me a 30 day regimen of several homeopathic medicines to take at specific times throughout the day. I did it diligently and after 30 days...I noticed no improvement. But then, by day 32/33, it all improved. The belching went away! Over the next few months, I slowly reintroduced trigger foods/drinks and noticed that the belching would return sparingly and be minimal at best. I haven't taken any medication related to this issue since the 30 day regimen. Could I scientifically explain what happened? Nope. But I know what I went through, that I tried the scientific method first, and that homeopathic medicine is what ultimately healed me. I am very grateful for this. "}
