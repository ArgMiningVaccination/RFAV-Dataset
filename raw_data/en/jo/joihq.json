[Dr. Joan Waters](/Expert/82022732-Joan-Water)Family Practitioner FORT COLLINS, CO Yes, naturopathic medicine can definitely help to minimize your sinus symptoms related to allergies to pollen. While we won't ever claim to resolve an allergy, we identify and treat sources of inflammation in your body. Once we do this, your immune system is able to respond more-normally to allergens, rather than produce a highly exaggerated immune response. Naturopathic doctors make a distinction between true allergies and sensitivities. A person usually reacts very quickly to a true allergen. The symptoms of a food or other environmental sensitivity may not show up for 2 to 4 days after exposure to the substance, so it is harder to identify what the stressor is. There is testing available to naturopathic doctors to distinguish between a true allergy and a sensitivity. Since sensitivities are often reversible, it is very helpful to differentiate between allergies and sensitivities and to treat accordingly.

Foutch](/Expert/8138595-Christine-L-Foutch)Naturopathic Physician Rock Island, Illinois Hello to you, The immune system functions to clear the body of foreign bodies such as viruses, bacteria, blood cells, tissue cells, etc. Allergic responses are unusual responses of the immune system, occurring when the immune system reacts to a normally harmless protein that the body has identified as harmful, representing an altered reaction to an antigen. The antigens involved in an allergic response are called allergens. Allergies can represent the overactivity of the immune system, as the immune system is attacking harmless substances. Check into NSC Nutritional Science company & NSC Beta Glucan, which can help to modulate the immune response..
