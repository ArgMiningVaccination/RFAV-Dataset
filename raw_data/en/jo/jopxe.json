HRSA is also responsible for oversight of the 340B Drug Discount Program. HRSA administers the following revolving loan programs: Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL), Nursing Student Loans (NSL), Primary Care Loans (PCL) and Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS). These programs are financed through revolving accounts (Federal Capital Contribution) and do not receive annual appropriations. Through these revolving fund accounts, funds are awarded to institutions that in turn provide loans to individual students. As borrowers pay back loans, the program's revolving account gets replenished, and the collected funds are then used to give out new loans in the following academic years. If the program's revolving ac- count has excess funds that will not be used to provide new loans, these excess funds are returned to HRSA. Funds returned to HRSA are then awarded to programs that are in need of additional funds.

Only mandatory funding will provide long-term stability and rectify chronic underfunding of the Indian Health Service. However, in the event that Congress is unable to enact the Administrations mandatory proposal, the Admin- istration continues to support advance appropriations, as the Administration proposed in the 2022 Budget and strongly supported in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Providing discretionary appropriations without advance appropriation would reverse substantial progress in upholding the federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations.

The agency has played a key role in protecting Americans from recent health emergencies including COVID-19, opioid overdose, Zika, and HIN1. Key programs of the CDC include immunization and respiratory diseases; HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STD, and tuberculosis prevention; emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases; chronic disease prevention and health promotion; public health and scientific services; injury prevention and control; environmental health; global health; programs that reduce the occurrence of birth defects and developmental disabilities; public health preparedness and emergency response; and cross-cutting CDC-wide activities and program support, including public health infrastructure. The FY 2024 Budget continues to increase foundational investments in core public health capacities that are essential to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies and to the effective and efficient func- tioning of public health systems. These include a request for $600 million for dedicated funding to invest in public health infrastructure and capacity, and $100 million to support the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which will sustain efforts begun in FY 2021 with COVID- 19 emergency supplemental appropriations. The FY 2024 Budget also provides $310 million for CDC to continue the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative, and $340 million to continue CDC's Public Health Data Modernization efforts. The FY 2024 Budget provides $353 million for global public health protection activities to protect Americans through partnerships and other activities that support public health capacity improvements in countries at risk for uncontrolled outbreaks of infectious diseases.

The funding for this program, including operating costs, was provided in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148).

AFFORDABLE INSURANCE EXCHANGE GRANTS ProgramandFinancing (inmillionsofdollars) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) provided amounts necessary to enable the Secretary to award grants to States to implement Health Insurance Exchanges beginning no later than March 23, 2011, and allowed for renewal of grants through January 1, 2015. The final round of grants was awarded to States in December 2014. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) created a grant program for state-based Mar- ketplaces established under section 1311(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. $20 million was awarded to 21 states and was available for the period of performance, which ran from September 10, 2021 through September 9, 2022 to enable state-based Marketplaces to modernize or update any system, program, or technology required to be compliant with ap- plicable federal requirements. COST-SHARING law, insurers are required to offer reduced cost-sharing to eligible, low-income consumers. The classification of CSRs as an entitlement pursuant to BBEDCA does not determine legal entitlement to a payment or benefit or availability of funding.COST-SHARING REDUCTIONS (Legislative proposal, subject to The proposals strengthen healthcare coverage and affordability by permanently extending enhanced premium tax credits and limiting cost-sharing for insulin. The proposals also build on existing consumer protections and improve access to behavioral health services by doing the following: requiring coverage of three behavioral health visits and three primary care visits without cost-sharing; limiting utilization management controls for behavioral health; amending MHPAEA to authorize the Secretaries to regulate behavioral health network adequacy for all plans and issuers; and creating a new standard for parity in behavioral health based on compar- ative analysis of reimbursement rates. RISK ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) established a permanent risk adjustment program for non-grandfathered plans in the individual and small group markets. Risk adjustment is budget neutral within each state and market, such that charges collected from plans with lower than average actuarial risk are used to make payments to plans with higher than average actuarial risk. Risk adjustment may be operated by a State, or by the Federal government in the event a State chooses not to operate risk adjustment. Payments and charges are made in the year following the plan year for which they are calculated.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assessed contributing entities a per enrollee fee to fund the reinsuranceprogram and made payments to issuers in the individual market for enrollees whose medical costs exceed a certain threshold, up to a reinsurance cap. The reinsurance program ended in FY 2017 and outlays in subsequent fiscal years reflect remaining payments, refunds, and allowable administrative activities.
