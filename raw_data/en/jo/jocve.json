The challenges in bringing the life-saving vaccine to community pharmacies include a shortage of airfreight capacity and exact handling requirements. As obvious as it seems, I had made terrible investments in buying a new pair of branded shoes and high-end lipsticks in preparation for a rewarding career after completing the MBA. With the current and ongoing needs for cold chain logistics, wiser investment choices would be buying logistics stocks like UPS, DHL and FedEx, who would expect an extended period of supernormal profits earning from vaccine delivery. Another segment is cold chain tracking and IoT sensors, which I believe will be vital to the success of a COVID-19 vaccine. Start-ups offering innovative solutions for temperature monitoring and tracking will attract the attention of investors. Temperature sensitivity Two of the leading vaccine candidates \u2014 from Moderna and Pfizer \u2014 require either frozen (minus 20\u00b0C) or ultra-frozen (minus 80\u00b0C) storage and transportation conditions, which need specialized equipment handling practices. The Covid-19 vaccine candidate from Johnson & Johnson is much more logistics friendly than the Pfizer or Moderna candidates. J&J expects to transport its Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, which began its phase 3 trials on September 23, to customer warehouses at 2-8 degrees C. That's about the temperature range of a standard refrigerator. It's also the temperature at which vaccines are traditionally stored and transported. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored below -70 Celsius, meaning it has to be packed in dry ice. Pfizer plans to supply 50 million doses globally this year (enough for 25 million people to get an initial shot and a booster three weeks later), and a further 1.3 billion doses next year. In terms of logistics, Pfizer will ship the frozen vials directly from its plants to the point of vaccination. Avoiding distributors takes a link out of the supply chain where potential temperature diversions could occur. Pfizer has designed a box to manage the temperature, which is tracked by GPS. Pfizer expects to load those boxes on a combined 24 trucks a day from Kalamazoo and Puurs, which will move roughly 7.6 million doses daily to airports. The company plans to take cargo space on an average of 20 flights a day on planes operated by FedEx, UPS, and DHL to fly the vaccines as close as possible to vaccination centers, ranging from large medical facilities to far-flung hospitals. The air carriers are also in line to handle the next leg of the vaccine's journey, trucking the doses to sites close to where they will be administered [[1]](http://file:///C:/Users/Dewi%20Tran/Desktop/Drive%20D/MBA%20study/COVID.docx#_ftn1). The logistics companies, UPS, FedEx, and DHL, are also getting ready to handle vaccines requiring cold storage. There are three ranges in the world of cold storage [[2]](http://file:///C:/Users/Dewi%20Tran/Desktop/Drive%20D/MBA%20study/COVID.docx#_ftn2): - 2-8 degrees Celsius. - Minus 20 degrees Celsius. - Minus 80 degrees Celsius. The first two ranges can be handled with special packaging that can maintain that temperature for 96 hours outside of a refrigerated location. But once it gets down to minus 80 degrees Celsius, dry ice is required to keep the shipment cold. At -80 Celsius, a human could probably survive for five seconds, even with a ski suit on. Thus, it is better off building a farm with stand-up freezers that are mobile. UPS has built two freezer farms, one in the Netherlands and one in the US, to house a total of 600 deep-freezers that can each hold 48,000 vials of vaccine at temperatures as low as -80C. Ultra-low-temperature freezers can typically cost from $10,000 to $15,000, which would amount to a minimum cost of $6 million for just the freezers on both farms. With the facilities' proximity to UPS air cargo hubs, the company will be able to provide overnight delivery to almost anywhere in the world. For transport and delivery, the vaccines will be handled like many other fragile medical supplies already shipped by UPS, packed into containers of frozen carbon dioxide - dry ice - that keep it cold while being moved between trucks and planes. DHL has also opened a new cold facility in Indianapolis, and FedEx has been adding freezers and refrigerated lorries [[3]](http://file:///C:/Users/Dewi%20Tran/Desktop/Drive%20D/MBA%20study/COVID.docx#_ftn3). Bottleneck at airports DHL estimates that to provide the world with 10 billion vaccine doses over the next two years would require 200,000 pallet movements on 15,000 flights [[4]](http://file:///C:/Users/Dewi%20Tran/Desktop/Drive%20D/MBA%20study/COVID.docx#_ftn4). The 10 billion dose estimate is based on 70% of the global population requiring vaccination to achieve herd immunity and an average of 1.8 doses per recipient. Putting in perspective, globally, manufacturers produce 5 billion vaccine doses annually, including 1.5 billion flu vaccines. Most vaccines will likely transport cross-border through airports. The International Air Transport Association concluded that just one dose each for 7.8 billion people would fill 8,000 747 cargo jets, based on the assumption that there is zero waste in the transportation process, which is probably not possible. However, dramatic cuts in passenger airline service in the face of the coronavirus pandemic have disrupted the pharmaceutical industry's supply chain, which relies on the room in the bellies of passenger jets to move drugs around the world quickly. Some 45 to 50 percent of freight typically moves in passenger jets, complementing dedicated cargo flights run by companies such as FedEx and UPS [[5]](http://file:///C:/Users/Dewi%20Tran/Desktop/Drive%20D/MBA%20study/COVID.docx#_ftn5). Shipment tracking & visibility With billions of vaccine doses needed, any loss due to cold transport or logistics issues is problematic. Typical spoilage rates for other vaccines during transport are at 5% to as much as 20% because of inadequate temperature control. Hence, getting cold storage shipping control just right is critical to the expansion of availability. [[6]](http://file:///C:/Users/Dewi%20Tran/Desktop/Drive%20D/MBA%20study/COVID.docx#_ftn6) Blockchain, cloud storage, and technology-enabled tracking and monitoring sensors provide real-time visibility into temperature changes \u2014 and an opportunity to intervene before damage is done. Without sensors, there's no understanding of what happens to the temperature once the pharmaceutical materials leave the labs or manufacturing facilities. Traditional data logger technology collects data, but by the time someone looks at it, it may be too late, and the material must be discarded. Dramatic drops in the cost of sensor technology are creating a boom in these intelligent supply chain technologies and the use of data. And when this kind of big data is overlaid with powerful analytics and machine learning, companies can then use it to track, optimize and predict their operations. They can accurately monitor and adjust the movement of goods to maximize efficiency and even simulate complex supply networks; and they can share information and work more closely with customers and other partners. During the height of the pandemic, we have seen logistics companies stepped up their efforts to transport tons of N95 masks and PPEs to the front-line workers. Will they again complete this Herculean task of delivering Covid-19 vaccines to billions of people "}
