In the first part of this thesis, I will present a technology called \"DNA-encoded antibody library (DEAL).\" In this approach, computationally derived, orthogonal ssDNA sequences are conjugated to antibodies specific for protein targets and cell surfac e markers. The resulting collection of conjugates is applied to a biological sample of interest, binds to their cognate antigens, and is detected after the co mplexes are hybridized to a gl ass substrate printed with spatially distinct complementary DNA seque nces. By using DNA assembly, the DEAL platform enables the simultaneous detection of the major classes of biological molecules, namely nucleic acids, proteins and cells. The second part of this thesis focuse s on the development of a cell sorting platform that can detect antigen-specific T cells called \"Nucleic Acid Cell Sorting (NACS).\" In NACS, ssDNA encoding is used to assemble peptide These assembled peptide/MHC mi croarrays are then used to sort mixed populations of antigen-specific T cells. This spa tially encoded scheme addresses the widespread desire for methods that allow th e multiplexed detection of antigen-specific T cells. The sensitivity and selectivity of NACS is similar to flow cytometry, demonstrated in key experiments with T cells derived fr om multiple sources, including endogenous and TCR-engineered T cells collected from cancer pa tients. Finally, this platform is used to vii monitor the persistence of cancer-specific T cells in peripheral blood collected from a patient undergoing T cellular immunotherapy. Lastly, a scheme for the detection of cell surface markers is presented. In this approach, DEAL and NACS conjugates prepar ed with UV labile ssDNA oligonucleotides are allowed to bind to target cell samples in solution. The ssDNA tags are released in solution by UV-induced photocleavage. The pr esence and expression of the cognate antigen is determined by collecting the pool of repor ter ssDNA tags followed by exponential amplification by PCR. A DEAL conjugate specific fo r the oncogene EGFR was used to determine the expression leve l of EGFR in a low-passage brain tumor primary cell line. The feasibility of using ssDNA-p/MHC complexes for detecting unique TCRs was also demonstrated. Finall y an experimental flow is described for integration with second generational high -throughput sequencing platforms for global and quantitative surface-ome profiling. viii Table of Contents

initial landmark studies demonstrating that cancer was caused by the deregulation of a few oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (1, 2) . Identification of these genes and their encoded protein products has ha d a tremendous impact on molecular medicine, leading to effective targeted therapies for certain cancers. For example, patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a bone marrow derived cancer, express the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL that is effec tively targeted by the mesylate breast cancer, of the membrane-bound receptor oncogene Her2/neu (ERBB2) predict response to the humanized monoclonal antibody therapeutic trastuzumab (8, 9). The clinical effectiven ess of targeted molecular therapies against certain types of cancer is a testament to th e progress in cancer research and medicine. 2 It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that for the majority of metastatic cancers, a single or few genes is insufficient in predicting tumor be havior and does not represent all necessary and sufficient target s for molecular therapy. Tumors are highly complex, dynamic, heterogeneous biological systems driven by series of genomic and epigenetic mutations that affect the ge nes controlling cell prol iferation, survival, invasiveness and motility. Typically, multiple primary genomic alterations are present within a single tumor with secondary mutations arising through genetic instability, enabling malignancies to develop resistance to drugs. For example, the majority of lung adenocarcinomas that respond to epidermal gr owth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (erlotinib and gefitinib) eventually develop resistance through selection of tumor cells expressing an EGFR variant containing a si ngle amino acid mutation that confers drug resistance (10-12). Pre-malignant tissue evolve in a multi-step process into tumors, each step highly sensitive to numerous interacting extracellular stimuli, including growth factors (13, 14), extracellula r matrix proteases (15, 16), physiological stresses (e.g., low oxygen levels (17, 18)) and cytokines (19). Ma ny sources contribute to the tumor milieu, including non-tumor, stromal cells found in the local architecture (20, 21) and immune cells that have infiltrated the tumor microe nvironment (19, 22, 23). Thus for a typical malignancy, a large number of genomic, pr oteomic, physiological conditions, and supporting cell types are involved. 3 1.2 Diagnostic challenges presented by cancer One of the goals of cancer diagnostics is to detect and monitor biological elements that are representative of the in teractions between the various components involved in a malignancy, and with the information be able to characterize the state of the system and/or generate network models with predictive features that would be of fundamental or therapeutic value ( Figure 1.1 ). The biological elements targeted are either directly involved in the malignanc y (e.g. over expression of EGFR), or are byproducts of the process (e.g. circulating tu mor DNA resulting from necrosis). Individually, they are referre d to as biomarkers. Curren tly, most FDA approved cancer diagnostic platforms focus on the detection of a single or few biomarkers and have been effective for several cancers for staging, monitoring, and prognosti cation (24). This pauci-parameter approach, however, is being revised because of the molecular Figure 1.1 Numerous components of tumor biology must be queried for informative diagnostics. Reciprocal interactions between the tumor microenvironment, tumor cell genome and tumor development drive the complex ity of cancer, presenting challenges for multi- parameter diagnostics. Adapted from (36). 4 heterogeneity of cancer\u2014the accuracy and coverage of diagnostic assays will be improved by adopting a multi-parameter systems approach, namely measure as many different biological elements as possible. The motivation is that a collection of biomarkers would produce a molecular signatu re that would provide a higher level of sensitivity and specificity for staging, treatment and prognostication. A number of studies reported in the lite rature have shown that global profiling approaches are effective in characterizing can cer. Differential gene expression studies have shown that diseased complex expression networks can be diffe rentiated from their healthy counterparts and can be used to pr edict patient survival and response to cancer therapies (25 28). Many of the proteins, genes and small molecules identified in these studies have spear-headed furt her investigations, including m echanistic studies (29) and the use of these targets as potential biomarkers (30 32). Other global profiling approaches investigating genomic alterations (33 34) and proteomic alterations (30, 35) have also been reported, although for the latter, studies have been impeded by the lack of proteome wide capture agents and lack of technologies to captu re all the proteomic functions concomitantly (36) (e.g. interactions involving prot ein-protein, protein-ligand, post-translational modifications). The adoption of a multi-parameter paradigm is compounded by the fact that most biological tissues collected from patients ar e small, making it challenging to execute large-scale analyses of the different classe s of biological molecules (e.g. cells, genes, proteins, metabolites). This has driven the mi niaturization of many di agnostic assays into integrated biochips. The be nefits of developing biochips are severalfold. First, integrated biochips are able to handle small amounts of tissue. This is important in 5 interfacing with tumor tissue derived from skinny-needle biopsies and other minimally invasive diagnostic procedures. Second, on- chip measurements can be highly parallel and multiplexed which is important in providing statistical certainty by repeated sampling. Third, chip-based devices can be manufactured with well developed processes borrowed from mature engineering disciplines (e.g. semiconductor fabrication) and are typically compatible with a host of common instrumentation (e.g. fluorescent microscopy), lowering costs and increasing accessibility. An example of a cancer diagnostic that has benefited from miniaturization is circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection. CTCs are cells shed from primary tumors and are in circulation at low levels in blood. The abundance of CTCs can be used to monitor the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. Current t echnologies for CTC detection rely on bead- based assays (37) but are plagued with lo w recoveries and low purity. Recently, two chip-based, microfluidic devices have b een reported which significantly increase recoveries and purities of CTC capture (38, 39). The robustness of one biochip enabled the correlation of CTCs levels with d ecreased or increased tumor burden and the identification of mutations through genomic sequencing of CTCs collected from the device (40). 1.3 DNA as an encoding element The utility of DNA as a chemical materi al has reached into many areas of active research, including nanomaterials (41 43), DNA computing (44), automated machines (45), and molecular electronics (46). In the arena of biological sensing involving mainly protein detection, technologi es and platforms that have been developed include immuno-6 PCR (47), rolling circle amplification (48) , d, multiplexed assays in whic h multiple detection events are encoded and then decoded simult aenously include immunophenotyping using transcription (51) and self-assembled chemical libraries (52). There are several reasons that makes DNA an attractive material and encoding element. First, the exquisite specificit y and favorable energetics of DNA base-pairing provides self-assembling properties, permiting complex 2-D and 3-D structures to be designed and predicted from linear primary sequences. Second, analagous to its endogenous function, unique DNA sequences can be used to store information, scaling exponentially to the length N of the polymer . Third, in its natural environment, DNA interfaces with a host of other biological el ements which can be exploited for molecular level control. For example, DNA can be specifically truncated with restriction endonucleases. Fourth, the production of DNA ol igonucleotides is triv ial, owing in large part to chemical automation. A wide variet y of unnatural chemical handles (e.g. primary amines, thiols), readouts (e.g. fluorophores), and modified bases (e.g. locked nucleic acids) are available for incorporation into a primary sequence, expanding the utility and applications of the polymer. Lastly, platfo rms to characterize DNA are robust, including sequencing, PCR, microarrays, and bioinformatic algorithms. 1.4 Thesis overview This thesis presents the developmen t of chip-based, DNA-encoded technologies to address the current multi-parameter challenges associated with in vitro cancer diagnostics. In Chapter 2, I will begin by introduci ng the development of an approach 7 called DNA-Encoded Antibody Libaries (DEAL) in which computationally derived, orthogonal ssDNA tags are conjugated to an antibody library where every antibody- specificity is uniquely encoded with a dis tinct ssDNA sequence. A library of DEAL conjugates is exposed to a bi ological sample, bind to their cognate antige n, and decoded spatially on a gla ss substrate printed with the complementary DNA sequences. I demonstrate the DEAL technique for; (1) the rapid detection of multiple proteins within a single microfluidic channel, and with the ad ditional step of electroless amplification of gold-nanoparticle labeled secondary antibodies, establish a detection limit of 10 fM for the protein IL-2; (2) the multiplexed, on-chip sorting of both immortalized cell lines and primary immune cells; and (3) the co-detec tion of ssDNAs, proteins , and cell populations on the same platform. By using a common assembly molecule, DEAL meets the diagnostic need for multi-parameter platfo rms able to manipulate and detect major subtypes of biological molecules (genes, proteins, cell membrane-bound markers). Moreover, this technique is fully integrable with fluidics, enabling the processing of small tissue samples. Chapter 2 has been taken in part from \u00a9 J. Am. Chem. Soc . 2007, 129(7) , 1959 67. Chapter 3 extends and develops the concept of cell sorting with DNA tags in the context of an important immunological proble m with clinical implications for cancer therapy, namely that of detecting an tigen-specific T cells. Through genetic recombination, T cells are capable of rec ognizing and engaging to cells presenting processed antigenic fragments, including anti gens presented by cance r cells. The ability of T cells to cull target populations of cells has been expl oited as an experimental cancer therapy by infusing patients with augmented and activated T cells specific for cancer 8 associated antigens (53) with documented T cell-induced tumor regr ession in subsets of patients with metastatic cancers (54, 55). Despite these promising trials, T ce llular immunotherapy is difficult to characterize fully because of technologi cal bottlenecks that do not allow the multi- parametric analysis of different antigen-specific T cells in small numbers. With the goal of highly multiplexed T cell detection, Chapter 3 will introduce technique called \"Nucleic Acid Cell Sorting (NACS)\" in which singl ers complementary-printed subs trate. Fully assembled p/MHC arrays are used to detect and enumerate T cells captured from cellular suspensions, including primary human T cells collected from cancer patients. Importantl y, T cell array binding is optimized by utilizing cysteine-engineer ed streptavidin (SAC) for ssDNA-p/MHC tetramer production, resulting in NACS p/MH C arrays that outperform conventional spotted arrays assessed by performance standards such as reproducibility and homogeneity. The versatility of using DNA tags is also exploited to enable selective detachment of T cells with restriction endonucleases. Demons trative experiments regarding NACS sensitivity, multiplexing and limit of detection are performed with cell lines and with T cells isolated from cancer patie nts. Lastly, I show an important clinical application of this technol ogy by monitoring the presence and abundance of a cancer- specific T cell population collected from a melanoma patient receiving cellular immunotherapy. Chapter 3 has be en taken in part from \u00a9 J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 2009, in press. 9 Cell surface proteins constitute an important subset of the cellular proteome, as these proteins are frequent targeted for mo lecular therapy, stag ing and for directing therapies. Chapter 4 presents current work on detecting cell membrane-bound proteins by amplification of encoded ssDNA tags. In this appro ach, are synthesized with photolabile ssDNA tags. Wh ereas in previous demonstrations, the ssDNA tags were employed as molecular tether s, in the cellular barcoding approach, the ssDNA tags are used as reporter molecules. After staining a population of cells with a library of DEAL/NACS conjuates, the ssDNA tags are released into solution via UV cleavage and collected for an alysis by PCR. The quantity of each unique ssDNA tag directly correlates to the presence and expres sion of the targeted cell surface markers. I demonstrate that this concept by detecti ng EGFR over-expression from a low-passage brain cancer cell line (GBM1600) relative to EGFR null Ju rkat human T cells. In addition, I show that different TCR specificiti es can be differentiate d by this technique by using NACS conjugates to detect the pres ence of a TCR specific for a melanoma- associated cancer antigen, MART-1. Lastly, experimental details will be presented to interface with second generation sequencing platforms for high throughput and quantitative analysis of the reporter barcode s for global cell surface-ome profiling. 10 1.5 References 1.

Particularly informative are studies that integrate both gene expression and proteomic data. Such multi-parameter data sets are beginning to reveal the perturbed regulator y networks which define the onset and progression of cancers (1-5). This new pi cture of cancer, and the emergence of promising new cancer drugs (6, 7) are placi ng new demands on clinic al pathology (8). For example, traditional pathology practices (i .e. microscopic analysis of tissues) do not distinguish potential responders from non -responders for the new cancer molecular therapeutics (9). Recent examples ex ist in which pauciparameter molecular measurements are being employed to iden tify potential responders to at least two 17 therapauetics (10-13). However, it is unlikely that single-parameter measurements will be the norm. Instead, the coupling of molecu lar diagnostics with molecular therapeutics will eventually require measurements of a multi-parameter (e.g. cells, mRNAs and proteins) biomarker panel that can be used to direct patients to appropriate therapies or combination therapies. Currently, the measurement of a multi-parameter panel of biomarkers from diseased tissues requires combinations of microscopic analysis, microarray data (14), immunohistochemical staining, west ern blots (8), and other me thods. The collected data is integrated together within some model fo r the disease, such as a cancer pathway model (15), to generate a diagnosis. Currently, performing these various measurements requires a surgically resected tissue sample. The he terogeneity of such biopsies can lead to significant sampling errors since various meas urements of cells, mRNAs, and proteins are each executed from different regions of the tissue. In this chapter, the DNA-encoded antibody library, or DEAL, approach ( Figure 2.1), is described as an important step towards executing a true multi-parameter analysis (cells, mRNAs and proteins) from the same mi croscopic region of ti ssue. We report on several key demonstrations for achieving this goal, including the rapid detection of proteins and protein panels over a broad dynamic range an d with a detection limit of <10 femtoM; the sorting of immortal and primary lymphocyte populations; the co-detection of cells, cDNAs, and proteins on the same platform, and the integration of our multi-parameter platform with microfluidic techniques. 18 Figure 2.1 Illustration of the DEAL method for cell sorting and co-detection of proteins and cDNAs (mRNAs). Unique DNA-Antibody conjugates are pr epared and then combined into a single solution where they recognize cognate antigens, including cell surface markers and proteins of interest. When introduced onto a conventional DNA microarray, parallel self assembly, according to Watson-Crick base pair ing, localizes the bound species to a specific spatial location allowing for highly multiplexed multi-parameter analysis. A key issue involved with a microfluidics- based multi-parameter assay is that the measurement of different classes of biomol ecules (or cells) typically requires different surface chemistries, and not all of them are co mpatible with each other or the fabrication steps associated with buildi ng the microfluidics circuitry. Conventional antibody arrays for protein detection or for panning cells (1 6) require immobilization of the antibody onto aldehyde, epoxy, maleimide, or hydrophobic solid supports (17-20). It is often difficult to preserve folded (active) antibody conf ormations due to surface induced denaturation which depends on many variab les including pH, ionic strength, temperature and concentration (21-23). This has spurred the development of alternative approaches to preserve the native confor mation of proteins including 3-dimensional matrixes 25), cuti nase-directed immobilization onto SAMs (26), and the coupling of biotinylated an tibodies onto streptavid in coated surfaces 19 (27). In addition, the arrays need to remain hydrated throughout the entire manufacturing process in order to prevent protein denatu ration (18). DNA microarrays, on the other hand, are typically electrostatic ally absorbed (via spottin g) unto amine surfaces. One option for detecting both DNA and proteins on the same slide would be to pattern both functional groups used to immobilize DNA and protein onto the same substrate, although this would significantly increase the comp lexity and engineering of the system. Alternatively, a compatible su rface may be an activated este r glass slide to which amine- DNA and proteins can both covalently attach. However, we have found that the loading capacity of these slides for DNA is diminish ed, resulting in poor signal intensity when compared with DNA printed on conventionally prepared amine slid es. In addition, unreacted esters are hydrolyzed b ack to carboxylic acids, whic h are negatively charged at normal hybridization buffers (pH 7), electrost atically reducing th e DNA interaction. Moreover, to interrogate cells and protei ns, the best surface to reduce non specific binding of cells while maintaining full antib ody functionality is acrylamide (28, 29), which is incompatible with DNA. By using DNA as a common assembly strate gy for cells, cDNAs, and proteins, we are able to optimize the s ubstrate conditions for high DN A loading onto the spotted substrates, and for complementary DNA loadi ng on the antibodies. This leads to highly sensitive sandwich assays for protein detecti on, as well as high efficiency cell sorting (compared with traditional panning). We also find that non-selective binding (biofouling) of proteins to DNA-coated su rfaces is reduced. Importantly, DNA coated surfaces can be dried out, stored or heated (overnight at 80o C), thus making them compatible with robust microfluidics fabrication. 20 DNA-labeled antibodies have been previous ly used to detect proteins (30-32), largely with the pendant oligomers serv ing as immuno-PCR tags (33, 34). DNA-tags have been used to direct the localization of proteins allowing assays to take advantage of spatial encoding, via several different read-o ut strategies (35-37). Conventional multi- well ELISA assays are capable of quantitatin g multiple proteins, but typically require separate sample volumes for each parameter. Optical multiplexing can expand this, but is limited by the number of non-spectrally overlapping chromophores. Spatial multiplexing, such as is used with DEAL, allows for the execution of many measurements on a small sample, since the num ber of different measurements is limited only by the patterning method utilized to prepare the cDNA array. Spotted antibody arrays (18), while potentially useful for pr otein detection and/or cell sorting, are not easily adaptable towards microfluidics-based assays, since the microfabrication process for preparing robust microfluidics devices of ten involves physical conditions that will damage the antibodies. Complementary DNA arrays are robust to such fabrication conditions. 2.2 Experimental Methods 2.2.1 DNA sequences for spatial encoding All DNA strands were purchased with a 5'-amino modification from the Midland Certified Reagent company. Sequences for sequences A1, B1, C1 and their respective complements A1', B1' and C1' are given in Table 2.1. sequences, designated as A3, B3, respective complements A3', B3' and C3' were designed following the paradigm outlined by Dirks et al. (38). Example input files 21 and output sequences can be found in the A ppendix A. The sequences are reported in Table 2.1. Table 2.1 DNA sequences for spatial encoding Name Sequence A3' CAG GAT B3 B3' 5'-NH 2-AAA CTA CTA C3 5'-NH 2-AAA AAA C3' 5'-NH 2-AAA mouse anti-Human Interleukin-2 and B33-2, respectively) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Prior to use, all antibodies were de salted, buffer exchanged to pH 7.4 PBS and concentrated to ~ 1mg/ml using 3000 MWCO spin filte rs (Millipore). acetone hydrazone in DM F (SANH, Solulink) was added to the antibodies at variable molar excess of (1000:1 to 5:1) of SANH to antibody. In this way the number of hydrazide groups introduced to the antibodies was varied. Separately, succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate in DMF (SFB , Solulink) was 20-fold molar excess to 5'aminated 26mer oligomers in PBS. This ratio of SFB to DNA ensured complete reaction of the 5' amine groups to yield 5' aldehydes. No further improvement in yield was observed for either the antibody and oligonucleotide coup ling reactions after 4 hours at room temperature. Excess S ANH and SFB were removed and samples buffered exchanged to pH 6.0 citrate buffer usi ng protein desalting spin columns (Pierce). A 20-fold excess of derivatized DNA was then combined with th e antibody and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. Non-coupled DNA was removed with size exclusion spin columns (Bio-Gel P-30, Bio-Ra d) or purified using a Pharmacia Superdex 200 gel filtration column at 0.5 ml/min isocra tic flow of PBS. The synthesis of DNA- antibody conjugates was verified by non-reducing 7.5% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE at relaxed denaturing conditions of 60 oC for 5 minutes, and visualized with a Molecular Imager FX gel scanner (Bio-Rad). Conjugation ns imaged similarly usin g appropriate excitation and emission filters. 23 2.2.3 Microarray Fabrication DNA microarrays were printed via standard methods by the microarray facility at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB\u2014Seattl e, WA) onto amine-coated glass slides. Typical spot size and spacing were 150 and 500 m, respectively. Poly-lysine slides were made in house. Blank glass slides were cleaned with IPA and water in a sonication bath for 10 minutes each. They were then treated with oxygen plasma at 150 W for 60 sec., and then quickly dipped into DI wa ter to produce a silanol terminated, highly hydrophilic surface. After drying them with a nitrogen gun, poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma P8920, 0.1% w/v, without d ilution) was applied to the pl asma treated surfaces for 15 minutes, and then rinsed off with DI wate r for several seconds. Finally, these treated slides were baked at 60oC for 1hr. These slides were th en sent to ISB and printed as described above. 2.2.4 Fabrication of Microfluidic Devices Microfluidic channels were fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using conventional soft lithographic techniques. The goal was to fabricate robust microfluidics channels that could be disassembled after the surface assays were complete for optical analysis. Master molds were made phot olithographically from a high resolution transparency mask (CadArt) so that the resu lting fluidic network consisted of 20 parallel channels each having a cross-sectional profile of 10 x 600 m and were 2 cm long. This corresponds to channel volumes of 120 nl. A silicone elastomer (Dow Corning Sylgard 184) was mixed and poured on top of the mol d. After curing, the PDMS was removed from the mold and sample inlet and outle t ports punched with a 20 gauge steel pin 24 (Technical Innovations). The mi crofluidic channels were then aligned on top of the microarray and bonded to the substrate in an 80oC oven overnight. 2.2.5 1o Antibody Microarray Generation and DEAL-Based Immunoassays Antibody microarrays were generated by fi rst blocking the DNA slide with 0.1% BSA in 3x SSC for 30 minutes at 37oC. The slides were washed with dH 2O and blown dry. A 30 l solution onjugates (3x SSC, l of each conjugate) was sandwiched to the array with a microscope slide, and incubated at 37oC for 4 hours. Arrays were then washed first in 1x SSC, 0.05% SDS at 37oC with gentle agitation, then at 0.2x SSC, then finally at 0.05x SSC. The slides were blown dry and scanned with a Gene Pix 4200 A two-color array scanner (Axon Instruments). For immunoassays, the DNA-encoded 1o (15 ng/ antigen (3 ng/l) and fluorescent 2o antibody (0.5 ng/ l) were combined in a single tube. After 2 hour incubation at 37oC, the formed antibody-antigen-antibody complexes were introduced to the microarrays as described above. Subsequent wash steps and visualization were identical. 2.2.6 Microfluidic-based assay procedures Microfluidic devices were interfaced w ith 23 gauge steel pins and Tygon tubing to allow pneumatically controlled flow rates of ~0.5 l/min. The assays were performed in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS), which was found to be better than 1x SSC and PBS. Each channel was blocked with 1.0% BSA in TBS prior to exposure to DNA-antibody conjugates or immunoassay pairs for 10 minutes under flowing conditions. After a 10 minute exposure to conjugates or antigens under flowing c onditions, channels were 25 washed with buffer for 2 minutes and the micr ofluidics disassembled from the glass slide in order to be scanned. Immediately prior to imaging, the entire slide was briefly rinsed in TBS, blown dry and imaged on an array scanner as described above. For the human IL-2 concentration series, primary DNA-anti body conjugates were laid down first on the surface, before exposure to antigen and sec ondary antibody. This was necessary because at lower concentrations of antigen, the signals decrease, due to the high ratio of antigen- unbound primary antibody competing with anti gen-bound primary for hybridization to the DNA array. By first exposing the arra y to the primary DNA-antibody conjugate, excesses were washed away before subse quent exposure to an tigen and secondary antibody, increasing signal. 2.2.7 Microfluidic Au amp lification methods Microfluidics-based Au amplification e xperiments were performed in a similar manner, with the notable exception that a biotin-secondary antibody was used instead of a fluorescently labeled antibody. Subsequen tly, Au-streptavidin (Nanoprobes) was introduced into each channel (3ng/ l) for 10 minutes, after which the channels were thoroughly rinsed with buffer. After remova l of the PDMS, the entire slide was then amplified with gold enhancer kit (Nanoprobes) according to manufacturer's protocol. 2.2.8 Analysis of DNA-encoded anti bodies by flow cytometry VL3 and A-20 cells were incubated for 20 min. on ice with 0.5 g PBS-3% FCS. Cells were also incubated with equimolar amounts of -CD90.2/FITC-DNA conjugates characterized by various FITC-DNA loadings. Cells 26 were washed once with PBS-3% FCS and then were analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCantoTM instrument running the BD FACSDivaTM software. 2.2.9 Cell capture, separation, and sorting methods Two murine cell lines, VL-3 T cells (thym ic lymphoma line (39)) and A20 B cells (mouse B cell lymphoma (40), purchased from ATCC) were engineered to express mRFP and EGFP, respectively, using standard retroviral transduc tion protocols. Antibodies against surface markers for each of these cell lines, -CD90.2 for VL-3 and -B220 for A20 (eBioscience), were encoded as desc ribed above with DNA strands A1' and B1', respectively. For sorting experiments, cells were passaged to fresh culture media [RPMI 1640 (ATCC) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 0.05 mM -mercaptoethanol at a concentration of 106 cells/100 l media and incubated with DNA-antibody conjugate (0.5 g/100 l) for 30 minutes on ice. Excess conjugate was removed from the supernatant after centrifugation, after which cells were resuspended in fresh media. Prior to cell incubation the microarray slide was passivated, to reduce non-specific cell a dhesion, by reaction of the residual amine groups with methyl-PEO 12-NHS ester (Pierce) 10 mM in pH = 7.4 PBS for 4 hours at room temperature. Cells were spread evenly ac ross the microarray surface and allowed to localize for one hour on ice. After this pe riod, non-adherent cells were removed with gentle washing with room temperature Tris-buffered saline solution including 1 mM MgCl 2. Cell enrichment experiments were performed identically except that all incubation steps were performed in the presen ce of a 1:1 mixture of both T- and B-cells (each at 106/100 l). 27 Primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were pur ified from EGFP and dsRed transgenic mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratories), respectively, using sta ndard magnetic bead negative selection protocols and the BD IMag TM cell separation system. Prior to DEAL- based fractionation, the purity of these populat ions was analyzed by FACS and found to be greater than 80%. Simultaneous cell, gene and protein experiments were performed similarly to those as previously described on a PEGyla ted microarray substrate. Briefly, GFP- expressing B cells (106/100 l) were located on B1 spots after labeling with -B220-B1' (0.5 g/100 l). Following removal of non-adherent cells, a TNF- ELISA pair with C1'- encoded 1o and APC-labeled 2o antibodies were introduced along with 0.5 ng/ l FITC- labeled A1' and allowed to hybridize for a pe riod of 30 minutes at room temperature. The slide was then rinsed with TBS+MgCl 2 and visualized via brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. Homogeneous and panning cell experiments we re performed in parallel. For the homogenous cell capture process, 5x106 Jurkats (ATCC) suspended in 1 ml of RPMI media along with 5 g of -CD3/C3' conjugates and incu bated on ice for 1 hour. Excess conjugates were removed by centrifugation and the Jurkats were resuspended into 200 l of fresh media before exposur e to the DNA microarray. After 1 hour incubation on ice, the slides were rinsed gently with TBS. The cell panning experime nts were performed in parallel; 5 ug of -CD3/C3' conjugate in 1 ml RPMI media was incubated on a microarray for 1 hour on ice before rinsing in 0.5x PBS, then deionize d water. The slide was not blown dry, but gently tapped on the si de to remove the majority of the excess 28 solution, keeping the arra y hydrated. Jurkats (5x106/200 L) were immediately placed on the array for one hour on ice. Subsequent wash and visualization steps are identical. 2.3 Results and Discussion 2.3.1 In silico design of orthogonal DNA oligonucleotides The pendant DNA oligonucleotides were designed de novo in order to minimize inter- and intra-strand cross hybridization. We followed the paradigm outlined by Dirks et al. (38) to computationally derive a set of orthogonal 30mers. These sequences were designed with a polyA 10 sequence followed by a variable 20mer encoding region. The polyA 10 stretch was incorporated to provide mol ecular flexibility and to prevent steric hindrance between the 20mer encoding region and the antigen binding domains of the antibody after conjugation. Three sequences , designated A3-C3 were generated using this approach and were tested empirically. Identical cDNA arrays printed with A3, (green), A3'+B3' (red), and A3'+C3' (red). Minimal noise was obs erved between the probe sequences and noncomplementary spots ( Figure 2.2) . We performed initial DEAL experiments with sequences A1-C1 before determining that a rational design of the sequences was necessary to minimize noise. Therefore the ma jority of the experime nts outlined in this chapter are presented us ing sequences A1-C1. One advantage of using DNA oligonucle otides as molecular addresses is modularity. One working orthogonal set of sequences that has been experimentally validated can be used interchangeably with distinct sets of antibody libraries without modification of the underlying cDNA micr oarray. This feature allows 29 Figure 2.2 DNA sequences derived from computation minimize cross hybridization. (A) Fluorescent scans of three identical cDNA arrays probed with different combinations of fluorescent complementary strands. (B) Intensity profiles of the arrays 2.3.2 Generation of DNA-Antibody conjugates Chemically modified antibodies to aid in protein immobilizati on and/or detection are nearly universal for use in immunoassays . Such labeling introduces the risk of detrimentally affecting antibody function; ho wever, that risk can be reduced by minimizing the size, and thus the steric hindranc e, of the pendant moieties. With this in mind, we employed a covalent conjugation stra tegy in which 5'-aminated to antibodies via a hydrazone linkage (31), as shown in Scheme 2. Using commercially available reagents, an aldehyde functionality was introduced to the 5'-aminated oligonucleotide via succinimide chemistry. Similarly, a hydrazide moiety was introduced via reaction with the lysine side chains of the respective antibody. DNA-antibody conjugate formation was then facilitated vi a stoichiometric 30 hydrazone bond formation between the alde hyde and hydrazide f unctionalities. Conjugate formation and control over DNA- loading (41) was verified by PAGE electrophoresis, as shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3 Illustration of the two step coupling strategy utilized to prepare DEAL antibodies. In parallel, hydrazide groups are introduced onto a monoclonal antibody and 5' When combined, hydrazone bonds are formed, linking the ssDNA to the antibody. At bottom right is a gel mobility shift assay showing varied oligomer (strand A1') loading unto -human IL-4. By varying the stoichiometric ratios of SANH to antibody (lanes I-IV corresponds to 300:1, 100:1, 50:1, 25:1 respectively), the average number of attached oligonucleotides can be controlled. Clearly the adverse steric effects of ta gging antibodies with oligonucleotides are of concern when performing various assa ys, such as the immunoassays and cell sorting/capture experiments described herein. For this reason, we investigated the ability of DNA-encoded antibodies to re tain recognition of cell surface markers, as visualized by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). By using a fluorophore covalently tagged to the DNA, but not the antibody, FACS was used to optimize DNA-loading for the DEAL conjugates. For the analysis, 5' aminated, 3' FITC-labeled DNA as tagged unto - CD90.2 antibodies at various stoi chiometric (5:1, 300:1). This produced, on average, c onjugates with 1, 2, 3, 4-5 and 6-7 strands of 31 FITC-DNA respectively, as measured by gel mobility shift assays ( Figure 2.3). These conjugates were tested for their ability to bind to the T cell line VL3 (CD90.2 expressing), by monitoring the FITC fluorescence with the flow cytometer. The B cell line A20 (CD90.2 negative) was used as a ne gative control. The performance of the conjugates was also compared with commercially available FITC -CD90.2. The results are shown in Figure 2.4 . The histogram of the mean fl uorescent intensities for various FITC-DNA loadings shows that fluoresce nce increases are roughly linear when the number of DNA strands is increased from 1 to 2 to 3, corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 chromophores (1 per strand). At higher load ings, the increase in fluorescence first plateaus (4-5 oligomers) and then decrease s up to the highest load ing (6-7 oligomers). Thus, excess DNA labels (4-7 oligomers) did ster ically reduce the abi lity of antibodies to recognize cell surface markers. Optimal lo ading for cell surface marker recognition was achieved with antibodies synthesized with the 50:1 SANH:antibody ratio, corresponding to approximately three DNA strands per antib ody. Subsequent cell sorting experiments were performed in consideration of this ob servation. When compared with the FITC - CD90.2 control, the DNA antibody conjugates had reduced fluorescence by a factor of 10 and slightly higher nonspecifi c binding to A20 cells. 32 Figure 2.4 Optimization of DNA loading of DEAL antibodies for cell surface marker recognition. (a) FACS plot comparing -CD90.2/FITC-DNA conjugates with the commercially available FITC -CD90.2 antibody (no DNA). The conjugates bind to VL3 cells (100%) with minimal non-specific interactions with A 20 (1.3%). When compared with FITC -CD90.2, the overall fluorescent intensities are lower by a factor of 10, with slightly higher non-specific binding to A20. (b) Histogram of the m ean fluorescent intensities for various FITC-DNA loadings. Fluorescence increases are roughly linear when the number of DNA strands is increased from 1 to 2 to 3, corresponding to the 1, 2 and 3 chromophores (1 per strand). For higher loadings, the fluorescence plateaus and then decreases. 33 This could be due to a couple of reasons. A likely factor is that the stoichiometric ratio of fluorophore to antibody for the DEAL conjugates versus the commercial antibody is different. For the DEAL conjugates, each strand of DNA is attached to one fluorophore only (i.e. conjugates with one DNA strand has a fluorophore to antibody ratio of 1:1) whereas the commercial an tibodies generally have more than one fluorophore per antibody (i.e. fl uorescent antibodies have a fluorophore to antibody ratio >1). Thus the factor of 10 less fluorescence should not be st rictly interpre ted as a 10x reduction in the binding affinity of the DEAL conjugates, although it is possible that the oligomer steric effects discussed earlier do account for some reduction in relative fluorescence intensity. Direct measurement of the affinity of the DEAL conjugate compared with the corresponding unmodifi ed antibody using methods like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) will be more conclusive. 2.3.3 Multiplexed protein detection by DEAL We demonstrated the DEAL concept fo r spatially localizing antibodies using three identical goat anti-human IgGs, each bearing a different molecular fluorophore and each encoded with a unique DNA strand. A so lution containing all three antibodies was then introduced onto a microarray spotted with complementary oligonucleotides. After a two hour hybridization period and substrat e rinse, the antibodies self-assembled according to Watson-Crick base-pairing, conve rting the >900 DNA a multi-element antibody microarray ( Figure 2.5 ). This observation implied that quite large antibody arrays can be assembled in similar fashion. 34 Figure 2.5 Spatially encoded protein array. Three biochemically identical goat -human IgG (labeled with Alexa488, Alexa594, or Alexa 647 dy es) were tagged with oligos A1', B1' and C1' respectively. After a 2 hour incubation, antibod y/DNA conjugates were localized to specific sites dictated by the underlying DNA microarray. Scale bar corresponds to 1 mm. The ultimate size of any protein array, however, will likely be limited by interference from non-specific binding of pr oteins. In an effo rt to visualize the contributions of non-specific binding, three antibodies were simila rly introduced onto a microarray: two antibodies having co mplementary DNA-labeling spotted oligonucleotides and a th ird unmodified antibody ( Fig. 2.6). For demonstr ation purposes, the slide was not thoroughly rinsed follo wing hybridization a nd accordingly a high background signal due to non-specific adsorption of non-encoded fluorescently-labeled antibody was observed. The spotted nucleotide regions, to which no antibody was chemically encoded, displayed much less non-specifically attached protein, implying that 35 DNA greatly diminishes active area biofouli ng. Such retardation of biofouling is reminiscent of are functiona lized with polyethylen eglycol (PEG) (41-43). By analogy with postulated mechanisms associated with PEG (44-46), we hypothesize that the hydrophilic nature of the spotted olig onucleotides minimizes interactions with hydrophobic portions of proteins often exposed during non-specific adsorption. Conjugate hybridization experiments were al so carried out within 5 degrees of the calculated duplex melting temper atures, taking advantage of Watson-Crick stringencies and thus diminishing non-complementary DNA in teractions. In any case, this reduced biofouling means that the DEAL method can lik ely be harnessed to detect reasonably large panels of proteins with in a single environment. Figure 2.6 Illustration of the resistance of the DEAL approach towards non-specific protein absorption. A microarray was simult aneously conjugates and goat -human IgG-Alexa594 with no pendant DNA. When the arrays were not fully blocked and/or rinsed, non-specific binding was observed on the surface of the glass slide, but not on the non-complementary spots of printed DNA, i.e., spot B1 did not have fluorescence from non-complementary IgG conjugates nor did it exhibit fluorescence from proteins not encoded with DNA (goat -human IgG-Alexa594). Scale bar corresponds to 1mm. 36 2.3.4 Detection of multiple proteins wi thin a single microfluidic channel Microfluidic-based assays offer advantages such as reduced sample and reagent volumes, and shortened assay times (47). For example, under certain operational conditions, the surface binding assay kinetics are primarily determined by the analyte (protein) concentration and th e analyte/antigen binding affin ity, rather than by diffusion (48). We evaluated a microfluidic s-based DEAL approach by bonding a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microflu idic channel on top of a DNA (Figure 2.7A ). We initially performed a multip lexed antibody localization experiment, similar to that described above. The antibody conjugates self-assemble d at precis e spatial locations encoded by the pendant oligonucleotide in <10 minutes ( Figure 2.7B ), consistent with the time scales reported on DNA hybridization in mi crofluidics (49-51). Figure 2.7 Protein array assembled in microfluidics in 10 minutes. (A) Picture of PDMS microfluidic device encapsulated a DNA array (yellow box) (B) Two goat -human IgG (labeled with Alexa594 or Alexa 647) were tagged with oligos A1' and B1' respectively and introduced into a microfluidic device bonded on top of a DNA microarray with corresponding complementary strands A1 and B1 along with non-complementary strand C1. No DEAL conjugate encoded to spot C1 was added. After flowing at ~0.5 l/min for 10 minutes, the 37 microfluidic PDMS slab was removed and the glass slide imaged. The dashed lines delineate separate microfluidic channels of 600 m width. To validate the DEAL strategy for protein detection, we utilized encoded antibodies to detect cognate antigens in a variant of standard immunoassays. In a standard immunoassay (52), a primary an tibody is adsorbed onto a solid support, followed by the sequential introduction and incu bation of the antige n-containing sample and secondary labeled \"read-out \" antibody, with rinsing steps in between. In order to simplify this conventional five step imm unoassay, we reasoned that the encoding power of the DEAL antibodies could serve to position the entire sandwich complex to the appropriate location for multiplexed readout, redu cing the assay to a single step. To test this concept, in the same solutio n, a non-fluorescent, DNA-encoded 1o antibody was combined with antigen and a fluorescently-labeled (no DNA) 2o antibody. Under these conditions, a fluorescent signal will be spatially encoded only if an antibody-antigen- antibody sandwich is successfully formed in homogeneous solution and localized onto the microarray. Upon introduction of DNA-en coded antibodies against two IFN- and TNF- , cognate DEAL sandwich assays self-assembled to thei r specific spatial locations where they were detected, as shown in Figure 2.8 . This multi-protein immunoassay also took 10 minutes to complete. 38 Figure 2.8 DNA-templated protein immunoassays executed within microfluidic channels. The 600 m micrometer wide channels are delineated with white dashed lines. (a). Two parameter DEAL immunoassay showing the detection of IFN- at spot A1 with a PE labeled 2o antibody (green channel) and replicate detection of TNF- at spots B1 and C1 with an APC labeled 2o antibody (red channel). (b) Human IL-2 concentration series visualized using a fluorescent 2o antibody for detection. (c) Human IL-2 concentration series developed using Au electroless deposition as a visualization and amplification strategy. We explored the sensitivity limits of a microfluidics, DEAL-based sandwich immunoassay, using a third interl a fluore scent readout strategy, the assay peaked with a sensitivity limit of ar ound 1 nM on slides printed at saturating concentrations of 5 M of complementary DNA. Severa l strategies were employed to increase the sensitivity. First, we reasoned that increasing the loading capacity of the glass slide for DNA will increase the dens ity of DEAL conjuga tes localized and therefore, increase the number of capture events possible. Conventional DNA microarrays are printed on primary amine surfaces generated by reacting amine-silane 39 with glass (53). DNA strands are immobilized through electrostatic interactions between the negative charges on the phosphate backbone of DNA and the positive charges from the protonated amines at neutral pH conditions . To increase the loading capacity of the slide, we generated poly-lysine surfaces, incr easing both the charge density as well as the surface area of interaction with DNA. By adopting these changes, it became possible to print complementary DNA at saturating concentrations of 100 M on the glass slides. Correspondingly, the sensitivity of the fluores cent based assays increased to 10 pM (Figure 2.8b ). In addition, we chose to employ Au nanoparticle-labeled 2o antibodies, followed by electroless metal deposition (54), to further amplify the signal and transform a florescence based read out to an optical one. This is possible since spatial, rather than colorimetric multiplexing, is utilized. Adop ting these improvements, the presence of IL- 2 interleukin can be readily detected at a concentration limit less than 10 fM ( Figure 2.8c), representing at least a 1000-fold sensi tivity increase over the fluorescence based microfluidics immunoassay. In comparison, this method is 100-1000-fold more sensitive than conventional ELISA (55), and 150 time s more sensitive than the corresponding human IL-2 ELISA data from the manufacturer (56). In performing these experiments, the idea of a 1 step immunoassay was revised. The sensitivity of the assays was reduced when performing a 1 step immunoassay, especially at lower concentrations of antigen. This is most likely due to competitive binding between DEAL conjugates with and without cargo for hybridization unto the underlying DNA microarray. By sequentially exposing the array to DEAL conjugate, antigen, and then secondary antibody, the sensitiv ities were increased. This is a clear trade off between convenience and sensitivity. It should still be stressed however, that 40 maximum signal is still reached under microf luidic flowing conditions within 10 minutes for each step. Thus in a fully automated device, a complete microfluidic immunoassay with sensitivities down to 10 fM can be obtained in 1 hour (including a 30 minute step for Au amplification). In addition to the sample size and time-scale benefits that accompany this type of microfluidics immunoassay, there are other advantages. For exampl e, since the entire assay is performed in solution prior to re ad-out, protein denatu ration (a concern for spotted antibody microarrays) does not reduce bi nding efficiency. In addition, any assay that involves substrate-supporte d antibodies, would not have su rvived microfluidic chip assembly (which involved an extended bake at 80oC). That procedure was designed to yield robust PDMS microfluidics channels that could then be disassembled for the optical readout step. Another benefit of performing so lution phase assays is that the orientational freedom enjoyed by both the antigens and antib odies ensures that the solid suppo rt will not limit the access of analytes to the binding po cket of the capture agent. We explore this issue in further detail below in the section of cell sor ting. Other improvements, such as reducing the DNA spot size (57), and re moving spot redundancy are currently being investigated to further lower detection limits. 2.3.5 Multiplexed sorting of immortalized and primary immune cells We extended the DEAL technique for multiplexed cell sorting. The most common method for cell sorting is FACS, which is well-suited for many applications. Unfortunately, cells separated by conventiona l FACS are not immediately available for post-sorting analysis of gene and/or protein expression. In addition, FACS is also limited by the number of spectrally distinct fluorophores that can be utilized to label the cell 41 surface markers used for the sorting. FACS, however, is robust in sorting cells according to multiple cell surface markers. Amongst other alternative cell sorting strategies, the traditional panning method, in which cells in teract with surface marker-specific antibodies printed onto an underlying substrate ( 58), is particularly relevant. Panning is capable of separating multiple cell populations, but has the same limitations as conventional spotted protein microarrays, namely that antibodies are not always oriented appropriately on a surface, and they can also dry out and lose functionality. DEAL overcomes this limitation, by keeping all reagents in solution. We compared DEAL-based cell sorting with panning by evaluating homogeneous cell capture (solution phase cell capture) a nd heterogeneous capture of cells (surface confined cell capture). The homogeneous DEAL method exhibite d higher cell capture efficiency as shown in Figure 9a,b . The increase in capture efficiency can be attributed to several factors. In homogeneous cell capture, the DEAL conjugates are allowed to properly orient and bind to the cell surface mark ers in solution. Cell capture is not driven by antibody to cell surface marker interactions, but rather by the increased avidity of the multivalent DEAL conjugates for the comple mentary DNA strands on the microarray through cooperative binding, greatly increasing capture efficiency. Similar trends have been reported for nanoparticle, DNA hybridization schemes (59). With this process, it is typical to see a DNA spot entirely occupied by a confluent layer of cells. With panning methods, which are analogous to our (heteroge neous) DEAL defined arrays, the capture agents are restricted to adopt a random or ientation on the surface. The activity of the antibodies is reduced, simply because of improper orientation for interaction with the cell 42 surface markers, decreasing maximum avidity and cooperation with neighboring antibodies. Figure 2.9 Optimization and use of DEAL for multiplexed cell sorting. Panels a and b are brightfield images showing the efficiency of the homogeneous DEAL cell capture process. (a) DEAL labeled antibodies are first assembled onto a spotted DNA array, followed by introduction of the cells. This heterogeneous process is si milar to the traditional panning method of using surface bound antibodies to trap specific cells. (b) A homogeneous assay in which DEAL labeled antibodies are combined with the cells, and then the mixture is introduced onto the spotted DNA array microchip. This process is clearly much more efficient. Brightfield and fluorescence microscopy images of multiplexed cell sorting experiments where a 1:1 mixture of mRFP- expressing T cells (red channel) and EGFP-expres sing B cells (green channel) is spatially stratified onto spots A1 and B1, corresponding to the encoding of -CD90.2 and -B220 antibodies with A1' and B1', respectively. (c) Fluorescence micrograph of multiplexed sorting of primary cells harvested from mice. A 1:1 mixture of CD4+ cells from EGFP transgenic mice and CD8+ cells from dsRed transgenic mice are separated to spots A1 and C1 by utilizing DEAL conjugates -CD4-A1' and -CD8-C1', respectively. We also investigated the use of DEAL for multiplexed cell sorting. Two unique DNA strands were conjugated to antibodies raised against the T cell marker CD90.2 (Thy1.2) and the B cell marker CD45R (B220), respectively. Multiplexed DEAL-based cell sorting was demonstrated by spatially separating a 1:1 mixture of monomeric Red (VL-3, murine thymic lymphoma) and EGFP-expressing B cells (mouse B cell ly mphoma). This mixture was incubated 43 with uniquely encoded DNA-antibody conjugates against both T and B cell markers and introduced to an appropriately spotted microarray. Figure 2.9c shows both brightfield and false color fluorescence micrographs demo nstrating that the mRFP-expressing T cells are enriched at spots A1 and EGFP-expressing B-cells located at B1, consistent with the DNA-encoding of the respective antibodies. Primary cells are usually more fragile than established cell lines. This is due to the fact that they have to be ex tracted (usually by enzymatic di gestions) from the surrounding tissues, a process that can lead to decreased viability. Moreover, the culture process often selects for clones characterized by greatly increased viability as well as proliferation potential. A generalized cell sorting technology must ther efore also work on primary cells with minimal sample manipulation. To demonstrate the utility of DEAL for primary cell sorting, a synthetic mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was isolated via magnetic negative depletion from EGFP- and dsRED- transgenic mice, respectively. The mixture was stratified using -CD4 and -CD8 DNA-antibody conjugates. As shown in Figure 2.9d, the two cell types were separated to diffe rent spatial locations according to the pendant DNA encoding. 2.3.6 Single environment detection of specific cDNAs, proteins and cells To highlight the universal diversity of th is platform, GFP-expressing B cells were tagged with B1' DNA-encoded antibody conjugates and spatially loca ted onto spots (B1) encoded with the complementary oligonucleotide. Post cell localiz ation, FITC-labeled A1' DNA and a C1'-encoded TNF- immunosandwich, were combined and introduced to the platform. The resu lting brightfield and fluorescence microscopy 44 images, shown in Figure 2.10 , demonstrate the validity of the DEAL platform for simultaneously extending across differen t levels of biological complexity. Figure 2.10 Microscopy images demonstrating si multaneous cell capture at spot B1 and multi-parameter detection of genes and proteins, at spots A1 and C1, respectively . The brightfield image shows EGFP-expressing B cells (green channel) located to spots B1, FITC- labeled (green) cDNA at A1, and an APC-labeled TNF- sandwich immunoassay (blue) encoded to C1. The scale bar corresponds to 300 m. 2.4 Conclusions By utilizing DNA as a universa l linkage we have demonstrated a platform capable of simultaneous cell sorting, ssDNA and protein detection. DEAL represents a promising approach for the large scale, multi-parameter analysis of biological samples. We are currently applying DEAL toward s the separation of highly co mplex primary cell mixtures such as whole mouse spleen and whole mouse thymus extracts. In addition, microfluidics-based DEAL immunoassays arra ys are currently being harnessed for the analysis of protein biomarke r panels from mouse whole- blood. We are particularly interested in integrating DEAL with advan ced, on chip tissue handling tasks followed by simultaneous quantitation of mRNAs and proteins, because this is where DEAL can 45 potentially assist in pathological analysis of cancerous tissu es. From a more fundamental cancer biology perspective, a near-term target ed application is the capture and functional evaluation of tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (28, 61). Such an application requires both rare cell capture, cell activation, and the subs equent detection of secreted proteins. For such problems, DEAL has the po tential to eliminate any adverse effects of sample dilution and can thus greatly simplif y the analysis of the biological system. 46 2.5 References 1.

By relaxing the denaturing conditions, a sample heated at 60o for 5 minutes (minimum requi red for good gel) showed up to 7 discrete bands, whereas the same sample heated at 100o for 5 minutes showed no pendant oligonucleotides. 42.

Computational derivation of Orthogonal DNA oligomers There are several applications of the computational algorithm developed by Dirks et al. (38). First it can accept a list of sequences ( A, B, C, ... n ) and return with an exhaustive file listing the relative interac tion strengths between any two DNA sequences. This value, reported as n(s*), roughly represents the orthog onality of the two sequences that are being compared. As an example, sequences A1, B1 and C1 (inputs as A, B, and C respectively) were analyzed and the results are listed in Appendix 2.6.1 . Here, the interaction strength of sequence B with B, representing intra-strand interactions, has the lowest n(s*)value of 7.525723 , and thus is the most orth ogonal pair. In comparison, the interaction strength of An with An (n represents the complement operator) has the highest n(s*) value of 16.406083 and thus is the least orthogonal pair. A good measure of the global orthogonality of a set of sequences is determined by the set with the lowest n(s*). Besides analysis, a set of sequences can be generated by inputing a set of constraints (e.g. sequence length, defined se quences, etc.) and the program will return with a set of sequences ranked according to n(s*) adhering to the given constraints. An example of this is given by the input file shown in Appendix 2.6.2 , where the input code asks for 3 orthogonal sequences ( A, B, and C ) such that each sequences begins with a polyA 10 header before a variable 20mer region. The set of sequences (truncated to show only 3 sets of 10 total) with the lowest n(s*) value of 149.225 was taken and defined to be A3, B3 and C3, the sequences used in this chapter ( Appendix 2.6.3 ).

They recognize a diversity of antigens through th e highly variable, hetero-dimeric T cell receptor protein (TCR), with approximately 107 different antigen spec ificities (1). The initiation of the T cell immune response is tr iggered by the engagement of the TCR with processed antigenic peptides (e.g. from a bacterial pathogen) th at are bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (p/MHC) molecu les presented on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), leading to downstream T cell proliferation and maturation into effecter populations. After pathogen clearance, a subset of the activated T cells transition into memory cells, providing the immune sy stem with the capacity for rapid response 62 towards previously encountered pathogens. As a consequence, an individual's collection of T cells and their antigen specificities, coll ectively called the T cell repertoire, is an evolving, extensive repository of cellular i mmune responses against self and foreign antigens. It is of fundament al and therapeutic importance to detect and survey these T cell populations. The development of soluble p/MHC tetramers for labeling antigen-specific T cells has enabled the direct phenotypic analysis of antigen-specific T cell populations with flow cytometry (2). Conventionally, p/MHC tetramers are prepared by mixing p/MHC monomers have low affinities (2, 3), their tetramer counterparts exhibit much higher avidity, permitting T cell detection via flow cytometry to become a standard assay. However, because p/MHC tetramer-stained T cell populations are encoded optically (i.e. one unique fluorophore required per p/MHC specificity), the number of antigen-specificities that can be interrogated simultaneously within a population is limited by spectral ove rlap. In addition, serial flow cytometry detection of distinct antigen-specific T cells is genera lly restricted by sample size. Efforts to increase the degree of multiplexing generally revolve around polychromatic flow cytometry utilizing quant um dots (4, 5). However, co st, sample preparation time, and color compensation complexity al so increase corr espondingly. As an alternative to flow cytometry, several groups have reported microarray- based T cell detection schemes, in which collections of p/MHC complexes are printed on a supporting substrate (6-9). A population of cells is applied directly to the p/MHC array where target antigen-specific T cells bind to regions spotted with the cognate p/MHC and 63 are detected optically. Analogous to DNA and protein microarr ays, the readout of such assays is dependent on location rather than di stinct fluorescent signa ls, thus potentially increasing the degree of multiplexing. A factor that needs to be addressed be fore p/MHC arrays are used for broader studies and applications conc erns the reproducibility and robustness of p/MHC arrays produced by spotting onto treated and/or derivatized surfaces. Ideally p/MHC complexes should be immobilized such that their f unctional conformations are preserved. Analogous protein arrays produced via antibody adsorption to unmodified and derivatized surfaces can suffer from su rface induced effects including protein denaturation and protein adsorption in inactive orientations (10-12). To circumvent such problems, customized surfaces and relatively mild chemistries for protein immobilization have been developed (13-18). However, often the surface th at meets the demands of the application requires a high level of technical expertise and/or is limited in accessibility (19). We report here on the method of Nucleic Acid Cell Sorting (NACS), which is based upon the design and application of nucle ic acid assembled p/MHC tetramer arrays for p/MHC tetramers of distinct specificities are c onjugated to unique sequences of ssDNA in a site-specific fashion. A collection of ssDNA-tagged p/MH C complexes is then self-assembled by DNA hybridization onto a glass slide printed with the complementary DNA sequences. Fully assembled p/MHC tetramer arrays are used to sort mixed populations of antigen- specific T cells ( Figure 3.1 ). This strategy of using DNA pendants as molecular linkages (20-25) is simple and highly modular. Most importantly, T cell array binding is 64 optimized by utilizing cyst eine-engineered streptavid in (SAC) for ssDNA-p/MHC tetramer production, resulting NACS p/MH C arrays that outperform conventional spotted arrays assessed by performance criteria such as reproducibility and homogeneity. The versatility of using DNA tags is also exploited to enable selective detachment of T cells with restriction endonucleases. Demonstrative experiments regarding NACS sensitivity, multiplexing and limit of detecti on are performed with cell lines and finally with T cells isolated from cancer patients. Figure 3.1 Self-assembled ssDNA-p/MHC tetramer are produced by coupling ssDNA site- specifically to SAC prior to exposure to molar excess of biotinylated p/MHC monomers. p/MHC tetramer arrays are tetramers of select specificity and hybridization to a complementary printed ssDNA microarray. T cells expressing the cognate TCR are detected by binding to the surface confined tetramer. 65 3.2 Experimental Methods 3.2.1 Microarray Fabrication All DNA strands were purchased from IDT with HPLC purification. DNA microarrays were printed by the microarray facility at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB\u2014Seattle, WA) on amine-coated glass slides (GAPS II, Corning) in identical triplicate 12x12 arrays contai ning alternative rows of A, B and C spots, or A EcoRI and BBamHI with a SMPXB15 pin (Arrayit).

Briefly, transformed BL21(DE3)-pLysE cells were grown at 37oC with shaking in LB medium and selection antibiotics ampicilin and chlorophenicol. The cells were induced at OD600 = 0.6 with IPTG and kept spinning for another 4 hours. The culture was then cen trifuged at 1600g for 10 min and lysed with lysis buffer (2 mM EDTA, 30 mM Tris-HCl , 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). The insoluble inclusion bodies were then separated from the lysate by centrifugation at 39,000g for 15 min and dissolved in 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 1.5 to the original culture volume. The SAC lysate was then refolded by di alysis in 0.2 M Sodium acetate, 10 mM - mercaptoethanol ( -ME) pH 6.0 overnight before di alyzed against 50mM Sodium bicarbonate, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM -ME pH 11 in preparation for column purification. Refolded volumes of SAC were mixed 1: 1 with binding buffer (50 mM Sodium bicarbonate, 500 mM NaCl, 10mM -ME, pH 11). A gravity column packed with 1.5 ml of iminobiotin agarose resin (Pierce) was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer. The refolded mixture was then applied to the column and the eluted fractions were collected and reapplied to the column again, to ma ximize SAC recovery. After washing the 67 column with 20 ml binding buffer, SAC was eluted with pH 4 elution buffer (50 mM Sodium acetate, 10mM -ME). Fractions containing SA C, as monitored by OD280, were collected, buffer exchanged to PBS containing 10 mM -ME, and concentrated to 1 mg/ml final concentration using 10K mwco filters (Millipore). Immediately prior to conjugation, stock SAC was buffer exchan ged to PBS e hydrochloride, Solulink) in DMF was added to SAC at a molar excess of 300:1. In parallel, SFB in DMF (succinimidyl 4- formylbenzoate, Solulink) was added in a 40:1 molar excess to 5'aminated oligos. The mixtures were reacted at room temperatur e (RT) for 3-4 hours before buffer exchanged to citrate (50mM sodium citrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) us ing zeba columns. The SFB- labled oligos were combined in a 20:1 molar excess with the derivatized SAC and incubated overnight at RT. Unreacted oligos were removed using a Pharmacia Superdex 200 gel filtration column at 0.5 ml/min isocrati c flow of PBS. Fractions containing the SAC-oligo conjugates were concentrated using 10K mwco concentration filters (Millipore). 3.2.3 Preparation of T cells The cDNA from the alpha and beta chai ns of a TCR specific for tyrosinase368- 376 was a kind gift from Michael I. Nishimura (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The alpha and beta chains were cloned into a lentiviral vector where both transgenes were linke d by a 2A self-cleaving sequence as described ( 27). Concentrated supernatant from this lentiviral vector was used to infect Jurkat cells to generate Jurkat -Tyro cells. The MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retrovi ral vector expressing the F5 68 MART-1 TCR was a kind gift from Steven A. Rosenberg and Richard Morgan (Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute Bethesda, MD). The MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral supernatant was used to infect Ju rkat cells to generate the Jurkat-MART-1 cell line. The Jurkat-NY-ESO-1 cell line was a generous gift from Robert Prins (UCLA). To generate primary human T cell cultures expressing th e F5 MART-1 TCR, PBMCs obtained from leukapheresis were activated for 48 hours with 50 ng/ml (muromonab anti- was applied to retronectin-coated wells (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). Then activated PBMC in RPMI plus 5% human AB serum supplemente d by 300 IU of IL-2 were added to these wells and incubated at 37oC overnight at 5% CO2. On the following day, PBMC are transferred to a second set of pr e-coated retronectin retroviral vector ti ssue culture plates and incubated at 37oC overnight at 5% CO2. Cells were subsequently washed and re- suspended in culture media described above. Frozen leukapheresis fractions from patients NRA11, NRA 13 (UCLA IRB#03-12-023 ) and F5-1 (UCLA thawed and overnight in RPMI supplemented with human AB 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin (Omega Scientific). F5-1 were used immediately following incubation. g an AutoMACS machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following separation, the cells were kept at in RPMI- humanAB media containing 30 U IL2/mL. 69 3.2.4 T Cell Sorting Methods The HLA-A*0201 restricted from Beckman Coulter. Lipophilic cell membrane staining dyes DiO, DiD, and DiL were purchased from Invitrogen. Prior to experiments, microarray slides were blocked to prevent non-specific cell binding with 1 mg/ml PEG-NHS ester (Sunbio) in PBS for 2 hours at RT. Four-fold molar excess of p/MHC monomers we re combined with ssDNA-SAC at 37oC for 20 min. ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers were hybridized to DNA arrays for 1 hour at 37oC in 200 l media and rinsed with 3% FBS in PBS. T cells (106 /100 l media) were incubated on the array at 37oC for 30 min. The arrays were rinsed with 3% FBS in PBS and cell capture visualized via brightfield (Nikon Eclipse TE2000) and/or confocal Post T cell capture p/MHC tetramer staining was done by incubating the array with 200 l of media containing fluorescent p/ MHC were rinsed with 3% FBS in PBS prior to imaging. For selective T cell release experime nts, three identical arrays were used to immobilize cells. Treatment with EcoRI, Ba mHI, or DNase was in RPMI media for 1-2 hours at 37oC. DNase was purchased from Sigma, a ll other enzymes from NEbiolabs. 70 For p/MHC comparative studies, Supe rEpoxy and SuperProtein (representing covalent and hydrophobic surfaces respectiv ely) were purchased from Arrayit (Sunnyvale, CA). Amine GAPS II slides (electro static) were purchased from Corning. Polycarboxylate hydrogel (hydrophi lic) slides were purchased from XanTec MART-1 tetramers were printed a ccording to manufacturer's instructions for each slide. Cell sorting images were quantif ied with ImageJ (NIH) and fitted to the Hill Function (NACS n=2, R2=0.95, Covalent n=2.1, R2 =0.97) with Origin (OriginLab, 3.3 Results and Discussion 3.3.1 Rational design of ssDNA- encoded p/MHC tetramers The standard scaffold most frequently used to assemble p/MHC monomers into produced via chemical cross-linking, most functional groups are exhausted and/or modified, prohibiting the c onjugation of ssDNA. In addition, the attachment of molecular fluorophores to native SA reduces the binding capacity for biotin, an effect attributed to the modification of lysine121 th at occurs with amide coupling strategies. This residue is in close proximity to the lig and binding pockets (29, 30). To circumvent this, Altman and co-workers (29) employed a recombinant mu tant of SA for fluorescent p/MHC tetramer preparations. This varian t incorporates a cysteine residue at the carboxy-terminus (31), a site removed from the biotin binding pocket. The conjugation 71 of cysteine-reactive maleimide derivatives is restricted to the C-terminus because cysteine residues are absent in native SA. We expressed SAC, coupled the protein with 5'-maleimide ssDNA, and verified the formation of conjugates with mobility shift assays ( Figure 3.2 ). In parallel, ssDNA was coupled to native SA for direct compar ison. To test biotin (32), a molecular mimic of biotin with distinct optical density coe fficients dependent on whether biotin is bound to SA or not. A biot in:SA molar ratio of a ssociation significantly below 4 in the assay would indicate a reductio n in biotin binding capacity. Conjugates derived from native SA were greater than one full unit below the expected value (2.86 versus 4.0), while conjugates formed with SA C maintained near opt imal (3.7) binding capacity (Figure 3.2C ). These conjugates were then te sted across 4 different monoclonal T cell populations (2 human TCR-transduced cell lines and 2 muri ne TCR-transgenic splenocyte cell suspensions). ssDNA-tagged SAC constructs had markedly higher cell capture efficiencies ( Figure 3.3B) when compared with p/MHC tetramers prepared with SA ( Figure 3.3A ). All subsequent NACS tetramer s were prepared with the SAC variant. 72 Figure 3.2 An engineered variant of streptavidin expressing C-terminal cysteine residues has superior biotin binding capacity compared to native streptavidin post conjugation with ssDNA. (A) The various stages of SAC expression, refolding, and purification were analyzed on a denaturing PAGE gel. The molecular weight of a SAC monomer is ~12kDa. (B) A gel mobility shift assay to verify the formation of ssDNA- SAC conjugates. Individual bands representing SAC-oligo conjugates differing by one DNA stra nd can be resolved. Lower order SAC-oligo conjugates (1 -2 oligos per protein) run \"lighter\" when compared to unmodified SAC because of the difference in charge/mass density of nucle ic acids. Higher order SAC-oligo conjugates corresponding to 3 -4 DNA strands per SA were favored. (C) The molecule 2-(4'- Hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid (HABA) was used to determine the molar ratio of association of biotin to SA. Native SA-oligo conjugates bound ~2.9 moles of biotin per mole of SA, a significant decline when compared to the 4:1 ra tio of unmodified SAC. SAC-oligo conjugates maintained near optimum binding capacity (3.7:1). 73 Figure 3.3 T cell capture efficiency is op timal when utilizing ssDNA-SAC conjugates to generate NACS p/MHC tetramers (A) ssDNA-p/MHC constructs derived from native SA were used to sort 4 different human/murine tran sgenic T cell populations. The T cell capture efficiencies were highly varied amongst th e four T cell populations. (B) ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers derived from ssDNA-SAC conjugates were used to sort the four T cell populations. The resulting cell capture efficiencies were mark edly improved over native SA-oligo conjugates, 74 demonstrating that SAC is necessary for th e production of high affinity ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers. 3.3.2 Performance of p/MHC arrays produ ced via DNA immobilization and direct spotting We directly compared the performan ce of NACS with conventional direct spotting strategies on various model substrates. The substrates were selected to represent the spectrum of surface chemistries typically used to immobilize proteins (covalent, electrostatic, MART-1, on the substrates according to manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat-MART-1 T cells (the human T leukemia cell line Jurkat transduced with the F5 MART-1 TCR ( 33) specific for MART-1) were applied to the array and representative images collected ( Figure 3.4A ) and quantified ( Figure 3.4B ). We observed little to no T cell capture (electrostatic, hydrophilic) or significant noise (hydrophobic) on the majority of the surfaces investigated compared to NACS arrays immobilized with identical concentrations of p/MHC tetramers. T cell binding was observed on one surface (covalent) but cell capture was highly variable as evidenced by both intra-spot and inter-spot heterogene ity and cross experi mental variation (Figure 3.5). Moreover, to achieve equivalent T cell capture densities, NACS p/MHC arrays required >5 times less material than covalent immobilization. (p/MHC monomer at half max K 1/2 = ng for NACS and 5.7 ng for covalent immobilization). 75 Figure 3.4 Comparison of NACS versus spotted p/MHC arrays (A) Brightfield and fluorescent images of Jurkat-MART-1 T cells captured on various model substrates. (B) Quantification of T cell capture efficien cies (hydrophobic surface was excluded because signal:noise 1). Each data point was derived from three representative spots. The performance and repr oducibility of NACS p/MH C arrays is markedly improved and represents an integral step towards expanding array- based T cell detection schemes for broader applications. This likely has a few causes. First, surface-tethered ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers may enjoy greater orie ntational freedom at the surface/solution interface compared with adsorbed proteins whic h are required to conform to the surface. This effect may increase the density of f unctional protein and consequently reduce the amount of material required for array pr oduction. Second, the hydration state of the environment during the production and subsequent storage of protein arrays is an important factor for array reproducibility ( 10, 13, 18). This effect is minimized with NACS because DNA chips can be printed and st ored dry for extended periods of time and ssDNA-tagged p/MHC tetramer arrays ar e self-assembled in solution immediately prior to an experiment. 76 Figure 3.5 Comparison of the performance of p/MHC arrays produced by NACs and by spotting The consistency and robustness of T cell immobilization with NACS is evident when compared directly with spotted arrays, which su ffers from significant levels of inter-spot, intra- spot, and inter-experimental heterogeneity. Each row represents a separate experiment performed on a different slide. 3.3.3 NACS specificity and limit of detection To evaluate the specificity of p/MHC array assembly and T cell sorting, a ssDNA- p/MHC tetramer, tyrosinase, with pendant DNA sequence A' was hybridized to a DNA microarray printed with the complementary st rand (A) along with tw o additional distinct sequences (designated B and C). A homogeneous population of Jurkat-Tyr cells (Jurkat cells transduced with a TCR specific for tyrosi nase) (34) was then ap plied to the array. Jurkat-Tyr T cells localized to the complement ary spots (A) containing the hybridized 77 cognate p/MHC but not to spots printed w ith the non-complementary sequences B and C (Figure 3.6A ). The mean binding capacity ca lculated from three spots (~600 m) was ~1486 \u00b1 62 Jurkat-Tyr T cells. Figure 3.6 Mulitplexed nucleic acid cell sorting of antigen-specific T tetramer conjugated to ssDNA sequence A' was hybridized to an array printed with DNA complement strand A and non-complement strands B and C (dashed circles). Jurkat-Tyr cells were localized to spot A only. (B) A 1:1:1 mixture of Jurkat-MART-1 (red), Jurkat-Tyr (green) and Jurkat-NY-ESO-1 cells was selectively sorted on an array hybridized with MART-1, tyrosinase, and NY-ESO-1 p/MHC ssDNA-tetramers (top left). The remaining three panels are representative images of spots A, B and C. 78 To illustrate the multiplexing capability of NACS, MART-1, tyrosinase, and NY- ESO-1 ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers encoded to D NA sequences A, B and C respectively were combined and assembled simultaneously to a three element DNA microarray (strands A, B, and C). A 1:1:1 mixed population of Jurkat-MART-1, Jurkat-Tyr and Jurkat-NY-ESO-1 (Jurkat human T cells transduced with the TCR ( 35) specific for NY- ESO-1) cells prestained with lipophilic dyes (red, green and blue respectively) was applied to the array and localized into alternating columns ( Figure 3.6B ). Minimal cross-reactivity was observed. The average dens ity of spots was about a factor of three less than homogeneous sorti ng (440 \u00b1 28 T cells/spot). To determine limit of detectio n, target populat ions of Jurkat-Tyr cells were spiked in at 10%, 1% and 0.1% into wild type (w.t.) Jurkat cells and sorted ( Figure 3.7). The T cell capture density per spot per sp ecies for each mixture was enumerated and averaged (right panel) . The number of non-specific w.t. Jurkat cells that adhered to the array was constant throughout all dilu tions while the number of Jurkat-Tyr T cells captured per spot decreased linearly in rela tion to the fractional composition of Jurkat-Tyr cells with a detection limit that was ~ 1 in 1000 cells\u2014a limit that corresponds well to the total number of cells that can be captured per sp ot. Thus, the sensitivity of this approach is strictly a geometric constraint since anti gen-specific T cells that settle on inert areas cannot sample and bind to their cognate p/MHC tetramer. The sensitivity can be improved by increasing the size of the capture region (i.e. increase spot diameter and/or incorporate spot redundancy) or by reducing in ert regions (i.e. incr ease printing density). 79 Figure 3.7 NACS limit of detection (A) Jurkat-Tyr cells (red) were serially diluted in wild type (WT) Jurkat cells (green) at frequencies 50%, 10%, 1% and 0.1% and detected by NACS. (B) The average number of Jurkat-Tyr cells and WT Jurkat cells plotted in a histogram. It should be noted, however, that the sensitivity of this approach cannot be increased without limiting scalability. Since spot diameters are required to be sufficiently large to detect a population at low frequency, this sets an upper bound on the number of distinct spots that can be patterned on a substrate. In the current instance, 600 m spots are printed in 12 by 12 grids (~1 in2), enabling the potential identificatio n of 144 distinct antigen-specificities 0.1% from 106 T cells (106 cells is typically required to cover a 1 in2 region). In order to de tect target populations belo w 0.1% without decreasing multiplexing, p/MHC-specific enrichment stra tegies (e.g. magnetic bead-based schemes (36)) can be implemented prior to cell sorting. Lastly, the recovery of this technique\u2014 defined as the total number of antigen-speci fic T cells captured as a fraction of the number of T cells applied to the array\u2014is lo w relative to other so rting technologies like FACS and bead-based schemes. Typical T cell recovery for NACS is 20% ( 37). In comparison, fluorescent-based sorting techniques like FACS have high recoveries, since 80 each stained T cell can be iden tified individually by the cyto meter and sorted from the null population. The recovery (as well as sensitivity) of NACS will likely be improved by circulating T cells over the p/MHC array with agitation or with integrated microfluidic devices to allow T cells to sa mple the entire array. 3.3.4 Selective Release of Immobilized T cells with Restriction Endonucleases Antigen-specific T cells immobilized onto glass are immediately available for secondary assays, since many such as immuno histochemistry hybrization assays (6, 8) are tr aditionally performed or are compatible with cells localized to a substrate. However, several other relevant assays, such as those designed to assess T cell phenotype or functional status like genomic/mRNA analysis or simply furthe r culture for phenotypic enrichment would require a method for releasing the captured ce lls. Any release scheme should ideally be selective for given cell types. For NACS, we explored whether the DNA tethers could be selectively cleaved by exploiting the sequence specificity of restri ction endonucleases. We integrated unique restriction sites to each DNA sequence employed for cell sorting, and found that the adhesion of different populati ons of antigen-specif ic T cells could, in fact, be independently controlled ( Figure 3.8 ). Jurkat-MART-1 and Jurkat-Tyr cells prestained with lipophilic dyes (red and gr een respectively) were sorted on an array printed with DNA sequences A EcoRI and B BamHI (Figure 3.8 i). These oligonucleotides were modified by incorporating 6 bp restriction sites specific fo r endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI respectively. After T cell immob ilization, the array was treated with BamHI which cleaved the B BamHI spots and selectively released the bound Jurkat-Tyr cells (Figure 3.8 ii). Conversely, on a separate but id entically cell sort ed array, Jurkat-MART-1 81 cells were released after treatment with EcoRI ( Figure 3.8 iii). A second round of enzymatic treatment with the complementary endonuclease (EcoRI to state ( ii) or BamHI to state (iii )) removed the remaining adherent cells ( iv, v)). Alternativel y all captured cells ( i) could be released non-selectively in a single step with the addition of DNase ( vi). Figure 3.8 Programmed release of sorted T cells by endonuclease cleavage (A) DNA sequences containing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were used for T cell sorting. (B) Fluorescent images of Jurkat-MART-1 (red) and Jurkat-Tyro (green) cells captured on p/MHC array (i) and after treatment with BamHI ( ii) or EcoRI (iii ). Only cells localized to DNA spots containing the target restriction sequence were released. A second round of enzymatic treatment released the remaining bound cells ( iv, v). Panel ( vi) illustrates the array after treatment of state (i) with DNase. 82 3.3.5 NACS sorting of endogeno us primary human T cells Detection of primary human T cells isol ated from peripheral blood is generally more demanding than cultured cell lines becau se a single population of antigen-specific T cells is present within a large background of differing blood cells and of T cells expressing monoclonal and polyclo nal TCRs of diverse specific ities. In addition, these T cells would be expressing endogenous levels of TCR. We explor ed whether the same attributes of NACS that were found in the above examples would apply equally to endogenous primary human T cells. Frozen leukapheresis samples from patient NRA13 were CD8+ enriched and applied virus (EBV BMLF1 259- 267/HLA-A2.1) p/MHC cells were ca the EBV regions only (Figure 3.9A ). NRA13 CD8+ cells were verified by specific and ~0% CMV-specific ( Figure 3.10A ). The registry of the array was determined with the addition of A'-c y3 (red) and B'-cy5 (blue) conjugates. For mixtur e of EBV-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells was produced by combining NRA13 lymphocytes with CMV-specific T cells from patient NRA11 cell sorting and fluorescent p/MHC tetramer staining, the populations were complementary stained for the appropriate antigen-specificity ( Figure 3.9B ). The detection limit of antigen-specific T cells was evaluated from using serially dilu ted mixtures of EBV-specific T cells (~0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.1% by FACS) that were probed on an array. Isolated hits were resolved in frequencies as low as ~0.1% ( Figure 3.11 , red arrows). The number of unstained cells within the capture regions (black arrow) was constant throughout all dilutions (~1-2 cells/spot) and likely represents the level of background from non-specific interactions. 83 It should be noted that while we incorporated fluorescent p/MHC tetr amer staining after T cell immobilization for illustrative purposes, the specificity of the captured cells could be determined solely from the registry of the array. Figure 3.9 NACS sorting of endogenous primary human T cells specific for Epstein-Barr virus and Cytomegalovirus (A) CD8+ T cells from patient NRA 13 were captured on EBV p/MHC spots and no T cells were captured on CMV s pots (left panel). The right two panels are representative images after the cells were stained with fluorescent EBV (blue) and CMV p/MHC tetramers (red). (B) T cells detected from a 1:1 mixture of NRA11 and NRA 13 (left panel) were verified to be specific for EBV and CMV (right panels). 84 Figure 3.10 The T cell specificities of PBMCs from patients NRA11 and NRA13 (A) Lymphocytes isolated from NRA13 contained signifi cant levels of EBV specific T cells (4.9%) with minimal CMV specific T cells. (B) Lymphocytes isolated from NRA11 contained high levels of CMV specific T cells (9%) with a lo w population of EBV-specific cells (0.12%). Leukaphersis fractions from both pa tients were kept as frozen a liquots before thawing, CD8+ enrichment and NACS sorting. 85 Figure 3.11 Limit of detection of endogeneous human T cells with NACS Mixtures of ~0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1% EBV-specific T cell populations (upper panels) were detected via NACS (bottom panels). Populations of EBV-specific T cells are marked with red arrows and non-specific cells are marked with black arrows. 3.3.6 Persistence of MART-1 specifi c, TCR-engineered human T cells in vivo One important potential application of NACS is to utilize the technique for monitoring cancer patients that are undergoing a particular type of immunotherapy that involves TCR engineering of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This is an emerging clinical approach to rapidly generate large numbers of tumor antigen-specific T cells. In particular, a cancer patient's T cells are collec ted, genetically modified to express a TCR specific for a desired cancer antigen, and then they are introduced back into the patient as a cancer th erapy. After re-infusion into the patient, the modified T cells can subsequently traffic to and e ngage with cancer cells, promoting tumor regression in a subset of patie nts with metastatic cancers. This type of directed cell 86 therapy is utilized primarily in patients w ith melanoma (skin cancer), but also for other cancers (38, 39). This approach is called adopt ive cell transfer (ACT). We monitored the presence and abundance of TCR-engineered T cells in peripheral blood of a patient undergoing ACT. White blood cells were collected from patie nt F5-1 with metastatic melanoma. After in vitro expansion and TC R transduction, the cells were > 80% MART-1 p/MHC tetramer ( Figure 12A ). These cells were subsequently infused into patient F5-1 and the presence and persistence of MART-1-specific T cells in the peripheral blood was monitored by NACS at da ys 0 (prior to infusion), 9, 14 and 30 (Figure 12B ). MART-1-specific T cells were not detectable in pre-infusion samples from the patient but they were detectable at all subsequent time points. This is represented as a gradual rise in the abundance of MART-1-s pecific T cells until day 30 (left axis). In comparison, the frequency of MART-1-specific T cells detected by flow cytometry spiked initially before decreasing and finally increasing by day 30 (right axis). The abundance of TCR-engineered T cells, as measured by NACS, was generally correlated with parallel measurements using fl ow cytometry. The prospect of array-based T cell detection schemes for experimental cancer immuno-therapies such as ACT will likely increase as more cancer associated antigens are identified and targeted. For example, more than 50 different melanoma associated antigens have thus far been characterized (40, 41), and this means that mo re T cells types are likely to be employed for future therapies (39, 42, 43) . However, the desire to pr obe larger sets of cancer associated antigens will be compounded by the amount of sample that can be practically collected from a patient. NACS appears to provide a feasible approach towards carrying 87 out the highly multiplexed cellular measurements that will eventually be required as ACT-like therapies move forward. Figure 3.12 Monitoring the presence of infused MART-1-specific, TCR-engineered T cells (A) Flow cytometry plots (top panels) and NACS (bottom panels) monitoring the transduction of T cells with a MART-1-specific TCR. (B) Blood cells from patient F5-1 were collected at days 0, 9, 14 and 30 after infusion. The abundance of MART-1-specific T cells was monitored by NACS (left axis) and flow cytometry (right axis). 3.3.7 Homogeneous platform for cell so rting and functional analysis Antigen-specific T cells that are sort ed by NACS are immobilized to a solid surface and are immediately available for further studies. Traditional surface bound assays such as IHC, FISH and ELISPOT should integrate seamlessly with NACS. In addition, antigen-specific T cells have been shown to be activ ated upon binding to p/MHC arrays (6-8) mmunomodulatory cytokine cytokine secretion profiles of CD8+ T cells prov ide valuable information concerning the phenotype of the T cell (e.g. effector and an ergic phenotypes can be differentiated by the 88 production of IFN- ). Thus integrating on-chip cyt okine measurements with antigen- specific T cell capture would greatly expand the diagnostic capability of NACS p/MHC tetramer arrays. Figure 3.13 Functional profiling of TCR triggered activation of captured antigen-specific T cells NACS ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers and DEAL an ti-cytokine conjugates are both encoded to the same DNA sequence, co-hybridizing to th e same spot. CD8+ lymphocytes are activated upon binding to the p/MHC molecules, secreting cyto kines which can be captured locally by DEAL conjugates. After a predetermined period of incubation, a sandwich detection antibody is used to visualize the secreted product. We proceeded by integrating an ELISPOT-type sandwich assay with p/MHC NACS to detect cytokines capture murine strands. The ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers and antibody conjugates were pooled and assemb led to a microarray printed with the complementary strands A, B and C. Muri ne OT1 lymphocytes (derived from TCR transgenic mice in which most splenocyt es are specific for the model antigen OVA 257- 264), were then seeded on the array. Follo wing incubation periods of 2, 5, or 18 hours, pooled cytokine detection antibodies were added and the slide imaged by confocal 89 microscopy ( Figure 3.14A ). The inflammatory cytokine IFN- was detected at time points 5 and 18, manifest as discrete diffusive clusters (~50-100 m in diameter at 5 hrs) that increased in average diameter tempora lly, attributable to molecular diffusion and sustained secretion. Examination of the vicinity of each burst showed that underlying each fluorescent cluster was a single cell while neighboring cells appeared to be non- responders ( Figure 3.14B ), suggestive that each IFN- burst was derived from a single cell. The number of IFN- clusters remained constant at ~3 between hours 5 and 18, indicating no increase in the number of ac tivated T cells between those hours. No significant levels of murine IL-2 and TNF- were detected at these time points. Figure 3.14 Dynamic cytokine profiling of NACS sorted murine OT1 lymphocytes (A) Discrete IFN- clusters were detected at 5 and 18 ho urs with no detectable presence of IL-2 and TNF- . No increase in the average number of IFN- clusters between time points 5 and 18 hours was observed. (B) Representative confo cal and brightfield images of an IFN- burst. Isolated T cells were detected (arrow) within the diffusive IFN- regions surrounded by non-responsive T cells. 90 3.4 Conclusions We have described a method for generati ng robust and modular p/MHC arrays for high efficiency T cell sorting. The inclusion of a larger set of orthogonal DNA sequences (20, 25) will enable the modular assembly of higher order p/MHC arrays for T cell screening experiments (e.g. one worki ng set of DNA sequences can be used interchangeably to generate any combina tion of p/MHC arrays). This would find immediate utility in the field of TCR pe ptide epitope discovery where recently, novel antigen peptides were discovered via hi gh-throughput CD8+ screening experiments utilizing multi-color flow cytometry in mice and humans (44, 45) (as many as 2,000 distinct p/MHC tetramers were prepared and te sted). NACS arrays have the potential to streamline such experiments. Although tr aditional methods of producing single p/MHC monomers are time and labor intensive, recen t reports using conditional peptide exchange technology enables the relatively straight forward construction of 1000 element p/MHC libraries rapidly (44-46). The integration of NACS with thes e peptide exchange technologies is a realistic option. We have also demonstrated a number of advantages of the NACS platform. It significantly outperforms literature appr oaches that utilize surface-bound p/MHC tetramers to capture cells. It is simple and inexpensive to implement since cell sorting is performed on glass substrates prepared via traditional DNA printing technologies. In addition, sorted cells may be selectively released, which should permit for the deployment of a host of bioanalytical methods on NACS sorted cells. We envision that NACS will find uses beyond multiplexed sorting of T cells based on TCR specificity. The principal components of this platform\u2014s treptavidin-cysteine core and orthogonal 91 single stranded DNA sequences\u2014w ere rationally developed to enable oriented coupling and spatial addressing. Thus th is platform is amenable to any family of binding proteins or small molecule binders labeled with bi otin. The increase in avidity of p/MHC tetramers over monomers as a consequence of the valency of SA should likewise extend to other capture agents, making it feasible to generate cellular arrays with probes ranging from high to moderate affinities like antibodies, aptamers or peptides. 92 3.5 References 1.

For a typical homogeneous sorting experiment, 10 6 T cells are applied to an array containing 144 spots. Each spot can bind to ~1486 \u00b1 62 T cells. The recovery, R, is calculated as R = 100% x (144 x 1486)/10 6 20%. The recovery is valid even with heterogeneous samples (e.g. 1:1 mixture of two antigen-specific T cell populations) when the entire array is used to sort a single ta rget population (R = 100% x (144 spots x 661)/(5x105) 20%). For multiplexed experiments, R is proportional to the fraction of the 144 s pots dedicated for cell capture. For example, sorting 2 populations from a 1:1 mixture, R = 100% x (72 spots x 661)/(5x105) 10%. 38. Schumacher, T.N. T-cell-receptor gene therapy. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002, 2, 512 519. 39.

Cell surface marker s are involved in can cer pathogenesis, aid in staging, and represent a larg e class of proteins targeted for therapy. The importance of the membrane-bound oncogenes EGFR and ERBB2 and the development of small molecule inhibitors against them have been expounded on in the previous chapters. Identification of altered or e xpression of cancer associated surface antigens is an area of active research. For example, the cell su rface marker CD40 has been found to be expressed in many B cell malignancies and has been investigated as the possible target for anti-CD40 antibody-based cancer therapy (1). Development of methods that enable 107 comprehensive mapping of the cell surface proteome would provide new avenues for investigation, analogous to the effect global transcriptome expression profiling has had in providing valuable fundamental and therapeutic information for various types of cancers (2). However, there have been few documen ted effective strategies for high-throughput, global profiling of surface membrane protei ns. One approach is to purify cellular membrane fragments by two-phase separation, but cross-contamination from cytosolic proteins is a major limitation (3). Other re ports have demonstrated the feasibility of retrieving membrane fragments in vivo from endothelial cells using a combination of colloidal silica particles and polymers (4). Me mbrane proteins have also been isolated through chemical biotinylation followed by enrich ment with a streptavidin column (5-7). Typically after enrichment, the membrane bound proteins are identified by the combination of 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A major limitation of these studies is that the labeling strategies are non-specific and the biological samples are lysed, precluding dynamic studies. In this chapter summarizing current work, I present an antibody-based, membrane-protein profiling approach, which us es a library of capture agents to probe membrane-bound antigens. Similar to DEAL or NACS conjugates, each capture agent is conjugated to a distinct ssDNA tag but differs in that the sequence incorporates a photo- labile base. The capture agents are allowed to bind to cell surface antigens, after which the ssDNA tags are released into solution by UV-induced cleavage, collected and detected by PCR ( Figure 4.1 ). This approach is called cellular barcodin g. There have been quite a few studies inte grating the specific ity of antibodies for antigen detection with nucleic acid readouts, including im muno-PCR (8-10), immunode (13-14), and nanoparticle assays (15). However, all these assays were used to detect single pr oteins in idealized solutions, and were not utilized in a high throughput, multi-parameter manner for detecting and profiling cell surface proteins. Figure 4.1 Schematic of cellular barcoding A collection of capture agents conjugated with distinct ssDNA tags is applied to a bi ological cell sample. After binding to the cognate membrane-bound protein, the ssDNA ta gs are photocleaved and collected for analysis by PCR. The frequency of the ss DNA barcodes correlate to the expression level of cell membrane proteins. 4.2 Experimental Methods 4.2.1 DNA sequences and production of conjugates All DNA sequences were purchased with HPLC purification from Integrated DNA Technologies ( www.idtdna.com ) and are listed in Table 4.1. 109 Table 4.1 Cellular barcoding DNA sequences Name Sequence* PC1 5' - NH 2 - PC - ATC CTG GAG CTA AGT CCG TAG CCT CAT CCT AGC CGT CTA TCG PC forward primer 5' - ATG GTC GAG TCA GAG TAA TCC AGC TAA GTC CGT A PC reverse primer 5' - TAG ATA CTG CCA CTT CAC ATT AGC GAT AGT AGA CGA GTG C A' 5' - NH 2- AAA AAA ATA CGG ACT TAG CTC CAG GAT-cy3 * The 5' amine functional group for PC and EcoRV is necessary to conjugate the oligonucleotide to SAC or antibodies. 1 PC = photocleavable Antibody-ssDNA (DEAL) conjugates were synthesized, purified and characterized according to previously published protocols (16 ). The HLA-A*0201 restricted MHC class I monomers loaded with MART-1 26-35 (ELAGIGILTV) were produced in house according to previous published prot ocols (17). The production of p/MHC-ssDNA constructs (NACS conjugates) were according to previous published protocols (18). 4.2.2 Detection of surfa ce markers with PCR Prior to all experiments, blocking buffer (1.5% BSA, 150 g/ml salmon sperm DNA in PBS) was used to block all 1.5 ml tubes and a 96-well plate for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) before rinsing 2x with PB S. The blocked tubes and plate were used immediate for experiments. One million cells (Jurkat-MART-1, Jurkat-Tyro, or GBM1600) were transferred to 1.5 ml tubes, and resuspended in 100 l staining buffer 10mM HE PES, 0.01% azide). The cells were blocked by adding 100 l of 2mg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 20 min. at 37oC before 110 resuspension in staining buffer. Captur e agents tagged with ssDNA (Cetuximab, MART- 1) were added (0.5 g per 106 cells) to the cell suspension for 20-25 min. at 37oC. The samples were then washed 3x with staining buffer before a final wash and resuspension in 1% BSA PBS. For UV-dependent cleavage of the ssDNA tags, 5 x 105 cells in 50 l were transferred to a 96-we ll plate on ice and exposed to long wave UV for 1 hr. The cells were pelleted and the supernatant cont aining the DNA codes wa s collected for PCR analysis. 4.3 Results and Discussion 4.3.1 Detection of differential cel l surface expression of EGFR To illustrate the feasibility of usi ng ssDNA-antibody conjugates to detect membrane-bound proteins by PCR, we selected two cell lines expressing differing levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). GBM1600 cells are a low-passage cell line derived from a primary brain tumor e xpressing high levels of EGFR. Jurkat cells are a hematopoietic derived T cell line with null expression of EGFR. The presence or absence of EGFR expression was verified flow cytometry (Figure 4.2A). (Cetuximab) (PC) and stained GBM1600 and Ju rkat cells in separate tubes with the conjugate. After removing excess Cetuximab-PC molecules, the samples were treated in a 96-well plate with UV radiation for one hour. The photo-cleaved ssDNA tags were collected, amplified by PCR an d visualized on a 4% agarose gel. As shown in Figure 4.3, the reporter tags were detected at an ea rlier thermal cycle during the amplification in the GBM1600 sample than in the Jurkat sa mple. Quantitative assessment by Q-PCR 111 gave a Ct of approximately ~8.6 ( Figure 4.3b ). Under ideal experimental conditions, each thermal cycle doubles the total number of amplicons. Assuming EGFR expression directly correlates with th e number of ssDNA tags releas ed in solution, the relative difference in EGFR expression between the GBM1600 and Jurkat samples is given by 28.6, which is approximately equal to 400. In reality, since most processes are non-ideal, this likely represents the upper bound. A ssuming each thermal cycle increases the number of amplicons by a factor of 1.8 instead of 2 gives a rela tive difference of 1.88.6, which is approximately equal to 160. Figure 4.2 Antibody-ssDNA and p/MHC-ssDNA tetramers stain cells in solution (A) Flow cytometry analysis of EGFR expression of GBM 1600 (blue) and Jurkat (green) cells. GBM1600 EGFR expression was significantly higher than th e Jurkat control cell line. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of TCR expression. Jurkat-MART-1 cells were stained by MA RT-1-A' and MART-1-APC p/MHC tetramers (right panels). Jurkat-Tyr cells were not stained by MART-1-A' tetramers (lower left panel). 112 Figure 4.3 GBM1600 EGFR detection by cellular barcoding (A) Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of amplified products collected every 5th complete thermal cycle. Reporter ssDNA tags were detected earlier in GBM1600 samp les than in Jurkat samples. (B) Ct values by Q-PCR. 4.3.2 Cellular barcoding limits of detection In order to determine the minimum number of cells required for surface antigen detection, two avenues were inve stigated. First, GBM1600 cells were spiked into Jurkat cells to produce synthetic cellular mixtur es composed of 100%, 10%, 1%, 0.1%, or 0% GBM1600 cells. The total number of cells per condition was kept constant at 106 by increasing the number of Jurkat cells. Sec ond, GBM1600 cells were serially diluted into separate tubes, each containing either 105, 104, 103, 102, or 0 cells per tube. No Jurkat cells were added to these vials. These samples were stained using Cetuximab-PC conjugates and the results are shown in Figure 4.5 . For the cell mixtures, GBM1600 cells at 100% and 10% were det ected significantly above the baseline while mixtures 1% and 0.1% were similar in intensity to the baseline ( Figure 4.5A ). In the serial dilutions, samples containing 104 cells or more were de tected above background (Figure 4.5B ). Significant signal arose from the vial without any cells, which is likely due to non- specific interactions between Cetuximab-PC conjugates and the vial. We are currently 113 investigating improvements in the blocking an d washing steps to increase the signal to noise ratio. Figure 4.4 Limits of detection (A) Synthetic samples of sp iked GBM1600 cells in Jurkat cells were detected by -Cetuximab-ssDNA conjugate, with a dilution limit of about 10% (B) Reporter ssDNA amplification can de tect EGFR expression from > 104 cells. 4.3.2 Detection of antigen-specific T cells using ssDNA-p/MHC tetramers The ability to profile T ce ll receptors has many potential fundamental applications in immunology as well as diagnostic potential in many fields like vaccine development, immune monitoring, and cancer immunothera py. Since the development of p/MHC tetramers (19), it has been possible to direc tly analyze populations of antigen-specific T cells by staining with fluorescent p/MHC tetram ers. The fundamental limitation in this approach is the difficulty in multiplexing sinc e distinct T cell specificities need to be encoded with different colors for discriminati on. Therefore, there has been widespread interest in developing p/MHC protein arrays, since in a spatially encoded format, the 114 degree of multiplexing can be increased grea tly (18, 20-23). One inherent limitation of array approaches however, is that the sensitivity and scalability is limited by the size of the spots, since the sensitivity is directly proportional to the diameter of the capture surfaces. In addition, arrays approaches are planar substrate-based detection schemes. The limited diffusive capacity of T cells prevents cells from sampling an entire array. Hence for all arrays approaches, T cell recovery is low. The majority of the cells settle on inert areas of the substrate or on non-cognate spots. With an approach like cellular barcoding, the engagement of the encoding agen t with the cell surface receptor occurs in solution. Thus by using NACS conjugates, a ll T cells in a solution is encoded after staining and can subsequently be decoded. To demonstrate the feasibility of detec ting antigen-specific TCRs with cellular barcoding, the T cell lines Jurkat -MART-1 and Jurkat-Tyr were chosen as the model lines. These are transduced T cells expressing TCRs specific for the antigens MART-1 and tyrosinase respectively and were described in detail in chapter 3. MART-1 p/MHC tetramers were prepared encoded with their ability to stain Jurkat -MART-1 cells. The results are shown in Figure 4.2B . Both tetramers stained Jurkat-MART-1 cells similarly (right upper, right lower panels). Importantly, cells expre ssing the non-cognate TCR were not stained by MART-1-A' tetramers (lower left panel), de monstrating that p/MHC tetramers appended with ssDNA pendants can engage with the cognate TCR in the suspension phase. Both T cell lines were then stained with MART-1-PC tetramers, treated with UV and analyzed by PCR. The results are shown in Figure 4.4 . Approximately five fewer 115 thermal cycles were required before PC was detected from the Jurkat-MART-1 sample than from the Jurkat-Tyr sample. In comparison with EGFR detection by Cetuximab-PC, the discrimination between the two T cell lines is le ss significant. This may be attributed to higher affinity Cetuximab-PC conjugates re lative to ssDNA-p/MHC complexes. We are currently investigating more comprehensive pu rification strategies that would yield the highest avidity ssDNA-p/MHC complex by separa ting fully tetrameric p/MHC constructs from complexes of lower valency. Figure 4.5 Antigen-specific T cell detection by cellular barcoding PCR analysis of ssDNA tags showing specific detection of Jurkata-MART-1 over control Jurkata-Tyr cells when interrogated with MART-1 -ssDNA p/MHC tetramer. 4.4 Conclusions and Future Directions In its present state, the dynamic range of membrane antigen detection with antibody-DNA conjugates is approximately 102. This is sufficient in distinguishing cells that express a surface antigen from cells that do not, since most proteins are found on the cell surface at approximately 2,000-500,000 copies per cell (24). Improvements to this technique that expands the dynamic range will be beneficial as well as improvements that 116 lower the sensitivity of this approach, wh ich would allow the detection of membrane proteins from small sample sizes below 104 cells. In addition, with heterogeneous mixtures of cells, it may be necessary to enrich for a particular phenoty pe prior to cellular barcoding, since a surface anti gen that has been detected cannot be assigned to any particular cell type within a mixture a priori . To this end, it may be advantageous to integrate DEAL/NACS cell sorting prior to barcoding. While this demonstration using conve ntional PCR highlights the technical feasibility of this approach, the goal is integration with hi gh-throughput sequencing employing the Solexa platform. This sec ond generation sequencer works by ligating cDNA libraries to the bottom of microfluidic flow cells. Th e flow cells are sufficiently large to ensure scattered coverage, enab ling spatial resolution of individual cDNA fragments. After in situ amplification, the sequences ar e read by a sequence-by-synthesis approach. Typically, 25 base pair reads are taken from 107-108 possible unique sequences per flow cell (25, 26). This approa ch is digital and quantitative because each read is from a cDNA fragment that is spatia lly resolved. By integrating a library of capture agents encoded with ssDNA identifi ers with Solexa seque ncing, it should be possible to generate a quantitative cell surface -ome heat map. A schematic is illustrated in Figure 4.6 . 117 Figure 4.6 Schematic of glob al \"surface-ome\" profilin g with cellular barcoding A pool of reporter ssDNA tags get can seque nced with second generational, high- throughput sequencers (e.g. Solexa platform), enabling absolute quantification of membrane bound protein expres sion in cellular samples. There are several DNA sequence design cons iderations to inte rface with Solexa sequencing. First, since 25 base pair reads are commonly employed, the barcoding segment of the DNA should lie within 25 base pairs from the 5' or 3' end. Second, the barcoding region can be small. A st retch of 6 bases will encode for 46 = 4096 different parameters. Third, prior to ligation to the flow cell, small cDNA libraries are typically amplified by PCR. To avoid biasing the ssDNA tag library, universal primers can be integrated, flanking the barcode ( Figure 4.7A ). Lastly, because of the high-throughput and current cost of each sequencing run, it should be possible to utilize different sets of universal primers with 3 base pair overhangs as experimental identifiers. This would allow barcode tags from multiple experiments to be pooled together for a single 118 sequencing run ( Figure 4.7B ). A 3 base stretch would allow 43 = 64 different experiments to be pooled together. Figure 4.7 DNA sequence design considerations (A) Illustration of a generic DNA sequence that can interface with Solexa sequencing containing two universal primers flanking a 6 bp encoding region. Six bases encodes for 4096 differe nt parameters. (B) Because the throughput of second generation sequencers are high, experimental ID tags can be integrated through unique set of universal primers, enabling multiple experiment s to be decoded and sequenced simultaneously. A three base stretch is sufficient to encode 64 unique experiments. In conclusion, a solution pha se approach has been introduced that allow cell membrane bound proteins to be detected by capture agents like antibodies or p/MHC tetramers encoded with ssDNA tags. The pendant oligonucleotides function as reporter molecules that can be detected and quantif ied with conventional thermal amplification approaches. The successful integration of a library of ssDNA-encoded captured agents with high-throughput sequencing for quantitat ive assessment would provide a global profiling tool to survey the cell surf ace-ome with fundamental and diagnostic implications. 119 4.5 References 1.
