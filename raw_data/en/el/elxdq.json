In children and adolescents, data are insufficient to assess the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV), Meningococcal Conjugate and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Tdap). In adults, Prevnar 13 was administered concomitantly with US-licensed inactivated influenza vaccines, trivalent and quadrivalent (Studies 10, 13)[see [Clinical Studies (14.4)](#S14.4) and [Adverse Reactions (6.2)](#S6.2)]. There are no data on the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines and other vaccines licensed for use in adults 50 years of age and older. When Prevnar 13 is administered at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccines should always be administered with different syringes and given at different injection sites. Do not mix Prevnar 13 with other vaccines/products in the same syringe. 7.2 Immunosuppressive Therapies Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy (including irradiation, corticosteroids, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and cytotoxic agents) may not respond optimally to active immunization. 7.3 Antipyretics A post-marketing clinical study conducted in Poland using a non-US vaccination schedule (2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age) evaluated the impact of prophylactic oral acetaminophen on antibody responses to Prevnar 13. The data show that 3 doses of acetaminophen (the first dose administered at the time of each vaccination and the subsequent doses at 6 to 8 hour intervals) reduced the antibody response to some serotypes following the third dose of Prevnar 13, compared with responses among infants who received antipyretics only as needed for treatment. Reduced antibody responses were not observed after the fourth dose of Prevnar 13 when acetaminophen was administered prophylactically. 7.4 Prior Vaccination with PPSV23 Prior receipt of PPSV23 within 1 year results in diminished immune responses to Prevnar 13 compared to "}
