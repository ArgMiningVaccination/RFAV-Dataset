Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States and throughout the world. Fortunately, when risks are identified early, they can be treated quickly. This makes it easier and more effective to manage, treat, and prevent complications\u2014as well as promote greater cardiac health. At Weill Cornell's Preventive Cardiology practice, our mission is to prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals. Our expert preventive cardiologists take the time to understand each patient's unique history and needs and then create a targeted treatment plan to reduce the likelihood of heart attack, stroke, bypass surgery, or angioplasty. We prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients by first understanding their cardiac health and individual needs. Each patient receives: Personalized treatment plan: Using the cardiovascular assessment, laboratory studies, and advanced cardiac imaging, your cardiologist determines your risk for heart disease and provides a treatment plan to slow the progression of current heart problems and prevent future problems. Your health plan may include: Individuals with any of the following may be at increased risk for heart disease or rapid progression of heart disease. If you have any of these characteristics, you will benefit from an evaluation by our Preventive Cardiology team. We encourage you to consider a preventive cardiovascular evaluation if you have any of the above characteristics or are concerned about your overall cardiovascular health.
