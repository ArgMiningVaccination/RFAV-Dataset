The only time I ever hear people going to the chiropractor is if they are currently in pain that won't go away with anti-inflammatories, stretching, or resting. This is great and I hope everyone sees a chiropractor when they're in pain. But what if you saw a chiropractor when you weren't in pain? What if you went to one when you thought you were fine and you thought you didn't need one? Believe it or not, spinal manipulation is extremely effective for your immune and endocrine system. The endocrine system is the collection of glands that produce hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, tissue function, sexual function, reproduction, sleep, mood, and more. The immune system defends the body from infection. Need help with sleep? The National Sleep Foundation found that one-third of people who received a chiropractic adjustment had an immediate improvement in their sleep. They also reported that 40% of newborns slept more soundly through the night after having an adjustment. When the entire nervous system is working properly, your baby is able to eat and sleep and grow without colic, constipation, and sleep issues during their peak development. [Clinicians hypothesize that that subluxation adjustment helps treat insomnia by balancing dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain.](https://www.cuyahogafallschiropractic.com/chiropractic-care-improves-sleep-quality/) Sublexation: Compression of nervous pathways. This is basically when a joint doesn't work the way it's supposed to; whether it's not moving or it's just misaligned. So many things can cause a spinal sublexation such as stress, toxins, trauma, and more. Do you have allergies or have a tendency to get sick? Dr. Ronald Pero, Ph.D., chief of cancer prevention research at New York's Preventive Medicine Institute, measured the immune function of people under chiropractic care compared to the general population and those with cancer and other serious diseases. His study found that individuals who received regular chiropractic care had a [200% greater](https://www.piercechiropractic.net/blog/research-studies-showing-chiropractic-adjustments-boost-immune-system) immune function than those who do not receive chiropractic care. How does chiropractic care boost the immune system? We all know that chiropractors are experts in the musculoskeletal system. However, their knowledge and skillset goes beyond that. Our nervous system (brain and nerves) communicates directly with the skeletal system. Chiropractors are adjusting our spine, which is related directly to our nerves. Think of a telephone chord. When the chord is pinched, the signal isn't great. The connection can have static and even cut out. The same is with a misaligned spine. The connection is slightly cut off. When there is interference with the communication, it can result in pain, illness, and other ailments. Our immune system is directly related to our nervous system. Our nervous system is directly related to our spine. When our spine is not aligned, it can throw the entire system off track. What is the evidence that chiropractic care can aid in immune competency? The 1918 flu pandemic killed over 20 million people globally and 500,000 Americans in just six months. It was observed that those who chose chiropractic care during this time experienced 1/40th of the death rate. [\"Simply put, the immune systems of people who had been getting adjusted worked better. \"](https://www.tagchiro.com/the-real-history-of-chiropractic-the-flu-of-1918/) To remind you, the Spanish Flu was a disease so severe that it had a 2.5% death rate. Do you struggle with severe allergies? I'm not just talking the sniffles every so often (although chiro care can help). I'm primarily talking about the people who need to see an allergist and any change of the wind can stir up a massive case of allergies and sinus issues. Allergies are a hypersensitive immune response to allergens in the air. Did you know stress can inflame allergies? The nervous system and the immune system are interconnected; so it makes sense that an immune response to a body's perceived stress would be linked. Cortisol, our stress hormone, works to subdue the body's response to allergies and lessen symptoms. If your body is experiencing chronic stress, the adrenal glands which produce cortisol become worn out. [With the shortage of cortisol, allergy symptoms can become more severe.](https://chirocareflorida.com/how-chiropractic-helps-allergies/) Through the improvement of communication between the brain and spinal chord through chiropractic adjustments, the body's reaction to allergens can be reduced. In my experience, chiropractic care is a necessity to staying above the wellness line. If you're prone to being sick or are dependent on allergy medication, give yourself six months of weekly chiropractic care. I used to be dependent on saline rinses, nasal sprays, allergy pills, and steroid shots to control my allergies. After two years of regular chiropractic care and ditching anything with fragrance, I find that my allergies are significantly less severe. I can't remember the last time I had to take an over the counter medication for allergy related issues. If you struggle with allergies, imagine your quality of life without them. If mine can go away in Texas, the state that seems to pride itself on having all the allergens, then yours can too. Never Miss A Thing... Want to be the first to hear about new posts and products? "}
