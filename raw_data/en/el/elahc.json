The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations described in this Blueprint document are criterion -referenced assessments based on the occupational competencies that entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists must have to practise safely, effectively and ethically. These occupational competencies are outlined in the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Me dicine in Canada. These competencies are grouped into nine (9) practice a reas: (1) Interpersonal Skills ; (2) Professionalism ; (3) Practice Management ; (4) Traditional Chinese Medicine Foundations ; (5) Fundamentals of Biomedicine ; (6) Diagnostics and Treatm ent; (7) Acupunctur e Techniques ; (8) Herbal Dispensary Management ; and (9) Safety . A full list of these occupational compet encies by the nine practice areas is provided in Appendix B . This Blueprint document has two major components: (1) the content domain (practice areas) to be measured and (2) explicit guidelines on how this content is to be measured. The content domain consists of the measurable competencies expected of entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Ac upuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists . The specific guidelines are expressed in terms of structural and contextual variables. The Blueprint also includes a list of suggested references for these national exam ination s. CARB -TCMPA thanks all who contributed to the creation of this Blueprint document . In particular, CARB -TCMPA gratefully acknowledges the Government of Canada's Foreign Credential Recognition Program for funding this project . Additional appreciation is extended to the regulatory authorities and the members of the Blueprint D evelopment Committee who collaborated with Assessment Strategies Inc. to produce this document (see Appendix A ). 1 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) P ractitioner is a restricted title that comprises the dual usage of a cupuncture and herbology in the scope of practice. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint , Final 2 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) INTRODUCTION Contextual Background The Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CARB -TCMPA ) is the national organization of provincial and territorial regulatory bodies that govern and monitor the practice of Traditional Chine se Medicine and Acupuncture. The current members o f the CARB -TCMPA comprise of the following : College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of British Columbia (CTCMA -BC); College and Association of Acupuncturists of Alberta (CAAA) ; Ordre des Acupuncteurs du Qu\u00e9b ec (OAQ) ; Transitional Council of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (TC -CTCMPAO) ; and College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Newfoundland and Labrador (CTCMPANL) . Each of these regulatory bodies is established by provincial/territorial law with a mandate to protect the public's right to safe, competent and ethical services offered by registered Doctors of Traditional Chinese Med icine (Dr. TCM), TCM Practitioners, TCM A cupuncturists and/or TCM Herbal ists who are members of the regulatory bodies. The objectives of CARB -TCMPA are: To serve as the collective voice of the provincial and territorial regulatory bodies of TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists ; To work collaboratively on common issues that impact on the regulation, safe and quality practices, education and training of TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists ; To develop, implement and maintain programs of national interest; To develop mechanisms and programs to facilitate mobility of TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists in Canada; and To work with national and international agencies, where appropriate. Since 2008, members of CARB -TCMPA have been working collaboratively on establishing common standards for the registr ation of TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM H erbalists . In May 2010, it completed the Entry -Level Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada ( Appendix B) and in July 2010, the Pan - Canadian Standards for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists: User Guide. The framework and process used to develop these occupational competencies are outlined in the Developing Occupational Competencies section. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint - Final 3 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) CARB -TCMPA , in consultation with its examinations provider , Assessment Strategies Inc., presents this Blue print document with the purpose and intent of facilitating the develop ment of reliable and valid examinations to assess fairly, in a consistent and transparent manner , the candidates applying for registrat ion to practis e as TC M Practitioners, TCM and/or in Canada . The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations to be developed will use the same standards and processes to ensure safe , effective an d ethical practice to evaluate both internationally -trained candidates and Canadian -trained candidates. These national examination s are also meant to ensure quality standards and facilitate labour mobility across provinces. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinat ions CARB- TCMP A Blueprint , Final 4 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) DEVELOPING OCCUPATIONAL COMP ETENCIES I. The Framework/Approach There are several common approaches for the development of competency frameworks based on tasks, functional analysis or descriptions of roles (Raymond and Neustel, 2006) . Each has its place in describing competence. What is most important in any competency framework is the completeness and accuracy of the description it provides. The Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada (Appendix B) is based on a functional analysis methodology. T he functional analysis approach is an integrated method to competency development whereby competence is inferred from performance and the context sensitivity of diverse practice is recognized . The description of the area of competency is required to be relevant to the patient and clinical context and should move from a general to more specific delineation of the expected performance of a competent professional. Figure 1 presents how the varying levels of the framework are interrelated and described. Figure 1: Levels of a functional analysis competency framework II. The Process The development process involved the identification of defined competencies by an interprovincial committee of experienced TCM Practitioners , Acupuncturists and educators . The committee utilized source documents from various countries describing TCM and acupuncture education and practice, as well as the expertise of its members. This was followed by surveys of practitioners in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Que bec and Newfoundland & Labrador, to determine the extent to which the proposed competencies were deemed by practitioners to be important, frequently -used and appropriate as entry -level requirements. Level 4: Performance Indicators Describe an interrelated set of measurable factors that define the level of expected performance. Level 3: Competencies Describe the identifiable components of expected performance. Level 2: Units of Competencies Describe the major functions for effective performance. Level 1: Key Role Statement Describe purpose or goal of the professional. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint - Final 5 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) The occupational competencies , provided in Appendix B, have been approved by the regulatory authority in each jurisdiction. They are intended to identify the knowledge, skills and abil ities in which entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists should be able to coordinate and apply, in or der to provide safe, effective and ethical practice. III. Situating Occupational Competencies Assessed Figure 2 situates the competencies that form the basis of the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations within the full complement of competencies for t raditional Chinese m edicine, acupuncture and/or herbology practice. The outer circle represents the competencies that are expected of TCM Practitioners , TCM A cupuncturists and/or TCM Herbal ists in general and may include competencies to be demonstrated by fully experienced professionals in the practice. The middle circle represents the competencies that the TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists at the entry -level are required to possess by regulatory authorities in order to practis e safely , effectively and ethical ly. The inner circle represents the competencies assessed by the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examination s. Thus, the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case -Study Examination s, described in this Blueprint document, focus on competencies that are measurable on written examinations using clinical case -study format as described in the Technical Specifications section . Figure 2: Competencies assessed by the Pan-Canadian Clinical Case -Study Examinations ALL COMPETENCIES (i.e., skills and knowledge) FOR PRACTICE ENTRY -LEVEL OCCUPATIONAL COMPETENCIES COMPETENCIES ASSESSED IN THE PAN -CANADIAN CLINICAL CASE -STUDY EXAMINATIONS DEVELOPED ions CARB- TCMP A Blueprint , Final 6 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) ASSUMPTIONS The following are the assumptions on which the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations are based and have been derived from the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada and other sources as provided in the bibliography. 1. Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) is a comprehensive body of knowledge that applies TCM theories to diagnose, treat and prevent illness using a variety of TCM methods /modalities . 2. The entry -level occupational competencies build and expand upon the developments required by traditional use, scientific advancements and social and legislative influence. 3. The entry -level occupational competencies are the foundation for all TCM professional practice and apply across diverse practice settings and patient populations. 4. TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists provide health -care services relating to health promotion and maintenance, illness , injury , prevention, rehabilitative care, curative and supportive care, and palliative and end -of-life care. 5. TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbal ists may work in consultation/collaboration with other health -care providers to provide safe, high- quality patien t-centred health -care services. 6. The competencies examined in the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations are directed toward the professional practice of entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or and/or TCM Herbal ists will practis e in a manner consistent with their provincial/territorial regulatory body 's professional practice standards, codes of ethics and scope of practice. They will also practice in compliance with applicable provincial/territorial and federal law and legislation . 8. The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations described in this B lueprint are not constrained by jurisdictional variations in scope of practice . 9. The implementation of the registration e xaminatio ns will be determined by the individual provincial regulatory bodies . Successful completion of the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations does not constitute an automatic registration to practis e. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint - Final 7 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS I. Structural Variables Structural variables include characteristics of the examination that determine its general design and appearance: weighting (percentage) of the occupational competencies by practice areas ; format, question prese ntation and length of the exam; and taxonomy levels of cognitive ability upon which the exam cases focus. These specifications describe the important features of the national examinations described in this document and provide essential guidelines for how the occupational competencies will be measured using clinical cas e-study situations requiring open- ended candidate responses. a) Percentage of Examination Questions by Practice Areas The following tables provide the weighting (percentage) of occupational competencies by the nine (9) practice areas. 1) Interpersonal Skills 2) Professionalism 3) Practice Management 4) Traditional Chinese Medicine Foundations 5) Fundamentals of Biomedicine 6) Diagnostics and Treatment 7) Acupunctur e Techniques 8) Herbal Dispensary Management 9) Safety The numbering and sequencing of t he occupational competencies provided in the second column correspond to the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada (Appendix B). It should be recognized that the competency statements vary in scope, with some representing global activities and others more discrete and specific to TCM actions. Exam ination questions will be developed based on these competency statements and be weighted in the examinations according to the following tables provided on the next pages .

[3 Hours] The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case -Study Examination for TCM Acupuncturists . The cases will assess foundations, diagnosis - TCM illness and s yndrome differentiation, four inspections , etiology and pathogenesis, treatment principles, acupuncture treatment, and biomedical diagnosis and treatment considerations. [2 Hours] The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case -Study Examination for TCM Herbalists . The cas es will assess foundations, diagnosis - TCM illness and syndrome differentiation, four inspections , etiology and pathogenesis, treatment principles, herbal therapy, biomedical diagnosis and treatment considerations , and behavioural situations . [2 Hours] Format : The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations will consist of six to eight clinical case -study situations requiring open- ended candidate responses. For each case, the following presenting conditions may be provided: General patient informatio n such as age, gender, occupation and marital status ; Main/ Chief complaint ( for example, ability to quote patient 's own words) ; Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinat ions CARB- TCMP A Blueprint , Final 10 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) Patient medical h istory including previous illness, history of present illness, medications, supplements and allergies, surgical procedures, etc. ; Past medical history including medications, supplements and allergies ; Family medical history related to the current conditions ; Personal history such as lifestyle, diet, exercise, environmental factors ; Symptoms described by patient ; and Information collected by practitioner to assess the patient . Each of the clinical case- study situations requiring open- ended candidate responses will be assessed bas ed on the following six skill and knowledge areas : a) diagnosis - TCM illness and synd rome differentiation ; b) etiology and pathogenesis ; c) treatment principles ; d) acupuncture treatment ; e) herbal therapy ; f) biomedical diagnosis and treatment considerations. Each of these six skill and knowledge areas are described below . a) Diagnosis: T CM illness and syndrome differentiation - Candidates will be responsible for the formulation of a TCM diagnosis based on the understanding of four inspections, etiology, pathology and syndrome differentiation. Diagnosis includes the name of TCM illness, sy ndrome differentiation and reasons for diagnosis. Questions may refer to, but are not limited to competencies outlined in 4, 6.2, 6.3. b) Etiology and pathogenesis (reason for diagnosis) - Candidates will be responsible for explaining the pathogenic factors i nvolved in development of the chief complaint and the pathogenic process producing the symptoms. In some cases , explanation of the primary and secondary causes may be required. Questions may refer to, but are not limited to competencies outlined in 4, 6.3. c) Treatment Principles - Candidates will be expected to outline appropriate TCM principles of treatment ( zhi ze ) based on the diagnosis. This should serve as a guideline for treatment selection and rationale. Questions may refer to, but are not limited to competencies outlined in 4, 6.4a. d) Acupuncture Treatment - Candidates will be responsible for applying the fundamentals of acupuncture in developing the treatment plan. Questions may refer to, but are not limited to competencies outlined in 6.4, 6.5, 6.8, 7, 9. e) Herbal Therapy - Candidates will be responsible for applying the fundamentals of TCM in developing an herbal treatment plan. Questions may refer to, but are not limited to competencies outlined in 4.3, 4.4, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7, 8, 9.1, 9.3. f) Related biomedic al diagnosis and treatment considerations , and other behaviou ral situations - Candidates will be responsible for identifying possible biomedical and other concerns, and outline appropriate clinical management. Questions may refer to, but are not limited to competencies outlined in 1, 2, 3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 9.3. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint - Final 11 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) c) Percentage of Examination Questions by Category of Cognitive Ability To ensure that the competencies are measured at different areas of cognitive ability, each question on the Pan- Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations will be classified into one of three categories: knowledge, comprehension/application or analysis and interpretation. 2 Table 2: Percentage of Scoring by the Category of Cognitive Ability Categories of Cognitive Ability Weighting of Scores Knowledge 10-15% Comprehension and Application 40-45% Analysis and Interpretation 45-50% Knowledge The category focuses on performances that involve remembering information. It combines the ability to recall previously learned material with the ability to understand its meaning. It includes such cognitive abilities as knowing and understanding definitions, facts, concepts and principles (e.g., the ability to identify the principles of treatment). Comprehension and Application This category refers to the ability to apply knowledge and learning to new or practical situations. It reflects the ability of entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists to apply rules, methods, principles and theories in different scenarios (e.g., the ability to describe the treatment method for illness). Analysis and Interpretation This category focuses on performances that involve analyzing and interpreting information. It includes the ability of entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists to judge the relevance of data, to deal with abstractions and to use clinical reasoning and inquiry to solve problems (e.g., the ability to formulate and justify a treatment plan). Entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists should be able to identify cause -and-effect relationships, distinguish between relevant and irrelevant data, formulate valid conclusions and make judgments concerning the needs of patients. Table 3 presents examples of performance indicators and common verbs that may be used as a guide when the examination questions based on cognitive abilities are constructed. These are examples and do not represent an exhaustive list. 2 Classification system modified from Bloom, 1956.

Partial marks may be awarded, where applicable, for accurate but incomplete responses. The scoring of the response will be aligned to the difficulty of the questions as well as the stated expected competencies as described in Table 4 below . Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint - Final 13 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) Table 4: Aligning the L evel of Complexity and Expected P erfor mance s Maximum Marks Level of complexity and expected performances 4 marks These will be questio ns with a higher level of complexity requiring some explanation in a few sentences or multiple answers; t hese questions may require using knowledge and skills from two or more topics (e. g., formulating a prescription) . 2-3 marks These will be qu estions of increasing complexity requiring identification of general principles (e. g., point selection within given theory, treatm ent principle , syndrome differentiation, important symptoms, naming classic formula ). 1 mark These will be re latively simple questions (less complex ) requiring one to two word responses where only one answer is possible (i.e., TCM illness, depth of insertion) . Generally, no marks are deducted for incorrect spelling (unless knowledge of the exact terminology is explicitly being tested). Also, in cases where there is more than one way to express the correct response, alternate wording of the correct response is de emed acceptable. The scoring key may include examples of acceptable alternate wording, usually in brackets alongside the correct response element. This helps guide the markers in determining the equivalency of terms or in interpreting the scoring key for s ituations in which a potential for misinterpretation exists. All candidate responses will be scored by experienced and trained subject matter experts (e.g., TCM practitioners, TCM acupuncturists, TCM herbalists, educators) using the chain-marking system. T hat is, once the candidates' test books are received, they will be photocopied and then collated according to the marking session guidelines. First, candidates' responses to each of the questions are independently hand- scored by two subject matter experts and second, any discrepancies between the two scor es are discussed to ensure that all candidates' responses are fairly and objectively scored. Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinat ions CARB- TCMP A Blueprint , Final 14 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) II. Contextual Variables Contextual variables qualify the content domain by identifying the contexts in which the exam ination questions will be set. They include patient demographics and lifespan, TCM illnesses and practice environment. a) Patient Demographics and Lifespan The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations may include questi ons pertaining to individuals , families and groups , such as populations and communities . The Pan -Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations will include questions related to lifespan, from preconception through to advanced age, including end of life.

Pan-Canadian Clinical Case- Study Examinations CARB- TCMP A Blueprint - Final 21 August 2013 (Revised March 2015) CONCLUSION The Blueprint for the Pan -Canadian Clinical Case -Study Examinations for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners, Acupuncturists and Herbalists is the product of a collaborative effort between the aforementioned regulatory authorities and the TCM Practitioners and TCM Acupuncturists that served as Blueprint Development C ommittee members . Their efforts have resulted in the assimilation of the competencies required for entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists into guidelines for how the se competencies will be measured on national examinations using the clinical case- study format . It is recognized that TCM, acupuncture and herbology practice will continue to evolve. As this occurs, this Blueprint document (i.e., t he test development guidelines) will require revision to accurately reflect the scope of practice, roles and responsibilities of the entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists . The guidelines for the national examinations provided in this document will be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure relevance to TCM and acupuncture practice, to respond to changes in the Canadian health- care environment, progress in evidence -based knowledge and changing Canadian demographics. CARB -TCMPA, in consultation with its examination provider, Assessm ent Strategies Inc., will ensure that such necessary revisions take place.
