Although some studieshave looked at the attitudes of non-immunisers, 12no quali- tative studies have explored the perspective of parents whohave, and who have not, accepted MMR since the recentconcern about its safety. This study investigated factors that influenced parents' decisions about MMR, with emphasis on the impact of the recent controversy. Understanding the concerns of parentsmay enable health care professionals to address these andprovide an immunisation service that is more responsive totheir needs. Methods Six focus groups13were held with parents in Avon and Gloucestershire. Three groups comprised parents who hadaccepted MMR for their youngest child ('immunisers') andthree comprised parents who had refused MMR ('non-immu-nisers'). Their children had a range of histories for immuni- sations other than MMR. Sampling was purposeful, so that parents were included from a variety of socioeconomicbackgrounds who had either accepted or refused MMRimmunisation for their youngest child, aged between 14months and three years at the time of recruitment (Box 1).Ethical approval was obtained from Bristol, Frenchay, Bath,and Gloucestershire local research ethics committees. Each focus group was facilitated by a moderator and assisted by a different member of the research steering group. The discussions were tape-recorded and fully tran-scribed. The moderator used a series of open-ended ques-tions about child health, attitudes towards immunisation, thedecision-making process, and the effects of the media andother influences on immunisation decisions, but participantswere encouraged to explore issues about immunisation thatwere important to them. The discussions lasted between one and two hours and were held in a convenient location for the parents where a cr\u00eache was provided.

Despite reassurances about the safety ofMMR, uptake levels remain lower than optimal. We need to under-stand what influences parents' decisions on whether to accept MMRor not so that health professionals can provide a service responsiveto their needs. Aim: To investigate what influences parents' decisions on whether to accept or refuse the primary MMR immunisation and the impactof the recent controversy over its safety.Design: Qualitative study using focus group discussions. Setting: Forty-eight parents, whose youngest child was between 14 months and three years old, attended groups at community halls insix localities in Avon and Gloucestershire.Methods: Purposive sampling strategy was used to include parents from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. Three groups com-prised parents who had accepted MMR and three groups comprisedparents who had refused MMR. Data analysis used modifiedgrounded theory techniques incorporating the constant comparativemethod.Results: All parents felt that the decision about MMR was difficult and stressful, and experienced unwelcome pressure from health pro-fessionals to comply. Parents were not convinced by Department ofHealth reassurances that MMR was the safest and best option fortheir children and many had accepted MMR unwillingly. Four keyfactors influenced parents' decisions: (a) beliefs about the risks andbenefits of MMR compared with contracting the diseases, (b) infor-mation from the media and other sources about the safety of MMR,(c) confidence and trust in the advice of health professionals andattitudes towards compliance with this advice, and (d) views on theimportance of individual choice within Government policy on immu-nisation. Conclusions: Parents wanted up-to-date information about the risks and benefits of MMR to be available in advance of their immu-nisation appointment. Many parents did not have confidence in therecommendations of health professionals because they were awarethat GPs needed to reach immunisation targets. Most parents would,however, welcome more open health; decision making.until theoretical saturation was reached, according to the constant comparative method.14Transcribed data were analysed using modified grounded theory techniques15by the research team. The transcripts were scrutinised, emerg-ing themes and sub-themes were agreed, and an initial cod-ing index was developed. Sections of text were coded andthese codes were applied to subsequent transcripts. Furthercodes were added as new themes emerged. Three mem-bers of the team coded some transcripts independently anda high level of consensus was achieved. Microsoft Word wasused to develop individual files for each theme, allowing thetext to be sorted and analysed in detail. Results Four key factors influenced parents' decisions about whether or not to accept MMR. Despite having made differ- ent choices, immunisers and non-immunisers shared manysimilar views about the MMR vaccination. Similarities anddifferences between the beliefs of immunisers and non-immunisers will be explored for each of these four keythemes. Beliefs about the risks and benefits of immunis- ation compared with the risks associated withcontracting measles, mumps or rubella All parents perceived that MMR brings potential benefits and potential risks for their children. Although the immunisers tended to stress the benefits of immunisation and the dangers of the diseases to a greater extent than the non-immunisers, they still remained unhappy about MMR and itspossible association with childhood autism and bowel dis-orders. Parents in all the groups talked about their anxietyover this possible association.'You have this doubt in your mind, however small I may feel it may be ... autism ... Crohn's disease ... why putparents through the anxiety of thinking, 'Well did I do it bygiving them the immunisation or would it have occurrednaturally?\".' V (Non-immuniser.) 'Afriend's child was, you know, described as autistic and you think, this was after his MMR, it may not havebeen as a result of that but it does make, if it's close tohome it makes you think.' L (Immuniser.) Non-immunisers realised that, by refusing MMR, their chil- dren might contract the diseases and did not rely on herdimmunity to protect their children. However, they felt that therisk of serious complications from the diseases was small ina country such as the United Kingdom, with generally goodstandards of health and nutrition. This view was also sharedby the majority of immunisers. 'I mean in the Third World obviously it's a killer, I don't believe that measles is a killer here, I haven't heard ofanybody dying.' C (Immuniser.) The majority of parents felt they could reduce their chil- dren's susceptibility to contracting diseases and developingserious complications by maintaining their general health. 'We tend to think while they're healthy it's not going to be ... the chances are so small of any serious complicationthat it's probably better that they catch the things.' I (Non-immuniser.) 'The vulnerable children are the ones who don't have good diet or who are from, you know, poorer back-grounds and who obviously are more open to infectionin the first place if there are epidemics.' R (Non-immu- niser.) Most parents had contracted some or all of the diseases in their own childhood, but their personal experiences werenot good predictors of their own child's immunisation status.For example, many who had suffered measles severely did British Journal of General Practice, November 2001 905Original papers HOW THIS FITS IN What do we know? Immunisation safety scares provoke anxiety among parents and lead to areduced uptake. Following the recent mediareports of doubts over the safety of MMR, its uptake inthe United Kingdom has fallen to a level where epidemicsof disease could result, despite Department of Health reassur-ances about its safety. A recent survey of health professionalsidentified a need for training and updating about immunisationissues so that they can respond promptly and appropriately to parents' concerns. What does this study add? Doubts and anxieties about MMR safety are prevalent,both among parents who have accepted and those whohave refused MMR for their children. Department of Healthstatements are insufficient to reassure parents about MMR'ssafety. Decisions about whether to accept or refuse MMRreflect the degree of parental trust and confidence in medicalrecommendations and their attitudes towards compliance.Parents want a more informed and open discussion withhealth professionals about MMR and access to detailedinformation about its risks and benefits.

Study participants.not immunise their children. 'I had measles at six or something and it allegedly dam- aged my eyesight very badly but, and I wear lenses now,I'm very blind but, I still would rather run the risk that Gcatches it sometime now and we catch it quickly enoughto put him in bed and so on, than expose his immunesystem at the age of whatever, a year, to something [vac- cination] that may or may not have serious effects on the system itself.' I (Non-immuniser.) Parents generally felt that it was important to develop their child's 'natural immunity' through exposure to mild infec- tions. For non-immunisers, this included early expo- sure to measles, mumps and rubella. In contrast, they feltthe combined immunisation might be harmful to the child'simmune system. 'It's very healthy to have them and it's a positive benefit to the child to actually have those illnesses properly, nota kind of half-hearted thing after the vaccination whichdoes happen.\" W (Non-immuniser.) Vaccines in general were perceived by some of the non- immunisers as placing stress on a child's immature immunesystem, with possible short and long-term consequences fortheir health. For example, an increased susceptibility to aller-gies, asthma, and eczema was mentioned, and the potentialfor developing autoimmune diseases, cancer, and AIDS. Non-immunisers also cited the process of vaccine produc- tion and the use of animal products as further disincentivesto immunise. A minority of non-immunisers also believed that having the diseases assisted the child's psychological and physicaldevelopment and enhanced family relationships. Non-immunisers were less fearful of diseases in general, perceiv-ing that they were a necessary part of the spectrum of lifeand the balance of nature. They reported that they wouldprefer their children to contract the diseases while they wereyoung to avoid a more severe infection or more seriouscomplications when older, such as male sterility frommumps or congenital rubella syndrome in pregnancy. Many parents were confused about the role of breastfeed- ing in promoting immunity, as they were told that this trans-ferred maternal immunity, but that immunisation was alsonecessary. 'I've just been told that ... breast feed ... you get immu- nity so I wonder why the pressure. I feel that the medicalprofession can't have it both ways, they say breastfeedbecause the baby gets your immunity therefore well, whyhave vaccinations then until you stop.' C (Immuniser.) All parents felt that immunisation was associated with some risk and very few approached MMR with completeconfidence. Although some parents were opposed to allimmunisations, many more had concerns specifically aboutMMR, especially the widely publicised possible associationwith Crohn's disease and autism. 'I'm not actually anti-vaccines, I'm quite sort of pro-vaccines, it's MMR in particular that I have a problem with.' C (Non-immuniser.) For many parents in all groups, the three separate vac- cines for measles, mumps, and rubella were seen as a saferoption and one which placed less stress on the immune sys-tem. Vaccine effectiveness was generally accepted by immu- nisers, despite some knowing immunised people who had developed the diseases. All groups, however, were con- cerned about the duration of protection from MMR, with theneed for an MMR booster raising doubts about its long-termeffectiveness. 'I would prefer to give my child protection against MMR nat- urally through catching the disease than have to keep boosting him for however long it takes.' H (Non-immuniser.) Many non-immunisers felt that the immunisation pro- specific 'high forexample; rubella immunisation for teenage girls, or mumpsfor boys. Data from this study therefore showed that parents went through a process of weighing up the risks and benefits of immunisation, but this process does not fully explain thedecisions they made. For example, many who perceived therisks of MMR to be very small still found it unacceptable. 'They still cannot categorically say the vaccine is safe and until, however small the doubt in my mind is, I feel prob-ably it is safe but I can't live with that and until someone can categorically say that it's going to be all right, it's not going to be acceptable to me.' V (Non-immuniser.) The rational analysis of risks and benefits was, however, overlain by other attitudes and psychological processes.Other processes which contributed to parents' decisionsabout MMR are discussed below. Responses to information from the media and other sources about vaccine safety The media publicity about the possible link between MMR, autism, and Crohn's disease had raised doubts in the minds of people who had not previously questioned the safety ofimmunisation. 'It was because of the media and the press that I looked into the MMR and decided well whoa, I'm not having thatyou know, otherwise, before, I didn't just didn't think any- thing of it.' C (Non-immuniser.) Although parents recognised that information in the media can be sensationalised, reassurances about the safety of thevaccine issued by the Department of Health were treatedwith scepticism as parents felt that their concerns had notbeen adequately addressed. Many parents believed that thepossible link with autism and Crohn's disease was not resolved, so were unwilling to accept MMR. 'There is a question mark behind the MMR whether that's 906 British Journal of General Practice, November 2001M Evans, H Stoddart, L Condon, et alBritish Journal of General Practice, November 2001 907Original papers proven or not there was a question mark, enough for me to sit down and think about it and I think they misjudged that completely ... people do want to know these days, that's the era we're living in ... don't just pat us on thehead and say \"Oh you'll be OK\".' A (Immuniser.) Generally parents did not have confidence in statements issued by the government about the safety of MMR andanalogies were made with the BSE crisis. Parents had there-fore obtained other information from a variety of sources, to investigate the safety of MMR. Although parents were gen- erally well informed about immunisation, they reported thatinadequate information had hampered their decision-makingprocess. Apart from consulting health professionals (seebelow) parents consulted family and friends, the Internet,and a range of 'alternative' books and articles such as 'Whatthe doctors don't tell you'. 16They felt that much of the avail- able information was biased, either strongly pro-immunisation or anti-immunisation. 'There doesn't seem to be anything balanced does there, there's either the government sort of, yes, youknow it's definitely very safe and every child should haveit or there's the other side where, you know, they shouldn't have any etc, and it's very hard to try and work out from those two what to do.' A (Non-immuniser.) Parents suggested that more information from indepen- dent sources should be easily available at GP surgeries andcommunity clinics. Currently available leaflets were felt to belimited in scope and failed to address their concerns. 'But that's very confusing isn't it, as a parent because you obviously want the best for your child and when yousee all these reports ... and you're trying to look at it andmake an educated decision .... I think just basicallythere's a complete lack of information ... I think thereneeds to be something a bit sort of totally universal thateveryone can sort of get their hands on and that's inde- pendent 'cause I think people are just either way polarised.' H (Immuniser.) 'It is impossible to get figures that we know are objective and trustable.' I (Non-immuniser.) Confidence and trust in the advice given by health professionals and attitudes towards com- pliance with medical recommendations Parents often found it difficult to have an open discussion with health professionals about the risks, benefits, and options for immunisation, which they felt would have helped them make an informed decision. In fact, they reportedunwelcome pressure from professionals to accept immuni-sation and many immunisers had accepted MMR becauseof this pressure rather than making an informed choice, feel-ing that it was easier to comply than to refuse. 'Sometimes the doctors and nurses at the surgery can be too much you know, you must have it, you know? And that's what puts a lot of people's backs up doesn't it real-ly, your choice is gone a bit isn't it?' B (Immuniser.) 'I, it was really just ... bowed under the pressure that we had the vaccination done, I think. ' A (Immuniser.) 'We thought long and hard before we had the immunisa- tion done and we're still not happy having had it done.'K (Immuniser.) 'You're sort of shoved into it because you think it's the right thing, but you do feel like it's the lesser of the twoevils.' L (Immuniser.) Many felt afraid to ask questions in case they were labelled as a 'nuisance'. 'I'm sure they've got it on my file, \"neurotic mother\".' N (Immuniser.) 'They put red all over the notes, red pen, they write REFUSED in big red letters all the way across the child'smedical notes so they've sort of got 'difficult parent' intheir mind!' L (Non-immuniser.) However, for non-immunisers, this pressure to comply made them more resistant to having the immunisation,although some also described how difficult it felt to goagainst medical advice. 'But it's hard isn't it if you begin to make an enemy of your doctor by pushing things then you can feel very outon a limb.' W (Non-immuniser.) Several examples were given of non-immunised children being offered opportunistic immunisations in accident andemergency departments, or during a hospital admission,which parents felt was both inappropriate and distressing.Parents recognised however, that health professionals arethemselves under pressure to reach immunisation targets. 'All credit to health visitors but they toe the government line, there's no choice about it.' A (Immuniser.) Non-immunisers were particularly concerned about GPs receiving payments for achieving immunisation targets.Because of this, parents worried that the recommendations of health professionals may partly be motivated by financial factors and not purely by the child's best interests. 'Because the GP's funding is based on their quota of immunised children that's something that made me verysuspicious about the whole thing. I've got to have immu-nisation for my child because otherwise they won't gettheir funding, that's already weighted isn't it.' L (Non- immuniser.) However, health visitors and doctors who discussed immunisation issues openly with parents were highly valued.Parents suggested that designated times for discussionsabout immunisation with health professionals should be908 British Journal of General Practice, November 2001M Evans, H Stoddart, L Condon, et al considered, such as meeting in a group during antenatal education or postnatal support. They also wanted to receive information before their scheduled immunisation appoint- ment and suggested this could be sent out with the immuni-sation appointment card. This would enable further discus-sion and reflection before their decision was reached. 'I can't believe that in this day and age they can't get the information across to the parents.\" N (Immuniser.) 'I might not have had the MMR vaccination, I was given the fact sheet after my son had had it, which I was a bit cross about.' C (Immuniser.) Many of the non-immunisers had had their older children immunised, but had changed their views over time as theyreported feeling more confident about questioning profes- sional recommendations and exploring alternatives as their experience as parents grew. Views on the importance of individual choice within government policy on immunisation The potential conflict between government policy setting immunisation targets and the rights of parents to make theirown choice about immunisation was an important issue forthe participants. 'They [the government] are making decisions for what they see as society as a whole and we're making deci- sions for our individual children so we are polarised tostart with.' R (Non-immuniser.) As discussed above, there were concerns about the finan- cial incentives offered to GPs for achieving immunisation tar-gets and other vested interests, such as the investment ofpharmaceutical companies in the production of MMR. 'What I wish is that they wouldn't pretend it was value free ... to pretend money isn't a part of it, I find that real-ly irritating.' W (Non-immuniser.) Many participants had been parents over a long period of time and had experienced several policy changes about immunisation, which made them believe more strongly that they should follow their own instincts. 'I resent being told by a GP that I have to have something done because it's better for the population and I want tochallenge that somehow.' H (Non-immuniser.) All groups emphasised that parents should be able to choose which immunisations, if any, their children received,and they all wanted the single vaccines for measles,mumps, and rubella to be available as an alternative toMMR. Parents felt that the promotion of MMR was partlybased on considerations of cost and convenience, such asthe potential difficulty in tracking individuals for separateimmunisations, factors which are not generally discussed. 'We were angry that we were not given a choice, that it had to be the combined three together, why they couldn'tsplit it ... We were told no you couldn't ... we were never given that choice, we were just told this is how it is ... why are we not allowed to have it, why is there not the option to have any of those three separate vaccines?' K (Immuniser.) 'Just because it's easier and cheaper for the government to deal in those triples, doesn't mean that if you wantthem as single vaccinations you should be, you know,you should be able to have that.' J (Non-immuniser.) Many parents who had refused MMR said they would accept some or all of these single vaccines. 'I feel quite clear that I would have my children vaccinat- ed against measles as a single vaccine but I'm nothappy with the options available ... I only hope that if we do make a stand they will release a single one.' CC (Non-immuniser.) In addition, most parents felt that giving MMR at an older age would rule out any coincidental association with autism.Some non-immunisers had delayed having MMR, and wereplanning to have it just before school entry, but only some GPs had agreed to such arrangements. While acknowledging the role of immunisation in keeping disease incidence low in the population, parents' overridingconcern was for the health of their own children, which wasmore important to them than any commitment to the societalbenefits of immunisation. 'I think primarily your first thought is, Oh yes, my child and I want to protect them and then as a knock-on effect, as a secondary effect, if you like, the fact that it's goingto help everybody is a great \u2014 that's good, that's abonus \u2014 but I think the primary thought is \u2014 how it willbenefit your child.\" H (Immuniser.) Although a few immunisers felt that non-immunisers were 'irresponsible', the majority respected the opinions and deci- sions of others. Peer pressure was not a significant factor intheir decision; more importance was placed on people mak-ing their own choice. However, some non-immunisers feltthey had been criticised for not immunising their childrenand reported feeling unwelcome at playgroups or beingremoved from GP lists. Discussion The majority of participants found that the decision aboutMMR was both difficult and stressful. Surprisingly perhaps, both immunisers and non-immunisers shared similar anxi- eties about the MMR, despite having made different deci-sions. Although some parents were opposed to all immuni-sations, many more had concerns specifically about MMR,especially the widely publicised association with Crohn'sdisease and autism. 5Non-immunisers felt that the potential risks of MMR outweighed the potential risks from contractingthe diseases, and did not feel happy about complying with a policy which offered them no choice. In contrast, immunis- ers generally chose compliance, rather than making anBritish Journal of General Practice, November 2001 909Original papers informed positive decision. Although parents had assessed the risks and benefits of MMR, most felt that the information available to help themmake this decision was insufficient and unreliable and thathealth professionals were not easily available to supportthem. Many felt they could not trust their recommendationsowing to the pressure professionals are under to reach tar-gets and the financial incentives involved. This potential forconflict has also been recognised by primary health careprofessionals themselves. 17 Study parents' immunisation decisions appeared to involve more than a 'rational' risk/benefit analysis, and also reflectedtheir personal attitudes, beliefs and perceptions \u2014 a finding previously reported in a study of parents' decisions about pertussis immunisation. 18The media reports about MMR had affected most parents' immunisation decisions, except forthose few who were already committed to their views, beingeither strongly pro or strongly anti-immunisation. F or these people the MMR story had less impact. Although some non-immunisers were worried that their children might contractone of the diseases, the majority found it easier to live withrisking the 'natural' process rather than risking a definiteaction (immunisation), which might cause harm. This revealsa preference for an act of 'omission' rather than an act of'commission' as previously documented in a study aboutwhy pertussis immunisation was not accepted. 18 Did parents perceive that they had a responsibility to soci- ety by immunising their children to reduce disease inci-dence? Generally, their key concern was for the health of their own children, which overrode any commitment to the societal benefits of immunisations. It has been suggestedpreviously that parents who refuse immunisation are relyingon 'herd immunity' to protect their children, 19but this was not found in this study. Parents accepted that their childrenmight contract the diseases if they were not immunised, butthey were optimistic that they would make a good recovery,despite evidence about the dangers of the diseases. Theperception, expressed by some non-immunisers, that dis-eases can be beneficial to a child's development, has alsobeen reported recently in a study of a measles outbreak inan anthroposophical community. 20 Fears about the combined vaccine placing stress on the immune system, which was of particular concern to non-immunisers, has also been reported in a recent Australianstudy. 21Other combined vaccines, in particular the diphthe- ria, tetanus, and polio combined immunisation, also caused concern for some immunisers and non-immunisers, a find- ing beyond the scope of the present discussion. Although the groups were held in locations reflecting the socioeconomic diversity of the region, over half of the par-ticipants (54%) were highly educated and their mean agewas 35 years, which could limit the generalisability of theresults. Since this study was conducted much new scientif-ic evidence has been published, emphasising the safety ofMMR: 3,7-10evidence that was unavailable at the time of the focus groups. It is important that such findings reach thepublic domain and are presented in a form that can help par-ents make informed decisions. This study shows that much can be done by health care professionals to help parents make their immunisation deci-sions. Professionals may need help and support to develop an open approach with parents. Registrars in general prac-tice have reported not being trained in the skills required toinvolve patients in shared clinical decision making. 22GPs and health visitors may also need updating about the risks and benefits of MMR.23 A range of information for parents could be available at practices and clinics so they have timely access to thisbefore the immunisation appointment. New booklets andvideos are now becoming available, such as those pro-duced by Health Promotion UK. 24,25Information leaflets could accompany the immunisation appointment card andinclude fact sheets giving statistics of the risks of diseases,their complications, and the risks of adverse immunisationoutcomes, with reference to recent scientific findings. 3,10The study findings highlight key information items needed byparents, such as why the MMR schedule has changed, theimportance of immunising both boys and girls, the durationof protection and the rationale for boosters, the limited trans-fer of immunity in breast milk, and why immunisation isimportant at a young age. Only by fully appreciating the con-cerns of parents will health professionals be able to workwith them to restore their confidence in MMR immunisation. References 1. Petrovic M, Roberts R, Ramsay M.
