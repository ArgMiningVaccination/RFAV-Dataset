IAVI's candidate (IAVI C108, [rVSVG-SUDV-GP](https://www.iavi.org/news-resources/press-releases/2021/iavi-and-barda-partner-to-advance-filovirus-vaccine-candidates)) was [confirmed](https://www.iavi.org/news-resources/press-releases/2023/iavi-starts-first-in-human-phase-i-clinical-trial-of-single-dose-sudan-virus-vaccine-candidate) on June 27, 2023, the first participants have been vaccinated with a SUDV vaccine candidate in a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial in the U.S. Previously, [BARDA](https://aspr.hhs.gov/AboutASPR/ProgramOffices/BARDA/Pages/default.aspx) issued financial awards to IAVI to support IAVI's SUDV vaccine candidate. biEBOV bivalent adenovirus vectored vaccine is conducting a phase 1 study ( [NCT05301504](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05301504)), last updated on November 2, 2022. The Sabin Vaccine Institute USA produces the ChAd3-SUDV monovalent vector [GeoVax vaccine MVA-VLP-SUDV was against Sudan Ebolavirus. [Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-022-00512-x) published on July 25, 2022, demonstrate single dose protection and potency of the MVA-VLP platform for use in emergencies to contain outbreaks. [Soligenix, Inc](https://www.soligenix.com/). proposes developing SuVax, a single-vial, adjuvanted, heat-stable subunit vaccine to prevent filovirus infection for use in the event of a Sudan ebolavirus outbreak. The [Sabin Vaccine Institute](https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-receives-35-million-for-ebola-sudan-marburg-vaccine-production/) is developing a single-dose vaccine candidate for Sudan Ebolavirus. The [U.S. government](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/everglade-consulting-helps-sabin-vaccine-institute-secure-up-to-214-million-in-barda-funding-to-develop-and-procure-ebola-sudan-and-marburg-vaccines-301730564.html) will initially invest $35 million to produce up to 100,000 doses of ChAd3-SUDV. These vaccines may be part of ongoing U.S. preparedness efforts and response to future global outbreaks. The National Institutes of Health [Rocky Mountain Laboratories](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/rocky-mountain-overview) in Hamilton, Montana, developed a candidate forae vesicular stomatitis virus-based Sudan virus vaccine (VSV-SUDte. The investigators anticipate that giving people VSV-SUDV in a [dosage similar](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/experimental-nih-sudan-virus-vaccine-protects-macaques) to that of [VSV-EBOV](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/ervebo-ebola-vaccine) would provide rapid protective immunity to SUDV. VRC-EBOADC086-00-VP, a adenovirus serotype 3 vector-based Ebola wild-type glycoprotein from the Sudan strain administered intramuscularly. A [Phase I](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04041570) Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Clinical Trial to Evaluate Two Doses Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity. In August 2023, a [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00344-4/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email) found the cAd3-EBO S vaccine was safe at both doses, rapidly inducing immune responses in most participants after a single injection. The rapid onset and durability of the vaccine-induced antibodies make this vaccine a strong candidate for emergency deployment in SDV outbreaks. [YF-EBO](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00699-7) is a live YF17D-vectored dual-target vaccine candidate expressing EBOV glycoprotein (G.P.) as a protective antigen. A single dose of YF-EBO was sufficient to induce high levels of EBOV GP-specific antibodies and cellular immune responses that protected against lethal infection using EBOV GP-pseudotyped recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-EBOV) in interferon-deficient (Ifnar-/-) mice as surrogate challenge model. Concomitantly induced yellow fever virus (YFV)-specific immunity protected Ifnar-/- mice against intracranial YFV challenge. INOVIO announced on [April 12, 2023](https://ir.inovio.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2023/INOVIO-Announces-Acceptance-of-Abstract-for-Oral-Presentation-on-INO-4201-as-an-Ebola-Booster-for-rVSV-ZEBOV-Ervebo-at-ECCMID-2023/default.aspx), that an abstract had been accepted for presentation for INO-4201 as an Ebola booster for rVSV-ZEBOV ( [Ervebo](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/ervebo-ebola-vaccine)) at the 33rd European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Ebolavirus Human Monoclonal Antibody The WHO [recommended](https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2022-who-makes-new-recommendations-for-ebola-treatments-----calls-for-improved-access) in 2022 using monoclonal mAb114 (Ansuvimab; Ebanga) and (Inmazeb). ( [NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK574507/)) says monoclonal antibodies ( [mAbs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572118/)) are made in a laboratory to fight a particular infection and are administered during an infusion. mAbs are different than vaccines, says the NIH. Approved Ebola mAbs included but are not limited to: [Ebanga](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/ebanga-mab114-antibody) (mAb114) is a human IgG1 MAb targeted to the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, available in a lyophilized form.
