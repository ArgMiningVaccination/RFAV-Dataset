The current COVID pandemic is a stark illustration of the global interdependence between people and other animals. Resumption of normal societal function in the current COVID crisis will require immunity to SARS-CoV-2 either through natural means or through vaccination on a global scale. The rate at which unexposed people (currently most of the human population) become infected or ill is affected by many factors, including the potential for partial immunity (following natural exposure or vaccination) and subsequent reinfection. Use of naturally-occurring related coronaviruses in other animals to emulate this process is a novel and practical approach, and that is the goal of this proposal here. Rat sialodacryoadenitis virus (SADV) has transmission features that closely approximate those of SARS-CoV-2 and a similarly rapid disease course. Animals can be partly protected using another rat coronavirus (RCV) thus emulating vaccination. These characteristics allow researchers to perform rapid transmission studies to produce real transmission data that can be used in predictive models. Broader impacts include that these models can more accurately guide regional preventive measures such as social distancing, to minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread. An additional broader impact is the training of several junior scientists, and an all-female set of investigators, broadening participation of science. This proposal will use sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), a rat coronavirus with transmission features that closely approximate those of SARS-Cov2, to generate in vivo transmission estimates in rats informing a data-driven core SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed ? Infected ? Recovered - Susceptible) simulation model. In Aim 1, rates of infection and recovery will be determined in susceptible (nave) rats following exposure to SDAV. Thus, this models the current global dynamic of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. In Aims 2 and 3, the rates of infection and recovery will be determined in convalescing rats from aim 1 who receive a second near-term or long-term exposure to SDAV, respectively. This assesses the potential for individuals with recent naturally-acquired immunity to shed virus and models the near-term dynamics of SARS Cov-2 (aim 2), and the potential for individuals with waning naturally acquired immunity to shed virus and models the near to long-term dynamic of SARS CoV-2 (aim 3). Aim 4 will determine rates of infection and recovery in rats vaccinated with a related rat coronavirus (RCV), a vaccination known to provide partial immunity against SDAV, following exposure to SDAV shedding rats. This aim assesses the potential for individuals developing variable vaccine acquired immunity to shed virus and models the long-term dynamic of SARS CoV-2. Estimates obtained in Aims 1-4 will be used to construct a core mathematical model in NumerusMB. This will allow simulation of complex scenarios testing the effects of vaccination and social mixing on the susceptible population.

Control of the COVID-19 pandemic has relied upon a combination of social distancing, masking and vaccination to limit spread of the virus. Public health decisions, particularly regarding when to institute lockdowns are based upon prior knowledge of likely viral behavior. Predicting this relies upon simulation modeling, which in the case of a novel pathogen, must rely on assumed parameters. We generated data of coronaviral transmission that can be used to inform to inform such models. Using sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) in rats as a model of SARS-CoV-2 propagation, and Parkers Rat coronavirus (RCV) as a model of vaccination, the major goals of the project were to 1) Determine viral shedding on initial exposure and subsequent re-exposure via high risk and low risk exposure routes and 2.Determine whether animals that had been previously exposed to SDAV, or previously vaccinated with RCV, could shed virus and transmit disease on re-exposure to SDAV. Results indicate that low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated individuals is possible. These data support use of masks and social distancing even by vaccinated individuals in situations where background rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission are high. These data will support further complex modeling paradigms that can inform local and global social distancing and vaccination strategies for not only for COVID-19, but for potential future novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential.
