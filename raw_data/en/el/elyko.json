I'm doing a lot more of it and I'm sure I'm not the only one. I know that not everyone is into the idea of DIYing everything so I wanted to round up a few of the best all-natural and eco-friendly cleaning products on the market. You can order many of these products online, but you can also find a lot of them at your local grocery store, but before we even get into the brands, I want to identify what makes an eco-friendly cleaning product? Terms like \"eco\" and \"natural\" aren't regulated by the government so how can you be sure that you're getting a product that's good for your health and the health of the planet? This post was sponsored. All thoughts and opinions are my own; for more information please see my disclosure policy. In the US, cleaning companies aren't legally required to disclose the ingredients in their products. Which is a HUGE issue, especially seeing that many conventional cleaning products can emit volatile organic compounds (vocs the building blocks of smog) which can trigger asthma and allergy symptoms. And, if a green cleaning product is equally effective as a conventional cleaning product (which they totally are!) why would you want to clean your home with products containing harsh chemicals with labels like 'Warning!' or 'Toxic Chemicals!' anyways? For me, an eco-friendly cleaner is one that's non-toxic, derived from natural and organic ingredients, and most importantly is biodegradable so it doesn't negatively impact the environment. Biodegradability is really important when it comes to cleaning products because many of our products get into our waterways, think dish soap and laundry detergent, and I want to make sure that my products are going to breakdown quickly and not hang around forever.
