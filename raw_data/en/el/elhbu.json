The tetanus vaccination is not a single shot that provides lifelong protection. Instead, it is given in a series of doses. The tetanus vaccine is sometimes combined with vaccines that protect against other diseases like diphtheria. After the initial series, a booster shot is recommended every 10 years to maintain ongoing protection against tetanus. Tetanus vaccination schedule in children The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine offer protection against three different diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (also known as lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). It combines these three vaccines into a single shot, making vaccination more convenient and efficient. Individuals can build immunity against all three diseases by receiving the DTaP vaccine. According to the [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis-Vaccines-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx), children should receive the DTaP vaccine as follows: - First dose: At 2 months of age. - Second dose: At 4 months of age. - Third dose: At 6 months of age. - Fourth dose: Between 15 to 18 months of age. - Fifth dose: Between 4 to 6 years of age. Following this schedule helps ensure that children receive adequate protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis at the appropriate stages of their development. Children who are over the age of 7 years are typically not given the DTaP vaccine. A Tdap (Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis booster vaccine) vaccine given at approximately 11 or 12 years old. Tdap is like DTaP because it guards against the same three illnesses. It is recommended that a Td shot should be given 10 years after the Tdap vaccine to help protect against tetanus and diphtheria. The difference between Tdap and Td is the number of infections protected - Tdap is a \"3-in-1\" vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis while Td is a \"2-in-1\" vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria. Tetanus vaccination schedule in adults The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/tdap.html) recommends that unvaccinated adults or those who were not fully vaccinated as children should get a Tdap shot followed 10 years later with a Td booster. Consult your doctor to determine the appropriate catch-up vaccination schedule. They will be able to provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances. Tetanus vaccination during pregnancy Pregnant women who have not received the Td or Tdap shot within 10 years before getting pregnant are advised by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/tdap.html) to get the Tdap vaccination, during the early part of the third trimester, as early protection against pertussis to their unborn baby. Tdap vaccination reduces the risk of diphtheria, which can be fatal in the newborn. If you are uncertain about your vaccination history, you may require a series of shots to ensure proper immunization. Why booster shots? The tetanus vaccine does not give lifelong protection against the disease. Its effectiveness starts to decrease after around 10 years. Doctors recommend getting booster shots every ten years to maintain immunity. If there is a suspicion that someone may have been exposed to tetanus-causing spores, a doctor might suggest getting a booster shot earlier than the usual timeframe for children and adults. For instance, if you accidentally step on a rusty nail or have a deep cut that has come into contact with contaminated soil, your doctor may advise you to get a booster shot as a precautionary measure. Why tetanus vaccination is essential Tetanus has a high fatality rate, about [10% to 20%](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4220.pdf) of reported cases. Although tetanus is rare in the United States, with an average of only [30 reported cases](https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/tetanus/#:~:text=Tetanus%20is%20uncommon%20in%20the,their%2010%2Dyear%20booster%20shots) yearly, in Africa, almost [7.7 thousand cases](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1283155/number-of-tetanus-cases-in-africa/) were reported in 2020. In 2017, [38,000 people globally died](https://ourworldindata.org/tetanus) from the disease; almost 50% of these deaths were younger than five years old. Nearly all tetanus cases involve individuals who have never received a tetanus shot or have not kept up with booster shots. Vaccination is crucial in preventing tetanus. Is it safe? Tetanus vaccinations are safe, and side effects are typically mild. They may include swelling, pain, and redness at the injection site. Side effects may also include fever, nausea or stomach pain, tiredness, headache, and body aches. Although serious, allergic reactions, such as difficulty breathing, fast heartbeat, hives, and seizures, are rare. However, seek immediate medical assistance if you experience any of these symptoms after a tetanus vaccine. How do you get tetanus? Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani found in many places, especially soil, manure, and dust. Infection occurs when spores of the tetanus bacteria enter the body, which can [occur in several ways](https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/causes-transmission.html#:~:text=Tetanus%20is%20an%20infection%20caused,spread%20from%20person%20to%20person.): - Exposing open wounds to soil, faeces, or saliva. - Broken skin during a surgical procure. - Receiving intravenous fluid, drug, or intramuscular injection. - Stepping on a nail or sharp object causes a punctured wound. - Insect bite. Inside the body, the toxins released affect the muscles and nerves, causing stiffness in the neck and jaw muscles, sometimes referred to as \"lockjaw.\" It's important to note that tetanus is not contagious and cannot be transmitted from one person to another. Symptoms of tetanus Symptoms are typically seen within [14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/causes-transmission.html) of tetanus infection. Common symptoms include headache, and stiffness in the jaw, neck, and shoulders, which may spread to other parts of the body and cause muscle spasms. Difficulty swallowing and breathing can occur, potentially leading to pneumonia and aspiration. Seizures can also be a symptom of tetanus. Can tetanus be treated? There is no cure for tetanus, but the symptoms can be managed using sedatives to control muscle spasms. Treatment primarily focuses on reducing exposure to the toxins produced by the bacteria. To achieve this, your doctor may recommend: - Thorough cleaning of the wound. - Administering tetanus immune globulin as an antitoxin can only affect toxins that are not yet bound to nerve cells. - Prescribing antibiotics. - Administering the tetanus vaccine. The bottom line Tetanus is a severe and potentially fatal disease, but it can be prevented by ensuring you are up-to-date with your vaccine schedule and receiving booster shots every 10 years. It is essential to consult with your doctor if you suspect you have been exposed to tetanus. A tetanus vaccine booster is a precautionary measure after an open wound injury.
