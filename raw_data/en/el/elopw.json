It is avital component of needs assessment, health promotion, and clinical governance, where patientscan add value to audit, risk management, and quality assurance. Public consultation is ofparticular importance when developing and improving services for hard to reach groups, suchas teenagers. 1Participation is in itself health promoting and can enable communities to tackle their own health problems.2 And yet, training in public involvement is wholly foreign to most GPs, who consider consumeropinion unhelpful because of unrealistic patient expectation, invalid methodologies, and the biasof those with vested interests . 3Of the 20 000 accredited meetings run in the West of Scotland, for example, since 1990 none have focused on the training of GPs in public involvement. An editorial in the BJGP describes how a combination of burgeoning consumerism, rapidly escalating patient expectations [and] relentlessly increasing accountability is putting GPs in the hot seat .4Ruth Chambers refers to pressure from local champions or special interest groups for their particular pet causes in the context of the need for restraint when planning educational programmes.5 How can GPs reconcile the difference between their ethical obligations to the key stakeholder inthe NHS and their own professional values, which are too often tainted with prejudice or altruisticpaternalism? Hard pressed GPs find difficulty in allocating equal value to the patient perspective,however honourable their intent. How do GPs address the unconscious and learn to value theexpertise and unique information provided by voluntary organisations and single issue groups? Education and training is the key. Training in public involvement is omitted from most GPs undergraduate and postgraduate education. GPs need to be convinced of the benefits of patientparticipation, given practical support, and advised of pitfalls. The devolution of power and delegation of responsibility to PCGs and LHCCs requires that educational activities are extended to the primary care team and the populations within their remit.After all, uninformed people make uninformed decisions. The result in terms of publicinvolvement will be to build capacity, not only into the community but into the NHS as a whole. Currently, despite considerable political rhetoric, there is no financial or serious educational provision for such training. National strategic plans emphasise the what but not the how of public involvement. The how requires some basic knowledge, such as sampling techniques and an understanding of the concepts of community development, empowerment, and equity. Whilequantitative methods of data collection can give a global view to advise health planning,qualitative information (from interviews, focus group discussions, and other forms of interaction)allows us to go from macro to micro, identifying existing community resources, harnessing theenthusiasm and expertise of voluntary groups. But GPs need the relevant training, and suchtraining needs to be funded adequately. There is considerable literature on public involvement, several useful websites and resource packs for primary care teams available from the Health Education Board for Scotland. For theenthusiast, there are postgraduate degrees. To formulate judgements and make informed choices the public requires education about different treatments, services, clinical effectiveness, and the need for explicit rationing decisions.It is through education and training that we can develop a constructive relationship out of apathyand adversity and change the culture of medicine and our society.

Havingundergone a pilot phase over two years, thescheme is being supported by theDepartment of Health (DoH), with fundingto enable PCRTA to launch as a nationalscheme in March 2001. What is it? There are already a number of assessmentschemes in existence, such as the RCGPQuality Practice Award or the King s FundOrganisational Audit. None of theseconsider the research aspect of a primarycare team and yet, there are an increasingnumber of research practices across the UK.PCRTA therefore aims to measure andrecognise the quality of primary careresearch undertaken within general practiceagainst professionally developed, tested,and published standards and criteria. The increase in the number of research practices and the variety of work undertakenhas been recognised by the DoH who aredeveloping new funding arrangements forR&D in the NHS. 1The terminology used within these arrangements is reflectedwithin PCRTA where two levels ofassessment for research practices collaborator-led and investigator -led have been developed. The scheme also fitswith a recent DoH document on thedevelopment of a framework for researchgovernance. 2Similar to the principles of clinical governance, this aims to provide aframework to promote improvements inresearch quality. It is envisaged that PCRTAwill be a key step in achieving the elementsof research governance. How are research teams assessed? On confirming their intention to undergoPCRTA, research teams will be providedwith advice as to possible sources ofmentoring. This may be from a number ofsources such as a local primary careresearch network (PCRN) or perhapsresearch teams may wish to contactpractices who have been accredited withinthe scheme. Practices are then asked toprepare and submit written documentationrelating to key criteria. We envisage that thiswill be a team activity which, as highlightedwithin the pilot phase, allows researchteams a dedicated forum for discussion andstrategic thinking. Having assessed writtendocumentation, a multi-disciplinary team ofthree assessors then undertakes a half-dayvisit to the practice. Feedback is provided onthe day of the assessment visit, highlightingstrengths and areas for development. Why undergo assessment? PCRTA provides a process of continuingdevelopment for the research team. Systemsare being developed to ensure that localsupport is available from appropriatesources for practices entering the scheme.For example, building on the work from thepilot phase, a series of workshops is beingheld with PCRNs across the UK toinvestigate ways in which they canparticipate in the scheme. Continuing development is not only about practices having access to support andguidance. The assessment process itselfencourages discussion and planningamongst both the research and widerpractice team. An independent and externalassessment process complements this andallows practices to gain independentfeedback, encouraging them to develop inthe most appropriate way. Above all, PCRTA recognises and rewards excellence. PCRTA accreditation provides a kite mark of quality. This may be useful, not only in relation to the proposed researchgovernance arrangements but also inreassuring patients involved in practiceresearch, as well as providing a usefuldemonstration of a practice s capabilitiesand standards when seeking funding.

Wherever in the worldwe are working we still have great freedom toobserve the natural history of disease,whether modified by us or not, from itsearliest manifestations to the grave. Why then do we lag behind other branches of the profession when it comes to our researchoutput? Why are practices bombarded withunsolicited requests for help (16 to 24 a year,according to a recent paper 1) when they would like to be able to distinguish qualityresearch proposals. One answer is the relativeisolation of those who are keen to study ourdiscipline, whether as leaders or collabora-tors. Yet only a very small proportion of thevery large number of readers of this Journal need to participate to make a worthwhilestudy. Below are a couple of examples frommy experience, by way of illustration. A decade ago I responded to a request for help in the BJGP about patients with gout on long- term allopurinol. This led me to examine howquickly we diagnosed gout. This year theresults from 111 patients in our practice werepublished. Some years later I saw a request for help, again in the BJGP , with a study on the history of British general practice. I hadrecently read the day-book of a local GP from1903, and so was able to contribute inform-ation that would otherwise have lain undis-turbed indefinitely. Last year I was gratifiedto read an acknowledgement in Anne Digby s The Evolution of British General Practice1850-1948 . We are all busy, but those of us who enjoy research can often find time to exploresomething new. We should therefore like topublish a quarterly column, Requests forhelp , where researchers can seek collabor-ators. Usual studies would be anonymisedobservations that would not normally needformal ethical approval. To avoid yet morehalf-finished projects we are asking potentialrequesters to tell us something of what theyhave already published (which need not behighbrow). We shall similarly not publish asecond request for help until the first has seenthe light of day. Finally, to encourageeveryone we should like to print a synopsisand reference when it does. Is there a demand for such a column? Are the rules of thumb we have suggestedreasonable? Should we be more or less open-minded? What sort of subjects do researchersneed help with?

Let us call him Lane, for that is his name.He s an ordinary bloke who likes talking, lying around in the sun, tinkering with carsand fishing. I like him. He s a relaxed sort ofperson who always seems to have time todiscuss life as it comes. But he was notalways like that. Once upon a time he owneda company, had to meet deadlines andworried his guts out about what seem to betrivial things to outsiders. Then somethinghappened which changed him entirely. Oneday he had a chest pain and was admitted tohospital. He was there a day or two having allsorts of tests. He was monitored, had serialECGs , and blood was taken for things likecardiac enzymes, cholesterol, andelectrolytes. Eventually he had an exercisetest which was entirely normal. Theconsensus seemed to be that the chest painhad been due to indigestion. But fortunatelyfor Lane the tests had taken a day or two toorganize. And while he was sitting there inhis hospital bed a clever young doctor (CYD)who was on another firm sauntered by,glanced at Lane and had a thought. Thethought turned to conviction so the CYDbeetled off and found the consultant who waslooking after my relative. For the CYD hadobserved that Lane looked acromegalic.Predictably, this was something whichnobody in the family had noticed. But nowprobing questions were asked, scans weredone and the upshot was that the patient wasreferred to a neurosurgeon and had hispituitary adenoma removed just before it gotto his optic chiasma. A fact for which he wasextremely grateful. So grateful indeed that hedecided that if normal life could hang by suchthread he would take steps to enjoy it more.He sold his business and retired. Nowadayshe spends a lot more time talking, fishing andsitting in the sun. Which brings me to a patient of mine who found that she was allergic to the sun. Or soshe thought. Every time we had somesunshine she would be out in the garden, butshe noticed that a day or two later she woulddevelop quite severe nausea. By the time sheappeared in my surgery the weather hadusually changed and her symptoms haddisappeared. Physical examination, urinetests and blood tests were all normal. It was apuzzle. But in due course she attended thehospital outpatients and reported hersymptoms to a CYD who hit on the diagnosisstraightaway. My patient had sarcoidosis. Herblood calcium was usually within normallimits in the winter, but exposure to sunlightcaused her body to increase its production ofvitamin D, which in turn resulted in a rise inher serum calcium. This was the cause of theextreme nausea and lassitude of which shecomplained each summer. She was muchimproved by steroids, which she took in asmall dose for several years until thesarcoidosis had burnt itself out. Both these stories illustrate how important it is that other doctors, and especially CYDsIn October the BJGP asked for potential columnists to submittheir wares. The response has rather taken us by surprise, beingintimidatingly large andenthusiastic. Not at all Collegey! There must be a short intermission while our panel of expertsdeliberate amidst high security.New recruits to our distinguishedteam of columnists will beannounced in the February issue ofthe Journal. As an editor, I love this sort of thing. Splendid copy from all overthe place, to mull over at leisure. Iwould like to thank everyone whohas been brave enough, and creativeenough, to take time to write. (Andmore non-UK contributions are stillwelcome...) But in the meantime, and with authors perm ission, here is a taster... Alec Logan journal@rcgp.org.ukClever Young Doctorsshould have the opportunity to see our patients. No matter how clinically alert he orshe tries to be, the average mature GP isgoing to miss things which might seemperfectly obvious to a CYD. Medicine is noteasy, and the flash of inspiration only comesto a prepared mind. It is all the better if thatmind has been freshly prepared EE Cockayne Ihave a nagging sense of unease about thesituation with our sheep. Every morningthat they don t all come running promptly when we go to feed them, I immediately startimagining they are lying diseased in somecorner. Luckily, my imaginings have not yetturned into reality. They have all alwaysappeared in the end, usually just concludingsome private conversation before comingrunning. The problem is we have no way of transporting our sheep. My anxiety is abouthow we can get them seen by the vet if theydo fall ill and my horror of having to requesta home visit simply because we have notransport. I imagine it must be easy for urban sheep. No doubt they can amble a few doors down thestreet to see a vet when they are feeling a tadweak on their hooves. And even when theycannot make it, at least the vet does not haveto travel far to get to them. Up here in the wilds of England, perilously close to a contradiction in terms as that maybe, the time cost to a vet of coming to do ahome visit, a field call, is probably at least anhour. Quite possibly more than that if youtake into account our ineptness at catchingour sheep. Call it an hour though, since youwould expect a sick sheep to be a bit easier tocatch than a healthy one. At that rate of visiting it takes precious few requests for visits to completely wreck aworking day. The only way our vet can copewith this is because, presumably, such daysare few and far between. Nevertheless, myfear of helping to cause a day like that isenough to keep me worrying about our lackof transport. This is not the end of my concerns either. I also fret that vets will be forced into co-operative working out-of-hours. For all Iknow, urban sheep may already be used tothis sort of arrangement and it may be thatnone of them bleat about it, finding it to be anarrangement that is at least as efficient as anyother they have known. But I do not reallybelieve our sheep would be so impressedwere the change to happen around here. The simple mathematics of such changes dictates that, where the population density ofvets is small, the area needed in order to haveenough of them to make a viable co-op rota islarge. Therefore, a veterinary out-of-hoursco-operative in this area might well mean thatSheep trials and tribulations 76 British Journal of General Practice, January 2001the travelling distance to the out-of-hours centre is even further than the distance to thevet is already. Which would in turn probablymean that the vet on duty on any particularnight would be even less in a position to do afield visit than at the moment, beinginundated at the centre with coughing dogsand mewling cats. It is illegal to transport livestock by car these days. There have been prosecutions. Whatcould I do? As if all this is not enough, it is something else that actually stops me from sleeping.Something far more pernicious. Something soawful to comprehend I have already thoughtof a name for it: NHS4Legs. That s right, I am talking about a national helpline service thattriages all calls to vets. Then, the night Murdodevelops Rams Hurt Syndrome, I will spendtwo hours on the phone before being advisedto go direct to Edinburgh veterinary hospital.What would I do? Saul Miller It s a blustery day, white horses at a trotfrom the South-west. Force five, six? Imust swot up on the Beaufort scale if I'm going to earn my living doing this sort ofthing. We descend the granite steps of StMary's fine old quay, clamber over the legs of bemused visitors in a couple of pleasureboats, and are welcomed onto the medicallaunch by Martin its skipper, and his dogScout. As we head out towards Tresco,Martin brews the tea while I watch thewaves, elation tinged with apprehension.This is not exactly trial by sherry. The health centre, which I was shown round yesterday, is magnificent, a white-walled andslate-roofed octagon commanding grandviews of the islands and ocean. The waitingroom is airy, light, and spacious, the officesand consulting rooms generous, and themeeting room upstairs feels like a first-classlounge on an upper deck. No wonder Toby,the senior partner looking for someone tojoin him, is so cheerful: he used to work inthe Royal Navy. What I like about this job, ' he says, only half joking, is that the nurses do the realwork, and the doctors go boating! And so we do. Safely across the channel, and my tea still safely in situ , we jump ashore and head off to the branch surgery held in aroom in T resco s community centre. I ask an 80-year-old what brought him to the island. 'I was sent here for a rest forty years ago, and seem to have stayed . Such stories are commonplace, I soon discover. And having visited Scilly manytimes with my young family for gloriousholidays amid turquoise seas, white sands,and tranquillity, I can understand why. Thequestion is whether the reality of life on asmall island 30 miles off Land s End will live up to the fantasy I have long nurtured,and which I have thrust on my wife onlythree weeks ago. The other question, ofcourse, is whether Toby thinks I m right forthe job, and for him. After three home visits on foot on Bryher (population circa 60), we head back to StMary s. The sea is running across us, the boat is tossing about, it is very wet, and Ican t stand up. Scout opens one eye, shuts it,and snoozes on the warm engine housing.Toby and I repair to the cabin and he eagerlyopens the packed lunch thoughtfullyprovided by his w ife, Anne. Now it s trial by crab sandwich. That night Toby and Anne take us out to dinner. My wife and I have each had awonderful day, and are slightly high on thesights and smells of the sea and the strand,and overwhelmed by the kindness of ourhosts and the friendliness which we have meteverywhere. We are wondering whether I m actually being offered the job, andwondering if Toby is wondering whether Istill want the job. I take the plunge halfwaythrough our meal: Er we d like to come if you want us. Oh, good. We hoped you would. So that s how it s done! And I always thought job interviews were close encountersof the fierce kind. There remains the question of accommodation, not an easy one in a placewhere freehold values reflect the scarcity ofhousing and its desirability for retirement,and where rented accommodation is strictlycontrolled by the Duchy of Cornwall.Fortunately, an incoming doctor is regardedas a key worker i s n t that refr eshing? and we are offered a flat the following day.It will be a challenge to reduce our gallons ofpossessions into this pint-sized pot, but theview is breathtaking, looking westward tothe twin hills of the now deserted island ofSamson. We dream of sunsets beyondnumber, and cosy evenings battened downagainst storms and gales. I try not to thinkabout visits to the off-islands.

Nearby Raymochey Schoolhas compiled a book of local Cures.Everybody seems to be at it! So what is it that they re doing? W ell, let s take the erysipelas. Patients self-refer withany sort of spreading red rash. The odd onehas even been sent by a GP (heartsinks, nodoubt). Diagnostic criteria seem lessimportant here. The key ingredients are thedesire of the sufferers to be helped and myaunt s willingness to do so. There is faith on both sides of the therapeutic fence. Florencetakes a quantity of butter and divides it intonine pieces. She has a blessing which shemust say away in private. Then she asks thatthree pieces of the butter are rubbed into therash on each of three consecutive days. TheHoly Trinity must be recited during the butterapplication. At the end of the treatment, anybutter remaining must be buried in theground. No money changes hands, but hard-pressed gifts, accepted to avoid offending, arelater given to charity. Most Cures involve aprocess like this. There is a prayer,incantation or ritual of some sort. There is amaterial, such as butter, tea leaves, ribbon,cord or clay. The patient is given a role in thetreatment. The parallels with a GP s own ritual (the consultation) and material (the drug) areobvious, but while Florence s punter leaveswith a belief and a positive frame of mindafter a Cure, can the same always be said aftera GP consultation? I suppose, dear old auntieFlo doesn t have the constraints of ten- minute appointments to harness her healingways. The only computer she has in the placeis a new-fangled gizmo that can tell if themilk in the dairy is at the wrong temperature,and as for generic prescribing ... well, allbutter is undeniably the same salt-laden,arteriopathic dairy fat, but you just can t beatKerry Gold for patient satisfaction. Okay, so the Cure isn t doing anything other than making the individual feel better. That s the great thing about Cures they don tguarantee a cure! But positivity they do give,and in large amounts. The power of positivethought is a great thing, but giving it tosomeone is a skill few of us possess. Wecould learn much about this from otherspheres. Take the world of sports coaching,for example. Martin O Neill is a formerNorthern Ireland football international andnow a bespoke team manager. He tookLeicester City from nowhere and transportedthem to Europe. Now he s doing the same sortof thing for Glasgow Celtic. Whatever it is, he s got it aplenty. Man-management. Peopleskills. The ability to inspire people to feel andperform better. Celtic magic.

The last reportfor the Department of Health on services forhomeless people documented 13 primarycare centres around the country providingservices exclusively for homeless people. 2 The number of such centres has risen sincethen with the introduction of PersonalMedical Services pilot schemes. This paperseeks to give a personal, yet logical accountof the threats and opportunities inherent inproviding such a service. It is hoped that aframework will be provided to helpovercome the sense of mutual suspicion andpowerlessness that is often generated whenthe two worlds of homelessness and primarycare meet. Unsustainable reactive primary care In 1996, I started working as a salariedgeneral practitioner to the homelesspopulation of Leeds. I was effectivelysingle-handed, though I had the goodfortune to be based in a small cohesive team,comprising practice nurse, communitypsychiatric nurse, two part-time clientsupport workers, one secretary and onereceptionist. The service had been runningfor 11 years though I was the fifth GP to takeon the post (the high GP turnover is in itselfan indicator of the level of deprivation andneed among the client group.). 3 It quickly became apparent that we wouldnot be able to run a sustainable servicewithout radically altering the way in whichthe service was delivered. Though we hadpurpose-modified city centre premises, theGP was expected to provide a peripateticservice in the different hostels around thecity. This equated toproviding 13 surgeriesper week. Over 60% ofthe consultations werefor drug misuse but wehad no strategy The centrehad become a target foropportunistic dealers and, as such,avoid the need to take thedaily dose of methadonein a supervised way in front of a pharmacist. Prescribing of methadone ampoules was thenorm. Though the topic prescribingmethadone ampoules in a primary caresetting is controversial, 4,5it was obvious that by being the only primary care centre in thecity to do so we would become a target fordrug users who simply wanted to augment,and not address, their drug habit. Otherfactors contributing to our unsustainabilitywere that many of our patients fitted thecriteria of heartsink or difficult patient. 6,7 Eighty per cent of GP consultations were for drug use, alcohol use or severe enduringmental illness (or a combination of theabove). Although the team had goodinformal working relationships, there wasno forum for discussion of difficult patients.The skill-mix of the team was biasedtowards the clinical, with pooradministrative and management support. Ithas long been recognised that homelesspeople have difficulty registering with aGP 8,9and, by seeking to address that problem, the team had become a dumpingground for many difficult-to-place, but not homeless, people. The evidence base hassince confirmed what as a team we realisedin 1996, that to move towards a proactivesustainable service we needed a strategy fordevelopment. 10This would encompass an appraisal of where our service was currentlyat, where we wanted to be in five years, andhow we would get there. Through an annualteam away day , we sought to review ourprogress towards our goals. Devising and implementing a strategy Our strategy encompassed short-term,medium-term, and long-term goals. Short-term goals centred on improving the level ofpractice organisation to the extent wherebythe service that we provided was accessibleand available yet not placing intolerabledemands on the practice staff.

Though drug use isvery common in the homeless population itwas apparent that homeless people withother health problems (e.g. severe mentalillness, alcohol dependency, and othergeneral medical problems) felt toointimidated to use the service. Achieving abalance was inextricably linked to devisingpolicies around safe prescribing of opiates.Policies related to ensuring daily pick-up ofmethadone from the pharmacist, decliningto replace any medication that claimed tohave been lost or stolen, avoidingconcomitant prescribing of benzodiazepineswith methadone and ensuring thatprescribing methadone was part of a largerpackage of rehabilitation. Such policiesencouraged the patient to take responsibilityfor his recovery. These policies are now inkeeping with national good practiceguidelines. 11While achieving this, we worked towards medium-term goals thatincluded defining our priority group forprescribing, seeking to secure drugscounsellor support so that the GP was notprescribing in isolation, developing thecohesion of the multidisciplinary team, andincreasing the level of computerisationwithin the practice. We sought, and stillseek, to maintain a democraticmultidisciplinary team with shared powerand decision-making. We aimed for teammembers to be clear about their roles. Wesought to create informal and formal forumswhereby team members felt supported.Butler et al have described team discussion about problem patients as one of the mostpowerful means of effectively managing heartsink patients. 12I would add that as well as such a formal forum, activeinvestment in building the teams cohesionhas helped us to achieve most of our goals asa team. Working interactively across theprofessions rather than competitively or co-actively helps teams to mature and optimisetheir effectiveness. 13 Having achieved such a workingenvironment we then had a strong case toput to the Health Authority for increasedfunding to further help our effectiveness. Funding centred around two areas: the first was support for the GP through providing adrugs counsellor, additional communitypsychiatric nurse and increasing the hours ofthe client support workers, and the secondwas to secure additional GP time so that theexisting GP could be free to reduce hisclinical commitment to a level whereby thetwo-to-three-yearly cycle of GP turnoverwould be broken. If such additional timecould be secured, it would free the GP totake a lead on developing the practice slong-term goals, namely developing a robustundergraduate and postgraduate teachingand training programme and developing relevant research projects into topicspertinent to the health of homeless people. Personal Medical Services Pilot Scheme as the vehicle for fulfilling the strategyThe NHS (Primary Care) Act, 1997provided the legislation for new ways ofdelivering primary care through PersonalMedical Services (PMS) Pilot Schemes. Acentral objective was to improve thequality, range and accessibility of servicesthrough: tackling unmet needs with new oralternative services to specific populations deprivation services, e.g. for the homeless . 14 Why are PMS contracts proving so effectivein improving the health of homeless andother socially excluded, deprived clientgroups? We must await the centralevaluation of first wave PMS schemes forthe answer to this question. However, fromour team experience the answer is likely tobe fourfold. First, deprivation (and notprimarily list size) can be negotiated as thepriority for adequate GP remuneration.Taylor and Leese upon reviewingrecruitment, retention, and timecommitment of GPs in England and Walesfor the period 1990 1994 predicted that a new contract could in part improve retention . 15PMS has allowed us to become employed on a contract similar in practice toour hospital consultant colleagues with timering-fenced for clinical activities,management and administrative activities,and teaching and research. Secondly, PMSallows for projects at primary care level tobe funded from monies additional to cashlimited General Medical Services monies(e.g. growth or HCHS monies). Throughgrowth monies we were able to employ anadditional half-time GP. Thirdly, PMSprovides funding whereby additional non-GMS (secondary care type services) can beprovided in a primary care setting. Pre PMS-contract, our community psychiatric nursesand client support workers were employedby the local community mental health trustand the rest of the staff employed by theHealth Authority. PMS contracts overcomethe inherent problems of having amultidisciplinary team line-managed bymore than one organisation. Finally, thePMS contract enables primary care staff towork corporately in our case through thewhole team being employed by the localCommunity and Mental Health Trust.Homelessness has been described as acomplex social problem that requires acollaborative, joined up multi-agency response. 16By thinking and working corporately, primary care staff are able tomake a significant contribution toameliorating the suffering caused byhomelessness. Summary and recommendations for future service provisionIn July 1999, the Department of Healthawarded beacon practice status to the NFA Health Centre for Homeless People for theimprovements made in service deliveryleading to measurable health improvementof the homeless population. It has been ourexperience that the heartsink phenom enon can be competently managed and doesn tneed to be shied away from. To manage thephenomenon, we as primary care staff needto move away from a rigid medical modelbased on diagnosis, treatment, and cure to a soteriological model that g oes beyond the clinical to acknowledge and empathise withthe full range of human suffering thatpresents at our surgeries. We need to befreed from feeling that we ve failed if we hold patients suf fering, yet don t effect a cure. 12I often describe myself as a social palliative care doctor , since in common with other colleagues working with thehomeless population we are very successfulat ameliorating unpleasant symptoms yetintractable root causes remain. Mathers et al noted that the personality and skills of thedoctor could affect whether or not the doctorsees the patient as heartsink . 17Greater perceived workload, lower job satisfaction,lack of counselling and/orcommunication skills and lack qualificationsexplained in thenumber of heartsink patients that GPsreported. Such factors need to be taken intoconsideration when planning future healthservices for homeless populations. Therehas been little research into health care ofhomeless people in the United Kingdom. Asa result, using evidence-based medicine tochange practice is sometimes simply notpossible. This imbalance needs to beredressed with some urgency. I would like topropose several key areas in priority need ofresearch: 1. mainstream GPs attitudes towards the homeless and the consequent permanent registration of such people at their practices; 2. homeless peoples dependency on specialised primary care centres as described in this article and their ability to move into mainstream general practices once they are no longer homeless; and 3. developing fine tools to assess and quantify the risk to primary care staff posed by homeless people. Many of the risk assessment tools currently in use are neither relevant to the homelesspopulation nor to the primary care setting. In conclusion, it is my hope that GPs and primary care staff will feel empowered andmotivated to work with the homeless in anintelligent, professional manner andexperience the rewarding nature of suchwork when our mindset is broader than amedical model of diagnosis, treatment, andcure. Nat M J Wright British Journal of General Practice, January 2001 79digestTHESE are your post-Christmas, reducing-the-January-blues read, withtheir humour and zest for life. Sir Kenneth s is a must for every medical school and practicing doctor; John Graham-Pole sis intended for patients of serious illnesses,but is good for all of us. A study of story-telling, humour, and learning in medicine is exactly what it saysit is, in Sir Ke n s inimitable, readable, racy style Scots accent and humour included.Don t be put off by the possibly lightweighttitle (it would have been more lightweight,but the Queen Mother objected this beingthe result of the Eighth Nuffield Trust QueenMother Fellowship). Stories are at the heartof clinical practice : the patient tells theirs,the doctor caps it with hers, the student andquesting practicing physician learn fromthose of experienced colleagues. Thingspackaged as stories are memorable: we don tstore things like a computer, we story them. Stories help us to make sense of the world around us. [They] allow us to explore areaswhich are tentative, uncertain and evenheretical ; they can be used to teach andunderstand ethics. Why stories? What arestories? How do we interpret them(hermeneutics and exegesis)? When, whereand to whom are they useful? All arecovered in depth. Humour is a serious matter , because it can make us better, as well as feel better. A goodlaugh can support relaxation, raise the painthreshold, tone up muscles, boost theimmune system, and help lift shadows ofdistress and anxiety. It can enable us toexamine issues that are otherwise taboo,help us see things we hadn t seen if we are willing to interpret metaphors andparapraxes. It s a shame this book has no cartoons in it. At the Queen Mother Lecturewe were treated to belly-laugh pictures.Described cartoons are not so funny. We learn from stories; from humour. Our behaviour changes as a result of materialtransferring itself into our conciousness: ideas, feelings, and attitudes are caught, not taught. Sir Ken has coined a word for the role of story in this process transmid a contagious theory of behaviour . JOHN Graham-Pole s book is equally riveting. A handbook for patients withserious illness, it is equally useful for the worried well who would benefit fromacquiring a positive attitude to themselves,their physical, emotional and mentalproblems, clinical advisers and life situation.John asks his reader: are you noticingyourself more in charge of yoursurroundings, or your situation? Are youfeeling more supported, less intimidated andoverwhelmed, less out of control andhelpless? The title is a slight misnomer as an active spiritual and practical approach is offered, aswell as creative arts. Exercises throughoutthe text are interspersed with good soundadvice, stories about patients and staff, andquotations. The exercises are a mixturethroughout of the artistic how to startdrawing, begin a journal; and the practical how to befriend your doctor, start a support group. They are presentedimaginatively, attractively andstraightforwardly, making me feel likebuying a blank workbook immediately (ifonly I didn t have to sit at my computer hour after hour writing things like this). Of courseI keep a journal already and canrecommend the process of writing to helpyou understand, love, and care for yourselfbetter. The exercises teach how to listen, notonly to others, but also to our strong, wise,inner voices. The tone of the text is light. John Graham- Pole, a paediatric oncologist, deeplybelieves in the power of humour to lightentroubles, enable us to accept and still hope.His hugely successful playshops for staffalleviate stress, create positive attitudes,increase effective teamwork, and offerstrategies for alleviating mental, emotional,and spiritual pain in patients. Patch Adams,the funny doctor who wrote the foreword,habitually dresses and acts as a clown, andattends dying patients in a pair of angel swings to alert them to coming attractions .Patch writes: This century has pushedcompassion, humility, mystery, and joy outof our health care system in favour ofcorporate medical business, where thebottom line is profit not care. The focus ofthis book is to bring these back, as well ascreativity, self-expression, and sheer fun. To learn how to learn, how to gain more practical, spiritual and creative insight, andhow to have much more fun: read both thesebooks, and buy them for others.

The Great Court of the British Museum is a colossal space at the heart of the museum, originally housing the Reading Room with its miles of shelving and now , thanks to the re-siting of the British Library, transformed into a glass-roofed space with a massive central rotunda within which is the restored Reading Room. The m\u00d8lange of styles the square bordered by straightforward classicism, including that portico with its cut-price stone, the roof with its asymmetric pattern of triangular panes andarching struts compelling the eye to follow them round, and the Rotunda embraced by itsgreat outer staircases should jar but, triumphantly, it does not. There is, somehow, a light- hearted grace about the Great Court almost an impudence, when one places it against thefour-square solidity and solemnity of the museum as a whole. There are shops around thebase of the Rotunda. There are caf\u00d8s, and a restaurant high up in the Rotunda, with exhibition galleries at lower levels. There are seats and tables at which to sit and eat, or perhaps just tosit and watch and wonder. The Reading Room is, for the first time, open to all, with public access to the ground floor shelves. There are touch-screen computers for searches of the museum s treasures, and thewhole thing is liberated from the stifling old regime of silence and study and eccentricity and appalling dif ficulty of access in a way that changes the entire museum into something so much more approachable. The Great Court is huge the lar gest covered public square in Europe, but there is nothing portentous or massive about it, and nothing of the bated-breath syndrome. All is light and airand clarity. It is London s newest treasure, and it may be, for this generation of Londoners, what the South Bank was so many years ago, for ours. Michael Lasserson The Great Court of the British Museum, London THEfirst thing you notice as you enter the newly restored Great Court at the BritishMuseum is the white stone cylinder that encloses the Reading Room, not just for itsstriking shaping but for the names which adornit. The lower walls list benefactors in fonts ofdiffering sizes, presumably based on howmuch they contributed, in a display ofvulgarity not matched since Sir JosephDuveen had his name plastered all over the oldTate and the Parthenon Galleries elsewhere inthe British Museum. Worse, however, is thataround the top of the cylinder is inscribed amillennial dedication to, of all people, theQueen. While we should all be grateful thatsuch dedications are no longer made respectfully , it is a nauseating spectacle. HM contributes just about nothing to artistic life inthis country, actively impoverishing it by thedifficulty with which the Royal Collection canbe viewed; a collection which, incidentally, islargely paid for by our past contributions to herfamily s fort une. Short of dedicating the Court to Norman Tebbitt, it is hard to think of anyoneless appropriate. The use of the Great Court itself is scarcely more inspiring, with two corners filled bygrandiose information desks and two bycafeterias that generate long queues of boredand grumbling families. A few large sculpturalpieces scattered about on plinths onlyreinforce the sense that, having got thiswonderful space, the T rustees just didn t know what to do with it. The bizarre Hotung Gallery,an exhibition space wrapped around the backof the Reading Room, is equally directionless;its first show, a meaningless grab-bag ofimages of humanity, points up its unsuitabilityfor either the blockbuster or the intimateexhibition. And what of the portico controversy? For a start, it is through this entrance that one comesinto the Great Court, so only if you come inbackwards will it be the first thing that strikesyou. That diminishes any early impact a lot,and it actually just looks new rather than out ofplace, although it will never be exposed to theweathering that would rub off some of itsbrightness. As a howler by the Trustees, it doesnot compare with the grovelling to HM. The redeeming feature of the Great Court is the extraordinary roof. Its litheness andstrength are clear from inside, but it is notpossible to appreciate its sinuous shapeproperly. For the best view you need to go upin the London Eye, where its irregular foldscan be seen more clearly undulating aroundthe central dome of the Reading Room. Theother completely successful restoration is thecourtyard on the Great Russell Street frontage,where beautiful Portland stone walls andseating enclose new lawns either side of themain access to the Museum. All in all, though, the restoration is a very mixed bag, an initially grand and excitingconcept undermined by half-bakedcommercialism and embarrassing deference, acombination that perhaps defines this countryat the moment. Frank Minns British Journal of General Practice, January 2001 81reflectionKarel Fleischmann \u2014 physician and artist KAREL Fleischmann was born in 1897 in Klatovy, Bohemia (later tobecome Czechoslovakia). He studied medicine at Charles University, Prague andfrom 1925 worked as dermatologist inCeske Budejovice. Ever since childhood he had painted and written literary works and he was one of thefounding members of the avant-garde group Linie ( The line ). He published several novels, including The Return (1933), The Finger on the Map (1936) and People in the Doctor's Waiting room (1937). On 18 April 1942, he was deported to Ghetto Theresienstadt (Terez n), where hepracticed as a physician and worked as oneof the leaders of the health administrationand the social care department. He gavelectures and participated actively in thecultural life of the ghetto. He continued to draw, paint and write mainly poetry and essays; his best knownwritings dealt with the borderline between Medicine and Art. He was a close friend ofDr. Erich Munk, the head of the health caresystem in T erez n he drew him many times and dedicated many of his paintings tohim, including Waiting fo r the doctor (pictured below). However, on 23 October1944, Fleischmann was deported toAuschwitz, where he perished. After the war, about 1200 of his poems, notes, lectures, and drawings were foundpreserved in T erez n one of them was a long appreciation of his friend Erich Munk,who also perished in Auschwitz. Fleischmann s work, created in Terez n is, together with the work of the many otherTerez n artists, an integral part of the anti-Nazi resistance. Most of Fleischmann s works are now in the Jewish Museum in Prague but some are inthe Art Museum of Yad Vashem inJerusalem, including the ones shown below.

By allaccounts he was a very complicatedpersonality: elegantly dressed, withcomplete self-control;unapproachable alsouncorruptible, with but capable ofenormous self-sacrifice he oftengave his food rations to the childrenin the Dresden Barracks, even whenhe himself was severely ill.

Thus by drops and rivulets They gather in this dreadful sludge.These are not people who walk,Who only drag themselves along.It's only the drags of miserySoaked up by the ghetto walls.

OVER a hundred years ago, in 1897, Matthew Arnold wrote Dover Beach , a poem in which he lamented the erosion of Victorian faith and aclergy whose liturgy echoed an emptiness ofdespair. Evidence-based medicine has been likened to a Deity. A confident assertion thatjudgements about the nature of reality canbe based on technical authority andcompressed into an increasingly esoteric setof linear equations and mathematicalmanipulations. The creed inferential statistics and its ultimate instrument, therandomised controlled trial a thing ofbeauty . Now the essential truth without uscan be discovered and our interventionsdirected by explicit guidelines derived fromrigorous inquiry. But the early signs were to go unheeded. The foundation of modern science was to beone of uncertainty: The Sea of Faith was once, too, at the full, and round Earth's shoreLay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.But now I only hear its melancholy, long,withdrawing roar,Retreating to the breath Of the night wind, down the vast edges and drear And naked shingles of the world. Like their Victorian counterparts, the Paradigm continues to preach their sermonsas they seek to bludgeon their way tosolutions. The modern marches on, eachyear producing millions of research papersthat in general inform no-one but academicexercises. Do they secretly question their faith as they seek the truth? In their hearts they too mustwrestle with a description of reality as anever-changing approximation which, asthey make it more real, slips from theirgrasp stories for children? Listen! You hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,At their return, up the high strand,Begin, and cease, and then again begin,With tremulous cadence slow, and bringThe eternal note of sadness in. Did Arnold know how prophetic his metaphor was to be? Against a backgroundof rhythmical change The Sea of Chaos. Waves and pebbles, subservient to the laws of complexity. Sudden bifurcations, strangeattractors, sensitive dependence, self-organised criticality direct the equation ofThe Sea of Faith and the Death of Evidence-based Medicine state. Each of us a unique fractal onlyever viewing a limited gaze dif ferent yesterday than today, different againtomorrow. How can a rule-based analysis ever capture the rich internal detail that drives thesystems in which we live? Sophocles long ago Heard it on the Aegean, and it boughtInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow of humanmisery; weFind also in the sound a thought,Hearing it by this distant northern sea. The tension between empiricism and scientific insight is not new. The debate wasfounded in ancient Greek literature.Alexander argued for the uncertainty ofmedicine in a way that reflects modernchaos theory where behaviour of wholesystems can become unpredictable, even iftheir components behave in a simple way.Galen s view was that within medicine there existed a science with progressive truth thatwould be resolved by future progress. Morerecently, in 1789, Cullen proclaimed that for2000 years there had been two plansproposed for the study of medicine: thedogmatic and the empiric and we still donot know which choice to make. The sermons continue, The faithful intone their creed. Will evidence-based medicineever die? The dehumanisation of medicinethat undermines the art of healing. And themutual interconnectiveness that drivescomplex systems and their therapeuticemergence. The real world is not always defined by cosy certainties like guidelines, needs-basedplanning, and optimal solutions. But achaotic, complex, non-linear system drivenby the very factors that the randomisedcontrolled trial seeks to exclude.Contextual, irregular, and subtle. A systemof human frailties, feelings, and complexsocial rituals with limited room formanoeuvre. The danger that those char ged with making decisions will be seduced by thesimplistic solutions that the canon supplies. Ah, love, let us be true To one another! For the world, which seemsTo lie before us like a land of dreams,So various, so beautiful, so new,Hath really neither joy nor love nor light,Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help from pain;And we are here as on a darkling plainSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,Where ignorant armies clash by night.

British Journal of General Practice, January 2001 83matters arisingUK Council, November 2000 Communications with Faculties To improve and develop our commun-ications with Faculties and members,Council agreed that the unabridged Councilsummaries should appear on the Collegewebsite under Our College and Faculties ,attached as Council Summaries to the UKCouncil button ( www.rcgp.org.uk/rcgp/ corporate/ council/coun_index.asp ). They also agreed that, once approved at thefollowing Council meeting, Councilminutes should be made available onrequest to any member of the College. Devolution Council noted that as part of its incrementalapproach to devolution, the Chairs of UKCouncil, Scottish Council, Welsh Counciland of the Northern Ireland Faculty werenow meeting periodically to exchange viewsand catch up on developments in each of theconstituent countries of the UK. The Chairman of the Northern Ireland Faculty has been appointed as an additionalCouncil member, and also of CEC. Thecurrent Chairman is Dr Peter Colvin. This isa precursor to what it is hoped will be theformation of a Northern Ireland Committeefrom next Spring and in due course aNorthern Ireland Council, although thatrequires formal constitutional change. Valuing Scottish General Practice This important report being issued byScottish Council has started to influence thedebate and shape of the modernisationproposals as they emerge in Scotland. Thepaper draws on work that had already beendeveloped at UK level but within thelandscape of Scottish General Practice. Revalidation You will recall that the College togetherwith the General Practitioners Committee ofthe BMA held a conference entitledRevalidation: The Way Forward on 31 October. Despite the travel difficulties thiswas very well attended and well received.The major issues facing the College at thispoint were aired by the presenters andduring discussion. An edited video is nowbeing produced with the intention that it willbe sent to all Faculties for viewing. We intend to consult all GPs in due course on our Methodology for Revalidation inGeneral Practice ; however, we await theresolution of a number of important issuesbeforehand. These include: Resources for revalidation where there remains no firm assurance about what is to be provided. Resources are needed not just in the form of financial resources but in the capacity of the general practice workforce, the capacity for continuing professional developmentto conduct appraisals and to ensure that patients do not suffer because GPs are diverted away from surgery time for appraisal and other revalidation purposes.The appraisals themselves . We are still unclear what proposals might emanate from the NHS and that there might be differences between the approaches developed for England and other parts ofthe UK. One matter still unresolved is theappraisal regime for England where we await the CMO s proposals and whether they will prove to be appropriate for revalidation purposes.The need to pilot many aspects of revalidation. Pilots are planned by the GMC and we are ready to assist in ensuring that these are effective and informative.Ensuring that the systems for revalidationthat we develop and which the GMC is aiming for are simple, straightforward, and effective in identifying at an early stage poor performance with the means ofaddressing that. We intend to keep members informed of the development of our methodology towardsrevalidation. In the meantime, on the RCGPwebsite, you can find the College smethodology work-in-progress documentand the current version of our Good Medical Practice for GPs which is very nearly a final document. The link for these documents iswww.rcgp.org.uk/rcgp/corporate/reval_menu.asp . With regard to methodology, we welcome feedback to comments@rcgp. org.uk . GMC consultation on its future structure, constitution and governanceCouncil debated the College s response tothis important document. The view was thatwhile the GMC has analysed the need tochange correctly and has developed anumber of workable options, there was morework to be done in considering the roles andaccountabilities of its future governing andstatutory body and any wider body. One keypart of this was the extent to which layrepresentation should be strengthened andhow lay members should be accountable.The College s response has now been revised in the light of the debate andsubmitted to the GMC. Winter pressures The College is endeavouring to influence theplanning for winter pressures in the NHS atseveral levels. You may have read theexchange of letters between the Chair of theGeneral Practitioners Committee of theBMA and the Prime Minister. Our Chair-man, Mike Pringle has written as well andsent a fully referenced paper to demonstratethat GPs do not make inappropriate referrals.This activity stemmed from remarks madeby the Prime Minister at an address at theRoyal College of Surgeons recently. ThePrime Minister suggested that the problemsof long waits and high volumes of patientsrequiring acute admission or other secondarycare services over the winter might be due toinappropriate referrals from primary care.

They regarded theheart as the seat of the intelligence and thelocation of memory. What a hoot! Howcould they be so stupid? The ancient Egyptians lived a few thousand years ago. The Observer is published every Sunday, now, in the 21st century. Accordingto their Barefoot Doctor , one StephenRussell, the ears are the flowers of thekidneys. Thus, when kidney energy isdepleted, the result is tinnitus. It seems thatthe hair is controlled by kidney energy aswell. Hair loss is helped by massaging thekidneys to increase circulation to the head.The kidneys are obviously pretty important.While their energy is not tickling up the hairroots or tuning up the hearing, the kidneysare also responsible for the overallmaintenance of the womb and reproductivesystem. As an aside, they are also in chargeof eliminating waste through urination. Kidneys maintaining the female reproductive system was in a piece aboutpre-menstrual syndrome ( Observer Life , 22 October 2000). Much of the syndrome isdue to the spleen, which governs theappetite for sweet things and short-termmemory, but is diverted from this by theneed to build blood lost during the period. Iseem to remember that the spleen is not ahaemopoietic organ in the human adult, butthe ancient Chinese knew better. I know that these ridiculous statements are not the product of Stephen Russell s fertileimagination because I checked them in abook about Chinese medicine. Hisimagination is actually severely limited,because he is more prepared to accept ideasof how the body works and diseases affectit from a time when no one really had a clue and thought that the heart was the seat of memory. When he writes about the ancientTaoist view of the common cold virus he isrepeating nonsense: viruses were unknownto the ancient Chinese. This is all the more depressing for three reasons. First, judging from the BarefootDoctors general statements about health, he writes sensibly, has a good sense of humour,and probably helps many people. Second,the Observer is a quality broadsheet but nonetheless prints this nonsense. Which is a shame because, third, after the further denting of public confidence inscience caused by the Phillips report intothe BSE affair, we need all the help we canget if people are not going to revert toseeking fortunes in tea leaves, diagnosingtheir illnesses by pendulum, and demandingeye of newt on the NHS. Nev.W.Goodman@bris.ac.ukneville goodman This is set in the context of wider fears being expressed that primary care will be blamedfor the NHS s inability to cope this winter. It will be of special importance to theGovernment in what is expected to be thewinter before the next General Election. Ifyou can offer actual evidence of the abilityof general practice and primary care toabsorb peak demand effectively, then pleasefeed this into any member of your UKofficer team or your Faculty representative. NICE Council had an important discussion aboutthe College s interface with NICE which covers England and Wales. I have reportedto you before about the very heavy workloadwe face with the NICE appraisals process.There is also the work on NICE Guidelinesand the College s bid to run a Collaborating Centre for Primary Care for NICEGuidelines. Council noted a letter sent to the Chairman of NICE some weeks ago and a faxedresponse received the previous day from theChairman. While this gave some possiblereassurance, Council very much wanted therobust line to continue. The continuingconcerns also reflected how guidelinesmight be used in audit; the impracticality ofGPs operating within such a regime; andthat NICE appeared to be relying on theRoyal Colleges to disseminate itsGuidelines. NHS Plan for England We had a further discussion of the moredetailed response the College is preparing tothe NHS Plan for England, in conjunctionwith the General Practitioners Committee ofthe BMA and some other primary careorganisations. There will be a series ofpapers, some of which have already beenfinalised. One of those is the Personal Medical Services paper and the second is the paper on Workforce and Skill-Mix . Other papers in the series are in preparationand Council had a discussion about thecontent of these in broad terms and was verysupportive. All will appear on the website aswell as coverage of the Future of SHO Posts , and Genetic Testing and Insurance . Rejoiners Campaign Council endorsed the proposed campaign toencourage lapsed members to rejoin theCollege. Former members will be mailedwith a list of the services and productsavailable to them from the College, howthey can become involved and directions onhow they may rejoin. This is an importantissue of which Faculties need to be part andwe look forward to working with everyoneto make this campaign a success. It will berolled out over England, Wales and NorthernIreland and it has already started withinScotland. Maureen Baker Honorary Secretary British Journal of General Practice, January 2001 85Dread TitresIknew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver pill circular, in which were detailed various symptoms by which a man could tellwhen his liver was out of order. I had them all . So begins Jerome K Jerome s Three Men in a Boat . I might have been the fourth man. I too, once upon a time, had all the symptoms of harbouring a liver like a wallnut. Long after a brush with viral hepatitis temporarily turned me a colourdeeply incompatible with red hair, so out of sorts was I as to spend dark hours interminablychecking my urine for deadly excess of urobilinogen. This involved the addition of someoneor other s reagent, since found to be carcinogenic in Armadillos and withdrawn, but which inanother century was an essential tool in the tireless, physicianly pursuit of the untreatable.The addition of a little acetone was supposed to extract a nice pink colour if the test waspositive. A dire circumstance this, for a chap with fulminating cirrhosis anxiety, allied tohilariously incapacitating colour blindness (can t tell cyanosis from sunburn, far less portfrom starboard). Tired all the time, I divided what little time I thought I had left between fainting in operating theatres and hovering disconsolately on the periphery of life clutching a pint glass of orangejuice. Had a solemn counsellor explained that not cirrhosis, but post viral syndrome was thethief of my vigour, and that it might last many years, and through it I might struggleheroically only with unremitting, skilled, professional support and encouragement, I shouldcertainly have been sunk. I was lucky. I was saved from my obsessive imaginings by a wise doctor. A short waspish professor of liverish things told me to go away, drink what I liked, and never, ever let anyonecheck my LFTs again. Soon I felt much better. Jerome and his friends self-prescribed a boating trip. They soon felt less liverish too.Though I am a little on the long side, I have diligently practised short waspishness in front of the mirror ever since. There are still patients who are tired all the time and who need what Ineeded: to be demedicalised, to have their imaginations re-routed, to be inspired, somehow,to believe that they can take part in life to the full. But I m no good at it. Viral titres are therolled up newspaper with which my emergent short waspishness is mercilessly and invariablyswatted to death. You are our servant, the columns of figures seem to leer at me. Ours isthe power of science, do not challenge us. Like a fool I rise to it every time: I won t be aparty to creating invalidism out of incidents of immunological history. I won t be stuck in themedical model, I ll contextualise in the great sweep of life and the universe. But the titres getme every time. Patients know about blood tests for viruses. It s hard, I reckon, todemedicalise, and yet arrive at a shared understanding with a patient whom every medium ofmass communication is hell-bent upon medicalising. But there are occasional surprises, mercifully. Jock is a sprightly old guy, with a firm stride and quick smile. Tired all the time, he said, loud and clear. Nothing much emerged from a quick sift through the usual symptomatic stuff. Then, into the silence popped a clue! It s aye worse at the weekends. Uh-huh? Ah ve a wee job wi one of the hotels so ah'm sometimes up late wi that. And there s the dancing, ballroom dancing. Used to be pretty good still no bad. And there s the widows. Five auld wifies, their husbands a deid. They keep me at it pretty late. But there s five o them, ken, and they a want tae dance wi me. D ye think ah m just getting a bit auld fur it? We agreed he should spread the widows more evenly through the week. I suggested that to be on the safe side I d like to check a couple of blood tests, if that was okay with him. Iskipped the viral titres. He d be a fine man in whose company to row up a river.alan munro Gillie Bolton has a terraced house next to the British Museum, and shoots to the top of theDeputy Editor s Christmas card list Edward Ernest (T ed) Cockayne was a GP in Woolpit for 33 years.
