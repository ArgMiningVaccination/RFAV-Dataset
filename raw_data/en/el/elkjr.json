The quadruple helix approach speaks to my ongoing experiences at the Jacobs School as its dean: educating the next generation of medical doctors and research scientists, exploring areas of clinically impactful and cutting-edge discovery science, and conducting impactful research, and cultivating relationships through community involvement. Internationally recognized for my work as a neurologist and research in movement disorders, I have received continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health since 2008, with a special focus on ATP1A3-related diseases, which includes a spectrum of rare neurologic disorders. I am currently a principal investigator on a unique genetic form of dystonia known as Rapid-onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP), studies which are ongoing with a team of researchers at UB. Earlier results on this research have been published in numerous academic journals. I was also lead investigator for the trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that first demonstrated that botulinum toxin successfully treated wrist and finger spasticity in stroke victims. Over the course of my three-decade long career, I have led more than 40 clinical trials aimed at developing potential treatments for spasticity after stroke and cervical dystonia, or abnormal, involuntary movements of the neck. I believe strongly in contributing to the community and currently boards of several prominent professional organizations, including the WNY Women's Foundation, Great Lakes Health System of Western New York, Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, and Association of American Medical Colleges' Council of Deans Administrative Board, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and the McKnight Brain Research Foundation. A lifelong champion of advancing women's leadership in medicine, I was instrumental in creating one of the first national leadership programs in neurology for women, now expanded to include leadership development for minorities. I am a frequent lecturer on the importance of diversity in medicine.
