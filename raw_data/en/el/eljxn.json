It is based on the principle of 'like cures like'. In other words, a substance taken in small amounts will cure the same symptoms it causes if taken in large amounts. The holistic nature of homeopathy means each person is treated as a unique individual and their body, mind, spirit and emotions are all considered in the management and prevention of dis-ease. Taking all these factors into account a homeopathic practitioner will select the most appropriate remedy based on the individual's specific symptoms and personal level of health to stimulate their own healing ability. Homeopathic remedies are safe to use as they rarely cause side-effects. This means when used appropriately under the guidance of a trained practitioner they can be taken by people of all ages, including babies, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Homeopathic practitioners can assist by case history taking, assessment and investigation as these are all important in establishing what the persons unique needs are. However, as well as asking about your symptoms, a homeopathic practitioner will be interested in you as an individual and the unique way in which your symptoms affect you. My training in homeopathy was through the American College of Healthcare Sciences. "}
