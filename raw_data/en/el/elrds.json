When I whined and complained that I should only have to clear my energy once a day, I was told that I had made a vow when I came to earth, to assist in healing spirits and energy. \"If they cannot get your attention, how are you supposed to know that they need help?\" I was told that spirits need our assistance at times, to clear up some of the hard feelings that they left behind. This is why we (those who are sensitive to energy) wake up around 3:00 am every morning. This news sent a shock wave of paranoia through my body... \"WHAT? What does that mean?\" I was told, while in our deepest state of slumber, spirits can speak into our subconscious minds and program us to do some little things for them. They said not to be afraid of it, it's actually as simple as... \"Today when you go to the bank, you will talk to a young man who has an orange on his desk. You will point to the orange and say to him. \"Do you know how to tell if that is ripe or not? It's orange!\" \"This will instill in the man a memory and he might say to himself. \"My old uncle Albert used to say that. Poor old Uncle Albert, I sure loved him... I wish things had been better between us when he was alive.\" This line of thinking sets up a wave of healing energy, so that atonement between the man and his uncle can take place. So now I clear my energy periodically through out the day. I used to set an alarm on my watch because I knew that the shielding wore off in seven hours. But I have grown used to the feeling and rely on my own radar to know when I need to clear again. I have been taught to notice when I feel a disturbance in my energy, to check in and see who I am being made aware of, and to pray for their soul to be filled with light and to have their guides purged with light and ask for any healing to take place that will help this person or soul on it's divine path. Many times the disturbance is coming from a person walking down the road near me. Sometimes I cannot see the person yet, I just feel them. But then, I will notice the sensation is coming from a certain direction, I will watch in that direction and then a rather scary person will walk around a corner. Usually they are visibly, mentally ill. Like turrets, or just yelling into a blue tooth. This is my daily healing/clearing protocol that I use, every time before I channel or read energy. Sometimes I feel like I need to repeat the paragraph I am clearing and can read each one, up to 5 times. Prayer for Clearing with light, to enter my space. Thank you for returning all others to their points of origin and placing them into courts of atonement or any measures you deem appropriate to heal their energy. Thank you for removing all curses, hexes, implants and spells from our souls, hearts, bodies, energy and environments, from our present, past and or future lives.
