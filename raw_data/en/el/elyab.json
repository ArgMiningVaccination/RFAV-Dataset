Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Good health is central to human happiness and well -being, and also makes an important contribution to economi c progress of an individual, or a country as a whole. Sri Lanka can be proud of the success it has achieved so far in its Health Sector, through careful planning and efficient execution of programmes. However, when I took office early last year I was disma yed to note that the then ongoing Health Sector Master Plan was to lapse in December 2015, with no new Plan in the pipe line, which made me to go ahead in developing an updated Health Policy and a Health Strategic Master Plan as a top priority. This was of prime importance to implement the developmental programmes of the government of Good Governance, which laid much emphasis on health sector development and welfare of the people. A new Plan was necessary also due to the changing landscape of health care f inancing and delivery in the country due to life style changes and emerging environmental issues and accompanying health sector needs. I have no doubt that with proper planning and investment in both infrastructure and health personnel Sri Lanka has the p otential to develop a health system comparable to the standards comparable to those in developed countries . I am pleased to note that in spite of their heavy official commitments, the Director General of Health Services and the team of Ministry officials assigned for the task has come up with the Health Master Plan for the period 2016 - 2025 with in a relatively short period. I also wish to convey my sincere thanks to all the health professionals who contributed for this compilation . Furthermore, the valuable comments/ observations / recommendations made by the professional Colleges and Associations, Provincial Ministries of Health and Health sector Trade Unions are much appreciated. I sincerely look forward to the full commitment and dedication of a ll the officials of the Ministry of Health as well as health officials in the Provincial Health Services to achieve the expected Health Outcomes in the Master Plan 2016 -2025, with the view to improving Health care delivery to our people. Dr Rajitha Senar atne Minister of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine ii Message from the Secretary of the Ministry of Health , Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine Ministry of Health , Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine is responsible , to s afeguard the status of Health of all citizens of Sri Lanka . Therefore a considerable amount from the national budget is allocated by the Government of Sri Lanka , to the Ministry of Health , Nutrition & Indigenous Med icine , to achieve the said objective . Thus it is our duty to utilize those public funds effectively , efficiently and economically to provide better standards of health care throughout the country As such , it i s essential to have a comprehensive Health plan with monitoring tools to make the best use of this massive budget ; and , I am much pleased to note that , the professional of the sector have made a collective and collaborative effort to produce a comprehensive Health Master Plan for ten years ( 2016 - 2025 ) I hope the deficiencies of the previous health master plan will be corrected by the newly prepared Health Master P lan ( 2016 - 2025 ) As the proposals have been prepared by the relevant Programme Directors and the Consultants attached to those subjects , the ownership of the plan is correctly vested on the programmes itself . I fe el that this is a crucial decision taken by the Ministry to establish sustainability and continuation of the Health Master Plan throughout the next ten year period . As the indicators and the verifiable means have been identified for all proposals in the Health Master Plan 2016 - 2025 , it is essential to monitor the outcomes . A continued mechanism of Monitoring & Evaluation has to be linked to this Health Master Plan 2016 - 2025 , to achieve the expected health outcomes and justify the utilization of massive amount of public funds . Duplication to be avoided and allocative efficiency should be practiced at each step of translating strategie s to activities Finally I have to endorse that , it is the first and foremost duty of all officials in the Health sector to be adherent to this plan throughout the specified ten year period ( 2016 - 2025 ) and achieve the time targets specified in it , to offer best health services to the Sri Lankan nation Anura Jayawickrama Secretary Ministry of Health , Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine iii Message from the Director Gener al of Health Services Firstly I would like to place on record , my sincere thanks to my team of professionals , the members of National Steering Committee on Health Master Plan ( all Deputy Director Generals ), the Programme Directors and Consultants attached to relevant subjects , for their tireless work , ( despite having to cope with tremendous work load in daily duties ) which made the dream of a comprehensive ten year ( 2016 - 2025 ) Health Master Plan , a success and a reality . As the Department of National Planning recommended , the team of professionals involved in the preparation of Health Master Plan , essentiall y comprised of local experts only , and the National Steering Committee on Health Master Plan , at the first meeting , decided to utilize only the Programme Directors and the Consultants attached at present to the He alth Services as the experts responsible for the preparation of relevant proposals . This decision has given a great stimulus to the key officers in all Programms and I find that they have produced excellent proposals fo r the next ten year Health Master Plan ( 2016 - 2025 ). I also acknowledge very specially the collaborative efforts and expert contribution made by all Professional Colleges and Associations , at my request , to make this plan to cover all specialties of Medical Sciences . Although the Preventive sector is well represented in the organogram of the Ministry of Health , the Curative and Rehabilitative sectors need developments . The proposals of Clinical Professions were able to cover the said gap in Health Master Plan , accordingly I have decided to have separate plans for each major task , ( as separate plan documents for Preventive Health Serv ices , Curative care and Rehabilitation ) This Health Master Plan ( 2016 - 2025 ) has been submitted for Public Opinion , Provincial Ministries of Health Services and Trade Unions as well . I am much thankful to a ll of them for sending valuable suggestions to improve services on various aspects . At last , but not the least , the excellent coordinating of the activity and drafting of this ten year ( 2016 - 2025 ) Health Strategic Master Plan was undertaken by the focal point appointed by me for this activity . Dr D.A.B.Dangalla ( Director - Policy Analysis & Development and , Acting Senior Assistant Secretary ( Medical Services ) functio ned as the focal point , with his staff , devoted many months to accomplish the given task . I highly appreciate the degree of dedication of Dr Dangalla and his staff , towards the completion of this activity . It is my advice to all of my officials ( as we own the plan as we wrote the proposals ) to adhere to the plan throughout the said ten year period and implement all strategies designed by you all , with a rigid me chanism of monitoring and evaluation of time bound targets . to make our health services comparable to Developed Countries . Dr P. G. Mahipala Director General of Health Services iv Background As the present Health Polic y was prepared in 1996 and , now ; after 20 years it has to be replaced with an updated policy . There are many reasons justifying the preparation of a new health policy ; such as the following - Health issues w hich were not addressed with the present health policy , have to be tackled with new and different strategies . Newly emerged health issues have to be addressed with a new health policy . After the internal civil war , Sri Lanka can look forward to stability and increased investment in health . The country has the potential to develop a health system on par with the best in the world . But a change is needed ; to reduce inequity , to improve quality , to develop a health system which can respond to the needs and expectations of the new generation The present health master plan was prepared in 2004 with JICA assistance and it is schedule d to be terminated at the end of 2015 Thus a new health master plan has to be prepared for the next decade starting from 2016 , and the need for a new health master plan is timely as explained below . Some of the key subjects , which have become priority health issues in the present context , had not been included in previous JICA Health Master Plan ( 2005 - 2015 ) Eg . Renal Health , Nutrition , e tc . Although the Preventive sector had been covered extensively by JICA HMP , the Curative service component had not been sufficiently addressed to the expectations of clinicians . With the demands of patients for bette r services , ( Stroke centres , Cath Labs , Cataract Surgery , Waiting for Bypass Surgery ) an extensive analysis of issues , is essential to design strategies . Certain indicators of Health have become stagnant and new approaches are required for further improvements in those sectors Accordingly , a new health policy , a new strategic framework to develop health services ; and incorporating the new policy and strategic framework , a new Health Master Plan ; are needed for the country . Simultaneously it is essential to design the goals and the expected Health Outcomes of this Health Master Plan . Thus it was decided by the Min istry of Health , that the expected outcome would be a people centred health system which is sensitive to the needs and expectations of the patients / people . The best tool to ascertain the patient factors , is the concept of universal coverage ; a conceptual model which can be summarized as ( a ) Equity of distribution of services to all patients living in all areas of the country ( b ) v Accessibility to health facilities by e ach and every patient ( c ) quality of service provided to each patient , and ( d ) Financial Protection of all patients The processing of Health Master Plan was initiated with the establishment of National Steering Committee on Health Policy & Master Plan . The National Steering Committee on Health Policy & Master Plan comprised of DGHS ( As Chairman ) and the Deputy Director Generals of the Ministry of Health . Dr D.A.B.Dangall a ( Director - Policy Analysis & Development and acting Senior Assistant Secretary - Medical Services ) was appointed as the secretary to NSC and to function as the focal point for the preparation of Health Master Plan 2016 - 2025 . At the first meeting of National Steering Committee ( NSC - December 2014 ) it was decided to appoint all programme Directors and the Consultants to prepare the proposal for the relevant programme and respective deputy director generals to function as co -chair to the working groups . Terms of Reference ( TOR ) for the preparation of programme profiles , were approved by the NSC . Formats for preparation of str ategic framework and programme profiles were also identified at said meeting of NSC The format for the strategic framework was designed from the Reference document titled - Shri Lanka National Health Policy - 1992 ( Prof Erl Fonseka , et.al ) The said document has analyzed all sub sectors of health in a uniform matrix which contained a brief situational analysis of the sub sectors , followed by several policy measures . Therefore in the preparation of this Health Master plan , the situational analysis section was attached each of the programme profiles . But in the preparation of strategic framework ( 2016 - 2025 ) the health problems were liste d with strategies designed to over come the issues ( Instead of listing policy measures as in 1992 , the present Strategic framework ( 2016 - 2025 ) has extended beyond , to the level of designing strategies ) A new feature has also been added to link the strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals ( where we should be in 2030 ) The format for the preparation of programme profiles ( attached ) has been adopted f rom the JICA Health Master Plan ( 2005 - 2015 ) As it was a complex document , not referred as expected by many officials during later years . To avoid similar situation occurring once again , the format was delibera tely simplified to contain the essentials but made more practical and user friendly manner ; and new sections are also added to justify the proposal eg . Situation and Problem Analysis in detail with the proposal for each programme . vi A new tool has also been introduced ( attached ) for the Gap Analysis according to the concept of Universal Health Coverage - UHC . ( to direct all proposals towards UHC ) This new tool was approved by the NSC at the second meeting held in February 2015 . At the third meeting of NSC ( May 2015 ) it was decided to obtain external technical assistance , as there are no local experts for the fo llowing subjects ( Disease Burden Studies , Elderly Care , Home based Care , Health Technology Assessment , Human Resources for Health - HRH , Health Economics and Regulating Private Health Sector ) The suitable foreign experts shall have both academic qualifications ( Post Graduate qualifications ) and experience in employment of the relevant subject in other countries . This proposal has been approved by the Department of National Planning and forwarded to the Department of External Resources to seek foreign Technical expertise of aforementioned subjects . At the fourth meeting of NSC ( October 2015 ) the following areas were noted . Although the Preventive Health Services had been covered extensively by many proposals , the Curative Care sector proposals were inadequate . The said deficiency of not representing the curative care sector adequately at the Ministry level , has been a longstanding issue .( please refer to section on Reforms / Curative Division in pages 77 - 97 , in Vol IV of Health Master Plan / Health Administration & HRH ) Therefore , as the Chairperson of the NSC , the Director General of Health Services invited all the Professional Colleges and Associations , to submit their proposals on Curative & Rehabilitative Services , according to the format designed to prepare programm e profiles and to use the UHC gap analysis tool to identify the problems . The responses from the Professional Associations & Colleges were encouraging ; Received the proposals form the following ; College of Anest hesiologists of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists Palliative Care Association of Sri Lanka Neurosurgeons Association of Sri Lanka College of Ophthalmologists of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka Association of Oral & Maxillo -facial Surgeons vii Sri Lanka Heart Association College of Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka Association of Urological Surgeons College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka College of Haematologists College of Otorhinolaryngologists and Head & Neck Surgeons of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka College of Venereologists Association of Plastic Surgeons of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka College of Endocrinologists As such the Director General of Health Services instructed the focal point to draft separate volumes of Health Master Plan for each major task area , ( I ) Preventive Health Services ( ( III ) Rehabilitative Care ( IV ) Health Administration & HRH .Many stakeholder meetings were held to prepare proposals , the manuscripts of proposals of each programme were prepared by the respective Programme Director and the Consultants attached to the relevant programme , under the guidance of the respective Deputy Director Generals . For the Preventive Sector , an ad ditional group of Consultant Community Physicians were invited ( including Professors in Community Medicine and Provincial Consultant Community Physicians ) The final draft of all five documents of Health strategic Master Plan ( 1 / Strategic Framework for Health Development , 2 / Vol I - HSMP Preventive Health Services , 3 / Vol II - HSMP Curative Care , 4 / Vol - III Rehabilitation Care , 5 / Vol - IV Health Administration & HRH ) was prepared by the Director - Policy Analysis & Development ( the focal point for preparation of Health Master Plan ) with the assistance of the staff of PA & D unit As an additional procedure to cover the minor specialties , the staff of Policy Analysis & development unit , consulted the senior medical specialists of certain specialties to obtain proposals of those minor specialties . eg Medical Genetics , Stokes & Trauma care , Care of Abused Children , Plastic Surgery , Autism , etc viii Several Field Studies have been conducted by the staff of the Policy Analysis & Development unit with regard to situational analysis of certain subject are as ( a ) Health Services of Plantation Estates , ( b ) CKDu affected communities in Primary Level Curative Services - Divisional Hospitals and Primary Medical Care units - the need for re - structuring ( d ) under utilization of Healthy Life style clinics - application of management concepts to improve screening ( e ) study to identify the issues related to management and availability of medicinal drugs at district level . Further the data available at the Medical Statistics unit and also the da ta bases of the individual programmes had been analyzed prior to the formulation of proposals . However most of the analyzed data are presented in the Annual Health Bulletin ( AHB ) and also in the annual progress rep orts of each programme , As such data analysis is not presented in this document ( to avoid duplication ) In the previous Health Master Plan , maps & charts had been presented as a separate document ; but it is not required to attach a similar document to this new Health Master Plan because those items are already available with AHB and annual progress reports of individual programmes . The previous Health Master Plan had a separate volume to describe the situational Analysis , but its linkage to programme profiles published in another document was not evident . To avoid this type of deficiencies , the new Health Master plan has incorporate d the situational analysis in to the main text of programme profile ( with indication of references to relevant research publications) The final draft was submitted to the Depa rtment of National Planning , Mini stry of National Policies & Economic Affairs , to Provincial Ministries of Health in all nine Provincial Councils ( Northern , North Western , North Central , Eastern Central , Uva . Western , Southern & Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils ) and also to the Trade Unions of the Health Services . Further the Health Strategic Master Plan ( 2016 - 2025 ) has been published in the website of the Ministry of Health and advertized in print media of all three languages inviting Public Opinion ; and the relevant comments , suggestions , and recommendations received through the said process have been incorporated to the plan . The excellent leadership and the technical guidance given by Dr P.G.Mahipala - the Director General of Health Services , was the key factor in completion of this massive task . For the previous Health Master Plan , it is ix said that JICA had to spent Rs 225 Million , and a foreign company by the name of Pacific International was assigned the preparation of previous Health Master Plan with the contribution of a group of local experts . But the new plan , the National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 was prepared with a cost less than Rupees one million ( Funded by the Government of Sri Lanka ) The main reason for the production of the new plan at a muc h lower cost is the dedication of Sri Lankan Experts . The number of Consultants involved in the preparation of this plan was well above hundred and they offered their services voluntarily and without any additional c ost to the government . The Policy Analysis & Development unit would like to place its great appreciation to all of those consultants who offered assistance to prepare the HSMP 2016 - 2025 . It has been said that - Doctors are the voice of the poor , the sick and the dead . This statement has been once again proven by the said team of consultants ; by preparing a master plan for the next ten years to grant better health outc omes to the Sri Lanka nation . = focal point Health strategic master plan 2016 - 2025 ; health administration & HRH.

And it is on the basis of this concept of the person, and the fundamental dignity and equal ity of all human beings, that the notion of patient rights was developed. In other words, what is owed to the patient as a human being, by physicians and by the state, took shape in large part thanks to this understanding of the basic rights of the person and system to implement to impose the behalf of the grieved party Target area &Beneficiaries All citizens of Sri Lanka Justification Human Rights has been instrumental in enshrining the notion of human dignity in international law, providing a le gal and moral grounding for improved standards of care on the basis of our basic responsibilities towards each other as members of the \"human family\", and giving important guidance on critical social, legal and ethical issues. But there remains a great dea l of work to be done to clarify the relationship between human rights and right to health, including patient rights. Recognizing this method like Ombudsman draws setbacks ability of a grieved party toinitiate a complaints and obtaining justice. Systematic and reconciliation upgraded version of patient right friendly method. de Important assumptions/risks/Conditions Governments have a fundamental responsibility to ensure universal access to quality health care, education and other social services accordin g to people's needs, not acco rding to their ability to pay. The participation of people and people's organizations, trade unions and civil rights societies is essential to the formulation, implementation and evaluation of all health and social policies an d programmes, Liaise and obtain upmost support in formulation of new policies. Vision Equity, ecologicallysustainable development and peace are at the heart of our vision of a better world a world in which a healthy life for all is a reality; a world that respects, appreciates and celebrates all life and diversity;. Mission Health is a social, economic and political issue and above all a fundamental human right. Inequality, poverty, exploitation, violence and injustice are at the root of illhealth and the deaths of poor and marginalized people. Measurement is central to the concept of quality improvement; it provides a means to define what hospitals actually do, and to compare that with the original targets in order to identify opportunities for imp rovement.

Sustainable Development Goals Even though our country is considered a middle income country, we match the developed world by achievements in various health indi cators such as Maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate. Additionally, it is well known that we have either achieved or were on track of achieving many health related Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Although Sri Lanka had achieved a lot in the he alth sector as a country, regional and urban -rural disparities are well evident. Since we are at a stage of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SGD), much ahead of the MDGs, focus must be on all regions and in the quality of health service deliver y as well as the quantity. Epidemiological transition With rapid urbanization, unplanned development, globalization and open economy, a drastic change in the peoples' lifestyles and dietary behavior is visible. With these changes had risen the challenges r elated to demographic transition, economic transition and epidemiological transition. The epidemic of Non Communicable Diseases had affected all countries of the globe mainly affecting the economic growth of the developing countries including Sri Lanka. An d many such countries face double burden in nutrition, further worsening the problem. Therefore, focus should be set in at all the stages of disease prevention; primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary preventive strategies. Universal Health coverage In order to achieve complete physical and mental well - being of the people in the country as 'health' defines, universal health coverage is of utmost importance, where health care services will be provided equally and equitably in high quality with financial protection for them all. Low health expenditure National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 4 Sri Lanka had set an example for many developing countries to improve health service delivery with a low expenditure on health. Although the health service provision is free of cost to the people, out -of-pocket expenditure that has to be borne by the people is found to be high. Since the health care expenditure per person would grow continuously due to ever increasing health care demands, the system of free/ low cost government health care services would be further challenged and stressed due to low budgetary allocation for health. Medical Tourism Despite Sri Lanka being a middle income country, foreigners view and visit Sri Lanka as a focal point for Medical tourism due to expertise in medical management an d comparatively low cost. This is an opportunity for the country to cover state medical expenditure in order to provide quality universal health coverage for its people. With this background rises the importance of priority setting and planning for health in order to provide sustainable, undisturbed, quality universal health care coverage to all citizens in Sri Lanka and to promote medical tourism. Situation Analysis: 1. Strengths Support from the Minister of health and other hierarchical officials in the Min istry of Health for activities and improvement of the planning unit 2. Opportunities Support from the Minister of health and other hierarchical officials in the Ministry of Health for activities and improvement of the planning unit Appointment of expertise o n planning to the unit Appointment of required additional staff to the unit Training facilities of the staff on planning and monitoring 3. Weaknesses Lack of human resources in all staff categories eg: consultants, Medical officers, planning officers etc. National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 5 Lack of physical resources Lack of infrastructure for the unit Lack of management in subject areas Lack of monitoring of the activities in each subject area Several activities divided among various units, therefore, overlapping, gaps in activities and lack of accountability Lack of proper job lists 4.

Physical resource development National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 6 Central planning uni t Justification Epidemiological transition, increasing health demands with Low budgetary allocation for health and high out of pocket expenditure further challenges the free health care delivery system in Sri Lanka. Therefore, priority setting and plannin g for health is of utmost importance in order to provide universal, continuous, quality health care service for the citizens in Sri Lanka. Thus, the central planning unit should be strengthened to accommodate, implement and monitor all national programme p lans, institutional plans and regional plans. Since all the planned activities for the betterment of people will be implemented and monitored at the regional level, it is important that the regional and provincial planning units be strengthened as well. Vision (MDPU) People of Sri Lanka enjoy optimum health status through well managed health care services Mission (MDPU) To foster evidence based planning and management of health care delivery system at different levels, in order to achieve and sustain opti mum health status of the people as envisaged in the national health policy Goal To provide quality universal health care services to the citizens of Sri Lanka by effective planning and monitoring.

As we go through an epidemiological, social, demographic ant changes. The health burden experienced today is largely that of non -communicable diseases, including chronic diseases such as hypertension, Diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, a sthma, stroke, chronic kidney disease, canner, mental health. This is further fuelled by the lack of general and specialized care for elderly. We also face the challenge of acute care needs for injury. The healthcare needs of 20% youth population are almos t neglected and a long term health promotion strategy is needed when addressing all these conditions and special needs of target groups. The health service structure has adopted a gradual incremental approach in service development. Whilst the emphasis g iven to expansion of specialized services in the past is commendable (the policy of development of one hospital in every district to the level of a general hospital), this has led to a shift from development of primary care services. Also the development and facelift given to larger specialized hospitals (TH, General, Base hospitals) have lead to attraction of patients to these hospitals, even when their needs are only for basic primary care. Due to the large workload in these hospitals, patients cannot b e given comprehensive, personalized family centered care through specialized hospitals. Also the system is not being efficient if we use our specialized hospitals to be deliver basic primary care (other than to those in the immediate catchment areas) Sri Lanka can boast of a wide network of health institutions. The primary level of health has 970 hospitals (Divisional hospitals and primary medical care units) and 350 Medical Officers of health units (community health services), that are managed by non -spec ialist doctors. This network has not been changed in any significant way to address the current needs. Only random isolated interventions have been carried out without a significant impact. The government expenditure on health care is currently at a low level of only 1.7% of GDP. The Government has pledged to increase allocation for healthcare. This increased allocation must support reforms to health care delivery system in a way that it effectively and efficiently provides universal access to health care that addresses current needs. Expansion of primary health care is a recommended strategy endorsed by the WHO for Universal health coverage. National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 12 Although a large number of institutions exist in the government sector a clear demarcation of the roles of spec ialized hospitals and non - specialist primary care institutions does not exist, especially for outpatient services. A large number of patients access primary care at specialized institutions, but are not necessarily cared for by a specialist. Unlike the c ommunity or preventive health services there are no access demarcations for registering with institutions. Eg. For antenatal care services at community level a mother will register with the local PHM and the local MOH office depending on their location wit hin the MOH area. For curative services persons are given the liberty of accessing care from any institution and there is no registering requirement in the system. Whilst this may be considered convenient to patients, there are several drawbacks in such a system. As there is no gate keeping function and due to standard essential services not being available at primary care curative institutions there is considerable bypassing to reach specialist institutions. There is also no accountability for patient clinical outcomes within a defined population or area as there is free mobility or no registration of patients at an institution. Institutions also have not been made responsible to cater to a defined catchment population or area. In such a situation the specialist and non -specialist primary care institutions both largely function independently of each catering to undefined populations with overlapping primary care functions. Several interventions are proposed and some being implemented to strengthen pr imary care (these are revising the essential drug list for primary care level, NCD management guideline for primary care, health lifestyle clinics, provision of basic lab tests for NCD care are some of these). However there is lack of continuity in overall patient management and the following needed consideration a. continuous supply of essential medicines and a mechanism for basic essential laboratory tests b. a personal record and proper record system to ensure continuity of patient management c. proper lifest yle guidance appropriate to all patients and those at risk on an appointment basis - current scope of healthy lifestyle canters to be revisited to include planned lifestyle guidance sessions d. correct attitudes and practices of primary care practitioners to provide individual personalized and family care, requiring transformations in graduate training and basic training programs of health professionals e. Availability of basic emergency care f. Adherence to the NCD guideline and the adoption of referral and back referral with shared care between specialist and National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 13 primary care practitioner. Whilst items a to e will give the community surrounding the primary care institution the confidence to access care at their closest institution, there is considerable system reo rganizing to achieve item f. The proposed model of reform is a cluster model referred to as the \" shared care cluster\" General definition of \"shared care cluster\" A cluster is considered as a unit where a specialist care institute functioning as the a pex hospital providing general specialties of care will be considered as a shared cluster together with its surrounding primary care curative institutions (divisional and primary medical care units). (shared care : a. an individual's health care will be shares and form continuum between primary care and specialized services b. Resources with the cluster to be shares so that there is optimum availability and utilization) Justification for the proposal Recent and ongoing improvements to healthcare have moved away from improving utilization of primary health care. We have been gradually moving patients to seek care at the specialist level hospitals bypassing the smaller primary level hospitals. Developed countries that e xhibit efficient and effective health systems have invested adequately in their primary health services. 2015 was the deadline for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. In the post Millennium development agenda WHO has called for all countries to move towards universal Health coverage (UHC). WHO recommends that health systems must expand and strengthen primary health care to provide most needed health care whilst including all vulnerable communities if Universal health coverage (UHC) is to be achieved An analysis of the existing health service structure and policies was carried out by the policy Analysis & Development unit in 2009. This lead to the understanding that major changes to the existing health delivery organization was needed to addre ss the challenge for chroviding the system was not geared to providing continuity of care or to providing the necessary changes to prevent or manage lifestyle related diseases. The policy analysis unit suggested system changes and a decision was taken to conduct pilot studies. National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 14 The proposed developments were shares at the National policy forum for strengthening primary level health care in 2010. The pilot studies were conducted in collaboration with the primary care unit of the Ministry of health to de velop protocols, tools and monitoring plans that were needed to improve the system. These developments lead to development of a personal Health Record and clinic record for adults, emergency care guidelines for primary care, easy reference education mate rial for health staff, finalization of an essential medicines list for NCDs at primary level, lifestyle guidance tools, checklists for institutional assessment for infrastructure and logistics and a social marketing tool. The organization development uni t in 2013 having noted that primary care needs to be supported with optimim specialized care with a proper referral and back referral proposes that the health institutions be clustered. The basis for clustering is that a specialist hospital serves appropri ate specialized services to a group of surrounding primary level hospitals. This was given the name of \"shared care cluster system\". GAP ANALYSIS by using UHC tool Target areas & Beneficiaries General population Justification Important ass umptions / Risks/ Conditions Assumptions - primary care strengthening requires financial allocation that can be accommodated within the increase in budgetary provision to health sector. People's choice to access health care will not be directly regulated but through improving the supply more people would demand for primary level services. The increase demand can be met Private health sector regulations for price and quality control will simultaneously take place to shift people who can afford private car e to access those facilities Vision A primary care Doctor to all providing personalized continuity of care Mission To reform primary level health care which can afford the greatest coverage in terms of accessibility to the people, in a way that provides personalized, family centered, continuity of care of good quality, where good health outcomes can be achieved with reduced out of pocket expenditure to the people.

The strategic guidance for overall Human Resource development lies with the Line Ministry. The overall staff is approximately 1,25,000 The central ministry plays the lead role in determining numbers, recruitment, training, deployment and ensuring optimum level of personnel management to ensure tha t the right numbers of human resources are available in the right place at the right time, who have the right attitudes and skills and perform to achieve organization objectives and goals. The Ministry of Health developed the strategic plan for HRH 2009 - 2018. After a detailed situation analysis The strategic plan clearly identifies three key areas of policy, management and training for HRD. the need to establish a central HRD unit within the Health Ministry organization that will improve Human resourc e planning and management systems was identified as a requisite in the implementation of the strategic plan. Gaps in the capacity to establish a central coordinating mechanism to address key HRH policy issues are noted. Existing post graduate training in related disciplines also need to focus on these areas. Related specialties may need to be developed further to take on these important functions.

The Ministry of Health carried out a situation analysis prior to the development of the Human Resources Strategic plan for the period 2009 - 2018 . An assessment of th e organization for HRD was carried out using a tool used by the Management of Health Sciences in Boston. The tool has been widely used by other countries and rates the organization ability to perform HRD functions. The instrument is used for identifying th e gaps in human resources management. Conclusions from this assessment are as follows a. HRD occurs in a fragmented manner within the health system. The functions of HRD are currently scattered in this large organization and often are not well coordinated b. There seems to be poor conception of the strategic issues related to HRD and a more operational approach has been considered in distributing the functions. c. Different components of HRD are at varying levels of development. d. Given the magnitude of the org anization and large number of staff categories the distribution of HRD functions on the basis of staff categories seem to be relevant. e. Given that HRD functions are scattered within the organization, there does not seem to be any single unit within the Min istry of Health that is responsible in keeping track of HRD overall. The strategic plan clearly identifies the need to establish a central HRD unit within the Health Ministry organization that will improve Human resource planning and management systems.

National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 21 Program title National Health Performance monitoring Focal point DDG (Planning) Back ground/ situation Analysis (Problem Analysis) The Sri Lankan health system has often been cited as a model for efficiency in the delivery of good health ou tcomes despite the relatively low investment on health care. Currently the government contribution to health care is approximately 1.4% of GDP. The total allocation for Health accounted for 4% of the government budget. (2014 central bank report) Sri Lank a has achieved commendable progress in providing universal health care and the main health indicators are far ahead of the averages for countries at comparable levels of income. As the policy of the government is to provide health care free of charge at al l points of delivery, the Ministry of Health must utilize the limited available resources optimally. Given limited resources it is important that the government can take timely decisions to further improve health status of Sri Lankans. Performance indicato rs that are currently used to describe health systems do not adequately capture the requirements of a changing health burden due to different transitions experienced in the country. Performance measurement offers policy - makers an opportunity to secure health system improvement and accountability and aims to improve the quality of decisions made at all levels in the health system. Performance measurement system should be monitored frequently to ensure alignment with other health system mechanisms and to identify areas for improvement. Seeks to monitor, evaluate and communicate the extent to which various aspects of the health system meet their key objectives. The diverse uses of health system performance measures necessitate a wide variety of measuremen t methods; indicators, analytical techniques and approaches to procurement methods, indicators, analytical techniques and approaches to presentation. It is also to ensure that all major areas of health system performance are covered by the measurement system, that priorities for new developments can be identified and that collection and analysis efforts are not misdirected or duplicated. Some critical situations in performance evaluation are that Policy impact / outcomes of National programs/ Healthcare delivery practices are not routinely reviewed Mostly we do this through external reviews conducted purposefully, but not on a regular basis or for international reporting Limitations in performance indicators as these mainly reflect public health program s and the need to capture other health services and health determinants The Ministry of Health needs to be accountable for government allocation in terms of health performance Change/ continuation of strategic direction needs to be discussed objectively using indicators with time series and sub national analysis where relevant All national program indicators are not required as policy impact monitoring indicators. (some program indicators have been traditionally used to monitor public health programs) The direction of National policy must be captured in trend analysis of the indicators National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 22 selected. Explanation should be available for success/ failure through the wider range of program indicators that are available. However any critical indicator that meas ures a particular strategy can be included if the National program has valid reason for it to be monitored. Performance measurements should have relevance o Sustainable development goals and their indicators. The National health performance framework: T he framework has been developed after a long process of consultation with all relevant professionals and requires a suitable mechanism for implementation.

There are over 1080 hospitals geared for this activity. The data generated in this process is a vital part of the health information in the country. This information is utilized in planning the managemen t of health care services, monitor ing of disease Burden, for disease prevention activities and evalu ation of treatment outcomes. Medical Sta tistics u nit (MSU) is the central unit for processing of collected data from Health institutions in Sri Lanka. In a ddition to that Indoor Morbidity and Mortality Data using the manual system and the E - version of the IMMR (eIMMR)which have been covered more than 50% of the hospital system. The accuracy and the timeliness have been gained a considerable improvement by th e eIMMR system in comparing to the manual IMMR. The Annual Health Bulletin (AHB) is the main publication for data dissemination. AHB is also get ting late to publish due to the time wastage for the data cleaning process. So the accurac y of the data should be enhanced to improve the timeliness of the publication. Though s everal actions have been already taken to improve the quality and timeliness of data, further implementation of the overall process is needed in order to provide high quality data. There are many reasons which are affected to quality of the data negatively, such as poor descriptive data collection on OPD and Clinics , incomplete diagnosis writings, and unavailability of well -trained medical recording staff for medical record rooms due to National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 28 the t ransferable situation of the said staff categories, etc. Staff who is submitting data from the Hospital level to the MSU should be well trained in order to improve the quality of the data. Currently data preparation and submitting is done by different hos pital staff categories such as Medical Officers, Registered Medical officer s, Nurses , Midwives, Programming and Planning Officers, Development Officers, Development Assistants, Programming and Planning Assistants due to lack of Medical Recording Officers ( MRO) or Medical Recording Assistants (MRA).Data collecting and submitting is done by clerical or minor staff in some hospital s in rural areas. Those officers may have been transferred to the stations unrelated to statistics and untrained staff from any othe r field could be appointed to the record rooms for statistical duties. Therefore trainings are need ed to be done continuously to keep the quality of the data. Because of the above reasons the required benefits cannot be achieved.

The Directorate of Training coordinates with Ceylon Medical College Council, University Grants Commission and other releva nt academic and professional institutions and organizations in Sri Lanka in strengthening human resource capacity of the health sector. 1. Pre-service training The Directorate is responsible for providing technical guidance and the coordination of pre -servi ce training programmes for the health workforce except Medical Officers, Dental and Nursing Officers. The pre -service training for the above workforce is unique in its governance mechanism as they are trained entirely by the training schools under the purview of the central unit, the Directorate of Training. There are 17 training schools and seven regional training centers. The schools are mainly located at National Hospital of Sri Lanka, National Institute of Health Sciences, Medical Research Institute an d few other teaching hospitals. These schools of training are technically supervised by the Directorate yet function under the administrative supervision of the respective health institutions. The i ntake for pre-service training is determined by the Admini strative Sections of the Ministry of Health in consultation with ET&R Unit and the MDPU. The 'National Standards' for upgrading the training schools and the regional training centres have been identified which consists of components such as strengthening governance, trainer capacity development, revision of pre - service training curricula, strategies for trainee retention, infrastructure development, monitoring and evaluation. An o orientation programme of six months is also conducted for the four categor ies of graduates (PSM) passing out from the Universities in Sri Lanka before employing in the Ministry of Health. 2. In-service training The Directorate provides the necessary technical and financial assistance for the in -service training programmers for the health workforce which are conducted based on the needs analysis submitted by the healthcare institutions. An ISTP (In -Service Training Programme) management system is in place for reviewing of the training proposal, approval for funding, and monitoring a nd evaluation of training programmes. A National Framework for continuous professional development (CPD) is being advocated among relevant stakeholders and policy makers. National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 32 The Directorate also coordinates overseas training collaborations for different cate gories of health workforce to bring novel methods of teaching , learning and service delivery in to local practice.

The recruitments are carried out by the Ministry of Health based on the carder, vacancies, attrition and retirement for which the directorate is responsible for providing training. Annually over 3000 health personal are trained prior to recruitment; however is falls short of meeting the annual national requirement. Furthermore, the increasing Non -communicab le diseases (NCDs), demographic transition with aging population and adverse environmental changes were witnessed over the recent past, creating significant negative health impact in our country. The Sri Lanka country profile published by the Global Burden of Diseases1 strongly suggests that the NCD burden have emerged as leading causes of years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality. In addition, the public is demanding for more non -healthcare needs when seeking care such as autonomy, dignity, confi dentiality, prompt attention, choice of healthcare provider, basic amenities and provision of social health needs2. Transformation and scaling up of education and training is a multi -dimensional process that involves not only increasing the number of hea lth professionals, but also ensuring that they have the knowledge, skills and competencies relevant to the needs of the population3,4. The training programmes need to cater to the above circumstances and needs while incorporating the new technologies such as ICT, computer based simulations, m -Health and web -based learning. Therefore, evidence based strategies are needed to transform and scale up health professionals' education to attain the right 'mix of skills and competencies' of health workers who can r espond to the changing needs of the population.

A cquiring, analyzing and protecting digital and traditional medical information are major components of health information management. Many forms used to collect data are outdated and does not cover the present scope of work. Also the traditional flow of information has caused delays in using information for decision making. Therefore it is important to study and simplify processes. Implementation of electronic health information systems can improve health care efficiency and safety (1) while increasing health and other social benefits in addition to long term cost benefits. Unique Health Identifier (2) is a prerequisite for any electronic health record. With the use of electronic health records incorporated with clinical decision support has the ability to improve patient safety thro ugh assisting drug dose calculation, allergy highlights, drug interaction highlights, etc. (3) An electronic health record that contains past diagnosis, laboratory investigations, radiolog y images, etc. has the potential to reduce the repeat of investigations due to lost investigations. It also allow public health surveillance activities (4) and admini strative decision making through results of data mining in the large electronic databases created in health records. Networking of government healthcare institutions is important to harness the full potential of electronic health records. New health tec hnologies needs proper assessment before introduction in to the health system. A technology assessment (5) and innovation laboratory will help filter -in most suitable technologies that would maximize the benefits.

Finally such patients are rushed to Emergency rooms , Preliminary care units and Intensive care units with states of Coma , Stroke or Arre st ; ( with minimum chances of saving the life ) This scenario is much common among economically active group ( age 35 - 65 yrs. ) In addition the Aging of population has contributed immensely to increase the NCD Burden of the country. Considering these two problems ( increased No of deaths due to major NCD in economically active age group & the Burden of NCD associated with aging of population ) the Ministry of Health has developed a model named as Healthy Lifestyle centers ( HLC ) in all Hospitals to screen the population at risk. Present Situation The government allocated over Rs Mn 600 to create HLC island - wide ; and it is linked to a disbursement linked indicator ( DLI ) of having at least two HLC per MOH division .Definition of a fully functioning HLC is given in Annexure One ..The guidelines for the establishment of healthy life style centres in health care institutions ; had been described in D GHS letter No NCD/41/2011 ; dated 31.07.2013 ( Annexure Two ) Further instructions and additional guidelines had been issued by general circular No 02 - 25 /2013 ( Annexure Three ) Accordingly the performances of HLC are tabulated by the District MO/NCD and submitted to the NCD Directorate of the Ministry of Health as a quarterly summary of NCD screening activities in the District . ( Annexure four ) In the directorate the statistics ar e maintained in the form of cumulative figures ( Annexure five ) However , due to various reasons ( Eg: National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 50 Symptoms not felt by at risk individuals , daily employment permit no time to at tend HLC during daytime , Not knowledgeble about NCD , Behavior Change Communication not reached the target population , etc. ) the attendance of individuals for screening at HLC is said to be low and the intervention instituted is becoming les s cost - effective. Therefore the Director General of Health Services instructed ( at the Health Development Committee meeting held on 27 November 2014 ) the Policy Analysis & Development unit of Ministry of H ealth to conduct a study to evaluate the utilization pattern of HLC and identify predisposing causes as well as mechanism/s to improve the situation . Objectives (a) To identify the utilization pattern of healthy life style centres in medical institutions (b) To identify the causes influencing the utilization pattern (c) To identify mechanism/s to improve utilization of healthy life style centres Methodology As this is a health system analysis it was dec ided to include several methods to ascertain the different aspects of the problems listed above . (1) According to the guidelines listed in Annexure two ; the expected target of clients to the HLC , should be 240 per quarter . ( estimated number to be screened for 3 months = 240 ) Therefore it is expected that the estimated attendance per month to a HLC should be 80 ( 80/month) Thus it was decided to consider this norm as the denomina tor , and the average monthly attendance of clients of any given HLC as the numerator ; and the percentage calculated is termed as the utilization percentage of HLC Average Monthly Attendance of HLC x 100 = Utilization % Estimated monthly attendance ( 80 ) Therefore all PDHS , RDHS / NCD were requested ( DGHS letter No PA & D / 30 /2014 on 08 December 2014 ) to send data on attendance at HLC ; pertaining to first nine months of year 2014 ( Annexure six ) The sets of data received from districts are analyzed according to aforementioned indicator and presented in Annexure Seven (2) As programme implementers the PDHS,RDHS and Di strict M.OO /NCD have a wide practical experience on this issue , it was planned to collect their expressions in terms of the following (a) Best practices created by district staff to sustain / improve the attendance of cli ents to HLC ( considered as Strengths & Opportunities to achieve targets ) (b) District specific problems leading to lowering of attendance ( considered as weaknesses & Threats to achieve targets ) (c) Innovative proposals from dist rict staff to improve screening and follow up National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 51 (3) Opinion survey from National level Technical Experts (4) Interviews with clients who attended HLC (5) Facility survey using check list ( according to annexure one ) Results and interp retation Out of 26 Districts of the country 23 districts had send the requested data ; Data on attendance of clients of 663 HLCs during January - September 2014 were analyzed accordingly . The total number of HLC established in the country at present is 742 . Therefore this survey has covered 89.35 % of HLC of the country . Calculation of Utilization percentage of each HLC is given in annexure seven . A summary of u tilization of HLC according to RDHS divisions is given in table one .

Matara NCD /HLC activities shou ld be included in the duty lists of field staff Strengthen and implement programes jointly by MO/NCD & HEO with monitoring impact A separate MO should be appointed to each MOH division with a PHI for NCD activities .( coordinating with District MO / NCD & HEO to conduct workplace screening and school NCD activities ) A separate MO should be appointed to each HLC with a nursing officer for NCD activities ( Awareness programs and Screenin g ) All above activities should be aimed at improving National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 58 male participation for NCD screening and follow up . Polonnaruwa Awareness and training programmes for community leaders ( village level community organizations ) Repeated remainders by MOH at Divisional coordinating committee meeting at Divisional Secretariat with local political leaders Kegalle As the age limit for females in Well -women clinics is 35 yrs ; it is suggested to lower the age limit of HLC from 40 yrs to 35 yrs . At mobile clinics RBS is tested instead of FBS ; thus it is suggested to consider RBS > 200mg/dl as the guide line . Ampara Screen the target population based on GN divisions ( need to conduct mobile clinics ) Rathnapura Introduction of cholesterol checking strips to the HLC without the services of MLT Make available glucometers and strips through RMSD /MSD without instructing the districts to parche s those items locally/ at district level Appoint an additional M.O and a nursing officer ( Community health nurse ? ) with supporting staff to each MOH office ; with additional vehicle & a driver ; and designate the said team for NCD screening and followup activities According to the voters National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 59 register of GN division the target population should be screened and documented ; repeat the process at least at two year intervals . Conduct follo w up clinics in MOH office once a week by the same staff Saturday clinic for government/private workers House to house survey in each GN division to assess the NCD burden Galle Conducing a NCD screening programe at a co mmunity centre , on a fixed date of a month in each PHM area Annual schedule to screen work place employees of each MOH division The aforementioned new proposals sent by programe implementers in the districts should be considered at programe reforms . Opinion survey from National level Technical Experts Several National level experts expressed their concerns as summarized in table six Table 6 Consultant Opinion / Key proposals DrL.C.Somathun ga DDG ( MS ) I 1. According to the World Bank report, Screening target is 8% of the target population, but by 2014, SL has achieved about 17%. 2. Stepwise approach is necessary for the next 5yrs because a. People attend for HLCs are apparently health b. Time is necessary to take the messages to community 3. Next step should be to increase the number of days of HLCs to be opened. But this can be achieved if human resource can be provided only. 4. Healthy people must be encourage to attend HLCs yearly to ascertain that they are healthy. 5. Appointments should be given to work places to screen their workers to catch National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 60 up males . Dr Sarath Amunugama DDG ( PHS ) I 1. Need system reforms a. Appoint a DDG NCD prevention b. Establish a NCD Prevention Bureau c. Need to strengthen the monit oring & Evaluation mechanism 2. Community empowerment should be a main strategy of NCD prevention. HLC is only a part of NCD prevention. Without a community approach, establishment of HLCs , resource allocation will not give the expected results 3. Health promo tion village concept may be used to prevent NCDs 4. PHM can be used to empower the community. PHM should not overburden. Population allocation can be reduced 5. Underutilized clinics operated in hospitals may be combined if possible - HLC, Youth Clinic, WWC 6. Outreach screening programmes may be successful than HLC clinics. Therefore possibility should be reviewed 7. Good healthy behavior culture should be popular among community Dr Sunil de Alwis DDG ( ET & R ) 1. No feasibility study was conducted prior to establishment of HLC ( Feasibility should have been obtained from people But no pilot study conducted ) 2. Numerous rooms in the OPD ( HLC , TB sputum collection room ,Youth service unit , etc ) 3. Cost analys is on capital investment should be conducted 4. Rhythm of life of people should be analyzed . Accessibility and timing inconvenient for the clients . 5. Extend to household level ( Village level ) Examples of similar programs which g o to the village level are Ante natal clinics , School Dental Mobile Service & Private Dispensary National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 61 of Govt M.OO . 6. People like active case detection , therefore village level mobile clinic are more suitable . Lists of names can be obtained from GN divisions 7. Investigative facilities through mobile laboratories or out source to private laboratories . 8. To clear the backlog , conduct a National NCD day or National NCD week and all staff to be deployed to screening of 35 - 65 age group Dr Ananda Gunasekara DDG ( MS ) II 12 January 2015 1. Need a separate responsible team for NCD care to conduct mobile clinics in villages ( in addition to HLC ) because the allocation given by th e Ministry of Health for HLC s is comparatively high. 2. Staff should be dedicated for activities of HLCs. Presently the HLCs are not a priority activity of most of the MOOs 3. Need to prepare a separate duty list and a follow up plan 4. Need to establish a high level unit like FHB 5. Need special monitoring of the activities 6. Establish a separate unit at the apex hospital to follow up of this patient to assure that the patient is on track. This unit need holistic approach on these identified persons - Nutrition, Endocrinology etc 7. Need costing of HLCs with the recommendations at the end of this survey. DrV.T.S.K.Siriwardana Director / NCD 16 March 2015 1. Screening should be compulsory 2. Screening can be link with other benefit packages (eg - OPD priority, Separa te counter for patients with HLC registration). These benefits can be given for a limited period till adequate coverage is achieved. 3. Can ask HLC registration card when go for other government offices 4. Insurance agents all over the country can be used to pro mote HLCs. Can give a target of 100 clients per month National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 62 5. Social groups ( eg. Three wheeler associations) can be used for improve public awareness 6. GPs can be used to promote HLCs 7. Quality of data is doubtful 8. Mobile screening system should be establishe d Dr Sussir Perera D/Organization Development 1. Structure need to change to suit the need 2. The present system focuses mainly on screening. HLC should be used for lifestyle modification of patients already attending Medical clinics ; ( Because MCs are overcrowded and no time to give lifestyle guidance to patients and their families. ) Then the messages are disseminated to others of community. 3. We see the iceberg of the NCD problem only. Programme should be focus on risk factor manage. 4. Mostly the same patient s attend different screening programmes. Personal Health Record should be linked to HLCs. Then repeated screening can be discouraged. 5. The Ministry of Health has spent large amount of money on HLCs. Therefore a Separate Health Promotion officer should be t rained and recruited. 6. HLCs should be opened daily basis incorporated different activities - Screening, Health education Life style modification of MC patients etc 7. Need to introduce a target to PHMs to refer to a HLC ( 4 persons per month). 8. Need to introdu ce a NCD notification system and NCD register. Need strengthening of the NCD monitoring Dr Kumari Fernando D/ Primary Care Services 1. Support from Consultant Physicians should be improved ; priority to be given to patients referred from the HLCs to th e MC 2. Attitude of MOOs should be changed 3. MOOs should be trained 4. May need training of other new staff category to overcome the staff shortage. National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 63 Dr Samitha Sirithunga CCP NCD unit / MoH 03 March 2015 1. Must give more time to establish HLCs because still onl y 3 yrs. ( Immunization programme took more than 20 yrs to achieve 100% coverage ) 2. Need attractive NCD package 3. Need work station screening to capture more males 4. Can in cooperate with other clinic patients 5. Need to highlight 40yrs age group otherwise dilute 6. Need more supervision role of MO NCD at district level 7. Avoid the risk of getting false returns from HLCs 8. People do not like to come to HLCs only for FBS. Need to add other investigations if possible. 9. Need to continue HLCs for follow up of patients identified with risk factors. 10. PHI and PHM work profiles have to re - define to suit NCD requirements. Dr.V.Mallawarachci CCP / NCD unit 1. Public health staff support is not satisfactory in referring patients to HLCs. 2. Separate staff cannot be utilized to refer patients from the community to HLCs 3. Need to give adequate time to establish HLCs 4. MOOs attitude need to be changed 5. Educational reforms need to be introduced in curricula of medical faculties 6. HLCs are one of the strategies in the NCD policy. This i s not a new concept. Accepted world wide 7. Need special strategies to improve male participation 8. Piece meal approach may not successful. Need systematic approach 9. RDHA level supervision is not adequate It is evident that most of the technical experts are in favor of program reforms ; and it invites to the subject of management reforms rather than technical reforms ( modifications) to the existing programe Interviews with clients who attended HLC National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 64 Personnel who at tended to HLC of Hospitals ( according to District HLC timetable received from MO/NCD ) ; presented their experiences as described in table seven .

This with the universal free education has contributed to a high life expectancy and good health indicators. Substantial declines in fertility since 1970s, has led to a process of rapid demographic ageing. Today, Sri Lanka has fastest aging population in the world. Due to improvement of the health care services as well as the socio economic conditions of the country there is a reducti on in the communicable diseases while the non - communicable diseases are on the rise. The country has a strategy to address non -communicable diseases, based on prevention and control which includes the promotion of healthy lifestyles as well as the Sri Lank an population is the fastest aging population in the world and as the Non Communicable Diseases are common among the elderly, provision of a quality Non Communicable Disease control programmer has become a national priority. Justification: NCD Unit of M inistry of Health was set up in 1999 with the expressed view of combating the emerging problem of NCDs in Sri Lanka. The NCD Unit, which is responsible for diseases which cause more than 50% of deaths in Sri Lanka National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 69 currently has only the Director, Deputy Di rector, two consultant community physicians, and two Medical officers which is far less of strength in comparison to the disease burden. Also the activities related to control of cancers and mental health which are also part of NCD are tackled by a separa te directorates. Therefore considering the disease burden and the scope of work it is proposed to have a separate Non Communicable Diseases Bureau under a Deputy Director General of Health Services (Non Communicable Diseases). The directorate of NCD, Ment al Health and Cancer prevention and control will be managed under the DDG (NCD). The proposed NCD Bureau will carry out health promotion, disease prevention, community screening, disease control, disease surveillance and reporting, development and introdu ction of policies and guidelines, training and capacity building, research, piloting of innovative approaches for the following illnesses: Cardiovascular disease (ischeamic heart diseases, stroke, hypertension) Diabetes Mellitus Chronic respiratory disea ses Chronic renal disease Eye diseases Accident and injuries including child injuries The Terms of Reference for the NCD Bureau are: 1. Plan and implement a comprehensive programmer to control the selected NCDs. 2. Coordination of activities related to NCD risk factors. 3. Establishment of an effective monitoring and evaluation framework for NCD 4. Conduct surveillance on NCD morbidity, NCD mortality, NCD risk factors and health system response. 5. Take action to improve reporting from Health Lifestyle centers and other NCD screening centers and form a National NCD data base. 6. Implementing a four yearly National Health Survey 7. Identify and facilitate research in priority areas for NCD 8. Facilitate implementation of innovative approaches to prevent, control and manage N CD 9. Coordinate and develop clinical Guidelines and Management protocols. 10. Ro conduct/ coordinate capacity development programmers for NCD management.

Thereafter , sinc e the gaining of Independence , the policy of ' free health care for all ' was adopted and Sri Lanka continuous to be one of the few countries who have been able to sustain it while having an impressive health servi ces record and being very much progressed in Universal Health Care . In 2012 the World Health Organization ( WHO ) adapted this new resolution on ' Universal Health Coverage ' which comprises of the four pilla rs of Equity , Accessibility , Quality and Financial Protection . ( 3 ) Both the WHO and the World Bank have devised a framework for analyzing the UHC progress , which comprises of three indicators of Health service cove rage , Financial risk protection and Equity of distribution of health services to entire population Curative health sector is the largest service provider in Sri Lanka .Annually it serves 53 million out patients and 5 million in patients together which comes to three times the total population of the country , No other service organization whether it is in public sector or private sector has such a large customer base The closest competitor is the Ministry of Education which serves about 4 million students annually . Although Sri Lanka has this free health system , the out of pocket expenditure for health care services for the public was estimated at a massive 46 % by the year 2009 while government spends 54 % only ( 4 ) The Government Budgetary allocations for health was a mere 1.43 % of National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 73 the GDP in 2013 while the highest it reached was 1.9 % in 2004 ( 5 ) But the present government has pledged to increase the health allocation to 3 % of GDP , historically doubling the previous allocations , as mentioned by His Excellency the President Maithreepala Sirisena hims elf at the International Family Health Day celebrations on 05th May 2015 . Therefore it is imperative the new impetus gained by this increase in financial allocations , be distributed in a justifiable manner to all the districts , while prioritizing on scientifically based criteria which encompasses the UHC perspectives , as well as national and district perspectives Is there a mechanism to undertake this challenge of the needs & demands for better health services . The best answer to the aforementioned question had been given by the Hon Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Dr Rajitha Senarathna , at an international forum . The A fghanistan and Maldives island delegations had discussions with the Hon Minister of Health Sri Lanka at the SAARC Health Ministers Meeting in New Delhi India ( February 2015 ) Both countries have stated that they are i mpressed by the health status and health service provision indicators of Sri Lanka and they wanted to know the mechanism by which we attain such high indicators , The reply of the Hon Minister of Health Sri Lanka had been two fold ( 1 ) Due to high literacy rate in our country all mothers are health conscious ( 2 ) excellent health service delivery designed and managed by Medical Administrators . This is the first and only and best ever recognition given to Sri Lankan Medical Administrators at International Forums , Whilst thanking the Hon Minister for giving the Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka a long awaited appreciation internationally , it is the duty of all Medical Administrators to preserve it by making innovative efforts and reforms to deliver the best health service in the SEAR countries Both statements , of the H E the President and the Hon Ministe r of Health are of high importance at this particular period of time , as it is the time , the preparatory activities have begun to create the next health policy and next health master plan for our country .The excis ing health policy was introduced in 1996 and by now 19 years have elapsed and a new health policy has to be designed according to the issues at present and also considering the needs and demands of health futures . ( as the present health master plan ends in 2017 ) Simultaneously the strategic framework to implement the new policy ( = new health master plan ) has to be developed . Thus Medical Administrators of today have a grea t task to perform for tomorrow's patients .More specifically , ( according to WHO ) the Medical Administrators are the voice of the poor , the sick and the dead . National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 74 2.0 The present situation in the Curative Service s Division of the Department of Health Services / Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Although certain ordinances pertaining to public health were enacted ( Example - Ordinance of Quarantine and prevention of diseases was enacted 100 years ago ) by the British Colonial Rulers , the Health Services Act was enacted after the independence ( as Act No 12 of 1952 ) According to section 3 a , b , c , and d ; the Director of Health Servi ces , Deputy Directors Medical Services , Public Health Services and Laboratory Services were appointed respectively . ( 6 ) Later the designations were improved as Director General of Health Services , Deputy Director Ge nerals of Health ( Medical Services , ( Services ) , and ( Laboratory Services ) The first Health Policy of Shri Lanka was introduced 40 years later , in 1992 by Prof Earl Fonseka et.al ( 7 ) The team of officials who participated in the Presidential Task Force in the preparation of Health Policy in 1992 have paid a fair attention to situation analysis in their documentation before suggesting policy options , In d eed they have analyzed the following sub sectors in curative services at length in 1992 . Cardio Vascular diseases p 28 Accidents and poisoning p 36 Blind and visually impaired p 50 Deafness and hearing impairment including dumbness p 51 Geriatrics p 53 Occupational health p 55 Snake bites p 56 Population groups living in areas of development projects of other sectors p 57 Estate population p 59 Primacy level curative services p 61 Health services at secondary and tertiary levels p 63 The centres of excellence p 67 Laboratory and diagnostics services p 69 Blood transfusion , tissue grafting and organ transplantations p 71 Human resource for health p 128 Drugs and vaccines p 141 Equipment supplies p 149 Private health sector p 152 Unfortunately a National Framework to establish Divisional Health System ( which emphasized more on preventive sector ) was fixed on top of thi s extensive analysis , and the result was neglecting the reforms in the curative sector Few years later , in 1996 , another Health Policy was prepared ( and it is still in existence ) But no evidence was available about situation analysis National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 75 and problem analysis The emphasis was on two major areas ( 1 ) Subjects which were not available as directorates in the Ministry before , were established ( ) The other area to which the clinical professors who were involved in the preparation of this health policy of 1996 , paid major attention was ( 2 ) to incorporate the growing number of young clinical consultants in to a rapidly nominated Base Hospitals scattered all over the country . For this purpose , some of the larger District Hospitals were identified to appoint consultants , As those hospitals were belonging t o Provincial Councils , the allocations within the Provincial councils were not sufficient to establish operating theatres , Diagnostic facilities etc . Because of the Provincial Council Act the Line Ministry was unable to fund the Provincially owned Base Hospitals , and it took nearly 20 years to over come the problem of funds and make those BHH suitable for Consultants units Though out the Curative Services Division of the Line Ministry of Health ( DDG MS I and II , DDG LS ) were not involved much in planning these new facilities in the Provinces . In 2006 the JICA health Master plan was prepared ( the first health master plan of the country ) Unfortunately most of the planners had their origin from Community Medicine stream and little emphasis was paid for the development of Curative services Division of the Ministry of Health . Though it had spend sev eral millions of Rupees/Yen , there are serious defects in this JICA master plan Document . They have failed to prepare plans for some of the major subject areas . Examples are Kidney disease , Thalassemia , Estate ( Plantation ) Health , Occupational Health , HRH , etc ( Now we are at the end of time period of JICA master plan 2006 - 2016 ; and now the CKDu and Thalassemia have become major problems of the country , whielst t he Tamils of Indian origin have made complains to the LLRC - Commission on Learned Lessons & Reconciliation , about defects in the Estate ( Plantation ) Health services .Thus JICA Master Plan has failed to address key health problems in our country even after spending millions of money for the preparation of plan document On the other hand JICA master plan writers elaborated more and more on officials engaged in preventive health services and a large number of ramification of preventive subjects and offices and posts were created to incorporate all post graduates in Community Medicine . ( as directors , deputy directors and as national programme managers , up to the extent of NPM/ Suicide prevention , NPM/Gender based violence , NPM/Birth defects etc ! ) Because of this numerous ramifications in preventive sector , the present post graduate students in Community Medicine will be benefited as a post will be available for them when the time they qualify / Board certified !! Will the people of Sri Lanka get the benefit of these ramifications in Preventive subjects ( the cost of Administrative overheads in retaining officers in Colombo than sending them to Districts , and the outcomes / Impacts ) are to be assessed !!! The opportunity cost of all aforementioned preventive health National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 76 developments wa s mal development of curative service component of the Ministry of Health . Thus the Organization of the curative division was unchanged for 50 years ; but the needs and demands have been increased many folds . With th e increased literacy of people over the past years , the expectations for standard clinical care have become increased . The professional colleges of clinicians demand more from the curative division of the Ministry of He alth to provide more care ( with their knowledge and skills ) to the patients , But the age old structure is not capable in delivering the expected to the clinicians as well as patients The patient's Grievances o r the commonest complains made by the patient's and their next of kin include the following ( a ) delay in attending the patient ( b ) rudeness or unkind attitude of staff ( ) Medical negligence ( d ) negligence by othe r categories of staff ( d ) non availability of drugs , investigative facilities and ambulances ( e ) problems in critical care units including transfer of critically ill due to non-availability of ICU beds , problems in Labour rooms and operating theaters , directorates ( D/MS , D/TCS & D/PCS ) are unable to attend all these problematic zones island wide as they are at present mostly engaged in transfers of all categories of Medical officers On the other hand , the clinical professions too have ramified over the past decades creating various sub specialties and each of these sub specialty has it's own national plan to develop and cater a quality service throughout the island . But at present there is no directorate to liaise with the clinical professions and materialize their plans to improve the sub specialties to deliver an equitable and quality se rvice through out the country . Though we claim that we offer Universal Health Coverage in Sri Lanka , it is only with regard to the preventive services , The curative services have to achieve many development strategi es to attain the status of ( 1 ) Equitable coverage of Curative Services ( 2 ) Accessibility for all patients who need any specialty of Curative Care ( 3 ) Quality service by making available the relevant clinical professio nals and trained staff , Bio Medical equipment and drugs etc ( 4 ) Financial protection of all patients who seek curative care At present the Curative Services division is mainly divided in to two sub departments , the Medical Services and the Laboratory Services The Medical Services Sub department is further divided under two Deputy Director Generals - Medical Services I and II The Directors of Tertiary Care Services , Health Ca re quality & Patient Safety with D/NCD and D / Cancer control are functioning under DDG ( MS ) I . The Directors of Medical Services ,Primary care services , Private Health Sector Development and D/NBTS are assigned to DDG ( MS ) II . The DDG ( Laboratory ) has two directors namely D/Medical Supplies and D/ Laboratory Services . It will be evident from the aforementioned description that the present organization is overload ed and have no capacity to undertake the new demand for services and challenges of health futures National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 77 Therefore it is essential and timely to introduce reforms to the curative services division of the Ministry of Heal th as follows Reforms to the PRIMARY CARE SERVICES unit ( D/PCS ) Reforms to the Medical Services unit ( D/MS ) be re-named as SECONDARY CARE SERVICES Reforms to the TERTIARY CARE SERVICES unit ( D/TCS ) Reforms to the L ABORATORY SERVICES unit ( D/LS ) Creating a separate Division of the Ministry of Health known as CURATIVE SERVICES DIVISION with DDG MS I ,II, II DDG LS and DDG Medical supplies with a structure of directorates releva nt to functions ( and responsive to needs of clinical professions and patients ) 3.0 Reforms in the Primary Care Services ( PCS ) At present the D/Primary Care Services operates as a branch of DDG ( Medical Services ) II , and since its inception no developmental changes have been implemented to uplift its services . But from the table below it will be evident the crucial importance of it ( D/PCS ) as the Technical authority of all Divisional Hospitals and Primary Medical Care units distributed through out the country . Type of Hospital Number of Institutions in the Country (a ) Divisional Hospitals - A 42 (b) Divis ional Hospitals - B 129 (c ) Divisional Hospitals - C 322 Primary Medical Care Units 474 Therefore total Number of Institutions under technical supervision of D/PCS ( all D HH and all PMCUU ) 967 , with the estab lishment of Provincial System , the importance of D /PCS had been lost Each and every Province ( and each and every District ) had been adopted their own methodologies in development and management of these Primary le vel Curative institutions , creating wide disparity among institutions and services as no inputs were obtained from national technical focal point , the D/PCS . These variations of service provision invariably affected the recipient population , the patients living in those catchment areas . It should be noted that a large percentage of patients attend to out patient units of these Primary curative care institutions ( please refer to th e table below ) As such the services offered to those large populations has to be technically monitored by the D/PCS Diagnosis Tertiary Level Secondary level Primary level Injuries 11.9 18.5 19.7 Asthma 1.8 3.0 7.7 Other Ischem ic Heart Diseases 1.7 1.9 1.5 Malignant Neoplasm 2.5 1.8 0.1 Hypertensive Heart 1.0 1.5 3.5 National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 78 Disease Diabetes Mellitus 1.1 1.4 1.2 COPD/Bronchiectasis 0.4 0.6 0.9 Cerebrovascular diseases o.6 0.6 0.5 Myocardial Infarction o.2 0.5 0.3 64.7 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 An analysis of the list of duties assigned to the D/PCS will clearly indicate that the present structure is not adequate to deliver the expected services Duty assigned at pr esent Comment Attend the health care delivery related problems of district hospitals , peripheral units , rural hospitals , central dispensaries , and maternity homes , categorized under divisional hospitals and refer to DDG ( MS ) II when advice required At present D HH and PMCUU are managed by Provincial and District health authorities and involvement of D/PCS is minimal or nil ( No technical advice is sort from D/PCS ) Support and assi st regional authorities in preparation and implementation of development plans / projects The assistance of D/PCS is never obtained at present by Provincial /Regional authorities thus uniformity of plans / projects have been lost Support and assist National Quality and Productivity improvement programme according to the guidelines provided by the Quality secretariat of the Ministry of Health At present the involvement of D/PCS in this activity , in D HH and PMCUU , is minimum or nil as D / PCS has not been invited into Provincial or District programmes Organize , support & monitor National Health Sector Excellence awards Programme according to guidelines provided by DDG ( MS ) II Non functioning Take part in progress review meetings conducted by regional authorities that are related to D/PCS area of responsibility Provincial and District health authorities usually do not i ncorporate D/PCs in their progress reviews and function independently Thus national norms are not implemented / not monitored at provincial /district levels Visit health institutions ( D HH and PMCUU ) if requested and tak e part in appraisal of divisional hospitals under National Health Sector Excellence awards Programme No invitations to visit No appraisals of Hospitals Thus no maintenance of norms and quality Prepare comparisons of apprai sals of institutions according to standard format provided by DDG ( MS ) II Non functioning Thus it will be evident that a large majority of hospitals in this country are not National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 79 been managed by the technical focal po int due to the fact that those hospitals are owned by provincial authorities , making in accessible to the D/PCS alone , and creating wider disparities - inter and intra districts /provinces , resulting poor quality and non safe services to thousands of patients in those catchment areas . Therefore it is strong evidence to strengthen the Primary care services , to make it penetrate in to provinces and districts , embark on supe rvision and appraisal of Divisional Hospitals and Primary Medical Care units , promote norms and standards and reduce disparities to offer a quality and accessible service with financial protection of the patients through o ut the country in an equitable manner ( = Universal Health Coverage ) Thus the proposal is to establish a new structure for management of Primary care services under a separate and new Deputy Director General ( PCS ) For the effective function of this new DDG ( PCS ) several new directorates have to established , taken in to account the age old non development in Curative Services Division of the Ministry of Health (a) Director / Primary care services D/PCS will function as it is and with the same duty list but with more authority as the DDG ( PCS ) will have the same duties .So that both can penetrate in to Provincial and District health a uthorities and implement technical standards monitor quality & safety to uplift the D HH and PMCUU through out the country . Depending on the work load a Deputy Director may be appointed ( example = to at tend the technical needs of large D HH = type A ) (b) Director / Palliative care ( Transitional and Integrated Care ) services Growing number of patients in need of Palliative care has demanded a creation of this new disci pline in the Ministry of Health . The Profile of the Directorate has already been prepared by the Consultants in Palliative Care . The preparation of National Policy and strategic plan for Palliative care is in progress , In addition the subjects of Home based care and community nursing will be attended by D/Palliative Care ( Transitional and integrated care involves transition of patients from acute care ( Tertiary ) to rehabilitation and palliation at next level , which capture more wider and appropriate intervention ( c) Director / Geriatric care services With the increase of patients with NCD complications and Aging of popul ation , the Ministry of Health has to face a greater challenge in developing Geriatric care services in an equitable basis and accessible manner to all such patients living anywhere in the country . As such a new dire ctorate of Geriatric care services should be established ( d ) Director / Tele -health As centres of excellence are located far away from DHH and PMCU , the linkages to and from such centres of ex cellence is of utmost importance to the poor patients attending DHH and PMCUU ( as out of pocket expenditure for such National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 80 patients to attend centres of excellence would be unbearable ) Thus tele health net work has to be established to cover all DHH and PMCU through out the country . M.OO with medical informatics qualifications will work under D / Tele health to maintain the services 24 hrly . (e) Director / Operational Developmen t ( PCS ) All the planning issues under the DDG ( PCS ) involving the development of all DHH and PMCUU in the country will be attended by D/ operational development ( A hospital planning Specialist ) It includes Infrastructure , equipment , Quality & safety , HRH and health system research and design in Primary level curative institutions 4.0Reforms to the Secondary Care Services At present Director / Medical services is attached to the Deputy Director General ( Medical Services ) II .

Attend management committee meetings of allocated hospitals as liaison officer of MoH In sufficient time / due to appeals of M.OO requesting transfers Out of the functions of the D /MS about 50% ( 8 out of 16 ) are involvements with the transfers of Grade M.OO. Therefore , in practice , D / MS is unable to attend the rest of duties due unavailability of time . Duties such as , Up grading of Ins titutions , Facilitation to Provincial Health system and attending management committee meetings are the important issues but the attention paid at present is less due to around the clock engagement with transfers and appe als of M;OO Therefore the following new structure / system is proposed ( a ) the aforementioned functions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 should be separated and given to a separate Director of Senior Medical Administrative Grade who has Qualifications in Medical administration and name the post as Director / HR management of Medical Service ( b ) A separate new Director post to be created , assigning the aforementioned functions 9,10,11,12,13, 15 and 16 ; thus named as Director / Secondary care Services .

However it is observed that the Ministry has not given a job description to the post of Director / Tertiary Care Services . Furthermore it is evident that the transfers and placements of clinical consultants have become the main and only function of Director / tertiary Care Services ; making no time and attention to the planning , development , implementation and evaluation of Tertiary Care Services . To make the situation more complex , the personnel files of clinical consultants are kept in the TCS unit in the alphabetical order , If the personnel files of clinical consultants are kept acc ording to the specialty and , within specialty according to seniority , it would have been much easier to find ( a ) who has gone abroad for foreign training and when S/He will be back to service in Sri Lanka ( b ) Who is next to arrive after completion of foreign training in a given specialty ( c ) the vacancy list of all specialties and the priorities .

Therefore 906 primary care hospitals are established island wide to serve the above purpose , of which the categorization is given below . Type of primary level curative institute Bed capacity Total No. of institutions Divisional Hospital type A ( DH - A ) More than 100 type B ( DH -B ) C ( DH -C ) Less than 50 322 Primary Medical Care Units ( PMCU ) Central dispensaries & Maternity Homes 474 Analysis of patient movement statistics , viz; percentage of patients obtaining treatment from out patient units of different types of government hospitals indicate that 69.7% of patients obtain treatment from OPD of primary care hospitals ( 1 ) Although the OPD of primary care hospitals are utilized by patients extensi vely ( as indicated by a higher percentage of 69.7% ) the in patient facilities are utilized comparatively less as indicated at the comparison of bed availability ( 49.1% ) with admissions ( 37.7% ) ie; whilst observing an under utilization of in patient f acilities at primary care hospitals , a simultaneous over crowding is evident at secondary & tertiary care hospitals Level of care OPD Admissions Beds Primary The reasons for ab ove disparities have to be analyzed ; and a re - structuring methodology has to be developed to strengthen the primary level curative institutions to offer maximum and National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 93 personalized care to the people living in the catchment area 2.0 Background The Department of Health Services had been established under the legal provisions of Health Services Act ( Act No. 12 of 1952 ) According to section 5 of Health Services Act , the first National Health Policy was published in 1992 and later i t was replaced by the National Health Policy of 1996 . None of the Health policies have failed at least to analyze the largest curative ( primary ) care network in the country - the Primary Care Hospital System . Later on , to implement the Health Policy of 1996 ,a Health Master Plan had been prepared in 2006 But the same mistake has occurred once again by not considering this vital segment of Sr i lankan Health system . The National Health Development Plan ( 2013 - 2017 ) too , has not id entified the issues in this important sector of service delivery for the simple fact that the planners were based in Colombo - the capital city and had no experience in rural and estate settings In addition to said problem of non-recognition of PHC curative services as equal importance to other segments of Health system ; New Base hospitals ( Secondary level ) were established throughout the country ( at major townships ) as a directive from National Health Policy of 1996 But those hospit als were established under the 13 th amendment of the constitution of the country , where provincial hospitals have to be financed by the provincial councils . As provincial councils had no sufficient finances to create several new BHH in their provinces , almost all the allocations were pumped to build and equip the new BHH ; at the cost of neglecting essential improvements of PHC hospitals ( a Negative externality effect of creating new set of BHH ) It is true that the inward facilities of primary care hospitals are underutilized because of the fact that facilities are not available to the standards .But said underutilization has created a negative effect on allocation of funds for improvements ; a reduction in allocations to primary level hospitals with low bed occupancy rates ( ? allocative efficiency ) making the situation further deteriorated 3.0 current Situation The primary care hospitals comprise of three basic units (a) OPD (b) Clinics (c ) Wards . To offer services at these three service outlets the Department of Health Services is utilizing five resources (1) Workforce HR (2) Medical supplies (3) Biomedical equipment (4) infrastructure & Transport (5) Procedures ( Clinical & administrative )It is essential to note the response of patient community to each of aforementioned eight items as the final outcome depends on the interaction of all above National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 94 The issues at present in the sector is described in the paragr aphs to follow ; 3.1. The burden of NCD and PHC hospital PHC hospitals had been designed during the era of epidemics of communicable diseases But after several decades at present with epidemiological transition the country has moved to an era with high incidence of non -communicable diseases The problem has been further aggravated by the demographic transition ; The aging of population But the PHC hospital system is not geared to provided curative care services for the NCD in an organized and coherent manner . The following statistics indicate the need to strengthen NCD care at PHC hospitals Percentages of patient discharges accounted by selected NCD at different levels of health care institutions ( 1 ) Diagnosis Tertiary level Secondary level Primary level Injuries 11.9 18.5 19.7 Asthma 1.8 3.0 7.7 Other Ischemic Heart Diseases 1.7 1.9 1.5 Malignent Neoplasms 2.5 1.8 0.1 Hypertensive heart disease 1.0 1.5 3,5 Diabetes Mellitus 1.1 1.4 1.2 COPD/Bronchiectasis 0.4 0,6 0,9 CerebroVasculer Disease 0.6 0.6 0.5 Myocardial 0.2 other causes 81.2 72.1 64.7 Total 100,0 100,0 100,0 In response to growing patient demands the healthy lifestyle centers have been established in PHC hospitals , but several issues are identified as fo llows ; 3.1.1 Inadequate referrals to HLC - Life style guidance is obviously lacking to a readily accessed target population attending medical clinics where further guidance should be extended to the families of the affected 3.1.2 low coverage of at risk population ( specially males ) In the rural areas majority of females are housewives and they have spare time to attend the HLC But males are engaged at their employment and find it difficult to attend HLC 3.1.3 Capacities for managing risk to be emphasized ( in par with screening ) ; Inadequate guidance for healthier life styles ( In addition to screening functional scope has to be broaden such as with life style guidance in an effective way ) The above subject is further analyzed and proposals o f Mobile HLC at Village level & a monitoring unit at central level termed as NCD Bureau ; have been submitted to the Ministry of National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 95 Health . 3.2 Non availability of Referral and Back Referral system at PHC hospitals The above problem is an age old issue in the Srilankan Health system and it is further affected by the following contributory factors 3.2.1 No demarcated catchment area and no designated population for the PHC hospitals 3.2.2 Choice of access to care ; Currently people have the choice of accessing care where they wish to Although patients accessing care at primary level hospitals ; are , at times referred to specialist hospitals and these would be mainly in acute situation s or in difficult to manage situations . Referrals done to prevent an adverse outcome that need to be planned on a regular basis is not a standard practice As stated in the NCD policy it is important that premature morbidity and mortality are prevented . Proper referral and Back referral policies are important to make shared care possible between primary and specialist care and also to make the health care delivery more effective and efficient 3.2.3 No Sharing of Resources Optimum use of PHC curative c are facilities and also the specialist facilities of apex hospitals are not evident at present Inefficient utilization of resources at both levels with no intension of sharing is an important issue to be solved The above issues are further analyzed and the proposal of Shared care cluster system is now being piloted in four districts by the Ministry of Health . 3.3 Under Utilization of In patient facilities As evident from statistics given above the wards of PHC hospitals are under utilized( bed occupancy rate below 37% )the valuable working hours of staff deployed have become not cost -effective . There are several contributory factors to this scenario ;it is rather best name those as aggravating factors 3.3.1 Inadequate Emergency care ( Em ergency rooms are not available in certain PHC hospitals ) 3.3.2 Inadequate sanitary and other supportive services to the patients . 3.3.3 Inadequate Laboratory facilities 3.3.4 Shortage of medical supplies The shorta ges are mostly experienced with the group of drugs given for Cardio vascular Diseases and Diabetes Mellitus at medical clinics of PHC hospitals .When medications and tests are not available in PHC hospitals patients are often asked to , self purchase the medications from private pharmacies , ( and tests from private laboratories ) or may not be given any advice at all . Thus many patients find that the cost of self purchasing medications is so expensive that they chose to go without regular medicatio ns. Consequently for many patients National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 96 NCD are not properly managed and subsequent progression to disease complications . 16 drugs were identified as essential for management of chronic NCD at Primary level care ,Although official circulars conveyed the decision , the ground availability for patient use has not been monitored . Due to mal -distribution of drugs within the RDHS/RMSD region a quasi -demand is created at certain locations and if a proper attention is given at local level regularly these issues could have been settled with re - distribution . Prescribing drugs for limited period also pose difficulty in patient complacence and access at primary care level . A detailed analysi s of distribution and availability of cardiovascular drugs at PHC level hospitals was undertaken as a research by a MD trainee attached PA & D unit in 2014 ( 2 ) This study has recommended to use a new indicator termed \" Adequacy of a drug for a given period \" This methodology can be used by any District to analyze the movement of drugs from RMSD to PHC hospitals . 3.3.5 Gaps in knowledge , attitudes and practices of staff to manage Chronic Disease There has been inadequate attention to the practice of standard care in management of chronic NCDs . Even through the national guidelines for management of chronic NCD ( Cardiovascular Diseases ) were made available there is no consistent effort to build capacities , monitor and evaluate the implementation . Under graduate medical education too focuses mainly on episodic management rather than chronic diseases which need personalized and family centered care . Teaching is mainly focused on diagnosis and management in a specialist setting rather than managing in primary care settings with early clinical preventions The discipline of Family Medicine too , is not taught in all medical faculties and the practical exposure in primary care given to undergraduates is also limited . Although the Primary Care Services unit ( PCS ) of MoH has been involved in orientation of post intern M.OO. who are deployed at primary care hospitals , there is no overall understanding of the required competencies for primary care M. OO. ( Even the trained personnel would go back to a system that has adopted its own style of working in an episodic functional mode , priority being managing the 'conditi on' rather than the person's total health needs 3.4 Non availability of personalized care to the patients 3.4.1 Non availability of patient friendly services at PHC hospitals ; - At the moment patients are seen at the OPD as ' cases ' of illnesses and no extra care is taken as in the general practice model . If a general practice model is applied in primary care settings Out Patient Doctors can be assigned to demarcated areas . ( similar to principals applied in preventive health services National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 97 ) but the ar eas would be much smaller , corresponding to a few Grama Niladhari divisions .Currently the availability of M.OO. at primary level is low , when compared to numbers deployed at base hospitals and above .This would also work out a rational method for employi ng more doctors through primary care strengthening .However a clear job description and functional scope needs to be developed to include the provision of personalized family centered care 3.4.2 In general OPD clinics the systems available to have access to Medical records for follow up ( of NCD )are not efficient and at time retrieval of records fails making the patient desperate and neglected 3.4.3 Patients in rural areas , have to travel along distance , and spend a considerable time to acces s the clinic , and spend a significant amount of money to purchase test reports and drugs , which facilities are not available at PHC hospital .( Out Of Pocket expenditure ) are the frequent complains and causes for dis - satisfaction among the public sector patients ( 3 ) 3.4.4 Inadequate facilities for patients to obtain further information about their illnesses As doctors and nurses are always busy in therapeutics , patients find it difficult to approach them to have a discussion about the illness that the patient suffers at the moment Further the family members or next of kin experience the same in seeking advice 3.5 Non availability of Policy decisions 3.5.1 At present the Primary Level Curative Sector has no defined and comprehensive Policy 3.5.2 Morbidity information on out patients is not available as there is no such island wide system to collect those data ; Disease categories ,treatment provided , etc. are essential data for the decision makers. Althoug h out patient information systems were established in few hospitals this has not been assessed for purpose of information used in decision making Medical informatics need to attend as this would benefit relevant information generation in primary c are settings 3.5.3 Inadequate technical cadres to provide crucial services ( M . OO. ,N.OO. ,MLT T ,Dispensers ) 3.5.4 Capacity for Multi task is not developed ; - currently different units are being established similar to specialized hospital setti ng which may not be that efficient from a health system point of view . Whilst task specialization is rational at higher level s of care , the primary care level needs to be more effective through capacities for multi -tasking 3,5,5 Performance evaluati on ; - Estimation for work carried through the curative system / measurement of health performance ; is lacking . Unlike the preventive health sector where MOH areas are demarcated with assigned population ( giving a denominator on which statistics can b e computed ) there is no designated catchment area/population for PHC hospitals National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 98 3.5.6 The primary care facility for the people living in the surrounding area of Secondary care and Tertiary care hospitals are the OPD of said Secondary care and Tertiary care hospital But the standard of OPD in these hospitals are quite different and superior to OPD of PHC hospitals 3.5.7 A decade ago health planners stated that every citizen of Sri Lanka is able to find a health facility within 3.5 km from his/her residence , but this scenario is no more in existence due to development of new settlements in remote rural regions The government , under rural development schemes , has provided a good road net work ; electricity and schools to these new settlements and now it is the time to design health facilities for them ; considering the Universal Health C overage concept ( Equity , Accessibility , Quality and Financial ) ( 4 ) GAP ANALYSIS by using UHC tool Please refer to Sit uation Analysis Target areas & Beneficiaries Please refer to Situation Analysis Justification Please refer to Situation Analysis Important assumptions / Risks / Conditions Please refer to Situation Analysis Vision Please re fer to Situation Analysis Mission Please refer to Strategies Goal Please refer to Strategies Programe Objectives ( Please prepare separate indicators for each objective ) 4.0 Objectives 4.1 To re -structure primary level hospit als for the management of burden of NCD effectively and efficiently 4.2 To establish a referral and back referral system for patients ;

Link to Health Information Policy 5.4.3 A study should be undertaken ( preferably by non health research officers to eliminate bias } to assess the problems faced by patients ( travelling a long distance , increased waiting times , inability to be standing for long hours in queues , out of pocket expenditure etc ) and identify methodologies to grant a patient friendly service 5.4.4 As Prof Senaka Bibile stated in his original article ( 5 ) ; Patien t information booklets on major NCD should be made available to patients 5.4.5 Trained nurses at information desks should be make available during visiting hours to provide further information to patients and their relatives 5.5 Strategy Five Develop ment o f National Policy on strengthening Primary level hospital services Activities 5.5.1 Develop the national policy on PHC hospitals in terms of accepted stages of formation, formulization , and formalization National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 103 of a policy ( with incorporation of this document ) 5.5.2 Develop a methodology to identify OPD data ( eg ; - at the lower edge of OPD ticket , a separate area is given to write the tentative diagnosis/ the episodes are calculated to take decisions by policy makers ) MIS /IT link to Health Information Policy 5.5.3 Cadre expansion according to the needs of PHC hospitals , and obtain the approval of Department of management services of Ministry of Finance ( Initiate Training of this subject according to Cadre projections ; - Link t o Human Resources Policy HRH ) 5.5.4 Currently different designations ( such as MO/Public Health , /Infection control nurse / Health education nurse , etc ) are being created in PHC hospitals and they perform their duties independently and it is not efficient in the point of view of health systems . On the other hand the HLC is equipped and furnished but without regular staff to provide services .Considering both situations it is proposed to develop capacity of multi -task at HLC , converting it as the PUBLIC HEALTH ( PROMOTIVE& PREVENTIVE ) UNIT ofPHC curative services . All the said officers are housed under one unit to provide a comprehensive package of services to the patients and their relatives who will be called in to this unit according to a timeta ble and guide for a healthier lifestyle ( Inward patients with NCD will be discharged from ward ; only after counseling at the PUBLIC HEALTH UNIT of the PHC hospital National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 104 5.5.5 Development of a mechanism to evaluate the performance of PHC hospitals ; - Link to policy on health safety and quality , and the manuals prepared by HQ secretariat ( Each section of PHC hospital eg ; - wards ,labor room, dispensary , etc to be evaluated by using check lists 5.5.6 Improve facilities of OPD of PHC hospital accordin g to standards of OPD of Apex hospitals eg; - seating facilities , ventilation ,drinking water etc. 5.5.7 Non availability of health facilities at distant places can be addressed through the concept of PURA = providing urban facilities to rural areas ; ie ;- a PMCU can be established for each 10,000 population Eg;- World bank funded PMCU at WERAGAMA in Rathnapura District Monitoring & Evaluation Implementation and monitoring Strategic Area Implementation of activity Monitoring Restructur ing of PHC hospitals to manage the Burden of NCD Pilot study in Divisional hospitals at three different settings ; - Urban/Rural/Estate A separate Bureau is to be established to monitor the activities of subjects mentioned in this document Referral system of PHC hospitals Shared care cluster system - pilot study is conducted by PCS & OD units at four RDHS divisions Vauniya, Rathnapura, Puttalam , Anuradhapura Improving In patient facilities (a) A study on Distribution and National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 105 availability of Cardiovascular drugs was conducted at RDHS division Kalutara& NIHS region (b) Action to be initiated by PCS , PDDHS , and RDDHS Rannan -eliya,R.

In addition it is the sole supplier of Dangerous and Narcotic Drugs to the private sector. Currently The Medical Supplies Division is managed by the Director (Medical supplies) who is directly responsible to Deputy Director General (Laboratory services). Director 9Medical Supplies) is the accounting office r for about one third of the National Health Budget and is responsible for managing a Human Resource Cadre of more than 500. There are around 30 central warehouses in 6 different locations in the country under his purview. In addition he has to supervise a nd coordinate the functions of 26 Regional Medical supplies Divisions in each District with the provincial management. As these supplies are coming through a multi stakeholder supply chain he must monitor and manage the supply chain carefully. There must b e a proper and smooth coordination with state Pharmaceutical Corporation, National Drug Quality Assurance Laboratory and cosmetics Drugs Devices Regulatory Authority, import National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 107 controller, customs, local agents, manufacturers, heads of institutions and end us ers. As the operational processes of this supply chain is more comprehensive medical Supplies Management Information system has been developed and introduces addressing all the complex situations. Director (Medical Supplies) also contributes to achieve th e objectives of the National Drug policy by introducing and monitoring rational use of medicines, adhering to Essential Medicine List and establishment and adherence to standard treatment protocols and guidelines. One of the major duties of the director ( Medical Supplies) is the selection of the most appropriate items into the formula of the Medical Supplies Division for supplying to state sector health institutions. This has to be done in a more professional and tactful way by getting the fullest commitme nt and corporation of the professional bodies at least once in three years. To maintain an uninterrupted supply throughout the year Director (Medical Supplies) has to do emergency purchases from the highly competitive market while minimizing malpractices and corruptions using his knowledge and experience on public procurement and contract administration procedures. Justification: Considering all the above responsibilities of Director (Medical Supplies), it is proposed that the post of Director (Medical Supplies) to be upgraded as a Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies) with adequate authority while attending to the same operations in the same institute. Also it is proposed to include Director (National Drug Quality Assurance Laboratory) in to the pu rview of Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies). Under the Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies), there will be two Directors (Senior Medical Administrative Grade) responsible for pharmaceuticals and surgical items respectively. In addition there will be two Accountants and ten assistant Directors relevant sections. The responsibilities of the Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies) will be; 1. Overall supervision of all the functions of the Medical Supplies Division 2. Supervision of the supply o f medical supplies in all state sector health institutions in Sri Lanka. 3. Accounting officer for the total budget of Medical supplies (which is around one third of the total National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 108 Health Budget) 4. Promoting and monitoring rational use of medicines and adhering to the Essential Medicines List through Drug and Therapeutic Committees in the institutions all over the country. 5. Coordinating all the stake holders in the supply chain such as state pharmaceutical corporation, state pharmaceutical Manufacturing corporation, NDQAL, cosmetic Devices and Drugs Regulating Authority, Customs, Department of Import control, local and foreign manufacturers and local agents. 6. Filling up the supply gaps through local purchases in an economical manner. The cabinet of Ministers has pr eviously approved similar upgrading of the post of Mr. J.L.M.K. Jayathilake who was the Director (Bio Medical Engineering Services) to Deputy Director General (Bio Medical Engineering Services) and Dr. Hector Weerasinghe who was the Director National Hospi tal of Sri Lanka to the Deputy Director General Grade, by upgrading two institutions. Recommendations I seek approval from the cabinet of Ministers: - 1. To upgrade the post of Director (Medical Supplies) as the Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies) 2. For the creation of two new Directorates in the Medical Supplies Division for Senior Administration Grade Medical officers under the Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies) and to include Director (National Drug quality Assurance Laboratory) to the purvie w of Deputy Director General (Medical Supplies).

Environment where human beings and animal live has major impact on their wellbeing. It is estimated that twenty five percent of human health issues are due to environmental factors. Among the diseases large number of communicable disease are food or waterborne. Vectors of communicable diseases are also li ve and thrive in the environment. Environmental causes contribute to the spread of diseases, through vectors. Large proportions of non- communicable diseases like cancers, kidney diseases, lung disease neurological diseases are also caused by environmental factors. Protection of environment from air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, sound pollution and visual pollution is not only important for the wellbeing of present generation but future generations too. Growing health sector is facing with eve r increasing health care waste management issues and ministry of health has to find solutions for those issues also. Availability of safe food to the general public will not only safeguard them from food borne illnesses but ensure healthier nation with opt imal nutrition. Sri Lanka has a workforce around nine million at present out of which around 60% belong to the informal sector. the ministry of health is responsible for looking after the health of the workers. Since healthcare in the government sector is provided free of charge, decreasing the number of occupational injuries and diseases will save millions of rupees from the health budget in addition to savings of out of pocket expenditure by the victims and lost opportunity National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 110 costs. On the other hand, havi ng a healthy workforce is an asset to the nation in the expected economic growth. National Occupational safety and Health policy had been approved by the cabinet in 2014. Ministry of health has been identified as joint key holder with the ministry of labo ur as the ministry of health is providing preventive, curative and rehabilitative services to all workers in Sri Lanka. Implementation of the activities recognized in the National Occupational safety and Health policy is also national requirement. At prese nt all above subjects are managed by a Director environmental Health and Occupational Health without adequate financial, human, and other resources. Therefore directorate is not in a position to handle the tasks mentioned above. The present food control un it is headed by an assistant director. In addition a technical capacity of the unit is also insufficient to face present and future challenges. Justification Public health services need to be strengthened to address the present environmental and occupa tional health services. Provision of preventive care services is a responsibility of the government. Introduction of new policies, policy instruments, strategic planning and implementation of identified public health interventions are required to achieve o ptimal public health situation. Such activities need sufficient financial allocation and by creating separate Deputy Director General position, ear marked allocation can be made. Monetary allocations to public services need to be monitoring and evaluation of the social and health impact of the policies and new interventions are necessary. Further improvement of the public health services, by planning, research and development need to be carried out. Development of occupational health services according to t he national policy is a priority. In the above context ministry of health has identified the necessity of reorganization of the managerial functions of the public health services to achieve the said objectives. It is proposed to upgrade the present environ mental and occupational health unit by appointing New Deputy Director General in charge of the unit. National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 111 Following new positions are proposed. 1. Deputy Director General (Environmental and Occupational Health and Food safety) 2. Two Assistant Director posts and 3. Two Food Safety Officers 4. Two public management assistants The presently existing posts of Director Environmental and occupational Health, Director Food safety, Deputy Director Environmental and Occupational Health will be incorporated in to the propose d unit under Deputy Director General (Environmental and Occupational health and food safety) according to the annexed organization chart. Terms of reference of the proposed Deputy Director General (Environmental Occupational health and food safety) 1. Report to the Director General of Health services. 2. Provide Technical, Managerial leadership in Environmental Health, Occupational Health and Food safety issues. 3. Provide advocacy to the other units of the ministry of health, other institutions and ministries of the government on Environmental Health, Occupational Health and Food safety issues. 4. Represent ministry of health in environmental Health, Occupational Health and Food safety issues. 5. Identify priority Environmental Health, Occupational Health and Food Safety issues and propose policy directions and develop strategic plans to address such issues. 6. Supervise, monitor and evaluate and follow -up work plans of submits under the directorate. Recommendations 1.

MRI - Nutrition research 4. Nutrition related areas not covered by the above units. GAP ANALYSIS by using UHC tool ( Text obtained from the publication of Government Medical Officer' s Association ( No G MOA/SH/2014/69 dated 23 May 2014 ) Titled - proposal to establish the nutrition service in the Health system of Sri Lan ka ) Low and middle income countries such as Sri Lanka are currently experiencing a double burden of disease. Malnutrition and infections constitute one end of the disease burden, while non - communicable diseases such as Diabetes, Cardio vascular diseases constitute the growing burden of diseases among adults and elderly. (1). both burdens can be effectively addressed by appropriate nutrition interventions both curative and preventive sectors. Importance of dietary therapy in disease was addressed at ancient times by ancient Ayurveda therapy. Currently it is being replaced by modern nutrition therapy in allopathic medicine. It extends far more beyond than provision of a \"diet\" to a patient. The wide spectrum of nutritional interventions range from advises on health living to providing nutrition therapy to overcome from infectious diseases (2). Clinical nutrition was recognized as a sub specialty in allopathic National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 114 medicine in 1979. (3) In comparison to other sectors, Sri Lankan health sector has greatly improve d over past few decades providing our patients with best evidence based care. However for the past 35 years we have failed to introduce the specialty of clinical nutrition, which would have been contributed to optimum patient management for a long time. Multi-disciplinary approach is recommended in providing patient centered care for diabetic and other non -communicable diseases (4). Currently Sri Lankan health sector experience a large number of patients with non -communicable diseases both as in hospitals and in the community. 95) Providing them with optimum care becomes a difficult challenge if adequate specialists in relevant fields are not available. Nutrition clinic is a facility which can provide care for diagnosed patients with many disorders and to many health seeking individuals with many risk factors. It is capable of providing individual dietary assessments and make dietary and nutritional prescriptions for individuals. But it requires trained medical nutritionists for its functioning in full capa bilities. Conducting medical research on nutrition and providing guidance for policy making in nutrition is also necessary. The growing body of nutrition research needs to be reviewed at national level and guide the policy makers in accordance. Curren t Health System in Sri Lanka There are multiple gaps in service provision in clinical nutrition in current hospital setting. 1. There are multiple institutions and committees work in improving the nutritional status of the community, but curative aspects in human nutrition is totally overlooked. 2. Nutrition in curative sector depends on a dietician who is trained on food technology, dietary aspects of food but not on human nutrition which is a medical specialty. As a result patients suffer with inaccurate die tary instructions and prolonged hospital stay. 3. Many medical disorders has dietary therapy and nutritional interventions as a component in non - pharmacological management of the disease (ref - national guidelines) We are unable to provide a total comprehens ive patient oriented care in those burden of inappropriate care contributes on the cost of the health sector both directly and indirectly. 4. There are patient groups such as ICU patients, cancer patients, renal patients and surgical patients who require special nutritional care. Currently their nutrition is being looked after by other specialists. But there is a great need of medical nutritionists to take over the nutritional aspects of those patients. 5. Evidence based medicine on clinical nutrition hardly National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 115 reaches the clinical practice due to lack of specialists in human nutrition. 6. Nutrition clinics currently operated at some hospitals lack human resources, appropriate training and dietary prescriptions are not made. Ultimately the facility which can contribu te immensely to the community is highly under -utilized.

GIS is increasingly used in health sectors in developed countries. This will help in many areas such as disease mapping, disaster management, epidemiologic al trend analysis, information sharing etc. Public health is an area where GIS can be applied in decision making to give maximum output with limited resources. Data sharing through web GIS is another area need to be developed in Sri Lanka. Currently applic ation of GIS using e software is limited and not sustainable. Issues identified 1. Knowledge on GIS software among health staff is very limited 2. Application of GIS software in health system is limited 3. Training opportunities in GIS is limited in Health se ctor 4. GIS licensed software is expensive therefore usage is limited 5. No proper GIS training module for health sector is available yet 6. Web GIS is limited in Sri Lanka Target areas and beneficiaries Public health programmes related to environment impact Disaster management Shared care cluster system Justification GIS has to be incorporated into health sector in large scale. But trained staff with GIS software manipulation is very limited in health sector in Sri Lanka. Therefore systematic approach should be implemented to capacity building of health staff in GIS.

This type of care is best known to save healthcare costs, control access to secondary care services, tailor services to local population needs and help patients make use of an increasingly complex healthcare system. According to the Annual Health Bulletin 2012, over 100 million consultations take place as out patients every year .Majority of these consultations are carried out at primary level both in the private and state sect or. Services that were traditionally provided in a secondary care setting are also moving closer to home into the community. We have a fast growing ageing population with multiple health problems. There are also increasing financial constraints specially for the majority poor .Cost -effective, integrated care is an answer to these problems. Family practice is a unique specialty with its own characteristics. Its foundation is based on basic principles such as first contact care, personalized and family car e, continuation of care, comprehensive care, coordination of care, and preventive care. It aims to provide first contact patient centered care, irrespective of age, gender, illness or disease on a continued basis for patients and families. Correct applicat ion of this concept to our resource poor out -patient settings will benefit the patients as well as the state. It is this approach which is adapted in developed countries to achieve universal health coverage. Majority of the problems that we in Sri Lanka fac e at present could be managed efficiently and cost effectively at primary level if the doctors who deliver primary care are trained in this approach as well as they are given opportunities to update themselves in clinical medicine National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 128 GAP ANALYSIS by usin g UHC tool Target areas and beneficiaries 1. Organized outpatient services will minimize patient waiting time, unnecessary admissions, drug wastage and proper utilization of laboratory facilities. 2. This system will provide opportunistic and population leve l screening of NCD and proper utilization and management of resources. 3. This System will also provide an organized referral system. 4. Electronic Medical Record (EMR) - Will ensure establishment of a health information system. It will help the clinician to retrieve data quickly and enable proper patient management, appropriate referral, avoid unnecessary admissions, efficient prescription of drugs and minimize wastage of resources and duplication. 5. EMR will facilitate continuity of care of patients and famili es and also enable follow -up and screening of NCDs and patients with chronic diseases. 6. Giving personalized care will improve patient satisfaction and compliance with health promotive disease preventive strategies at primary secondary and tertiary levels o f prevention 7. Each person will have a physician accountable for his/her health. Continuity of long term care will be established. and there will be a doctor to whom secondary and tertiary care referrals can be made 8. Ageing Population will be better looke d after with provision of home visits 9. More people will utilize facilities at primary care level and decrease over crowding of facilities at 2ry and 3ry care level 10. Universal health coverage will no more be a dream Justification The burden of Non Co mmunicable Diseases (NCDs) which require care for long periods or even throughout life is increasing in the country. The demographic transition projects an increasing population of the elderly with multiple diseases .These diseases are best managed through out patient consultations . According to the latest data available, there were 50.6 million primary care (first contact) consultations at the Outpatient Department (OPD) of the public sector hospitals while only 5.8 National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 129 million patients were given inward care (Annual Health Bulletin 2012). This shows the magnitude of the outpatient services rendered by the public sector throughout patient departments. These consultations are carried out by doctors without spe cialty training in primary care . This vital compone nt of patient care services and the vast potential in primary care has not been recognized and measures have not been adopted to upgrade it to its maximum capacity in the Sri Lankan health sector. The need of a strong primary care system has been long understood by the developed world. Presently these countries have a systematic well developed primary care system which is a pivotal component in their health care service. Patient record keeping, research and teaching are essential components in the developm ent of Primary Care which is presently lacking in state outpatient settings. Important Assumptions/Risks/Conditions There are Hospitals with different facilities and different cadre positions for Medical officers and specialists . Services are fragmented and episodic. Out of pocket expenditure for the patient is a known component of the system even though the health services are free of charge. There is no proper forward or back referral system and patients refer themselves to health care facilities There is no doctor accountable for the health of a given patient or to monitor one long term We still run on a clinic system which are highly congested and only drugs are repeated The smaller hospitals are grossly underutilized and larger hospitals are ove rcrowded. Our Doctors are still some of the best trained in the Region if not in the World. Majority deliver primary care but have no access to post graduate training and little recognition for the work they do. The PGIM has a training programme to boa rd certify specialists in Family Medicine. In the next ten years we envisage a minimum of 35 doctors who will be specialists, at least 500 diplomats .CGPSL will also train at least 350 doctors at Diploma level. College will train more if given the infrast ructure and funds. Every year a minimum of 1200 doctors are registered by the SLMC . These doctors are registered to provide unsupervised primary care without any further post graduate training. Vision Our vision is to develop a strong primary led pati ent care services in the country where every citizen has access to a family doctor. Mission Our mission is to achieve as far as possible universal health coverage for all citizens of Sri Lanka with doctors trained in the family practice approach working i n state and private sector providing accessible cost effective quality primary care services to all citizens of Sri Lanka. Goal To provide Comprehensive care, continuity of care, coordination of care, a patient centered personalized approach, health National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 130 promotion and disease prevention practiced for a cohort of patients who wish to register at this family medical unit.

While one institution facing a shortage of medicines, other institutions may have excess of stocks of the same drug leading to destroy excess stocks after passing the expiry date. Rational use of drugs may have econ omic savings without affecting patients. Ministry of Health has taken various steps to overcome institution drug shortages. RDHSs can play a key role in ensuring essential medicines in health institutions under their purview. Issues identified 7. Frequent shortage of some medicines 8. Excess of stocks of some medicine 9. No proper mechanism to interchanging of medicines between institutions in the same RDHS region 10. System of failure in reporting about stock positions 11. No accepted methodology to compare overall ava ilability of medicines between health institutions in district. Target areas and beneficiaries Target area - Medicines availability in Health institutions in RDHS region Beneficiaries - Patients attending government health institutions Justification A methodology is required for RDHS to monitor the availability and adequacy of medicines in health institutions under their purview. This will help to overcome shortage as well as wastage of medicines. Methodology Drugs Adequacy Index (DAI) Balance stoc k of a drug at the end of a month DAI = Average monthly consumption during last 3 months If DAI < 1 stocks Inadequate DAI 1 -3May adequate up to next 3 months DAI 4 - 6 Risk of overstock DAI > 6 Overstock Drugs with DAI < 1 are at risk of a shortage of that drug with in the same month if actions not taken. Institutions with DAI > 6 of the same drug may request to shift their excess stocks to institutions with DAI <1 to National Health Strategic Master Plan 2016 - 2025 ( Health Administration & HRH ) Ministry of Health - Sri Lanka Page 135 overcome possible shortage. Institutions should send month ly return of DAI of each medicine use in their institutions to the Divisional Pharmacist. Divisional Pharmacist should maintain computational data base (excel sheet) to summarize the ADIs of the district in each month (A colour code may use for easy identi fication) This summary sheet can be used to advise RMSD to shift drugs between institutions to avoid shortage and wastage of drugs.
