Irregularities in the circulation of qi leads to pain and disease. Treatment of disease with acupuncture is accomplished through the insertion of acupuncture needles into specific locations on the body. Through an understanding of the circulation of the body's qi, an acupuncturist can select those locations that will best regulate the circulation of qi and promote health. Acupuncture treatments usually last one hour. The needles are very thin (about eight times thinner than a hypodermic syringe) and are only used once. Most people describe the treatments as painless and relaxing. It is not uncommon for people to fall asleep during a treatment. Treatment of most conditions usually begins with two treatments per week until the symptoms are regulated and are then decreased as the person's health is reestablished. Acupuncture is also frequently used to prevent illness and maintain overall health and well being, especially during periods of high stress. Massage Therapy [Read More](3-description) Therapeutic massage is an age-old remedy and health practice. It can be found in all major civilizations throughout history and present day.

Meridian Stress Analysis [Read More](9-description) Meridian Stress Analysis (MSA) is a form of functional medicine that detects energetic and regulatory disturbances. It can provide a comprehensive evaluation of your energetic health and balance. MSA is based on the Chinese meridian systems, and involves measuring electrical conductivity at meridian points that correspond to those of acupuncture points. It is administered as a microamp current that is sent through the body's meridian pathways and is captured through data access points on the hands. It is painless and noninvasive. Chinese Medicine [Read More](2-description) Herbal Medicine is the Chinese equivalent to Western pharmacology. In accordance with diagnosis by a Licensed Acupuncturist, an herbal prescription in the form of a tea, pill, tincture, or externally applied powder, soak, or steam can be prescribed. The formula may contain anywhere from one to twenty different medicinal substances from plants, minerals, or animals. The most common form of prescription is a tea. Herbal medicine can be used as a stand-alone therapy, although it is quite common to give a prescription in conjunction with acupuncture treatments. The formula can be seen as a way of amplifying the effects of acupuncture and continuing the treatments at home. Unlike Western pharmacology, Chinese herbal medicine uses customized prescriptions for each individual to minimize or eliminate potential side effects. Many herbal medicines are also foods and can be incorporated into the diet as a form of continuing therapy. Food therapy can be a powerful tool, especially when treating people who are already taking many different medications. Posture Alignment Therapy [Read More](10-description) WE ARE EGOSCUE CERTIFIED Both chronic and acute pain is due to misalignment in the body as it loses its designed posture. Egoscue analyzes your posture using a uniquely designed software, alleviates pain, and returns you back to an active, pain-free lifestyle. HOW DOES IT WORK? Egoscue uses a series of gentle exercises and stretches to return musculoskeletal balance and symmetry to your body. If your body has lost its designed posture, it's because muscles have moved your bones into a new, dysfunctional position. Pain is the body's way of alerting you to the fact that your body isn't aligned\u2014and therefore isn't moving\u2014properly. Through Posture Alignment Therapy, your muscles will be reeducated and reminded how they need to function in order to maintain proper alignment. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR ME TO SEE RESULTS AND FEEL BETTER? All clients respond differently and on different timelines. However, the vast majority feel different after their first visit. The body has an amazing ability to heal itself; you just have to give it a chance. Posture Alignment Therapy is a process, but one with a remarkable 94 percent success rate since its inception in the 1970s.
