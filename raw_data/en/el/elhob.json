Cendan, MD Subject: FIU Associate Dean for Student Affairs Position Date: August 2, 2020 Dear search committee members, I respectfully submit my dossier for your consideration in your search for the next Associate Dean/ Executive Associate Dean for Student Affairs at the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine. I have been a founding member at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine (UCF-COM) and feel a strong kinship with your program. As mil- lennial and multicultural colleges of medicine developing in large metropolitan areas, we have traveled lock-step through a number of our most exciting milestones. From con- versations I have had with Dean Robert Sackstein I know that we have also encountered similar challenges ranging from clinical placements, to coordination of student require- ments across a range of partnership sites. Our faculty and staff have done yeoman's work to coordinate all of these activities as our students have engaged with the complexities of the programs. I have carefully reviewed the job description and believe that my preparation, skills and behaviors align well with desired qualications that you seek in this leader. My efforts in educational scholarship have been recognized with national and international awards (AAMC, AMEE), national extramural funding (NIH-R01, NSF, Macy Foundation) and par- ticipation in a variety of national organizations (NIH, USMLE, AAMC/SGEA). I have had numerous college of medicine (COM) and university (UCF/UF) administrative roles in- cluding that of assistant dean for simulation and clinical skills and director of the skills lab (10 years between UCF and UF); medical education department chairman (6 years); and voting member of the college Enterprise Leadership Council (UCF-COM central decision- making body). I am deeply committed to personal professional development and recently completed Cornell University Executive Healthcare Leadership and Healthcare Change Management Certicate programs. At the university level I have served as a university provost fellow 1 Page 34 of 402working closely with UCF's Provost and President developing the structure and model for UCF's Academic Health Sciences Center (AHSC). I then served for two years as vice- President of the AHSC. Regionally I led the effort to bring the SGEA/AAMC meeting to Orlando in 2019 with co-sponsorship from all Florida Colleges of Medicine. Opportunities for collaborating across became evident at this event leading to the creation of the Florida Council of Medical Schools Deans Undergraduate Medical Education (UME) Working Group, a group which I co-chair. The work of this group has led to ve Florida Colleges of Medicine (FIU included) now sharing an online publication platform on Cureus.com, numerous scholarly collaborations, as well as active exploration of solutions to UME chal- lenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. I fully appreciate the challenges of a new medical school with a nascent clinical pro- gram that is not ready to nancially support the educational mission. I have trained for and understand best-practices for strategic planning and have been directly involved in the budgeting process of the COM as a member of the subgroup that manages all education and general funds (EG). This body reconciles not just the budget of the MD educational program but also the budget related to our clinical enterprise, our research and basic sci- ence units, and the GME program ( $100M recurrent). Mentorship of faculty has been a central responsibility for me and as the department chairman I have realigned our annual review and our promotion and tenure guidelines to reflect and recognize the work of the MD program faculty. It is worth noting that I focus a lot of attention on the student's evaluation of faculty teaching and have successfully men- tored a number of faculty members towards more effective engagement with our students, resulting in statistical improvement in evaluation outcomes. Mentorship, and in particular mentorship and education of medical students, is what started me on an academic trajectory. Immediately after surgical residency I had a brief hiatus in surgical private practice yet I remained a member of the UF admissions com- mittee during that spell. The experience of those four years provides me with real-world insights into the challenges faced by our community physicians in their daily work. When I returned to the university setting, I was selected as surgery clerkship director. The med- ical directorship of the clinical skills and simulation center followed. I have been the sole surgeon mentoring and writing reference letters for surgery-bound students at UCF for a decade. Students and faculty members seeking a mentor nd in me a fair and honest sounding board; I hold myself and others to high standards. While I rely on metrics and data, I am also sensitive to context, stressors and the impacts of the real world. Many of my publications involve students as co-authors or as the focus of the research. Two worth mentioning were published in Academic Medicine and directly link to student progress and development. The rst of these is an innovative mathematical model for identication of students at risk for failure to progress; this has now been replicated in several other medical colleges and is being used to focus resources on struggling students. The other project is centered on the idea of student identity formation and professional- ism involving the use of a mobile application for recording professionalism-related events. 2 Page 35 of 402These projects were recognized with awards nationally and internationally. I have also served on the committee that oversees student progress and promotions. I have served as an LCME accreditation site visitor at four different medical colleges and am deeply fa- miliar with the standards: The work associated with the student dean role are central to Standards 3 (learning environment), 10 (selection, assignment and progress), 11 (academic support and advising) and 12 (health services and counseling) while also overlapping with a number of other Standards. FIU is a Hispanic Serving institution. I do believe that our Colleges of Medicine should make every effort to reflect the community they serve. I am very proud to be a fully bilingual Cuban immigrant who navigated Miami-Dade public schools. I had the honor to serve as the American College of Surgeons' inaugural Committee on Diversity Issues Chairman. I am currently leading the search at UCF for a new dean of diversity and in- clusion and deeply believe in the potential of all students, staff and faculty. The Dean of Students can play a signicant role in creating an environment that contributes to the greater goal of equity for all. I would be remiss to not mention that much of the work we do with students is also great fun! For example, I have greatly enjoyed serving as the faculty sponsor of our arts in medicine group (talent shows, publications) and supporting student-run international interprofessional experiences - these are, indeed, some of my fondest memories. I hope that that I was able to share my experiences, enthusiasm and interest for this work with you and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I may be able to serve FIU in this position. 3 Page 36 of 402 This page intentionally left blank curriculum vitae J.C.

We will focus on analyzing high-throughput sequencing data although the tools we will learn are applicable to a wide range of modern biological questions. Specific topics include operating in a UNIX/bash shell environment, scripting, genome assembly, alignment, and algorithms. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.\" Introduction to Bioinformatics requires one formative and one summative writing assignment and satisfies the writing or 'W' requirement for Biological Sciences majors at the University of Alabama. Computational Biology Lab Undergraduate section BSC 426 (enrollment 15-30 students per term) Graduate section BSC 526 (enrollment 5-15 students per term) From the University of Alabama course catalog: \"Computational Biology Lab introduces the programming skills, statistical methods and conceptual foundations necessary to pursue computational analysis and modeling of biological systems. This course is designed for biology students, and it is not expected that students will have prior with experience with computing or programming.\" Computational Biology Lab is a hands-on class involving a combination of lectures and laboratory activities.

Introduction The FIU Program of Distinction on Environmental Resilience is aimed at supporting the Board of Governors Strategic Plan and FIU's 2025 Strategic Plan of achieving exceptional student -centered learning and graduate success, producing meaningful research and creati ve activities, and leading transformative innovation. In addition, this proposal directly addresses recommendations from both the Florida Council of 100's Project Sunrise r eport and the Chamber of Commerce 2030 report. Specifically, this proposal wil l create a \"Strong Florida\" through the creation of policies and projects that improve the health of Florida's cities and communities , and through a future workforce able to communicate across disciplines and implement convergent r esearch approaches. This budget request addresses two pillars of FIU's strategic framework: 1) Accelerate Preeminence & Research and Innovation Impact, and 2) Amplify Learner Success & Institutional Affinity. Th e Environmental Resilience program concentrates collaboration across several of FIU's Preeminent research centers that have gained distinction through State and Federal investments in the recruitme nt of nationally recognized faculty. These University (s): Florida International University Request Title: FIU Program of Distinction on Environmental Resilience Date Request Approved by University Board of Trustees: Expected September 2021 Recurring Funds Requested: $15,150,000 Non -Recurring Funds Requested: Total Funds Requested: check the request type below: Shared Services/System -Wide Request Unique Request Page 142 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR centers and programs, which have secured over $400M in research awards over the last 10 years , include the Institute of Environment, the Extreme Events Institute, the Institute for Resilient and Sustainable C oastal Infrastructure (InteRaCt), the Brain, Behavior and the Environment Program, and the Center for Children and Families (CCF). FIU's leadership in environmental research and public health grew out of FIU's distinctive geographi c location, diverse population and vulnerable South Florida ecosystem. From FIU's inception, faculty have focused on environmental research because of the Everglades, the Florida Keys, the coastal regions such as Florida and Biscayne Bays, an d our hurricane vulnerabilities. Similarly, the size, heterogeneity and complexity of South Florida's population have attracted world class faculty to FIU to study the region's unique public health challenges. The FIU Program of D istinction on Environmental Resilience is designed to advance our current research programs and lead to innovative solutions for enhancing local, regional, and national resilience to environmental change, including preparing the workforce needed to address these challenges. It will also raise FIU's academic standing by leveraging existing programs of national preeminence to generate new knowledge and innovative solutions for the betterment of the environment, health, and society. This will solidify FIU's ro le as a top urban public research university and leader in environmental resilience and solutions. If funded, this proposal for the Program of Distinction will enable FIU to further attract and retain the best, most productive faculty , cultivate future leaders , and nurtur e all students, post -doctoral s cholars, researchers, and staff to excel. The metrics measuring program success will be as follows: At least one metric must demonstrate a year -one accomplishment or success. o Buoy Design and Construct ion for water monitoring by the end of the first year and deployment on the second year. o Initial mapping of coastal water monitoring needs. o Development of storm -related prevention workshops during the first six months of the year. o Within the first year of funding, the Environmental Resilience program will submit at least one student training grant application to the NIH or NSF to financially support students being trained in the program. o Within the first year of funding, the Environmental Resilience program will submit a NIH Core Center of Excellence (P30) grant application to National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) focusing on addressing the impact of environmental factors on brain health.

B. Creating Unique, Interdisciplinary Approaches to Florida's Environmental Resilience This Program of Distinction addresses important environmental challenges: (1) Enhanced Water Quality Monitoring for Coastal Health and Resilience, (2) Environmental Forensics and Public Health, (3) Environmental Finance and Risk Management, (4) Family Preparation and Resilience to Disasters. 1. Enhanced Water Quality Monitoring for Coastal Health and Resilience Tourism is an important component of Florida's economy, much of which is focused on Florida's more than 600 miles of coastline. These world -renowned economic assets are vulnerable to a myriad of environmental and human- driven challenges, e.g., harmful algal blooms (HAB) , which create health risks and had significant negative impacts of up to $130 million on tourism as reported by the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council in Page 144 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR 2018. Most recently, we have observed first -hand our near -shore Bay assets, such as Biscayne Bay , as they continue to deteriorate due to infrastructure failures as well as declining water quality. It is imperative that we establish state- of-the-art water quality mo nitoring throughout our southern coastlines as well as in the interior freshwater bodies that transport pollutants to the coastline. Through FIU's Center of Excellence in Aquatic Chemistry and Environment (described below), we are developing those necessar y tools to provide the real-time data needed to make predictions regarding harmful algal blooms, fish kill events , and water quality deterioration. In this initiative, we propose to acquire and employ a real -time, distributed sensing platform to measure and predict the occurrence of water quality and infrastructure issues and their likely severity and impacts on coastal ecosystems. In order to improve ecological models that predict the presence and locations of harmful coastal inputs, F IU seeks to understand the factors driving coastal water quality collapse. To model the timing and spatial distribution of contaminants and pollutant inputs and water quality issues, FIU must be able to simultaneously measure climate (air temperature, lig ht, windspeed and direction), aquatic environmental drivers (temperature, light, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, pCO2, conductivity), biotic responses , and current/flow profi les (3 -dimensional current velocity and direction, wave direction). This requires the design, development , and deployment of a sophisticated water quality buoy platform that simultaneously measures the biological and physical variables associated with poor water quality and the development of HABs , as well as other water quality -induced phenomena such as fish kill events. We will also develop sensing techniques specific for brevotoxins, which are known to be harmful to humans. To fully utilize the data, FIU will develop and maintain a near -real-time database for both Biscayne and Florida Bays, and the Flor ida Keys built on our 20- year record of data collected along a series of monitoring stations. In addition to a spatially explicit database, computer scientists in our CREST Center (described below) are developing computer algorithms to search other existin g city, county, and state datasets such as those at Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), Miami Dade County, etc. , to harvest existing data and more fully populate the FIU database with anci llary information. It is important to note that while it is imperative to be able to predict where and when nuisance algal blooms will occur to prevent human health issues, it is equally important to be able to predict where coastlines are free of such events and readily usable to the public and tourists. 2. Environmental Forensics and Public Health Environmental Forensics requires a cross disciplinary approach that encompasses the understanding of the sources of environmental contaminants, their transpor t through key ecosystems and their subsequent incorporation into humans and other fauna. The role of elements such as magnesium, calcium, zinc, or manganese in high concentrations are Page 145 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR now known to be involved in the onset and progression of chronic diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. This initiative will: (a) improve basic scientific understanding of global change and anthropogenic effects caused by multiple environmental drivers, the physical and biological responses measured in water quality, soil , and sediment contamination, emerging diseases, invasive species, and other global stressors that are a risk to ecosystems and community health \u2014filling the knowledge gap; (b) train students in the practices and uses of technologies needed to better understand risk assessment and mitigation with innovative solutions; and (c) provide state of the art facilities that can support faculty and student researchers at FIU and around the nation\u2014 to fill research gaps that now exist because the capabilities and instrumentation are not available. The team composition reflects the complex nature of the problem; toxic metals, for example, are affecting ecosystems like the Florida Everglades and its resources, inducing adverse outcomes pathways in marine organisms, influencing mental health of populations , and creating environmental inequalities in minority populations. Another area of concentration is the characterization of environmental materials for provenance discrimination and/ or geographic origin identification. 3. Environmental Finance and Risk Management FIU establish ed an Environmental Finance and Risk Management Program (\"Environmental Finance\") to provide useful data and sustainable environmental policies for government and the private sector. The goal of the program is to apply the most sophisticated financial modeling to the latest environmental data in real time , so that the market has an accurate picture of the environmental risks . A main focus of the program is to help ensure the proper operation of efficient markets within a sound public policy framework. For example, the programs help make sure that flood and hurricane insurance are priced correctl y, and t hat investments in mitigation and adaptation measures are accurately reflected in the price. By linking theories and modeling techniques of finance and environmental sciences via mathematics and data science, and then studying the practical applications of this to environment -linked securities, the Environmental Finance program will offer a first- of-its-kind academic model for assessing, managing, and reducing the most serious environmental risks facing Florida and the world. About the Program FIU's Environmental Finance program provides solutions to environmental challenges that require research from many different fields to address. This program include s researchers and faculty from engineering, finance, mathematics, data analytics, risk management, resilience, sustainability, environmental law and policy, and coupled systems. It will also emphasize environment al finance's relevance to a growing number of commercial and policy applications. This integrated, interdisciplinary program will prepare a generation of leaders with expertise in those disciplines to meet the gravest environmental challenges, a nd either find or create high paying careers. Page 146 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR The program uses a unique \"convergent\" research approach that combines financial engineering and environmental science. This integration of finance and environmental science can be achieved by ap plying advanced financial models to environmental data in real time, so that governments and markets can correctly \"price\" the full array of environmental risks. Without this quantitative approach, many of our most crucial resiliency strategies are a matter of specu lation with the potential for enormous social losses, whether risks are underestimated or overestimated, inflicting losses on taxpayers one way or the other. The Environmental Finance program is built like a pyramid, with research at the base, followed by education, stakeholder outreach , and solutions at the apex. Research. With a focus on environmental parameters as triggers for financial flows, EFRM's basic research will help governments and markets to assess and price environmental risks in real time on the basis of the latest data. These applica tions can help strengthen and advance virtually every area of sustainable finance, from disaster preparedness and resilience to climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability, through advanced financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds, we ather derivatives, index insurance, carbon emissions trading systems, debt -for-nature swaps, mitigation banking, green bonds, and ESG investments Education. The program will offer an undergraduate major, and graduate and professional certificates (a series of for -credit courses taken together to achieve a level of understanding and proficiency). Full master's and Ph.D . programs are being developed. The certificate programs will be taught in- person and fully online for working professionals. The certificates will also be made available to non-degree -seeking students from around the state, country, and internationally. Outreach. EFRM also has a robust program of community, state, and national outreach. Program researchers are working with government entities to increase awareness of regional resiliency efforts and are working with stakeholders to develop reports and recommendations for a coordinated regional strategy for addressing critical environmental challenges. Solutions. Building on those foundations, our program will craft innovative solutions to critical environmental problems that governments and the private sector need in order to prepare for future challenges. 4. Family Preparation and Resilience to Disasters Given increasing risk from severe weather and other shock events in Florida, preparing the state's most vulnerable populations is critical, in both pre - and post -impact periods. FIU's Center for Children and Families (CCF) and Extreme Events Institute (EEI)/International Hurricane Research Center (IHRC) are well positioned to address this critical challenge. The CCF -EEI/IHRC teams will coordinate to develop workshops focused on promoting storm - and shock- related media literacy for Floridians by helping families (a) make sense of met eorology reports, storm updates, and shock event coverage, (b) learn to distinguish actionable updates from more \"spectacle -focused\" coverage, and (c) appreciate the negative impacts that extensive media exposure can have on child and family functioning. P arents will receive coaching on how to talk to children across Page 147 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR different developmental levels about impending storms and shock events and about destruction and loss, and will be trained on how to identify signs of significant impact and adjustment difficulties in their children and themselves. In the context of shock or severe weather events, addressing emotions and preparation is not only critical from a public mental health perspective, but also from a public safety perspective . Resear ch documents how stress and irrational p ublic behavior constrain responsible decision -making and place Floridians at risk. During storm watches for example , masses of individuals not dwelling in evacuation zones make emotion -based decisions that contribute to pervasive traffic congestion/gridlock and widespread gas shortages that disrupt and prevent timely evacuation for those in mandatory evacuation zones and in immediate danger. Poor pre -season household preparation (e.g., stocking water, non- perishables, batteries, and other supplies) leads to abrupt supermarket shortages during individual storm watches that lead to additional unwarranted evacuations that burden the smooth and timely flow of evacuees from high-risk/mandatory evacuation regions. In fact, one of the leading reasons individuals in high- risk zones give for not choosing to evacuate is their concern that evacuation routes (and subsequent return routes) will be overcrowded and that they will not be able to access needed fuel along the way. Once the shock - and storm- related prevention workshops are developed, the CCF is well - poised to disseminate them to the rest of the State of Florida through multiple mechanisms. The CCF's annual Miami International Conference on Evidence- based Treatments for C hildhood and Adolescent Mental Health (MICAMH) can be used as a dissemination site as it is attended by mental health professionals from around the state. Further, the CCF has extensive experience disseminating information to health professionals throughout Florida and the U.S. through its decade -old website on Evidence -based Practices in Child Mental Health. Further, Dr. Jonathan Comer, a member of the CCF with expertise on the impact of disasters on child mental health , has developed procedures for modifying parenting programs to be delivered over the internet, and has shown that the impact is comparable to face -to-face trainings/sessions. Thus, the team will develop both face -to-face and web versions of shock - and storm -related prevention materials. The dissemination effort will also be facilitated through the extensive networks of FIU's Extreme Events Institute (EEI) and International Hurricane Research Center . C. Workforce of the Future The f uture workforce will need to be able to communicate across disciplines, implement convergent research approaches, and navigate the technological innovations of coming decades. Attracting and retaining top research faculty will provide our undergraduate and graduate students with exceptional preparation for innovatively solving the most critical environmental resilience challenges. In addition to traditional in -class and lab training, this proposal includes extensive fie ld opportunities and innovative workforce training components. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment Projections program highlights that future jobs will require degrees, credentials, and skills offered by trans - disciplinary programs, such as Environmental Risk Management, Engineering, Public Health , and Disaster Management. Page 148 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR Alongside the research programs mentioned above, we will develop the workforce needed to enhance environmental resilience locally and natio nally. A few specific programs to be added to our current offerings include: Certificate in Environmental Finance and Risk Management. As mentioned above, very few students or faculty have training in both finance and environmental science. This initiative will link our pre -eminent Institute of Environment with our nationally ranked programs in mathematics, statistics, finance, policy, law, business, and engineering to establish a graduate/professiona l certificate program in Environmental Finance, not only for our students but for professionals from around the country and the world who are working to solve the challenges of Environmental Resiliency. The overarching goal of the Certificate Program is to spur an understanding of how the modern global financial system interacts with multiple natural systems. Specific goals are to train future scientific, financial, and policy professionals in: The advanced quantitative skills required to understand, eva luate, and price modern financial instruments that are linked to environmental parameters. Such skills include scientifically based risk assessment, analytic techniques of mathematical finance, and computer -based simulation techniques. Key statistical methods and techniques for applying these methods to scientific and financial data. Key concepts of the role of finance as part of the dynamic coupled Earth Systems. Environmental Fellows pipeline and top student recruitment. The Environmental Fellows pipeline will be focused on the development and recruitment of top- qualified and diverse talent from South Florida schools . This will include high school teacher trainings, intense summer research experiences, guaranteed undergradu ate research placements and paid internships in the fields related to Environmental Resilience. Graduate student retention, doctoral student and postdoctoral fellow support. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows constitute a fundamental scientific workforce for research centers and research programs. FIU will provide financial support for recruitment and retention of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who will work with the faculty directly involved with these programs. Industry partners hips, trainings and certifications. This funding will support partnerships with industry in developing technological solutions to address environmental challenges and partnerships in workforce training. Artificial intelligence, robotics and financial man agement in industry competency for environmental resilience associated with the proposed Environmental Resilience program of distinction. Artificial Intelligence & Robotics. Automation and machine intelligence promise to fuel economic growth and produce new occupations, with likely impact on almost all industries and occupations. The broad-based application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to software and hardware systems is launching a significant leap forward, creating intelligent software applications and Page 149 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR robotic machines that learn from experience to make decisions and process vast amounts of data to reach independent conclusions. Therefore, we propose training in automation and robotic processes, in partnership with our Robotics Academy. To further d isseminate the findings, FIU will develop a series of professional development workshops that can be provided to stakeholders, policy makers , business , and government entities to explore new ways to link finance with environmental resilience.

FCE researchers study how hydrology, climate, and human activities affect ecosystem and population dynamics i n the ecotone Page 150 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR and more broadly, the Florida Coastal Everglades. FIU researchers working in the Everglades provided the data and water quality analyses that were used to set Florida's water quality criteria. The criteria for allowable phosphorus concentrations in freshwater are still in force and have significantly diminished the threat of catastrophic al gae bloom in the Everglades . The Southeast Environmental Research Center (SERC) Water Quality Monitoring Network. Operated by SERC, the function of the Network is to address regional water quality concerns that exist outside the boundaries of individual political entities. Funding for the Network has come from many different sources with individual programs being added as funding became av ailable. Field sampling occurs over different time periods due to the nature of the funding. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Southwest Florida Shelf are sampled quarterly. The data summary maps are produced on a quarterly basis by integr ating the individual projects into one data file for that month sampled. Previous surveys of Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay & Whitewater Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, and Marco -Pine Island Sound were sampled monthly. The Center for Coastal Oceans Research . The C enter consists of the Medina Aquarius Program, the world's only permanent undersea research laboratory, and partners with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and the Rookery Bay Research Reserve.

The CCF conducts a nationally prominent annual conference, the Miami International Conference on Evidence -based Treatment s for Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health (MICAMH), that is attended by more than 500 mental health professionals throughout Florida. E. Funding Categories (excluding Personnel listed in Section III) Faculty Research Grant Support ($600,000) The growth of the program of distinction in terms of obtaining external research funding and quickly moving the research finding into technica l applications and programmatic applications will depend on the recruitment of staff. Staff will be essential in providing the necessary administrative support, and perhaps more importantly , support in the pursuit of funding for the basi c and translational research that will be conducted. Recruitment Scholarships and Retention/Completion Grants ($1,500,000) This funding will expand the merit scholarship budget towards the goal of improving the incoming student profile in the discipline s associated with the Environmental Resilience program of distinction, as well as retaining and accelerating the graduation rates of students. These funds also support students who face unexpected emergencies and financial circumstances that impact their a bility to remain enrolled. Industry Partnerships for Economic Growth/Workforce Development in Environmental Resilience ($1,000,000) An important component of FIU's 2025 Next Horizon Strategic Plan is learner success through alignment with industry workforce needs. This funding will support partnerships with industry in developing technological solutions to address environmental challenges and partnerships in workforce training. Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Financial management in industry compet ency for Environmental Resilience associated with the proposed Environmental Resilience program of distinction. This will include: Identification and badging \"essential\" skills Identification and badging industry -recognized credentials throughout degree programs Alignment of essential skills to University Core Curriculum Development and/or alignment of continuing education for workforce development Page 153 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR Ongoing Support for Field Deployed Monitoring Equipment and Data Processing Technologies ($2,500,000) The funds will be used to establish and maintain world -class coastal monitoring systems and centralized data -processing to inform policy and decision -making. This dataset will be available to all researchers focused on enhancing the resil ience of Florida's coastal environment and the large populations living in near proximity. This program will require continuous upgrades and maintenance support to ensure it is well -positioned to help answer the critical questions facing Florida . II. Return on Investment - Describe the outcome(s) anticipated, dashboard indicator(s) to be improved, or return on investment. Be specific. For example, if this issue focuses on improving retention rates, indicate the current retention rate and the expected increase in the retention rate. Similarly, if the issue focuses on expanding access to academic programs or student services, indicate t he current and expected outcomes. University of Distinction proposals should also address the requirements outlined in the separate guidance document. Return on Investment will be measured through metrics listed earlier that are directly related to the impact of the Environmental Resilience program on specific areas of program focus, as well as on the overall impact on FIU's progression in student success and research excellence. Through the program's accomplishments, FIU will also contribute to the SUS goal of Florida continuing to lead in higher education across the nation. Competition for economic drivers such as corporations, business infrastructure , and research and development are estimated to only increase across the state , and we believe F IU's relative contributions to these SUS goals will help to retain existing and drive new business and industry to Florida. This request focuses on Accelerating Program of Distinction Research, Student Success and Innovation Impact. III. Personnel - Desc ribe personnel hiring and retention plan s, making sure to connect both plans to initiative(s) and goal(s) d escribed in section I. State the amoun t of faculty FTE and staff FTE and estimated funding amounts used for retention and new hires in each category . In describing faculty hires, provide overall hiring goals , including academic area(s) of expertise and anticipated hiring level ( e.g., assistant professor, associate professor, full professor. P lease describe how funds used for faculty or s taff retention will help the institution achieve its stated goals. University of Distinction proposals should clearly note how anticipated hires or retained individuals will help the institution elevate a program or area to national or state excellence. Faculty Recruitment/Teaching and Research ($7,000,000) Faculty are the main drivers of research and student success at a university. To expand the interdisciplinary research collaboration of the Environmental Resilience program of distinction, faculty recruitment will be essential. Following the successful approach that has brought FIU to the status of a Research I University, the faculty recruited into this core program of distinction will consist of clusters that will both complement and add to Page 154 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR the existi ng faculty; and will be world class in their achievements and potential. We will focus on expertise in the intersect of environmental factors and public health, and resilient infrastructures. We will recruit 3 members of the National Academies of Sciences, 21 senior level faculty and 16 mid- level faculty. The full impact of a program of distinction encompasses both research and teaching. Our goal is for the program to be a critical contributor to student success in all the areas (environment, infrastructure and public health) that are the interdisciplinary components of the program. Therefore, we will accelerate the recruitment of new faculty, with the recruitment focusing on curricular areas with highest demand within the integrated program. These new faculty members will focus on offering undergraduate lev el courses in various modalities to meet student demand and supply additional class sections required to ensure timely degree completion. Environmental Fellows Career Pipeline ($1,000,000) The Environmental Fellows pipeline will be focused on the devel opment and recruitment of top- qualified and diverse talent from South Florida schools. This will include high school teacher trainings, intense summer research experiences, guaranteed undergraduate research placements and paid internships in the fields rel ated to Environmental Resilience. Early engagement in research experiences leads to undergraduate student success, both in terms of early graduation and job placement success or continuation to post -graduate education. The Environmental programs at FIU already have recruitment and training connections with high schools and state colleges. This includes Research Assistantships for High School Students (RAHSS), as well as the Research Experience for Teachers (RET), and the Wind Engineering for Science Teachers (WEST) Workshop, which involves seasoned Miami -Dade County Public School (M -DCPS) teachers participating in a 6- week wind engineering research program. We will design an Environmental Academy pipeline by accelerating dual enrollment, providing High School students with summer research ba sics/fundamentals, and professional development for High School science teachers to strengthen the pipeline. This component of the program will also focus on establishing an early pipeline of State College students with interest in the fields of study associated with the program. FIU is already co -located with MDCPS's Marine Academy of Science and Technology (MAST) at its Biscayne Bay Campus. Doctoral Student Support ($800,000) FIU's doctoral degree production has increased by 15% (373 to 430) in the pa st three years, with increases in research doctorates by 28% (151 to 194). Research doctoral education is an integral part of research preeminence, and a necessary component of recruitment of world class faculty. We will dedicate some of the financial supp ort of doctoral students that will be part of the academic programs connected to the proposed program of distinction. This will support the continued success of these programs by being able to recruit the best and brightest doctoral student candidates. Since the research programs and institutes that are part of the proposed program of distinction receive significant external research grants and drive FIU's innovation, this investment will in turn increase external funding for doctoral students and amplify F IU's innovation impact. Page 155 of 402 2022- 2023 LBR Program of Distinction Postdoctoral Fellows ($750,000) Postdoctoral scholars constitute a fundamental scientific workforce for research centers and research programs. World Class faculty, when recruited, require postdoctoral support to back their research. Successful postdoctoral scholars conduct research, add to the research funding, and assist in the training of undergraduate and graduate students. IV.

Program Overview FIU's Strategic Degree Implementation Plan will transform and reengineer how strategic degrees in STEM and Health are taught and optimize d to increase retention, graduation rates, post degree marketability, career placement , and advancement or entrepreneurship. The FIU Strategic Degree Implementation Plan will: (1) integrate best practices and deploy state of the art evidence -based instruction and advanced classroom assessment throughout critical courses for all strategic majors; (2) implement interventions that promote mental health and wellness, especially for first generation and millennial students; (3) fu rther develop and refine best practices, assess and provide critical feedback to stakeholders , primarily aligning the curriculum with business and industry; and (4) leverage these initiatives to catalyze external investment and promote national prominence. The overarching goal is to drive greater efficiencies through shared system resources and provide this information to sister institutions in the Florida State University System . University (s): Florida International University Request Title: FIU Strategic Degree Implementation Plan Date Request Approved by University Board of Trustees: Expected September 202 1 Recurring Funds Requested: Non -Recurring Funds Requested: $4,850,188 Total Funds Requested: check the request type below: Shared Services/System -Wide Request Unique Request Page 158 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR The I nitiative's goal is to attract high technology companies to Florida, as well as fuel entrepreneurial innovation, thus driving the economic prosperity of the state. This will be achieved both through the reputation earned by our engineering and computer science graduates , as well as through the evidence accumulated on student learning outcomes from our other strategic programs. The State's economic prosperity is the impetus for this shift to align strategic degree production with our priorities . It drives u niversities to optimize the development, retention and ultimate graduation of future accountants, engineers, computer scientists, health care professionals, educators , and scientists, as they play an essential role in the knowledge economy. Eighty five percent of all FI U alumni choose to stay and reside in Florida , including computer scientists and engineers . They are at the cutting edge of the next wave of technological innovations and imperatives that are changing the economic model of our nation and the world, includi ng the internet of things, blockchain, cyber security, and virtual markets. This proposal integrates FIU's most impactful student success initiatives : the Graduation Success Initiative (GSI) , the STEM Transformation Institute, Gateway to Graduation (G2G), Learning Assistants , and leverages past legislative investments in the School of Universal Computing Construction and Engineering Education (SUCCEED) to create a new paradigm for greater intentionality in programs of study, classroom instruction, student wellness, and ultimately student success. We think about student success with a focus on the future , as an expanded construct that prepares students for a technologically driven world that continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace. This initiative will focus on improving and expanding specific pedagogies inclusive of intentional experiential opportunities as well as authentic integration of technologies into the classroom. This Initiative will also allow FIU to fully engage all students in a modern, ur ban, research - based university education. This Initiative leverages prior funding and support and expands student success and graduation rates through optimizing programs, classrooms, and experiences for our students to foster development of 21 st century skills necessary in a knowledge -driven economy. Research and assessment of student learning outcomes resulting from the transformations are a core innovation that provides continuous feedback on the Initiative , as well as spur expansion across FIU and propagation across Florida's universities and colleges. The Initiative's goal is to be a sustained producer of a highly skilled and highly adaptable workforce that will serve as a launch pad for innovation and startups as well as attract high -tech com panies to South Florida. To do this, FIU will leverage an existing framework to engage industry partners in the alignment of critical skills across the curricular and co -curricular experiences of our students. The I nitiative capitalizes on the opportunit ies afforded by the breadth of effective evidence - based instructional techniques, wide availability of technological devices that can be utilized for learning, FIU's proven expertise in preparing faculty to implement evidence - based instruction in their cla ssrooms , and FIU's investment in designing intentional college to career pathways. Effective active learning techniques are well established and understood, yet propagation of these techniques across the critical courses taken by future professionals is of ten limited to faculty with expertise in evidence -based instruction. Faculty often teach as they were taught in college, using lectures as the primary method; Page 159 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR thus, the barrier to innovative instruction is sufficient and effective professional development. FIU has established interventions with prior funding and validated this renewed, affirmed approach with an emphasis on Gateway (high enrollment and high dropout) courses for all students. The initiative will help to scale the college -to-career model throu gh intentional connection to industry partners, cohort -based programming to develop specific skillsets, and a tailored pathway that identifies critical career milestones for each year of enrollment. The Initiative provides critical resources that make it possible to work across all strategic disciplines to change the landscape and prevent a return to the status quo. The focus is on disrupting the current system in order to establish a change in culture and support the increase in strategic degree success and productions that utilizes intentionality, designing experiential learning and curated opportunities to seek these degrees and leverages FIU's proven success in evidence -based instruction and data -driven decision making in order to optimize time and financial resources. Thus, parallel elements seek to provide resources to change the physical layout of rooms, develop curated pathways for students, improve faculty teaching practices, and establish a tea m of experts focused on targeting strategic degree completion through data -driven decision making. FIU's top 10 strategic degrees include: Biological Sciences, Finance, International Business Management, Interdisciplinary Biological and Physical Sciences, Computer & Information Systems, Organizational Communication, International Relations, Health Services Administration, Nursing, Public Relations/Advertising/Application Communication. In academic year 2020- 2021, these top 10 degrees accounted for over 4,500 degrees awarded by FIU. With greater intentionality and targeted interventions towards not only these 10 degrees, but all our strategic degree offerings, FIU believe s it can contribute significantly more to the economic development of Florida. FIU h as the momentum to create, expand , and maintain innovative strategies that are impacting student success. State support is key to make these changes permanent and establish a new norm for the system. Highlights of Current Investments: Active Learning Classrooms 18 active learning classrooms renovated to date with support of state funding, ranging from 40 - 270 seats (total 1,485 seats) . The 270 -seat active learning classroom is likely the largest in the nation. Utilization: Fall 2019: 14,022 student enrollments across 257 sections of courses / Spring 2020: 12,921 student enrollments across 269 sections of 156 courses, roughly half of the sections are for STEM courses. Over 200 faculty are utilizing the active rooms each semester. Learning Assistants (LAs) impact: Learning Assistants are undergraduates who facilitate the learning of their peers in the classroom. The impact is profound, as LAs are near peers that recently succeeded in the classroom and are best able to help their peers while becoming leaders themselves. Mature course transformations that integrate LAs reliably lead to 15 -25%, and up to 40% increases in pass rates. Page 160 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR State funding has led to a rapid expansion of the LA Program . In Spring 2020, there were 420 LA assignment s in over 60 courses, working with over 70 instructors. LAs impacted roughly 14,000 student enrollments. LA Program partnered with CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) to develop a Bystander Training to better identify students that may be struggli ng or in difficult situations and would benefit from campus mental health resources. The Bystander Training has been integrated into the LA Seminar that all new LAs enroll in. Expansion of the program is in development. Increase in STEM course Passing Rates: In the last six full academic years, changes in instruction and increases in pass rates has led to an additional 16,000 students passing 21 key Gateway and STEM courses. Expanded implementation of a novel, evidence -based General Chemistry curriculum (Ch emistry, Life, the Universe and Everything, CLUE) that has led to increased student success (15-20% when compared to traditional instructio n) and reduced textbook costs (Free textbook and low -cost web -based materials). Introductory Physics sections utilizing Modeling Instruction see 40% increases in pass rate when compared to traditional instruction. I nstructional materials are provided free of charge and utilize free online textbooks as reference. Calculus: M odeling Pra ctices of Calculus Project (started on FIU funds, secured $1.5M NSF funding): Finds a 20% average increase in pass rates over several semesters, $200/course textbook savings, as all course materials are provided at no charge and students may use free online textbooks as reference materials. The department is adopting the curriculum across all sections. At least 4 FCS schools have used / will use the curriculum in Fall 2020. MAC 1147/ Pre -Calculus Algebra and Trigonometry : The Precalculus: Pathways to Calcul us research -based problem -solving curriculum. Included restructuring and redesigning post College Algebra sequence from two semesters (one semester of Precalculus Algebra plus one semester of Trigonometry) to one semester, reducing course sequence to Calcu lus by one course. Aggregate pass rates from Fall 2018 through Summer 2019 were 70%. MAC 1105 / College Algebra: Improved web- based modules as well as adaptive, just-in-time pre -requisite assessments to integrate Intermediate Algebra content throughout Col lege Algebra thereby reducing path to graduation for STEM and business majors. Pass rates increased in College Algebra to all -time-high of 73% . The core classroom design features active, engaged learning where students utilize the practices of scientists and engineers to learn their content. Thus, soft skills essential for careers are developed simultaneously with their content learning. This also optimizes major selection, as learning through the practices of scientists and engineers allows students to evaluate their interest in their selected discipline so they may make informed decisions about careers and can change majors without incurring excess credit s to their degrees or delaying graduation. Specific objectives include: Transform introductory courses for the strategic degrees with a particular focus on the more commonly held critical courses. This will include prioritizing the re - design of the Precalculus through Calculus sequence: Building on the established success of t ransforming Gateway STEM courses, this objective will improve the Page 161 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR instruction of critical courses taken by the identified strategic m ajors. This explicitly targets advancing the current pilot interventions reforming Precalculus and Calculus, scaling effect ive instruction across the complete Calculus sequence. Calculus has a reputation of serving as barrier for future STEM professionals; however, success in pilot Precalculus and Calculus interventions show sufficient promise that a dedicated effort is includ ed in this initiative. Pilot results include improvement in average pass rates by up to 25% in a randomized, controlled study involving 10 sections. Once established, practices and curricular materials will be shared across the State colleges and universit ies to foster greater efficiencies through shared system resources. Implement intervention of designing intentional, curated pathways inclusive of academic and co -curricular offerings , aligned to in- demand skills, to support the growth, relevance, and development of strategic degree areas , which are critical to our Florida economy. Develop internship -based opportunities across strategic degree offerings that capitalize and partner with and across the leading indust ries in Florida. Provide funded undergraduate research opportunities across strategic degrees as appropriate to ensure that our students can be competitive in the marketplace upon completion. Implement interventions that promote mental health, especially for first generation and millennial students: Student mental health is a concern for those transitioning to a university, especially for first generation, urban and millennial students as they need to navigate a complex educational system efficiently, often while working or supporting a family. Our current initiatives (active learning instruction featuring undergraduate Learning Assistants) foster peer learning communities that support positive mental health; however, much more can be done to improve student acclimatization to the university experience. Thus, this objective will implement interventions that have shown to improve student wellness and timely persistence to degrees. These interventions have been selected to act in concert with the classroom envi ronments promoting mental health, as we know that the stressors on these high -impact educational opportunities and career trajectories plays a critical role in students' ability to complete and succeed. Initial interventions focused on developing contempla tive practices in the classroom show positive responses from students. We will investigate which interventions are most effective for our student population, guided by Yeager (2019) 's research on growth mindsets and self - regulation, Walton and Cohen (2007) 's research on belonging and Davidson (2014)'s research on healthy minds . We will prepare faculty, administrators and undergraduate Learning Assistants ( LAs) to support mental health and recognize early indicators of concern. Classroom Renovation: Existing traditional classrooms will be renovated to facilitate active learning u sing state of the art facilities . FIU is transition ing to active- learning, technology- driven classrooms to promote student engagement of content during class time and dissuading the use of lecture by faculty. New classrooms are now routinely built as active learning classrooms with access prioritized for faculty utilizing active learning and thus incentivizing the best instructional practices. Newly opened active learning classroom s averaged over 80% utilization by active STEM courses , with the remaining 20% of utilization done by other courses . However , requests for the active learning rooms persistently Page 162 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR outpace availability and thus the need for additional active learning capacity and have include d support for these classroom renovations. We include funding for one - time retrofit of at least 10 of our more outdated traditional classrooms that do not have the design or technological infrastructure that is required by state -of-the-art instructional design. Establish faculty \"sand box \" for developing instructional practices before deploying across large active learning rooms. Creating a stepwise process allows for faculty to become familiar with the curriculum and implement it with fidelity, before introducing additional variables related to class management in larger settings. Establish Fellows program: This objective will harness the expertise of faculty that have transformed their courses into highly effective active learning environments and position them as Faculty Fellows to share their expertise with colleagues and accelerate institutional transformation. A pilot program was successfully deployed by the Center for the Advancement of Teaching (CAT) with a small cohort of Faculty Fellows including opportunities for building faculty community and leading faculty professional development initiatives. Faculty communities are known to be an essential tool for fomenting faculty change. This model has the dual objective of developing institutional leaders in innovative instruction while utilizing their expertise to expand the use of active learning practices to new faculty. Fellows will design a data intensive mini -project to evaluate student success in a particular course critica l to a strategic degree or focused on the entire discipline. We will provide course buyouts to allow sufficient time for this role, as well as stipends to compensate their efforts. To achieve these objectives, specific commitments include: Create Educat ion Research team through Discipline -based Education Research (DBER) faculty hires for strategic degrees : 10 DBER highly skilled faculty will be supported through this initiative, providing leadership in implementation and measurement of evidence- based ins truction and learning technologies. These faculty will serve as leaders of STEM education research to establish a culture of student learning and progression that will drive the 4- year degree completion agenda, and students' marketability and career creati on and placement . They join our current DBER team that consists of top DBER scholars in biology, chemistry, earth science, mathematics, and physics, as well as engineering and computer science education researchers. New hires will target established leader s in their disciplines as well as top junior candidates. Provide 200 Learning Assistant Stipends to top FIU students: Undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) have been critical catalysts in transformation of STEM courses at FIU, as they facilitate learning with their peers while deepening their own understanding of content and collaboration. LAs improve the success of students in transformed courses, increasing retention and completion. These prestigious scholarships will elevate the LA program, improve suc cess of faculty course transformations, and expand the LA program beyond the STEM disciplines. LAs also experience improved learning as a result of the program , thereby serving to improve Florida's workforce. Learning Assistants (LAs) are undergraduates wh o are hired to facilitate small -group interaction in large -enrollment courses. LAs work ~10 hours per week in various aspects of course transformation . This also supports our students who may need to work for supplemental income - they are Page 163 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR employed, while on campus and therefore still able to maintain full time enrollment and timely graduation. Award 10 DBER Graduate Fellowships in Strategic Degrees : A prestigious graduate student research fellowship program will be created to develop skills as both future university educators and researchers. These Discipline -based Education Graduate Researchers (DBER) will work with the DBER faculty to implement and provide data on student impact and improved faculty instruction. Eligible students will be required to submit National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship applications to support their continued studies. Hire six staff members for program operations: One LA Program Assistant Director will be hired to manage the LA program and prepare faculty to effectively integrate LAs into their active classrooms, working with faculty and undergraduate LAs. Two Faculty Developers to work with CAT, FIU Online and Academic & Student Affairs for courses with expertise in education transformation and in the discipline will be hired to prepare faculty to implement Learning Technologies and Evidence - based Instruction in their classroom. The Developers will provide year- round support and feedback. One Database Analyst will be hired to carry out statistical analyses on the project as well as develop data analytics dashboards specifically for strategic degrees. The project will be managed by a program manager and an administrative assistant to support staff team members , devel op and support the industry partnerships as well as LAs and graduate fellows. Classroom Renovations: Existing traditional classrooms will be renovated to facilitate active learning in STEM classrooms using state of the art facilities. New classrooms are no w routinely built as active learning classrooms with access prioritized for faculty utilizing active learning, thus incentivizing the best instructional practices. The recently opened active learning classroom with 270 seats averaged over 85% by large active STEM courses. This utilization rate is typical of all the active learning classrooms on campus. However, requests for the active learning rooms persistently outpace availability . Further , our hybrid course redesign relies on active learning rooms to be effective, thereby increasing need each year. We include funding for one -time retrofit of ten of our more outdated classrooms that do not have the design and technological infrastructure that is required by state- of-the-art teaching and learning classrooms . These retrofits will include several rooms designed as \"sand boxes\" for faculty develop and test new innovative instructional practices. Related Accomplishments The Initiative builds on the success of multiple projects that have brought significant change to the university and have become integrat ed into university practices and culture. FIU's STEM interventions began in physics, expanded into multiple STEM disciplines, and are now being led through the STEM Transformation Institute. Evidence of succes s in the reformed introductory physics courses includes significantly improved conceptual learning, the first reported increase in student attitudes towards physics, and a sustained 40% increase in the passing rate, when compared to traditional courses , realized by a dozen different faculty teaching the course . This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of physics majors and national recognition for FIU's success. Page 164 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR FIU is focused on raising its 4-year graduation rate and as evidenced by our performance funding metrics and achieving the highest ever PBF of 97 points in the state, FIU achieves its goals. We build our efforts on the foundational success of our Graduation Success Initiative (GSI) and Gateway Project. FIU's GSI has helped raise t he six -year graduation rate for First Time in College students (FTICs) by 16 points in its first four years. During the past t hree years of LBR funding, we have seen a 10.4 percent point improvement in our four -year graduation rate, a 2.4 percent point increase in the second -year retention rate, and a 7 percent point increase in the issuing of bachelor's degrees without excess hours. Of significance has been FIU's improvement in the proportion of Strategic Degrees produces, from 56.2 % to 60% over the last t hree years. Institutional analytics determined that poorly performing gateway courses are a significant barrier in students' path to timely graduation, leading to the Gateway Project. The first major success in the Gateway Course initiative was the compr ehensive transformation of the College Algebra course that included Learning Assistants and innovative technology- based instruction, leading to a sustained 35- 40% increase in passing rates for all students. Improvements in the pass rate for the College Alg ebra course has saved over 3,500 seats between F all 2012 and F all 2018 (compared to fall 2010 baseline). These improvements significantly increase efficiency through direct cost savings to our students as well as reducing excess hours and thus improving ti mely graduation. In AY 2016 - 2017, the legislative investments for course redesign of Finite Mathematics and Social Choice Math, Gateway course taken by non- STEM majors, resulting in consistency in content and expectations across sections and increases in average pass rates (+12% and +16% respectively). With well over 3,000 students enrolled in these three courses each semester, the impact is significant. Looking across our Gateway courses in mathematics, when compared to 2013- 14 passing rates, improvement s have resulted in more than 8,000 additional successful course completions. Funding support of prior smaller -scale initiatives has led to a core of interventions, which has begun to lay the foundational framework for STEM at FIU. At the core of both the STEM and Gateway initiatives are interventions that 1) adapt evidence -based instructional practices to the FIU context; 2) require faculty engaging students in meaningful, active learning in the classroom; 3) are initiated by external grant or foundation funding; and 4) engage undergraduates, faculty, and administration as partners in the transformation. One powerful and cost -effective approach is t he undergraduate Learning Assistant (LA) program , which provides undergraduates with the opportunity to expe rience the reward of teaching, develop skills to engage in the challenges of effective instruction, and deepen their content knowledge. At the same time, they serve a critical role as dedicated and skilled facilitators in the classroom, thus easing the tra nsition for both students and faculty to active learning. FIU hosts the nation 's largest LA program, with 318 LAs serving in 130 course sections across 14 STEM departments, impacting over 12,000 student enrollments in Spring 2019 (enrollment includes dupli cated headcount as students may have LAs in more than one course) . Lessons learned in these initiatives are spreading to other courses, where pilot projects have seen an average increase in passing rates of 18% across 7 courses (two of which increased over 25%), which will translate to improved graduation rates in the coming years. Further, enrollment in one transformed course more than quadrupled Page 165 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR over the past several years, doubling in annual offering as well as enrollment. On -time graduation rates have also increased 16% in four years. Further practices, curricula, and evidence generated by this initiative will be shared with all SUS and FCS institutions, allowing them to adopt and adapt practices for their use, fostering greater efficiencies t hrough shared system resources. This provides the opportunity to position Florida as the first State in the nation t o implement evidence -based instruction and learning technologies throughout the engineering and computer science programs. Alignment with SUS Strategic Priorities / 2021 FIU University Accountability Plan The Initiative is very well aligned with the goa ls of the SUS 2025 System Strategic Plan (including Improve the quality and relevance of the System's institutions and Increase Degree Productivity and Program Efficiency ) as well as the SUS Strategic Priorities in Teaching & Learning; Scholarship, Research & Innovation; and Community & Business Engagement. First, it will increase the number of degrees awarded at FIU, especially in the STEM fields, as well as the quality of those degrees by transforming instructional practices. Second, it will increase rese arch commercialization activities through providing a workforce well- prepared for driving a knowledge economy and triggering start -up companies. Further, the program and classroom transformation and education research outcomes have the potential to lead to commercialization. Third, it directly increases the community and business workforce, as our graduates will be well prepared to be fully employed in their disciplines upon graduation or to seek further educational opportunities. The initiative immediately addresses the SUS Strategic Priorities, including: Strategic Priorities for a Knowledge Economy: GOAL: Increase the Number of Degrees Awarded in STEM/Health and Other Programs of Strategic Emphasis Increase student access and success in degree programs i n the STEM/Health fields and other Programs of Strategic Emphasis that respond to existing, evolving, and emerging critical needs and opportunities. This directly addresses improving both the quantity and quality of all strategic degrees as improvements to foundation courses, such as the calculus sequence, that will benefit critical majors. Strategic Priorities for a Knowledge Economy GOAL: Increase Research Commercialization Activities : Increase the number of patents, licenses and start - up companies created as a result of university research . The initiative develops students' inquiry, collaboration and out -of-the-box thinking skills, thus providing them the opportunity to make authentic and significant contributions to the knowledge economy. Furthermore, improvements throughout the engineering and computer science programs will serve to produce more innovative and fully developed senior research projects increasing the likelihood of successful patents, licenses, and start -ups. Strategic Prior ities for a Knowledge Economy: GOAL: Increase Community and Business Workforce Increase the percentage of graduates who continue their education or are employed full -time. The project optimizes the production of our strategic degrees. Our FIU Students, stay and work in Florida at rates that far exceed Page 166 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR other institutions. Our students will become contributing members/leaders of our community and business workforce. The initiative immediately addresses FIU's 20 21 Accountability Plan goals and objectives, including: Mission: Provides high -quality teaching and state -of-the-art-research for our students and diverse population of South Florida. Goal: Aligned to becoming top 50 public university: FIU will continue to advance the institution's mission to be a top 50 public university by placing laser -like focus on aligning FIU's entire academic culture, resource investments, institutional priorities, and global perspective to achieve unprecedented excellence in higher education. Strategy: Bringing the best educational and research practices is essential in FIU's as a major contributor to our local economy and graduates the future leaders and innovators in those fields. Strategy: Developing new paradigms of evidence -based instruction now are essential for the future, as the demand for jobs is nearly insatiable. The Florida Chamber Foundation Florida 2030 Project estimates that 1.7 million more jobs will be needed in the state within 11 years. In part , the project calls for a renewed focus on talent supply and education to help the state prepare for this growth. Key Initiatives & Investments 1 ) Amplify Learner Success & Institutional Affinity : Directly impacts FIU's commitment to student success and is intricately tied to a greater sense of institutional affinity, individual grit, a well- nurtured sense of belonging, and optimism towards the future . Thus, this initiative drives FIU's first key initiative and is therefore designed to deliberatively suppo rt learners at every phase of their academic journey. FIU is well positioned to shift the higher education paradigm to meet the needs of the rapidly changing world of work by building upon our unique strengths and opportunities. To this end, we will continue to create and implement high -tech and high -touch innovative solutions that accelerate our students' academic and career success. Our focus is to foster 21st century, employment -ready, proud FIU graduates, who are technologically, creatively, and cultura lly agile. At the same time, we are committed to creating an environment that stimulates lifelong learning and builds synergistic networks, which dynamically and organically connect our students, teachers, researchers, alumni, community partners, and entre preneurs. Key Initiatives & Investments 2) Accelerate Preeminence & Research and Innovation Impact Preeminent Programs; This initiative directly impacts FIU's second key initiative is designed to advance our current academic standing by leveraging FIU preeminent and emerging preeminent programs that focus on generating new knowledge and innovative solutions for the betterment of our environment, health, and society. Many of our strategic degrees are represented across this spectrum of programs. This will d rive our visibility to solidify FIU as a leading urban public research university. To achieve this, we will strive to attract and retain the most productive faculty, while cultivating leaders and nurturing all students, postdocs, researchers, and staff to excel. During the next three years, we will focus on optimizing interdisciplinary collaboration through our Preeminent Page 167 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR and Emerging Preeminent programs to seek large center research grants, and grants that focus on technological innovation, as well as on graduate student training ... Our aim is for FIU to be the catalyst to foster social innovation and entrepreneurship from conceptualization to commercialization. Key Initiatives & Investments 3) Assure Responsible Stewardship : Aligns with optimizing resource management: consistently practice sound financial management while aligning resources with academic priorities that sustain knowledge production, optimize learning, discovery and creativity, and promote a positive working environment. Impact on Academic Programs, Student Enrollments, Student Services Every student at FIU will benefit from the implementation through new and improved first-year targeted and intentional programming around strategic degree options, awareness, and opportunities ; implementation of evidenced -based practices in critical/milestone coursework, curated industry partnership and internship opportunities, and mental health interventions. The culture of teaching and learning will likewise be transformed, toward evidence -based a nd data -informed improvement. These transformations will reduce individual course failure rates by at least 30% within two years of implementation , leading towards an overall goal of an additional 15% increase in graduation rates. This goal is aligned with the standard of excellence as established by the SUS Performance Funding Metrics . As was the case in physics, we anticipate increases in the number of Engineering and Computer Science majors. This information and insight will be shared with partner institutions. II. Return on Investment - Describe the outcome(s) anticipated, dashboard indicator(s) to be improved, or return on investment . Be specific. For example, if this issue focuses on improving retention rates, indicate the current retention rate and the expected increase in the retention rate. Similarly, if the issue focuses on expanding access to academic programs or student services, indicate t he current and expected outcomes. University of Distinction proposals should also address the requirements outlined in the separate guidance document . The Initiative leverages existing commitments to education transformation and a national climate devoted to classroom education reform . It will increase research capacity and funding opportunities that will lead to increased grant funding, improved student performance, and national recognition. Further, it will stimulate adoption of similar instructional inn ovation at universities and colleges across the state. The initiative explicitly targets revitalizing targeted and critical programs necessary for the state, preparing faculty to implement innovative instruction in the classrooms, gathering and analyzing c lassroom data, and disseminating the classroom transformation model for the state. These actions will lead to improved student learning and success in critical c ourses , which lead to improved retention, graduation rates, and employment. Page 168 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR The intensive Stra tegic Teaching Academy will provide professional development to least twenty additional faculty annually in integrating evidence -based instruction, cutting edge assessment, and learning technologies in their classrooms, as well as develop instructional leadership in at least 10 Faculty Fellows. This will directly impact approximately 12,000 student enrollments annually, and they will continue to impact similar student enrollments in later years. Student mental health/wellness interventions will be expanded in the first semester after initiative launch and impact at least half of the entering STEM students and measures on the impact will be determined over the next two semesters. Within three years, all entering STEM students will have the opportunity to fully benefit from the intervention s and wellness -based programs that are implemented across the life cycle of the student. The model for faculty professional development will be established through research on faculty practices and student impact. It is an ticipated that this will lead to the DBER faculty producing at least 80 scholarly products (publications and presentations) annually in the first three years, growing to at least 120 within five years. We also expect all new DBER faculty to attract externa l funding to the institution within 18 months of hire. All our recent DBER faculty hires attracted external funding within six months to one year of arrival; almost all have already been awarded more than one grant. These include Dr. Monique Ross' awards of $1.2M, Dr. Alexandra Strong's awards Dr. Trina awards , and Dr. Bruk Berhane's awards of $565K. The initiative will also drive improved student learning and success in the courses, leading to improved retention and graduation rates. Student learning outcomes are a key driver to sustained transformative instruction (as well as a critical feedback loop element) and will be reported through the scholarly products. Based on prior FIU initiatives and national trends in active learning, we expect a 30 - 40% decrease in failure rates in larg e enrollment introductory courses within four semesters of implementing evidence -based instruction. For the courses with failure rates of 20 - 40%, this translates to an 8 -16% decrease in failure rate. We expect this to increase an additional 10% within three years and be sustained for at least a decade. We base this on prior work at FIU and active learning literature. At FIU, College Algebra passing rates increased by 25% after evidence- based instruction was introduced across all sections in Fall 2012, th en rising to the current 40% increase in average pass rate (compared to the Fall 2010 baseline). We have also seen a 70% decrease in failure rates in our studio -based introductory physics courses, compared to lecture courses. A 2014 Proceedings of the Nati onal Academies of Science publication found an average 35.5% decrease in reported failure rates when comparing active learning in all STEM disciplines to lecture courses (www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111). We will transform the education expe rience for FIU's strategic degree portfolio , over 80% of which are from traditionally underrepresented minority groups , and 23 % of which are first generation students. Ultimately, this initiative drives economic development by substantially improving learning and skill development for our students, as well as enhancing efficiency in degree attainment. Our graduates will be well prepared to tackle existing, evolving, and emerging critical needs and opportunitie s in the global society and technology driven m arketplace. Page 169 of 402 2021- 2022 LBR They will be the innovators, entrepreneurs, and start -up leaders of the future. Their reputation for solving global challenges will attract the top technology companies to South Florida. Thus, FIU will be the reliable catalyst for South Florida 's highly skilled and diverse engineering and computer science workforce. III.

Affordability Counts Launched in June 2016, the Affo rdability Counts (AC) collaborative initiative from FIU Online, the FIU Libraries, and the Center for the Advancem ent of Teaching, aims at lowering the cost of course materials to $20 or less per credit. Faculty are encouraged to adopt open educational resources (OER) or other low-cost c ourse materials. Qualifying courses earn the AC medallion. In 2019, FIU Online partnered with five Univ ersities and one stat e college to expand the program state-wide. The team developed https://affordabilit ycounts.org, a new website with a searchable database of courses that us e OER and low-cost ma terials for faculty across the state to contribute to and use as a resource in their own content curation process. In just one year, faculty at Flori da state colleges and universities gained access to a statewide repository of model courses and their low-cost materials. SUS partners now include the University of Centra l Florida, University of North Florida, University of South Florida, Florida A&M University, Florida Atl antic University, and Lake Sumter College. As of May 2021, over 1,261 facu lty across the state of Flori da have participated in this program, with over 1,900 courses designated as AC courses. At FIU, savings are nearly $116 per course, with the average cost of materials in AC certified courses at $19, accounting for over $2 million in cost savings for thousands of students. This figure does not in clude subsequent iterations of the courses after the AC medallion was awarded, so sa vings are actually higher. FIU Libraries The FIU Libraries provide open access, low-cost materials as well as e-materials whenever cost effective, feasible, and possible. Many faculty request e-books and other online materials in their subject areas to be added to the catalog in electronic formats. In July 2021, the FIU Libraries transit ioned to a next-generation integrated librarysystem with cloud-based services and a scalable web and mobile design that improves and expands access to library materials. Joining the other Florida state univers ity and college libraries, the upgraded system will fully integr ate the library resources into the curriculum at zero- cost to students. E-Materials During the pandemic, the FIU Libraries shifted to online support for faculty in identifying appropriate alternatives to print materials fo r their courses. The libraries activated HathiTrust Temporary Emergency Access so that faculty and studen ts could access the print items in the library virtually. Additional ly, the libraries accepted all vendor offers of free access to content. Faculty, staff and stu dents actively used the additional content and HathiTrust as a new resource. Page 253 of 402 The FIU Libraries continues to support facult y in shifting to new formats for course materials by acquiring new e-resources wit h unlimited simultaneous user access to be embedded in their courses. FIU Libraries has access to more than 4,746, 739 items in e-format including e-books, streaming media (more than 118, 000), government information. Furthermore, the library subscribes to more than 1,160 databases. The majority of the library databases offer a permanent URL at the article level which c an be used not only for supplemental materials but to supplant a traditional textbook. Course Reserves Access to Course Reserves, E-Books, Databases & Library Research Tools Course Reserves is a service available to FI U faculty to house course materials in print, electronic, and multimedia formats in comp liance with the Copyright Law. Whenever possible, materials are scanned as electroni c documents and made ava ilable to students 24/7 free of charge. During the academic year 2020-2021, there were a total of 13,504 Course Reserve items including books, articles, DVDs, equipment, maps, files, and more compared to 11,579 from the year before. Additionally, the Library Learning Tools Inter operability (LTI) tool wa s incorporated into Canvas in 26 classes. The 844 Library Resear ch Guides were viewed 866,938 times, the E-Books and Database lists were viewed 115, 000+ times, and there were more than 1.8 million library website views. Open Educational Resources (OER) Subject librarians continue to collaborate with fa culty in finding, vetting, and implementing OER materials for courses. Sarah J. Ha mmill, Business & Online Learning Librarian served on the Florida OER Summit 2021 Commi ttee in May. She vetted proposals, served as a moderator, and participated in di scussions related to the focus of the conference. Her service validates and reaffirm s FIU's support to OER initiatives both on campus and to the OER co mmunity at large. FIU College of Law Library By leveraging library-provided subscription-bas ed resources via multi-year contractual agreements for subscription materials that are purchased regardless of their utilization as course materials, the College of Law realiz ed a 201% return on investment for our law students. This ROI does not account for actual valuation of individu al course materials given the steep discounts realized by the Law Library when subscribing to packages provided by Wolters Kluwer, West Academic , Thomson Reuters, and Lexis Nexis. The Law Library typically subscribes to these ma terials as part of its collection to support student learning and faculty research needs. Through these efforts, we saved students $195,858.61 in out-of-pocket costs for assigned c ourse materials across 63 law courses.

Students may save as much as 80% by purchasing te xtbooks in alternative formats offered. For Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 the Barnes & N oble FIU bookstores offered 75% and 74% respectively of all textbooks as rental opt ion with discounts of up to 80%. The rental utilization rates of all book transactions for Fall and Spring were 51% and 49% respectively. The digital availability of text books was consistently at 41%, with discounts of up to 60% and utilization rate s of 34% in Fall and 38% in Spring. Used textbook purchases represented 14.2% and new and used textbook rentals represented 19.6% of all textbook transactions in the Fall and Spri ng semesters. By taking advantage of used, new rental, used rental, or digital discount options, students saved $999,959 (19%) in the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters. Barnes & Noble @ FIU Price Match Program Barnes & Noble is matching the prices for textbooks advertised or offered by a local competitor, BN.com, or Amaz on. For the past year, Price Match savings of $922 were passed on to students, bringing the program total to $136,648 matched since program inception in Spring 2016. Adoptions & Insights Portal (AIP) Development Beginning with the Summer 2020 semester, FI U transitioned to Barnes & Noble's new textbook adoption platform Adoptions & Insights Portal (AIP). AIP not only offers a more use r-friendl y selection and entr y process for facult y and staff, it also features a dashboard Page 255 of 402with adoption submission reporting across all academic departments. FI U members of the Textbook Affordability Task Force have continuously worked with Barnes & Noble corporate leaders and its techni cal team to optimize system operations and functionalities also as they pertain to enforcing and document ing requirements by th e Florida Statute on Textbook and Instructional Mate rials Affordability. Has the opt-in provision been implemented by your inst itution for the purchase of student materials? If yes, describe the impact this has this had on student savings, if any. FIU did not implement an opt-in textbook program in the 2020-2021 academic year. Has the opt-ou t provision been implemented by your inst itution for the purchase of student materials? If yes, describe the impact this has this had on student savings, if any. FIU did not implement an opt- out textbook program in th e 2020-2021 academic year. The institution will pilot an inclusive access pr ogram with an opt-out provision across all undergraduate course sect ions in Fall 2021.

FIU's Regulation 1103 on Textbook Affordability requires all instructors to post required and recommended textbooks and course materials 45 days in advance of the first day of classes. The Office of the Provost has established a communication timeline to remind course instructors, chairs and deans each semester of the respective adoption deadline. The fi rst notification is sent out 75 days prior to the start of the next semester. Repeat reminders follow 60 and 55 days out. As of 50 days prior to the start of the next semester, the respective department chairs are required to submit any pe nding adoptions on behalf of their faculty. Any adoptions that are not considered exceptions or do not meet the posting requirement, are centrally reviewed for standard justifications (i.e. the adoption was submitted on time but the materi al could not be sourced by the bookstore). Effective Summer 2020, faculty utilize Barnes & Noble's custom-built adoption platform Adoptions & Insights Portal (AIP), which links this information to FIU's course registration system for all courses and course sections. Barnes & Nobled piloted AIP at FIU in the Summer of 2020 and fully deployed in Fall 2020. The user-interface for the entry of adoptions, commun ication tools, as well as the dashboard for the reporting of timely adoption submissions all have greatly improved the process. AIP's configuration is also in alignment with the State of Florida's requirements in regard to enforcing adoption submissions by the legal deadline. In addition, Barnes & Noble maintains a searchable website for FIU Course Materials on which students can find required or recommended course materials by campus, term, department, course and se ction. The website also details pricing options for all items (i.e. rent new, rent used, buy new, buy used, rent digital, buy digital) acquired through Barnes & Noble FIU book stores. Are the policies effective in meeting the reporting requirement? If not, what measures will be taken by the university to incr ease faculty and staff compliance for meeting the reporting requirement? Overall, the policies sufficiently guide the institutional policies and common practices for textbook and course materials adop tions and selections processes. In regard to ensuring timely adoptions and documenting justifications for late submissions, we have designed a process to collect such justifications at the time an adoption is entered in AIP. This feature was deployed in Fall 2021 and will enable us to provide comprehensive reporting of justified late adoptions. This process design has been created in consultation with our SUS sister institutions FAMU, FGCU and UCF to establish a consistent a pproach for all campuses that utilize Barnes & Noble's Adoptions & Insights Portal. **Note: Per Board Regulation 8.003 (1) (h), a course or course section added after the posting requirement is considered an ex ception and should be reported on the \"Exceptions\" tab. A request for any other exception to the compliance deadline shall be submitted in writing to the designated university official and shall provide a reasonable just ification for an exception. A course or section added after the notification deadline is exempt from this notification requirement.

In addition, Instructors can request an intake meeting with SCAI staff to re view allegations, the Charges, possible Sanctions, and to be explained the Student conduct process, and any available forms of resolution. Reasonable efforts will be made to hold this intake meeting at least ten (10) Business Days before any scheduled hear ing. iv. Interim Measures : Until final agency action or there is a such a change in circumstances that the decision -maker for each action below no longer supports such an action, the following interim measures may be implemented as follows: i. No-Contact Directive: In cases involving allegations of, hazing, personal abuse, retaliation, stalking, or other menacing activity or concerning behavior, the SCAI Director, after making a reasonable effort to meet with the Respondent if appropriate to do so, may issue a No -Contact Directive. ii.

Refund to the Respondent a pro rata portion of any c harges for tuition, and out -of-state fees, as appropriate, relating to the temporary revocation or suspension which affected the Respondent's ability to attend classes for more than ten (10) school days. v. Investigations : The SCAI Director retains the discr etion to determine whether an investigation should be conducted, and the scope of such investigation based on the alleged violations under the Code . The investigation will be a neutral fact -finding process used to determine if there is sufficient informati on to warrant action by the University. If the SCAI Director directs an investigation to another office to act on behalf of SCAI, including the Department of Housing and Residence Life or the Office of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Access (IDEA), the Director of such office, or designee, shall conduct the investigation in accordance to the Code and relevant processes and procedures, so long as such procedures do not conflict with this Code or applicable University Policy which has jurisdiction over the reported behavior. For cases in which ther e is an overlap of charges between the Code and FIU Regulation 105, a joint investigation will commence, and the details of the Code investigation will be included in the FIU Regulation 105 final report or considered as part of the informal resolution. The Code behaviors will cede to adjudication and appeal under the process set forth in FIU Regulation 105. In cases where conduct involves both potential Conduct and Academic Misconduct violations, the Hearing Officer or Hearing Body has the authority to ha ndle both matters simultaneously through a joint hearing. If a Student is found Responsible for simultaneous Conduct and Academic Misconduct violations, sanctions from both processes may be imposed. vi. Charge Letter : The Respondent will be given a written n otice of the Charges. The Charge Letter will include the following: i. Notice of the charge(s), including specific code section(s) which constitutes the alleged violation(s) of the Code, an allegations statement and any other detail in order to prepare for a Student Conduct proceeding , including the process to be used in determining whether a violation has occurred and associated rights ; and ii.

For a joint hearing, the individual who conducted the information sessions must affirm, in writing, to the Hearing Officer that each Respondent performed acts sufficiently similar that the facts presented in evidence would not differ materially from one Respondent to another. In such case, the Hearing Officer may order joinder of such cases for hearing. ii. Any Respondent, whose case is joined may request, in writing, to the Hearing Officer to be excluded from the joint hearing on the ground that (i) they are not charged with the same offense, at the same time and place, or (ii) that the facts relevant to the m would differ materially from the facts relevant to the Respondent(s). The Hearing Officer's decision regarding whether any requesting Respondent be severed from the joint hearing in final. Page 279 of 40219 iii. All decisions regarding responsibility under this Code, and any appliable sanctions or remedies will be rendered individually, and each Respondent remains entitled their own advisor. viii. Information Session : An information session is designed to provide the Respondent with information about the adjudication process , as we ll as giving access to the information supporting the charge(s) available at that time. The information session is not a disciplinary proceeding but may transition to suc h a disciplinary proceeding if the Respondent waives any applicable disciplinary proceeding rights not met in order to accept a Summary Resolution. i. Subsequent to the information session, the Hearing Officer may conduct further fact -finding regarding the incident that is subject to the charge. This information will be communicated to the Respondent prior to the hearing or at a subsequent meeting before a hearing. ii. If a Respondent fails to attend a scheduled information session, the Respondent will be deemed to have waived their right to an information session. Under those circumstances, a hearing will be scheduled. Failure to attend an information session will result in the Hearing Officer determining the type of hearing. The hearing type will be determined based on the severity of the possible sanctions (e.g., suspension/expulsion cases may be referred to the Student Conduct Committee). iii. If the Respondent fails to attend the information session, the Hearing Officer may place a hold/service ind icator on the Respondent's record until the conclusion of the hearing. If sanctions are imposed as a result of the hearing, the hold/service indicator will be retained until the Respondent fulfills all of the sanctions. ix. Student Academic Status Pending the Code Process : The Student's academic status will remain unchanged pending the outcome of the Code process, except where the Senior Vice President for Academic & Student Affairs or designee has implemented an interim suspension. When a final grade for a course may be involved, a grade of IN should be assigned, pending the University's final decision in the matter. A Respondent's ability to register for future semesters may be temporarily placed on hold. 10.8. RESOLUTION OPTIONS A Respondent is entitled to a resolution of any alleged violation of the Code through a disciplinary proceeding unless waived as set forth below. Two (2) types of resolution options are provided by the Code. i. Summary Resolution i. A summary resolution is available when the Respondent waives the right to a hearing , any applicable disciplinary proceeding rights not met , and requests that the Hearing Officer conducting the information session determine the findings and sanctions if ap plicable. The Hearing Officer reserves the right to conduct fact -finding to make an informed decision. ii. The following apply to a summary resolution: 1. The meeting(s) will not be recorded. 2.

Faculty members can be recommended annually by the Faculty Senate. Undergraduate, graduate, and professional Student members will be recruited and selected through SCAI's formal SCC recruitment and selection process. All members of th e SCC will be trained by SCAI. In cases where the Respondent is an undergraduate, every effort will be made to select undergraduate student representatives for the SCC. In cases where the Respondent is a graduate or professional student , every effort will be made to select graduate or professional student representatives for the SCC. For Academic Misconduct violations, the committee must include two full -time faculty members, and if the Respondent is a graduate or professional student faculty representatives must have at least Graduate Faculty status. For cases in which there is an overlap of charges under only the Code (Academic misconduct and a non -FIU Regulation105 violation), the Hearing Body shal l meet the requirements of the Academic Misconduct hearing. iv. For cases in which there is an overlap of charges between the Code and FIU Regulation 105, the Code behaviors will cede the adjudication processes under that Regulation. iii.

SCAI serves as the central repository for all student sanctions administered under the Code and FIU Regulation 105, and any prior misconduct under the Code or FIU Regulation 105 is considered in any sanctioning stage of either proceeding. 17.15. SANCTIONS i. Sanctions may only be imposed when a Respondent has been found in violation of the Code. In cases where a Respondent has been found \"Not Responsible\" for the alleged violation(s), no sanctions will be assigned. ii. In light of the facts and circumstances of each case, the following sanctions or combination of sanctions (with or without appropriate modifications) will be imposed upon any Respondent found to have violated the Code or FIU Regulation 105 . Sanct ions will be commensurate with the prohibited conduct with consideration given to any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, including, but not limited to, the Respondent's conduct and Academic Misconduct record. Fees may be associated with certain sanctions (e.g., counseling consultation, online programs) and are the Respondent's responsibility. iii. When an undergraduate student is found Responsible for Academic Misconduct violations, SCAI will determine any University Sanctions which are not related to a grade or the course in general. The Instructor and Chair (or designee) will recommend Course Sanctions and communicate their recommendation to SCAI. SCAI will then communicate the fina l outcome to the student . Should the Instructor fail to provide SCAI with recommended course sanctions within seven (7) Business Days, SCAI may assign Course Sanctions. If the undergraduate student is a member of the Honors College, SCAI will notify the De an of the Honors College that a student was found in violation and ask if the College wishes to invoke any Honors College -level academic action(s). The Dean of the Honors College will determine if Honors College action is necessary. SCAI will be notified w ithin seven (7) Business Days if the Dean recommends additional program action. iv. When a graduate or professional student is found Responsible for Academic Misconduct violations, SCAI notifies the Instructor, Dean or designee of the University Graduate or Professional School, and the Dean or designee of the Academic College in which the graduate or professional student resides. SCAI will determine any University Sanctions, which are not Page 287 of 40227 related to a grade or the course. The Instructor and Dean (or designee) will recommend Course Sanctions and communicate their recommendation to SCAI. Should the Instructor fail to provide SCAI with recommended course sanctions within seven (7) Business Days, SCAI may assign Course Sanctions. The College Dean or designee will in turn notify the graduate or professional program that a student was found in violation and ask if the program wishes to invoke any program -level academic action(s). The student's graduate or professional program will determine if program action is necessary. SCAI will be notified within seven (7) business days if the graduate or professional program recommends additional program action. SCAI will then communicate the final outcome to the student. v.

The reports from each public university in Florida encompass academic p rogram analyses, review of student services, review of gender equity in athletics, and analyses of employment in key areas. The 2021 FEEA Report encompasses five areas: Policies and Procedures, Academic Program Reviews, Intercollegiate Athletics, Employmen t Representation , and Other Requirements. The essence of these reports serves as a reaffirmation of the commitment of Florida International University ( FIU) toward enhancing the representation of women and minorities in FIU's undergraduate, graduate, and p rofessional , and athletics programs as well as faculty and administrative positions. FIU has two campuses: the Modesto A. Maidique Campus (MMC) in w est Miami -Dade County and the Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC) in North Miami. Highlights and Achievements FIU was named one of the best colleges in the nation to work for in 2019, according to a survey by The Great Colleges to Work For\u00ae program. The university also achieved honor roll designation, with recognition in 1 2 out of 12 categories. Honor status is given when the university receives recognition across all the c ategories. FIU has received honor roll designation every year since 2016. FIU has now been recognized four times consecutively with honor roll designation. In September 2019, in the Washington Monthly Magazine College Rankings, FIU ranked No. 43 in the Public National Universities category (number 72 overall) out of 395 universities - up from No. 54 in 2018. FIU also ranked No. 5 among public universities (number 14 overall) in the Best Bang for the Buck in the Southeast U.S. rankings for colleges that help low -income students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices. The two rankings consider factors such as graduation rates, the number of Pell Grant recipients and first -generation students, median earnings 10 years after entering college, the net price of attendance for families making less than $75,000 per year, and repayment rates. In July 2020, FIU was ranked No. 3 among U.S. public universities that are 50 years old or younger by Times Higher Education (THE). THE uses thirteen ( 13) carefully calibrated performance indicators to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons, trusted by students, academics, university leaders, industry, and governments. T he \"Golden Age\" rankings use the same weightings as the World University Rankings. The performance indicators are grouped into five areas: Teaching (the learning environment); Research (volume, income, and reputation); Citations (research influence); International outlook (staff, students, and research); and Industry income (knowledge transfer). PART I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Page 299 of 402 6 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Description of Plan Development The guidelines for this report were provided by the BOG, which oversees the State University System (SUS) of Florida. The completion of this plan was a collaborative institutional effort comprised of representatives from the Office of the Provost, Academic & Student Affairs, Academic Budget Office, Athletics, University Graduate School, Human Resources, Analysis and Information Management, Enrollment Management and Services led by FIU's Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) . The FEEA report is prepared by FIU's Director of DEI is reviewed by the Diversity Council Policy committee . This committee's responsibility is to reviews institutional policies and makes recommendations to the Vice Provost of DEI about diversity , equity, and inclusion -related policy issues. This committee also provid es feedback on the e quity report submission based on the Florida Equity report guidelines . The Office of the General Counsel as well as the Sr. Vice President of Human Resources and Vice Provost of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion both review the report before it is submitted for approv al by the University President and the FIU Board of Trustees (BOT). In addition, the report is presented to the BOT's Academic Policy and Student Affairs before it is approved by the full board. FIU complies with federal and state non -discrimination and FEEA statutes. The sources used for data are the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System ( IPEDS ), the 2019 Affirmative Action plan, and other institutional surveys and assessments. FIU is committed to the policy that all persons shall have equal access to programs, facilities, admissions, academic programs, and employment without regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance , or qualifications as determined by u niversity policy or by state or fede ral laws and regulations. Summary of Institutional Progress Academic Programs FIU has experienced an increase in the number of Bachelor's, Master's , and p rofessional degrees awarded during the 20 19-2020 Academic Year. There was a decrease in the number of Doctoral degrees awarded. There has also been a significant decrease in enrollment of First -Time -In- College (FTIC) students at FI U. In 2018, FIU began admitting students through a variety of pathways to pursue improvements in the level of selectivity without compromising access objectives. While the negative impact on our Pell rates and diversity has been minimized , some diversity and access goal s have not been achieved to the extent intended and may have contributed to the decreas e in FTIC . FIU will be augmenting these pathways with additional access pathways in the upcoming year. It is also our assumption that the pandemic had an impact on the decrease of doctoral degrees awarded as well as the enrollment of FTICs. FIU further affirms its commitment to community outreach and diversity recruitment initiatives to impact diversity outcomes in undergraduate student enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. Gender Equity in Athletics FIU has a designated Deputy Title IX Coordinator in the Athletics Department who, in collaboration with the University's Title IX Coordinator, arranges for diversity training for all Page 300 of 402 7 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT student- athletes and ensures compliance with Title IX and the NCAA Standards. Such efforts have been taken to ensure equitable facilities, equipment, personnel, and opportunities for female and male athletes. There is also a Title IX and diversity, equity, and inclusion committee that assists in ensur ing an equitable and diverse athletic s program. FIU furth er focuses on training the athletic coaching and support staff on the importance of inclusion, diversity, equity, and access to ensure that they are well -suited to meet the needs of our diverse student -athlete population. Employment R epresentation FIU is committed to ensuring that the faculty and staff at our institution reflect the diversity of our local community and our student body. The Division of Human Resources continues to lead efforts to strengthen employment, recruitment, classification, and compensation by leveraging technology to meet current university/legal/compliance demands, expectations, and changes in law for administrat ive, staff, and student employees. Further, the Division of Academic Affairs and the Office to Advance Women, Equity, and Diversity (AWED) are actively engaged in the recruitment, retention, and development of university faculty throughout each college /sch ool. In Fall 2020, there was only an increase in the number of Black tenured faculty members compared to Fall 2019. Additionally, there was also an increase in the percentage of There was a notable increase to Black and Female categories of the n on-tenure -earning faculty or faculty at non-tenure. In Fall 2020, there was an increase in N on-resident Alien , Asian, Hispanic, and Female categories. Protected- Class Representation in the Tenure Process FIU's faculty tenure process strives to allow faculty members who are underrepresented minorities to participate and be considered throughout the process in each college during the academic year of 2019-2020. FIU is proud to encourage diversity in the faculty tenure process through targeted diversity recruitment initiatives through AWED. FIU strives to ensure the tenure process demonstrates fairness and equity to all participants, including females and underrepresented minorities. FIU acknowledges that greater diversity is needed throughout the tenure and promotion process; efforts to obtain diverse representation on committees are continually sought and improvement is expected to continue. Areas for Improvement The Non -resident alien category of students expe rienced decreases in the areas FTIC , retention of FTICs, Bachelor's, Master 's, and Doctoral degrees awarded . Another area for improvement is in the overall number of FTIC student enrollment. The number of doctoral degrees awarded to Black students increased by 2% from the previous year, but that category remains underrepresented. There was also a decrease in the n umber of doctoral degrees awarded to female students. For gender equity in i ntercollegiate athletics, p articipation rates, male, and female, compared with full -time undergraduate enrollment and the a vailability of facilities, defined as locker room, practice, and competitive facilities, have been identified as areas for improvemen t.

Full -time, First -time students. The FIU FTIC enrollment dat a reflects that approximately 60% of students were female and 40% were male for the 2019 -2020 academic year. Although the total number of FTIC students enrolled at FIU has decreased from 3 ,306 in Fall 2019 to 2,734 in Fall 2020, 87% of full -time FTICs enrol led at FIU were underrepresented minorities in Fall 2020. This percentage is slightly decreased over the previous Fall 2019 metric, where 88% of full -time FTICs enrolled at FIU were underrepresented minorities. Students from Hispanic backgrounds made up th e greatest percentage increase in this metric. In the academic year , of 2019- 2020, FIU has over 58,000 students and a first- year student acceptance rate of 50%, which makes our admission process a selective one. The admissions committee selects undergraduate applicants who are academically prepared , based on high school GPA, grades in academic core courses, course selection, college readiness in math, writing and reading, and standardized test scores, have chall enged themselves with advanced courses, are active in their community , or are motivated by a specific goal or passion. FIU strive s to prepare applicants for a college education by open ing doors to more future undergraduate students, every year. In accordance with BOG Regulation 6.002(2)(c) FIU's Office of Admissions works closely with the Florida Board of Governors and Department of Education to review applicants through Florida's Talented Twenty Program . All other FTIC pathways for admission tak e into PART I II.

Florida's Talented Twenty P rogram supports the efforts to encourage students to strive for better grades in high school and provides access to at least one of the members of the state university system. Students eligible for the Talented Twenty Program have demonstrated academic suc cess in their respective K -12 public schools and are guaranteed admission, within space and fiscal limitations, to one of the twelve state universities. Areas for Improvement In 2018, FIU began admitting students through a variety of pathways to pursue improvements in the level of selectivity without compromising access objectives. While the university has minimized the negative impact on Pell rates and diversity, the diversity or access F TIC goals have not been achieved to the extent intended. FIU will be augmenting these pathways with additional access pathways in the upcoming year. FIU will develop a top 10% pathway through whic h FTIC students who graduate in the top 10% of their classes will be admitted . If students me et the minimum requirements as described in BOG Regulation 6.002, they will be admitted without applying the competitive admissions criteria to their standardized test scores. To maximize the impact of this pathway , Title I schools will be distributed among all recruiters; this will increase the resources committed to these schools. An additional recruiter in Admissions who will be accountable for initiatives associated with underrepresented and first-generation students will be added . Enrollment Management & Services will collaborate with MDCPS to develop more opportunities for faculty engagement. This effort will focus on specific programs such as Journalism, Nursing, and Hospitality. These programs have a low representation of FTIC students. FIU believes that students will see the value of these majors and pursue them at the universi ty. The desire to improve in this area highlights the need for early outreach and awareness programs. Based on the success during COVID 19, virtual initiatives associated with direct recruiting and financial aid will be adopted or refined . Enhanced FA FSA workshop s will be schedule d for underrepresented and first -generation students. The following events for high schools are being hosted . The tracking of the impact of these programs to help improve FTICs will be established. AVID Recruitment AVID, Advancement Via Individual Determination, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1980. AVID is a fourth through the twelfth -grade system to prepare students in the academic middle for four -year college eligibility providing academic and social support to Page 306 of 402 13 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT ensure students' success in high school, college, and careers. FIU participated in the Miami Heat & AVID recruitment event in 2019 as well as provided support through college fairs, college nights, panels, and high school visits to over 120 AVID high schools in Florida. College Board Access and Diversity Collaborative FIU is a sponsor of the College Board Access and Diversity C ollaborative (ADC). This program exists to provide information and tools to higher education institutions as they develop and implement policies and practices in support of educational access and diversity. FIU helps by shaping the priorities and provides adv ising and direction regarding activities; provides input to the policy and resources that guide the enrollment management community; and has the opportunity to work closely with the Education Counsel policy and law experts when dealing with diversity -related enrollment and admissions challenges, practices and goals. College Board Landscape Tool FIU is a member of the College Board's Landscape tool pilot program. Landscape provides FIU with neighborhood and high school information to use in conjunction w ith other applicant information in context . It does not replace individual applicant information but allows the university to consider more context about where the student comes from and opportunities, they have had during their high school career, relative to national and state data and comparison s. FIU Golden Scholars Through the Golden Scholars bridge program, FIU provides underrepresented students with an alternative admission pathway. In support of this effort, recruiters disseminate program information to targeted schools and students. FIU Admissions Coordinators undergo training concerning the Golden Scholars Program, and two coordinators participate on the student selections committee. As students are admitted to the program, first -generation students who graduate from high schools located in the City of Miami will be prioritized . Program students participate in an intensive six -week residential summer bridge program. This program includes academic preparation, individualized advising, and personal attention from f aculty and staff. Upon successful completion of the bridge program, students will matriculate into the fall term as fully admitted FIU students. The process for selecting Golden Scholars will be improved with the long -term goal of increasing the size of the program from 40 to 200 participants. To increase process efficie ncy and capacity, resources will be provided to the Student Access & Success department. S tudents will be provided with earlier admissions decisions and resources as they decide to become FIU students. Hispanic Scholars Fund FIU is a partner with the Hispanic Scholarship Fund. This organization empowers students and parents with the knowledge and resources to successfully complete higher education. FIU attends college fairs and scholar conferences such as the National Leadership Conference and Page 307 of 402 14 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT STEM Summit ; participates in College 101; hosts College Camp at FIU; and participates in the Youth Leadership Summit. Strive/I'm First FIU is a partner with Strive for College and I'm First! Strive connects students with financial need s with free, one- to-one mentoring to help them navigate the college and financial aid application process. Students already in college can be matched with a mentor for support to help them graduate and prepare for career opportunities. The Strive program is completely virtual, with mentors and students connecting through their online platform. FIU incorporates the I'm First resources into First Generation Student Day and is represented in the Partner book of colleges as well as on the website. Title I Schoo l Recruitment Title I Schools provide local educational agencies with the resources to help young people gain a quality education with the skills to master the standards required in the state in which they operate. Title I provide students in economically disadvantaged districts and neighborhoods with the technology, supplies, educational support , and activities to improve student achievement. Title I school districts ha ve a disproportionally large population of students who receive free or reduced -price d lunches. According to the U .S. Department of Education, more than 26- million students are served by the Title I program , and 19% of these students are enrolled in grades 9 -12. Targeted emails about additional scholarship programs such as The Dream.US, Hispanic Scholars Fund, and other community and university initiatives are sent specifically to students who attend a school receiving Title I funds. In addition, FIU hosts application workshops and FAFSA nights at Title I schools in Florida counties. Off-Campus Initiatives Application workshops, high school visits, college fairs , and financial aid presentations are ways to engage the local community in the college search and selection process. These are free and open to the general public of a specific area. Hosted by a high school, district, or community -based organization , FIU p articipates in nearly 500 events each year. The list below outlines a sample of those done at Title I high schools across the State of Florida.

Through this communication effort, early awareness of financial aid opportunities and FAFSA processes will be developed . As these efforts will f ocus on ninth graders , this engagement strategy will be augmented for f aculty members who will provide students with opportunities to explore career opportunities. Community- Based Organization Outreach Back 2 Life 'Get Life Ready' FIU participated in the Back 2 Life 'Get Life Ready' sponsored by Broward County Schools. This event sought to increase student exposure to the higher education opportunities available in Broward and Miami -Dade counties. By integrating educational workshops du ring community Page 309 of 402 16 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT gatherings, the 'Get Life Ready' event served to showcase how community and family obligations can be managed along with higher education pursuits. Financial Aid/College Admissions/Vocational Schools were represented to include the various p rofessional development opportunities open to the public. Black Brown College Bound Summit - Hillsborough Community College In 2006, Hillsborough Community College held the first annual Black, Brown & College Bound Summit in Tampa, Florida to address the national problem of a lack of student success in the areas of persistence, retention, and graduation for all students, specifically African American and Latino males. FIU participates in the summit and college fair. Breakthrough Miami Breakthrough Miami uses a unique \"students- teaching -students\" model to create a rigorous, vibrant learning community . In this community, highly motivated, traditionally underrepresented min ority 5th-12 th grade students pursue activities that prepare them for post - secondary success and become emerging leaders. T hese students will become the next generation of educators and advocates. Breakthrough Miami currently serves 1,300 middle and high school students at six community campus locations (Carrollton Scho ol of the Sacred Heart, Gulliver Schools, Miami Country Day School, Palmer Trinity, Ransom Everglades , and the University of Miami). Acceptance into the program is based on a competitive application and interview process. This process helps to identify st udents who are academically motivated and meet at least two of the following five risk factors associated with failure to enter/complete college: Ethnic/racial minorities Family income qualifies for free/reduced lunch First -generation in their families to attend college in the U.S. Single -parent household Primary language other than English FIU has been partnering with Breakthrough Miami since 2019 and actively participates in the College Bootcamp, College Tour, Sessions with College Admissions Officers , and Financial Aid sessions. In addition, the Miami Beach Urban Studios sponsors the Breakthrough Miami Growlight program; an art and design summer camp program for low -income high school students who are interested in learning how to navigate the world of art, design , and entrepreneurship. I Have a Dream (IHAD) Foundation The Miami Chapter I Have a Dream\" Foundation is the only not -for-profit in America that works with lower -income children from Kindergarten with unbroken, year -round support through College. To gain acceptance into this program: Family income qualifies for free/reduced lunch Low performing school in an economically disadvantaged area Page 310 of 402 17 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT First -generation in their families to attend college in the U.S. Ethnic/racial minorities FIU Office of Admissions staff co -hosted college planning workshops to help prepare high school juniors and seniors for the rigors of the college application and admissions process. They gave presentations on how to complete college applications, selecting majors and careers, the benefits of 2+2 programs, and how to write a college essay. Infinite Scholars The Infinite Scholars program is a non -profit organization founded by Thomas Ousley, a former teacher in Missouri. He founded the program to ensure that financially disadvantaged students could receive the funding they needed to go to college and succeed. More than 80% of participants of this program go on to college. FIU is one of the 450 partner institutions that support the Infinite Scholars program. Only five other members of the SUS are partner institutions as well as three of the members of the Florida State College System. Miami Youth Co -Op Youth Co -Op's immigration program provi des a wide array of immigration services to Miami - Dade County. The program's staff is comprised of BIA accredited representatives and legal assistants, all of whom are supervised by the program's immigration attorney. T his program host s a college fair and college planning workshop to help clients connect to opportunit ies. FIU attended the program to help with providing information sessions in Spanish. TRIO Programs The Federal TRIO Programs (TRIO) are Federal outreach and student servi ces programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. TRIO includes eight programs targeted to serve and assist low -income individuals, first - generation college students, and individuals with disabilities to progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to postbaccalaureate programs. TRIO also includes a training program for directors and staff of TRIO projects. FIU participates in many of the TRIO program initiatives including application worksho ps, FAFSA programs , and hosting the students on campus for \"Panther for a Day\" type events. In this time frame , the FIU Office of Admissions went to PBSC Lake Worth to participate in three days of college planning events. Upward Bound The Upward Bound program provides fundamental support to participants in their preparation for college from taking standardized tests to completing applications. Students in the program are from low -income families who are the first in their famil ies to go to college . Upward Bound participation not only increases the likelihood of participants going to college but also enhances their college completion rates by providing additional support and success strategies such as mentorships, counseling , and enrichment activiti es. FIU Office of Admissions provides campus Page 311 of 402 18 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT tours, information sessions, and college planning workshops on both the BBC and MMC locations for Upward Bound at FIU; and hosts groups from around the country who participate in other U.S .-based Upward Bound pr ograms. The Office of University Admissions will collaborate with the Office of Scholarships to offer students micro -scholarships for their participation in specific Community -Based Organizations such as 5000 Role Models, Upward Bound, IHAD , and Breakthro ugh Miami. A new RaiseMe \"plus\" category will be incorporated to ensure students in these programs understand that finances should not be a barrier to education. School Counselor Initiatives Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - Screening of Personal Statement Miami -Dade County Public Schools Division (MDCPS) of Student Services hosted a free screening of the movie Personal Statement; and a panel discussion with the three students from the docume ntary on January 22, 2020. This film, a documentary funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, follows three high school students turned peer college counselors as they navigate themselves and their classmates through the challenges of college access and equity. The event was sponsored by the Miami - Dade County Public Schools Division of Student Services and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and allowed prospective students, counselors, and the community to learn firsthand about the challenges low -income, first -generation students face in college access. FIU Admissions facilitated the usage of the Student Academic Success Auditorium for the screening. Page 312 of 402 19 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Table 2.

For Fall 2020, there were a total of 7,742 Florida Community College A.A. transfers. This marks an approximate 1% increase from last year's 7,646 enrollment number and a 13.64% increase from the Fall 201 5 enrollment number of 6 ,686. The percentage changes in the racial groups mirrored the previous year with a 1% increase to the Hispanic racial group. Additionally, the total number of female and male transfer students increased for Fall 20 20, although there was a slight change of 1% in the percentage of female transfer students and male transfer students. Over the past five years, FIU has experienced a 19.22 % increase in the total number of female transfer students and a 1.6% increase in the to tal number of male transfer students. Transfers who are starting their third year of college (or are near earning 60 credits) have a chosen degree. If they are entering FIU with an associate degree, they must apply to the ir college or program of choice in addition to university application. Some degree programs, such as architecture and nursing, have higher minimum admissions requirements than others and may require additional information or exams along with the application. The following programs assist in the increase of transfer students at FIU. Connect4Success The Connect4Success (C4S) program is two -fold; there is the part where FIU Office of Admissions conducts workshops in the high schools to educate students of the b enefits of a 2+2 program, and the second part where Admissions and T ransfer and T ransition S ervices assists students at the State Colleges with transitioning back to the u niversity as they are earning their AA or approved AS degree. High School to C4S Recruitment Programs at Hialeah -Miami Lakes, Hialeah Gardens, Mater Academy Charter , and Miami Lakes Educational Center were held to work with students to understand the benefits of the Connect4Success program and to complete the application. These schools have students with a Page 313 of 402 20 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT heavy interest in the STEM fields who are not ready for college -level calculus so special attention is paid to how best to advise these students on their journey toward a major with a heavy emphasis o n math and science. C4S Kickoff E vents The C4S Kickoff welcomes new students and their families to the program, including its comprehensive financial, social, and academic benefits in tandem with Miami -Dade College, Broward College, and Palm Beach State College. Historically, students hav e been offered this half-day event beginning in the morning. Although attendance has been strong for students, many parents and other family members could not attend or departed the event early due to employment or familial responsibilities. Recognizing th e important role that families play in the lives of their students, FIU expanded the program in 2019 to include an evening option . The adjustment was very well received. In Summer 2020, FIU shifted to virtual programming due to the COVID pandemic. The Office of Admissions worked diligently with partner colleges to ensure that FIU could offer the most comparable experience possible, while also recording the event for those students and famili es who could not attend the event live. University Admissions will offer virtual Kickoffs this summer (per ongoing pandemic guidelines, including at partner colleges); an in -person evening option will follow these events. Pre-Transfer Advising On March 16, 2020, FIU moved to fully remote work. Bridge Advisors, already well versed in virtual resources per their roles outside FIU, added Zoom to their toolkit and transitioned seamlessly. The team communicated to students how to reach advisors, and within days, students were being serv ed by the Bridge Advisors . During the height of the pandemic (March 16 -June 30, 2020), Bridge Advisors met with 1,549 students compared to 1,244 students during the same period in 2019. Bridge Advisors also noted meeti ng with more students from campuses outside where the advisor is housed, as well as having more focused conversations and instructional support via sharing tools. The attendance data and qualitative feedback signal the multiple benefits of virtual advising , especially for students who work and/or those who attend campuses in rural communities. The C4S department will expand access to pre -transfer advising by offering more virtual appointment options for individual and small groups. C4S STEM Transition Wor kshop In June 2020, FIU and Miami -Dade College facilitated a STEM Transfer workshop covering prerequisite completion and milestones, STEM careers, and transition tips, as well as a live chat and question and answer session with peers. The workshop offered virtually, recorded the highest attendance to date , 214 students, across two sessions. The virtual environment may have facilitate d more participation of information sharing and engagement for our students. In collaboration with Transfer and Transition Services, the C4S team will increase the number of scheduled transition workshops by adding at least two virtual options while maintaining the current number of in -person options.

As reflected in Table 4, FIU has a 67 % graduation rate for all full -time FTICs. This demonstrates an improvement of about 5.5% compared to the 61 .47% graduation rate reflected in the previous year's report. Male students in this group experienced a 3.92% increase in the graduation rate when compared to the previous year's report and the female student graduation rate has a larger increase by approximately 6.23%. There were increases in the number of Asian ( 74%, up from 65.73% ( 58%, up from 54.41% ) students that graduated. In comparing last academic year , the largest total increase in the number of full -time FTICs who graduated were Non -resident alien students and the second largest increase in Black students. There was a slight decrease in the number of Hispanic students (69%, down from 71.10% in 2013- 2019) that graduated . No American Indian/Alaska Native students graduate which is a decrease from 75% that graduate in the 2013- 2019 cohort.

This constituted a 7.4% increase in degrees awarded. During the same year, 6 0% of bachelor's degrees were awarded to female students and 40 % to male students, compared with 61% and 39% respectively in 2018 - 2019. During the 5 -year period from the 201 4-2015 Academic Year to the 2018- 2019 Academic Year, the number of degrees awarded increased by 28.20% . During the 2019 -2020 Academic Year , the percentage of bachelor's degrees awarded to each of the various racial and ethnic group s closely mirrored the percentages reported in the 201 8-2019 Academic Year with a 1% de crease of Non -resident alien graduates. However, it is important to note the increases in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanic students ( 7,839, up from 6,873 ), represent an increase of 8% respectively.

It is also an increase of 8.19% from five years ago (AY 2013- 2014). Of the total number of master's degrees awarded in AY 2019- 2020, females received 2,188, representing 63.46%, whereas males received 1,260 degrees or 36.54%. Hispanic students were awarded the largest number of master's degrees, a continuing trend here at FIU, with 1,844 conferrals representing 53.48% of the total number of master's degrees awarded. At 13.72% Black students and 13.54% Non -resident alien students represented the next largest percentages of the total number of master's degrees awarded. Asian students and White students accounted for 3.53% and 12.76% respectively, of the total number of master's degrees. Hispanic females represented the largest population with 34.04% of degrees awarded, followed by Hispanic males at 19.43%. Other larger group representations include Black females at 9.54%, Non -resid ent alien females at 7.8% and White females at 8%; Non -resident alien males at 5.74%, White males at 4.76%, and Black males at 4.18%. There were four master's degrees awarded to both American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islander student categories. This represents an increase from previous years. This has been the most in those categories at least in the last three years. From AY 2018 -2019 to AY 2019 -2020 the number of master's degrees awarded increased by 15.2% for Black males, 11.28% for Hispanic females, 8.94% for Hispanic males, 7.87% for Bl ack females , and 7.6% for Non -resident alien females.

Most, 39.69%, were awarded in the Non -resident alien category, a continuing trend from last academic year. The next largest category was that of Hispanic students with 26% of total doctoral degrees. This is a change from the previous year, where the second largest category was White students. Males represented 55.15% of the doctoral degrees and females represented 44.85%. There was a 14.71% dec rease in the representation of female students both in the number of degrees awarded and percentage representation since the last academic year and a 13.86% decrease from 2014- 2015. This is an area for improvement as the number of degrees awarded to female students has decreased . From AY 2018 -2019 to AY 2019- 2020 the number of doctoral degrees awarded increased by two for Black students and four for Hispanic students. The number of degrees decreased by 18 for Non -resident alien students and six for White students. There were no doctoral degrees awarded to Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native categories in AY 2019 -2020. Although there have been positive increases since the last academic year, increasing the number o f degrees awarded to Black and Asian students is an area for improvement.

The designation of \"First Professional Degrees\" represents degrees awarded through the College of Law (JD), the Herbert Wertheim of College of Medicine (MD), the Nicole Wertheim College Nursing and Health Sciences (DNP) , and Physical Therapy (DPT) programs . The number of degrees awarded in this category for AY 2019 -2020 was 365, a slight increase of 1.1% over AY 2018 -2019. Females received 56.71% of these degrees and males received 43.29%. Hispanic students represented the largest group, 43.29% of degree recipients, White students represented the second largest group with 32.6% of degree recipients. Asian degree recipients represented 9.04% and Black students represen ted 7.95%. As such, the larger group categories remained stable, compared to the previous year. There were two degrees awarded in the American Indian /Alaska Natives group, and one in the Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islander group. These numbers represent an increase from AY 2018- 2019, where there were no graduates in those group categories. There was a decrease of total degrees awarded to Non -resident alien students between AY 2018- 2019 and AY 2019- 2020 from three degrees to two. At FIU graduate student recruitment is part of the Enrollment Management Services portfolio. The University Graduate School (UGS) is primarily focused on supporting doctoral programs and attracting a diverse pool of highly qualified applicants. As such, UGS provides funding to doctoral programs to implement specific recruitment activities that require a cost- match from the Colleges in which they reside. One of UGS' requirements for funding allocation is that one or several activities must be targeted to the recruitment of underre presented minority students. Doctoral programs utilize these funds to participate in conferences that specifically target the Page 321 of 402 28 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT participation of minoritized students in their areas of research and visitations to HBCUs and other HSIs. An Inclusion Fellowship is presently offered at UGS. This fellowship was created to encourage promising undergraduate and master's students who are underrepresented minorities or people with disabilities, to pursue a Ph.D. degree. The Inclusion Fellowship supports Ph.D. students in any discipline for up to two years with another two years of funding provided by the graduate program through a teaching or research assistantship. Three fellowships were awarded in AY 2019 -2020. There was continued engagement by UGS with state and nat ional programs to encourage the participation of underrepresented minority students in graduate education. The Ronald E. McNair program is a Federal TRiO program designed to prepare students from low -income, first-generation, and traditionally under -repres ented groups for doctoral studies. At FIU we have 27 active McNair scholars every year of which approximately 30% transition to FIU for graduate studies. The FIU McNair and Undergraduate Research C onference was held in October 2019. We had over 200 underre presented STEM students from within and outside FIU attend. Three FIU doctoral students were awarded fellowships from The National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM) in AY 2019- 2020. FIU participated in the National Name Exchange (NNE). This is a consortium of fifty -five nationally -known universities which on an annual basis collect and exchange the names of talented underrepresented ethnic minority students who are in their sophomore, junior or senior y ear of their undergraduate education. The purpose of the exchange is to ensure that participating universities continue to identify a pool of qualified students who could be recruited to the graduate programs at these institutions. From the shared list of underrepresented minority students, we sent students communication about opportunities at FIU. As a result of our recruitment activities, FIU hosted 5 new fully funded McKnight Fellows and three Affiliate fellows starting in Fall Semester 2019. McKnight Fellows, who are Black and Hispanic doctoral students, receive a $12k stipend from the Florida Education Fund (FEF), in addition to a $12,000 enhancement and medical insurance supplement from UGS. During AY 2019 -2020 UGS supported 8 underrepresented mino rity students and provided professional development opportunities as fellows of the Bridge to the Doctorate program. This program is under the Florida -Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FG- LSAMP) to enhance recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM disciplines. In collaboration with the FIU Biomolecular Sciences Institute (BSI), UGS submitted and was awarded a National Institute of General Medicine (NIGMS) training grant (T32) to support 8 PhD students in transdisciplinary biomolecular sciences. For this program, we are specifically recruiting at FAMU and Bethune Cookman who agreed to support us in our efforts to increase the representation of Black students in our doctoral programs. The first cohort was appointed in Fall 2019 with 3 underrepresented minority fellows. The Willie Williams monetary award to recognize Achievements in Building Awareness and Strengthening Cultural Diversity in Higher Education was awarded by UGS to three doctoral students. The award rewards the contributions of graduate students who excel in utilizing Page 322 of 402 29 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT positive and pro -active communications to promote continued efforts in the areas of diversity and improved race relations in academia. In AY 2019 -2020 we also improved some of ou r processes and added programming to better serve students. Enhanced service to students in general, impacts equity in that UGS' services and programming are geared to improve retention and timely graduation rates, and to provide professional development assistance during students' graduate careers. For instance, UGS has consistently improved orientations (held in Fall and Spring) for incoming graduate students to be broader and more inclusive of policy review and updates and allowed for individualized st udent interaction with staff. A Graduate Program Director professional development program to strengthen the engagement of these faculty and enhance their mentoring skills was also initiated by UGS. This is essential to aid the retention of students. In formational workshops on policies and best practices were also offered by UGS. The University Graduate School addressed some wellness concerns, by providing programming to promote awareness of the mental health and wellness resources on campus. Although planned prior to FIU going remote due to the pandemic, this programming was additionally useful to students given the increased interest in these resources due to the socio -emotional effects of the pandemic. External faculty and professionals with specific expertise were hosted by UGS to provide a series of workshops to our graduate students in STEM, Social Sciences, and Humanities on identifying and applying for external funding sources. Areas for Improvement The University Graduate School at FIU primari ly manages theses and dissertation guidelines and policies, and some funding and programming for research degrees, as such these , are areas we impact. Master's Degrees Awarded Representation of groups obtaining master's degrees mirrors the local demographics and we would like to continue ensuring that this is the case. One area for improvement is the increase in the number of AI/AN (Native American or Indigenous) students in master's programs. Doctoral Degrees Awarded In previous years we have ide ntified recruitment and retention of Black and Hispanic doctoral students as a primary goal for our graduate programs, specifically STEM. Numbers in both groups rose slightly in AY 2019- 2020. We will continue to pursue strategies described in the Recruitm ent, Retention, and Support section of the narrative to increase representation. There was a decrease of 21 doctoral degrees awarded this year when compared to last year. This could be attributed to some of the concerns expressed by students about delays in their research in Spring and Summer 2020 due to the pandemic. This would impac t completion of their Page 323 of 402 30 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT dissertations and degrees. Examples include inability to collect data, needing to pivot to online data collection, inability to travel for research purposes, restrictions in going to the lab, and delays traveling back to the U .S. However , it would be useful to complete an analysis of factors that may affect attrition, as this impacts all doctoral categories of degrees awarded. Targeted Goals To increase the proportion of research doctorates awarded to Black students by 1% each year so that by AY21 -22 Black students will represent 9% of research doctorates awarded. To increase the proportion of research doctorates awarded to Hispanic students by 1% each year so that by AY21- 22 Hispanic students will represent 28% of research doctorates awarded. Action Plan Year 1 (AY 2020- 2021) and Year 2 (AY 2021 -2022) Master's Degrees: Working with local contacts to pursue recruitment in regional Native American communities (e.g. Seminole/Miccosukee) Doctoral Degrees: Continue to pursue strategies descr ibed in the Recruitment, Retention, and Support section of this narrative to increase representation. This includes programming, fellowships, tuition waivers, and other contributions to academic programs for direct student funding and recruitment. Assess the impact of UGS requirements for funding allocation related activities targeted to the recruitment of underrepresented minority students. Increase by 10% the number of underrepresented doctoral students that are supported by internal and external gr ants and fellowships. Complete an analysis to better understand attrition Strengthen recruitment at HBCU s With the establishment of the Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, institutional goals that will work towards fostering a culture of bel onging and towards eliminating disparities within the FIU community among underrepresented groups have been identified. These goals will also help improve the areas that have been identified as areas for improvement. The following goal has been established with tactics and strategies toward achieving the stated goals. REPRESENTATION : Recruit, Retain, and develop a Diverse Community PRIORITY: Graduate Students To achieve this, the university is researching and identifying barriers that impact the recruitment, retention , and graduation of historically underrepresented minorities - initially, with a focus on graduate students toward increasing the production of doctoral to the professoriate. Toward their retention, the focus will be on these areas : advising (academic, financial, and mental health) interaction with faculty and administrators Page 324 of 402 31 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT and curriculum. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES Identifying barriers that impact recruitment, admissions, and retention of doctoral students. Create an action plan to remedy and remove identified barriers to increased enrollment of underrepresented minority graduate and professional student body. Repor t by Fall, 2022 identifying recommendations of efforts to effectively restructure to remove barriers noted. TACTICS: Create platforms to conduct and engage in listening sessions with students. Create 'belonging' climate surveys and report findings and recommendations . Conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis of our current recruitment, enrollment, retention practices, and processes . Conduct listening sessions with Graduate Program Directors to understand their roles and challenges in recruitment as well as support to graduate students and their retention. Compile report to recommend actions to be conducted by Graduate Program Directors . Collaborate with HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) and other MSIs (minority- serving institutio ns) to recruit underrepresented minorities into our graduate programs. Launch visitation programs for underrepresented minority prospective undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Create a cohort model for underrepresented minority doctoral stu dents.

Academic Advising FIU students have equal access to utilize academic advising services. The university is particularly committed to providing equitable advising services to undergraduate students and employs a diverse staff of over 125 professional academic advisors who can serve as guides and mentors for the university's diverse student populatio n. All undergraduate students have access to an online advising platform (the Panther Success Network) that enables them to connect with an advisor and make advising appointments. Each student is assigned to a professional academic advisor from their acade mic department who is responsible for guiding their progress toward earning a degree. Graduate students are assigned to and work with faculty members from their respective disciplines. All students also have access to an online degree audit and other advis ing tools that provide information on degree requirements and track their progress toward completing their degree. Advising Services During Spring 2020, the university (and institutions throughout the U .S. and the world) was faced with an unprecedented challenge related to the outbreak of the COVID -19 virus. In March, all courses and services were moved to a remote/virtual format to comply with Executive Orders designed to keep the community safe and help r educe the spread of the virus. From an advising standpoint, that meant moving all advising appointments to online meetings utilizing the Zoom platform. Fortunately, the Panther Success Network advising system was already equipped to handle online/virtual a ppointments (since they also advise students who are enrolled in fully online programs), so the transition occurred quickly and relatively seamlessly. Since March 2020, students have utilized the Panther Success Network to send and receive messages to and from their academic advisors, as well as schedule and hold remote appointments. From March 16 through August 6, there were a total of 36,010 unique undergraduate advising appointments across all schools and colleges. Fall 2019 to Fall 2020 re - enrollment data showed that of students who attended an advising session during the academic year , 94% Hispanic students re -enrolled, 94% Black students re -enrolled, and 92% White students re -enrolled. Co llege Life Coaches met with 320 students during the 2019- 2020 year. Of those, 60.6% re -enrolled for Fall 2020: Hispanic students 60.8%; Black students 60.3%; White students 54.8%. In addition to meetings and communications with current FIU students, the academic advisors also successfully conducted orientation advising sessions for thousands of new freshmen and transfer students who enrolled for the first time at FIU in summer/fall (3, 752 freshmen and 4,724 transfer students). Students were first require d to complete the Virtual Orientation (VO), then register for the web-based in -person (zoom) session. During the in -person (zoom) session, students were first provided information about academic and student affairs, student financials, student conduct, an d academic integrity during a general session. Following the general sessions, students were divided into smaller groups based on major. Each group received an advising presentation specific to their program which was followed by individual meetings with a n academic advisor to discuss degree requirements and course selection in more detail. Page 326 of 402 33 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Some of the DEI -related training for academic advisors during the 2019 -2020 year included Safe Zone, Green Zone, Who Are Our Students, Disability Resources, and vario us brown bag lunches (veterans, LGBTQA, gender pronouns, students in recovery, etc.). Retention and Graduation Support/Student Success Outreach Initiatives During the 2019 -2020 academic year, the academic advising community actively participated in seve ral outreach campaigns designed to support student success and assist students with making positive progress toward their degrees. These included advising appointment campaigns to the 2019 FTIC students (September -November and February- May) to encourage Spring and Summer/Fall enrollment, as well as advising appointment campaigns to students approaching 90 credit hours to assist in mapping out the final semesters to graduation. Beginning Summer 2019, Academic and Career Success implemented a cohort track ing project. Each semester, Academic and Career Success provided the colleges with updated analysis on each of their FTIC students, with a focus on those students who are approaching or completing their fourth year. Each students' progress was tracked thro ugh indicators such as credits earned and in progress, GPA, remaining courses needed and their availability, future enrollment, financial concern, etc. Throughout the year, the advisors were asked to review each student in the 2016 FTIC cohort and indicate whether they are \"on track \" for four -year graduation. They worked with the students if/when any actions were needed to keep them on track for on -time graduation. Academic and Career Success supported the advisor's efforts in advocating for the students and removing any barriers to their success. This project has led to more targeted outreach and intervention and has ultimately contrib uted to an increase in four -year graduation. Beginning Summer 2020, the project shifted focus to the 2017 FTIC cohort. Recently, Academic and Career Success hired a Student Success Advocate and two Student Success Specialists to assist with supporting th e colleges in their student success efforts. The Student Success Advocate identifies targeted populations of students for retention and/or graduation -related outreach. The Student Success Specialists reach out to the students, document any barriers the stu dents are facing, and work closely with the Student Success Advocate to resolve pending barriers to success. Academic and Career Success also collaborates with the Colleges and advisors on their findings. Self-Assessment: Excellence in Academic Advising In Spring 2018, FIU was selected to participate in a self -study of undergraduate academic advising, as part of a national project called Excellence in Academic Advising (EAA). The project is a joint initiative between the John N. Gardner Institute for Exc ellence in Undergraduate Education and NACADA: The Global Community for Academic Advising. Twelve charter institutions across the country were selected to participate and were guided through a comprehensive, standards -based assessment process of decision -making, planning, and implementation that promotes excellence in academic advising. For more information, please see https://nacada.ksu.edu/Programs/Excellence -in-Academic -Advising.aspx . At the beginning of Fall 2019, an academic advising survey was electronically sent to all active undergraduate students and all university employees to assess the perceptions and experiences of students, f aculty /staff who have advising responsibilities, and f aculty /staff who do not have Page 327 of 402 34 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT advising responsibilities. The academic advising surveys were designed to elicit feedback from key stakeholders in the institution and were directly related to the Key Performance Indicators within the nine Conditions of Excellence in Academic Advising . The Academic Advising team received 830 responses from students. Tekla Nicolas, Ph.D., Senior Researcher with FIU's Analysis and Information Management (AIM) division, conducted an in -depth analysis of the student survey qualitative results. In summary, \"students tell us about the most important thing for advisors to do is to guide them and prepare them to successfully complete the journey to graduation and into a career. A review of both positive and negative comments displayed a common set of advising needs to guide students to graduation and beyond. Responses indicated that these needs were very well satisfied for some students, but for others, they were frustratingly absent or difficult to access. This suggests that the advising community is equipped with an opportunity to take the best of academic advising at FIU and ensure it is broadly and equitably available across academic units, campuses, and learning modalities. Students emphasized the need for consistent and reliable information, accessible when needed through flexible modalities, delivered with encouragement and support for the student's goals and aspirations. At best, advising goes beyond the basics, of course, plannin g to include the development of habits for success, support through setbacks, and celebration of achievements\" . An additional 224 survey responses from faculty and staff were received . While a comprehensive analysis was still being completed, the members of the Conditions committees reviewed raw data as evidence when discussing their recommendations. At the end of Fall 2019, the EAA task force held a retreat to share findings of each of the nine Conditions, review FIU data and survey results, and discuss recommendations. In Spring 2020, the academic advising team finalized the Cohort I report for EAA, outlining the task force recommendations. The n ext steps include working with the Task Force and the Advising Council to prioritize the recomm endations and create working groups to evaluate all implementation strategies through the lens of diversity, access, and equity, as work with the EAA proceeds with the second cohort during the 2020- 2021 year. For the 2020 -2021 reporting year , the feasibility of offering a mentorship program will be explored to support students on a university -wide basis and help with engagement and retention. T he student academic advising surve y, administered as part of the EAA process, will be replicated annually so that feedback can be provided to each college. Advising Organizational Structure and Personnel FIU utilizes a decentralized advising system for all undergraduate students that relies on a team of professional academic advisors and receives support and coordination from a centralized team of administrators and technological support. As previously mentioned, graduate students receive their advising and academic support from the faculty mentors and administrative staff of their respective academic departments. Centralized advising efforts are coordinated by the Associate Provost for Academic and Career Success and her team of student success administrators. That team includes an Associate Director who is charged with working with all the academic units and providing support to all undergraduate professional academic advisors. Her responsibilities also include developing and coordinating training sessions for newly hired advisors, and pro fessional development workshops that are offered to all academic advisors and advising leads throughout the year. Page 328 of 402 35 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT That Associate Director also supervises a Manager of Academic Support S ervices , two Student Success Specialists , and a team of College Life Coaches who provide additional support to the academic advising community and to students who need additional assistance with staying on track. The Associate Provost also supervises a team dedicated to Academic Advising Technolo gy, which includes the use of several tools that support advisors' ability to manage their advising caseloads. In addition, the Associate Provost supervises two additional staff members who work to support the academic units' efforts to utilize predictive analytics to identify students who need additional support and develop reporting mechanisms that allow the institution to track our progress on improving retention and on -time graduation rates. This centralized support has created a unique situation in whi ch our decentralized advising system not only functions effectively but also ensure a level of consistency (across academic units) that is normally more difficult for universities to achieve. As part of the decentralized advising system, FIU relies on ov er 125 professional academic advisors who report directly to academic administrators who oversee the advising initiatives for each of the respective academic colleges /schools. Those academic administrators participate in a university -wide policy group call ed the Council for Undergraduate Academic Advising that meets monthly to discuss academic policies and procedures. They also participate in an ad hoc group of \"advising leads\" who meet regularly with the central administration to discuss issues and concern s related to academic advising. Through these efforts, the university ensure s that students in each of the academic units receive comparable advising support and that academic policies are applied equitably across academic units. The Associate Provost and her team also monitor the advising ratios for each of the professional advisors throughout the university. In doing, advising ratios have decreased to around 400 students (on average) for each advisor, a number that will continue decreasing .

Admission t o Academic Programs Strive for College FIU was accepted as a partner with Strive for College; an online platform that provides mentoring, guidance , and college discovery to high school students who are the first in their famil ies to go through the college search, application , and enrollment process. There are only three (3) Strive for College Institutions in Florida. Strive for College provides colle ge partners with the opportunity to connect with students and mentors through an online learning community and fac e-to-face interaction. First- generation college students connect with not only colleges and universities, but also mentors who are leaders in the industry to learn not only about the college search and selection process but also have someone guide them through to graduation. Strive for College has proven results, 97% of the high school students, \"Strivers\" went to college and 84% of them attende d a four -year institution. FIU is highlighted on the \"I'm First!\" website and in the \"I'm First\" Guide to College. High schools around the country receive the guide as well as access to the Strive for College platform , therefore, connecting first -generat ion college students with access to FIU and the resources the university has to offer. FIU also benefits from professional development initiatives such as best- practice webinars and a supportive learning community with 135 like-minded institutions providin g equity and access to higher education.

The staff use data mining tools from the CollegeBoard and Hobsons to determine which high schools to visit and college fairs to attend. FIU staff goals are based on the universi ty strategic plan and BOG metrics and are also based on the mission of FIU. Out -of-state recruitment is limited to urban areas around Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, Washington DC, and Illinois. In -state recruitment is focused on South Florida, Hillsborough County, Orange County, and Duval County, and larger cities. Golden Promise FIU implemented the Golden Promise in 2018 ; this is a commitment to entering FTIC with an EFC of $0 that the university will meet 100% of their tuition and fees with grants and scholarship aid. Th is program help s to reduce the number of loans that these students will have to secure (if any). Students with the Golden Promise can stack this award with funds from Raise .Me or Florida Bright Futures , therefore, meeting the needs of books and supplies as well. Approximately 1/3 of the incoming freshman class receives the Golden Promise. Other Efforts FIU's Office of Admissions is a prominent fixture in community -based organization events. Staff have hosted free college application workshops, financial aid workshops, and college search workshops for Breakthrough Miami, I Have a Dream, and 5000 Role Models, Inc. and have actively participated in college fairs in the community thro ugh the Seminole Tribe of Florida, 100 Black Men of Jacksonville, and the Black Brown College Bound Summit. The o ffice also supports the community by engaging with the students at the events such as the Honey Shine, Inc. Hats Off Luncheon. Enrollment Management and Services in partnership with the Office of Admissions also hosts Miami -Dade County Public Schools Counselors at the FIU MLK Annual Breakfast. The school counselors in attendance feel like it allows them to get to know the faculty , staff , and students at a deeper level. It also helps them to understand FIU's commitment to diversity. School counselors know that FIU doesn't solely use \"access\" as a mission statement but lives \"in access\" by providing opportunities to a variety of students re gardless of their race or ethnicity. Participation and presentations regarding diversity, equity , and access have been presented by FIU Office of Admission staff members at the following professional organization national conferences: National Association for College Admission Counseling's Guiding the Page 337 of 402 44 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Way to Inclusion; College Board's A Dream Deferred.

Counseling and Student Health Services The Student Health Fee funds several student support departments which are managed across two separate divisions. The Division of Academic Student Affairs oversees Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), the Healthy Living Program (HLP), and the Victim Empowerment Program (VEP), among others. CAPS, HLP, and VEP provide mental health and health education/promotion services. The Student Clinics, managed by the FIU Health Care Network (HCN) provide students with primary medical care. All registered students who pay the student health fee for the corresponding semester have access to services offered by these four departments. Through these collective programs and services, SHW helps students lead healthier and more fulling lives. Note: The data presented in this report are from two separate electronic medical records; the Student Clinics and the Healthy Living Program both utilize PyraMED Health Systems, while CAPS and VEP utilize Titanium. Student Health and Wellness Overview Student Health and Wellness (SHW), housed within the Division of Academic and Student Affairs, helps students succeed both personally and academ ically. Recognizing each student is an individual with different needs, SHW programs and services emphasize the nine dimensions of wellness, educating students about building their personal toolbox of skills they can use to enhance their overall wellbeing . Dimensions of wellness : 1. Cultural 2. Emotional 3. Environmental 4. Financial 5. Intellectual 6. Occupational 7. Physical 8. Social 9. Spiritual Student Clinics and Healthy Living Program Equity data fiscal year 2019 -2020 The Student Clinics and the Healthy Living Program continue to provide services to all registered students who paid the health fee. As anticipated, most students who accessed services were between the ages of 18 -25, congruent with a college student population. Services were primarily accessed by female students, accounting for 68.05% of all encounters. Over half of the appointments seen were for Hispanic students (53.15%), followed by White (16.20%) and Black students (15.64%). The students who access se rvices had similar demographics to the FIU AIM dashboard for the 2019- 2020 academic year. Page 339 of 402 46 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Table 8 .

At HLP, 93% strongly agreed with this statement. I felt comfortable and safe in the building. 89.19% agreed with this statement. Recommendations: Continue to monitor patient satisfaction to ensure students c an provide feedback about inclusivity. Consider adding questions to the patient satisfaction survey to evaluate the climate within the student health areas.

Initiatives around equity include students, staff, supervisors, and the university as a whole. As such, statistics in these four areas are discussed below , including their current statuses as well as future direct ions. Finally, the CAPS/VEP team recogniz es that creating and sustaining a department that validates and values the many intersecting identity variables of students and employees is a journey and not a destination and is committed to ongoing learning and continued efforts to make the department a place that \"feels different\" to students and employees when it comes to a truly equitable environment. Race, Ethnic ity, and Gender In terms of race, ethnicity, and gender, enrollment data at the university level is compared to utilization data at CAPS/VEP. Utilization percentage was higher than enrollment percentage among students who identify as Black/African American female (+2.84%), Hispanic female (+3.04%), Multi -Racial female (+3.07%), and White female (+3.73%). Utilization percentage was lower than enrollment percentage among students who identify as Hispanic males ( -11.57%). Age In terms of age, enrollment data at the university level is compar ed to utilization data at CAPS/VEP. Utilization percentage was higher than enrollment percentage among students in the 22 -25 years age range (+5.8%) and the 26 -30 years age range (2.7%). The u tilization percentage was lower for students under 18 years old ( -4.1%) and over 39 years old ( -3.9%). Staff In terms of intersecting identities, efforts have been made to have a team that is representative of the student body. As such, enrollment data at the university level is compared to the staff identity variable at CAPS/VEP. Staff representation was higher than enrollment representation for people identifying as Black female (+13.44%), Black male (+4.45%), Hispanic female (+5.92%), Multiracial female (+4.80%), White female (+6.38%), and Whi te male (+4.62%). Staff representation was lower than enrollment representation for people identifying as Hispanic male ( -24.39%) and as being part of the LGBTQ+ community (estimated - 4% to - 8%). [While FIU enrollment data does not capture the percentage o f students who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community, national statistics suggest that as many as 13% - 17% of college students fall into this category ( https://pnpi.org/lgbtq -students- in-higher - education/,https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/2019_tables/students_by_sexual_i dentity.htm )] Page 342 of 402 49 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT 4. Club and Intramural Athletics1 The FIU Intramural Sports program (IM), through the commitment of the Division of Student Affairs Department of Recreation Services, fosters student development in important life skills such as leadership, competitiveness, teamwork, and sportsmanship. In s upport of the mission of the university and the Division of Student Affairs, Recreation Services promotes active, healthy lifestyles for FIU's vibrant and diverse community through quality participation opportunities, educational experiences, and support services. Through intramurals, students of all backgrounds are encouraged to practice a balanced lifestyle while developing habits that have a positive impact on their physical health and fitness. Club and Intramural Athletics Services To increase women's participation in 2019- 2020, IM implemented specific marketing to target previous female and open participants to fill women's leagues. Additionally, IM adjusted the schedule based on previous feedback from participants in women's leagues so that the days a nd times that women's leagues were offered were adjusted to accommodate more women . Additionally, IM added more sport s offerings that had leagues and divisions classified as Open - leagues where the gender composition of teams is not a factor for play. For future efforts to continue increasing female participation, there will be benchmark ing on Intramural Sports and Sport Clubs programs to develop assessment tools that fall within NIRSA industry standards. Finally , more Open leagu es will be offered to reduce barriers to female participation. While the number of female and male teams dropped from 18 -19 to 19 -20 by -2.27% and -7.66% respectively, there was growth when it came to overall male and female unique participants by 20.01% . Additionally, open teams increased by 451.47% from 18 -19 to 19- 20. The changes in these numbers are attributed to the program intentionally reducing barriers to participation by eliminating the IM Sports Pass, and updating policies regarding jewelry and participant equipment, which historically has presented as barriers for female participation. Additionally, more open leagues were offered in 19 -20 than in 18 -19. Lastly, a new policy change was implemented that allowed Greek participants to play in not on ly the Greek -specific leagues but also in the Men's and Women's divisions. Covid -19 also impacted the overall team numbers in that some leagues and tournaments were canceled. Women's Sport Clubs participants experienced another year of growth by 5.26%. Wh ile overall Sport s club team numbers stayed the same from 2018- 2019 to 2019 -2020, the make -up of the organizations changed. Cycling, Golf, Mixed Martial Arts, Men's Volleyball , and Run clubs were eliminated , and Handball, Kendo, Scuba, Spikeball , and Tennis Clubs were added . The added clubs were all co -ed clubs, which contributed to the increase in female participants. 1 Report on Sex Equity only.

This effort will be accomplished through the IM Sports End of Year Participant Feedback Survey, as well as from feedback from staff members. Additionally, 2020- 2021 is when the Esports program will be launched, which will include intramural sport offerings, as well as establishing an Esports s port c lub in both virtual and in -person spaces. With the addition of this program offering, the expectation is that not o nly overall participation and team numbers will increase , but more specifically unique participants will increase, by targeting and includ ing a different demographic of students.

Student Financial Assistance The Office of Financial Aid administers student financial aid in accordance with federal and state laws, regulations, and guidelines as well as institutional policies and procedures. The office is audited annually to ensure federal and state aid programs are properly managed and funds are timely disbursed to students. The 2019- 2020 Federal Student Financial Aid Audit, the most recent audit, reported no findings for FIU. In terms of benchmarking, this office compares its full -time, first time degree seeking undergraduates receiving ai d against the national average derived for four -year public Title IV institutions. It strive s to exceed 80% of the national average of students who receive federal, state , and institutional aid. The chart below illustrates the university's favorable comp arison when applying the 80% threshold. FIU's Golden Promise program, which began in the 2017 -2018 Academic Year, guaranteeing incoming FTIC Florida Residents with a 0 EFC that 30 credits of tuition and fees would be covered with a combination of Federal, State, and Institutional Scholarships and Grants, continues. Renewal requires a 2.0 GPA and completion of 30 credits each academic year inclusive of Summer Term. Through the 2019 -2020 academic y ear, 4,181 students were in the program.

Housing The Department of Housing and Residential Life at FIU offers residential students a vibrant and diverse living and learning experience. Its diversity statement is as follows: The diversity of our residential community takes many forms. It includes differences related to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, religion, age, and ability. We believe that any form of discrimination against any individual or group is a threat to the welfare of the ent ire community. We are guided by the belief that celebrating diversity enriches and empowers the lives of all people. Therefore, everyone who chooses to live in or visit our residential communities must understand that we will not tolerate any form of bigot ry, harassment, intimidation, threat, or abuse, whether verbal or written, physical or psychological, direct or implied.

Residential Curriculum: The Department of Housing and Residential Life recognizes th e essential role diversity plays in being worlds ahead. To this end, it intentionally develop s communities where all members can integrate key academic, social, and recreational experiences that inform their diverse being. During the 2019 -2020 academic year, FIU Housing and Residential Life continued using a curricular approach across all residen tial communities. As defined in the learning goals below, diversity and equity were elements embedded in each of the goals. Educational Priority: As a result, of living on -campus students will be leaders serving the local and global communities. Learn ing Goals: Personal Development - Residents will engage in self -discovery by exploring their identities, values, and purpose. Community - Residents will understand and appreciate living in a multi -cultural area where they will grow and communicate across differences, and work towards respect amongst each other. Social Justice - Residents will become aware of themselves by engaging in soc ial discourse to create inclusive communities, advocate for equity, and immerse themselves in other cultures and belief systems. Global Responsibility - Residents will participate in a learning environment, where they will reflect on the challenges in all communities, gain skills to advocate for others, and engage globally. Strategies: Page 348 of 402 55 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Residential Life staff w as charged with implementing a variety of strategies to meet learning outcomes associated with the above goals. Student employees engaged in structured international interactions to engage students around select scaffolded and sequenced topics around diversity as described below: Personal Development - individual identities and intersectionality Community - community identifies and multi -culturalism Social Justice - inclusivity and equity around diversity Global Responsibility - advocacy around diversity Self-Assessment: Housing Assessment o f Diversity Initiatives Housing and Residential Life uses the Skyfactor Resident Satisfaction Survey to assess if students are having meaningful diverse interactions while living on campus. Its current overall score for the category of diverse interactions is a mean score of 5.29. The goal is to have a mean score of 5.5 or above. This is based on the following three ( 3) survey questions: 1. To what degree has your on -campus housing experience helped you: Interact with residents who are different from you (i.e., race, gender, beliefs) . Achieved a mean score of 5.42. 2. To what degree has your on -campus housing experience helped you: Understand other residents by putting yourself in their place. Achieved a mean score of 5.16. 3. To what degree has your on -campus housing exper ience helped you: Benefit from the interactions with residents who are different from you . Achieved a mean Score of 5.30. The assessment goal for the 2020 -2021 report year is to achieve a 5.5 or above for each of these three questions. The action plan to achieve this is : prioritizing inclusivity and equity around diversity in our residential curriculum ; creating programs and activities to raise awareness around issues of inclusivity and equity ; a commitment to talking directly with students from marginalized populations about their experiences on campus and in the dorms and using the information to create more inclusive environments ; and address ing behaviors around bias, hate, or intolerance promp tly. Page 349 of 402 56 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT 7. Student Employment FIU offers a significant amount of employment opportunities for our students. A large portion of the employee population (approximately 30%) are students. A study in the FIU libraries has continued to demonstrate a strong correlation between on -campus jobs and graduation success. The Career Ready program, developed by a multi -disciplinary council from Human Resources, Student Affairs, the Office of Academic and Career Success, the Office of Analysis and Information Management, and the Office of Alumni Affairs, offers convenient on -campus job opportunities to students, provides relevant job experience, and professional development at different leve ls, which will assist students once they graduate. The Career Ready team has performed many different outreach and marketing activities and events to increase the structure and formalize student employment opportunities. The program collaborated with univ ersity departments and colleges by attending several student development -focused events and initiating conversations with student advisors for success. On - campus employment provides career preparation so that students can compete for well -paying jobs upon graduation. The events attended expanded knowledge about student employment and provided services for incoming freshmen, transfer students, and alumni support. Alignment of Career Ready in these events reduced duplications of effort and increased communica tion regarding internal and external job , internship, and apprenticeship opportunities. The Career Ready team met with several Deans and Colleges. They were able to inform Career and Talent Development about the dashboard for accountability to work in tand em with the Division of Human Resources efforts to place student employees as well as Federal Work -Study students into roles aligned with their respective majors or, at minimum, provide a substantive work experience with transferrable skills they can use i n the workplace. Other professional development feedback of students based on the professional opportunity, additional job codes were created to better categorize them and be able to prioritize the placement based on seniority. In addition to creating new job codes, Human Resources partnered with Academic and Career Success to create student badges and to place their students in a role that better aligned the employment opportunity with their majors. As a result, every college assigned teams that intentionally aligned their opportunities for their student employees and monitor student employment for the college. The C areer Ready team collaborated and attended the following events: July 2019 Career Ready Strategy/Metrics Meeting with Assistant Vice President, Academic & Student Affairs Wellness and Recreation Center Student Pay with Student Affairs Career Ready Student hiring training for Supervisors Chartwells University Relations Meetin g DASA Internship Taskforce - Meeting with CTD and HR Page 350 of 402 57 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Career Ready/Post -Grad Course Meeting with Assistant Vice President, Academic & Student Affairs Career Council Meeting Career and Talent Resume Writing Session FIU Career Ready Program/Dashboard w ith Paden Goldsmith August 2019 Career Ready/Post -Grad Course Meeting with Assistant Vice President, Academic & Student Affairs Chartwell's Campus Recruiter Meeting Freshman Convocation September 2019 Chartwells Partnership: Career Ready Meeting FIU HR + Career Meeting for Recent Alumni Support with Career and Talent Development Career Bash BBC Campus FIU Fall Technical Career Fair FIU Fall All Majors Career Fair Post -Grad Metric with Assistant Vice President, Academic & Student Affairs October 2019 Student Engagement Fair 2019 November 2019 Post -Grad Meeting with Assistant Vice President, Academic & Student Affairs January 2020 FIU Freshman Student Orientation Meeting with CASE Advising and Career Ready Program February 2020 FIU STEMCon: Career & Next Steps Resource Fair University -Wide Post -Grad Updates Meeting with Assistant Vice President, Academic & Student Affairs FIU Technical Career Fair Mission 200 - Jobs for Students with Chartwells and Felicia Townsend Event Protocol Training March 2020 Career Crash Course - Resume Station April 2020 Bender Virtual Disability Career Fair The following two tables include the number of student employees at all FIU campuses in the 2010- 2020 academic year, based on their gender and ethnicity group.

Giving students a structured environment with the necessary tools to assist with their professional development is instrumental to making them more employable with relevant work experience. This includes the need to develop a student specific performance evaluation instrument to provide structured feedback that was more meanin gful, and job related. Page 352 of 402 59 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT 8. Educational and Work Environment On June 12, 2020, as communities across the nation spoke out against racial injustice and inequality, the Equity Action Initiative (EAI) was commissioned by President Rosenberg. The EAI was a call to action to help improve the climate for and reality of equality, dignity, inclusion, and belonging. The universit y renewed its commitment to play a key role in social justice and equal opportunity. A core advisory group was tasked to review options and initiatives that could help FIU reform and improve the approach to our work. They worked collaboratively and consul ted widely - both inside and outside of FIU - on specific initiatives that would help reduce and eliminate disparities and inequities in our work environment. This group solicit ed advice, suggestions, position papers, data analysis, and evidence to include in their recommendations. They examine d, consider ed, and presented initiatives focused on our community, our police, access to higher education, and FIU. Florida International University values diversity, equity, and inclusion as integral to its mission as a student -centered public research university strongly focused on learning, research, entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity so that its graduates are prepared to succeed in a global market. FIU embraces and strives to ensure that a diversity of cultures, races and ethnicities, genders, political and religious beliefs, physical and learning differences, sexual orientations, and identities are thriving on our campus and within our community. FIU recognize s its responsibility to foster an ope n, welcoming, and inclusi ve environment of belonging.

Sex Equity in Athletics - Areas for Improvement Areas for improvement Program for improvement Timetable Participation rates, male and female, compared with full- time undergraduate enrollment Although good progress and efforts continue , the female participation rates are lower than female undergraduate enrollment. The enrollment of female undergraduate students from 2019- 20 increased slightly from 57. 02% to 5 7.21% and the female student -athlete participation rate decreased from 53.20% to 51.64% in 2019- 2020. Although the COVID -19 pandemic hindered the ability to invite female walk -ons at the same rate and the concern will extend to next year , the gap with a 5.57% difference will be decreased in 2020 - 2021 with the discontinuation of the men's indoor track program. FIU has discontinued the men's indoor track program effective spring 2020 which will also improve participation numbers for 2020- 2021. Significant differences exist between the baseball and softball facilities. For example, the baseball facility has an impressive fa\u00e7ade and softball facility does not. The softball facility lacks concessions, box office, videoboard, suites, weight room , and indoor batting cage. Additionally, the batting cage, windscreens , and fencing need repairs. Repair/replace fencing, windscreens , and outdoor batting cage to provide optimal conditions for practicing. Secure an architect to create a concept design plan and provide pricing estimate to create fa\u00e7ade and entrance, build a concession stand, add videoboard, create indoor batting space an d suite to enhance the softball facility. Design and build a new fa\u00e7ade/entrance and concession area to enhance the entrance and amenities to the softball facility. Installation of videoboard display at the softball facility.

Page 363 of 402This page intentionally left blank 70 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT The number of tenured faculty is a measure of faculty retention which depends on opportunities for professional development and having a supportive departmental and institutional climate. An increase in the number of tenured faculty means that the number of newly tenured faculty is greater than the number of tenured f aculty leaving the institution. A decrease means the opposite: that the number of newly tenured f aculty is less than those leaving the institution. The number of newly tenured f aculty each year depends on both the number of faculty with successfu l applications and on the number of tenure -track f aculty hired six years prior. Table 1 of Part V shows that between 2019 and 2020, the number of tenured f aculty remained relatively flat. The number of female tenured faculty remained the same at 171 while there was a net decrease of 3 (1%) in the number of male f aculty from 532 to 529. Our records indicate that 14 women successfully applied for tenure the previous year (AY 2018 -2019, so rank change effective Fall 2020) which may indicate that there was an equal number of tenured women leaving the institution. Similarly, there were 26 men tenured in AY 2018- 2019, which means that 29 tenured men left FIU before Fall 2020. Breakdown by race/ethnicity shows that there was an increase in the number of Black tenured faculty from 25 to 27 (8%) and in White faculty from 308 to 309 (less than 1%). There was one Black person (male) tenured in AY 2018 -2019 so the increase indicates there was also a tenure d faculty hired with tenure in this category. The decreases in tenured faculty occurred primarily in the number of Hispanic faculty , a total of 5, down to 63 from 68 (7%), with the only other category showing a loss being American Indian (AI)/Alaskan Native (AN) from 1 to 0 (100%). Five Hispanic faculty were tenured the year prior so there was a loss of another 10 tenured Hispanic f aculty between 2019 and 2020. No AI/AN faculty were tenured in AY 2018 -2019. The number of As ian faculty remained the same at 120, but as 10 were tenured the previous year, this indicates that another 10 left the institution as well. These one- year differences contrast with the 5 -year changes seen since 2015. There was a 5 -year increase of 37 tenu red faculty (8%) at FIU, from 492 in 2015 to 529 in 2020. This is an average increase of 9.25 f aculty /year not seen during the reporting year when there was a decrease of 3. Twenty of the 37 -person increase in tenured faculty were female (13%) and 17 (5%) were male. The largest increase in race/ethnicity in numbers was in White f aculty (from 282 to 309; a change of 27, or 10%), with the next largest in number being Asian, up 16 (15%). There was a decrease in the number of Hispanic faculty over the past five years, from 69 to 63 (6 f aculty or 9%) but note that almost all that change was in the past year (5 faculty ). The number of NH/OPI over the five -year period remained steady at 1, as did the number of Black faculty at 27 (although there was a decrease of two from 2017- 2019, there was an increase of 2 from 2019 - 2020). The largest percentage change, 100%, was the loss of the only two AI /AN tenured f aculty over the five years. The data show that FIU has done well in increasing the percentage of tenured female f aculty and Asian faculty over the five- year period from 2015 -2020. However, by the numbers, the largest increase was still in White f aculty over the five years (27 of the 37). The small change in Faculty numbers in the reporting year of 2019 -2020 makes it hard to look for trends, but the Page 364 of 402 71 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT increase of 2 Black faculty is encouraging given their small overall numbers, while the increase in Hispanic faculty in this timeframe is a positive change. Increases in the number of tenure -track (TT) f aculty are due to hiring new TT faculty at a rate higher than the losses from this category. Losses are due either to Faculty leaving the institution or to successfull y being tenured. More information on the status and outcomes of tenure applicants is supplied in the previous section . The data show that there was a marked increase in the total number of TT f aculty in the reporting year of 26 f aculty (15%) bringing the number to 203. As 40 faculty were successfully tenured starting in Fall 2020 (so left this cohort), that indicates that 66 new tenure -track faculty were hired. However, this is still 27 ( -12%) below the number from five years ago (230 ). Page 365 of 402 72 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 2021 EQUITY REPORT Table 3.

Page 366 of 402This page intentionally left blank 73 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Unlike TT f aculty , non -tenure- track (NTT) faculty remain in the same category throughout their careers and so changes in the numbers solely reflect hires and departures. Table 3 of Part V indicates that there was a small increase of 3% (19 f aculty ) in the total number of NTT f aculty from 647 to 666 between 2019 and 2020. However, there was a much larger increase in the five- year numbers, up from 510, or 31%. There has been an effort to improve student success by hiring more full -time teaching -focused f aculty over this period which could be responsible for this large increase. The effort has paid off, with increases in FIU's 4 and 6 - year graduation rates indicating students are proceeding through their required curricula more quickly due to increased mastery of the material and therefore pass rates. In the gender category, the five- year percentage changes are essentially the same for women and men at 31% (85 women) and 30% (71) men. The one -year is quite different, with an increase of 20 women (6%) up to 355, and a decrease of 1 man (<1%) to 311 total . Historically, women have occupied a larger percentage of NTT positions nationally, and this happens at FIU also, with little change in the overall distribution in 5 years: women were 54% of NTT f aculty in 2015 and are 53% in 2020. Looking at the changes in race/ethnicity over the 5- year time period, the largest numerical increase is in the number of Hispanic NTT f aculty , with 67, a 50% increase. This is followed by White f aculty at 40 (15%), and then n on-resident alien with 15 (44%). There was an increase of 14 Black faculty which translates to 34%, and 12 Asian f aculty (40%). For those reporting two more or races, the change is from 4 to 9, a 125% increase, and for AI /AN, the number increased from 1 to 4, a change of 300%. Note that although the percentage changes are large, this is because of the small overall numbers in these underrepresented categories. Over the one- year reporting period, the largest numerical increas e in a racial/ethnic category is for White f aculty at 11, but that is only a 4% increase due to their large numbers (305). The next largest gain was in Black f aculty at 6 from 49 to 55, a 12% increase which is higher than the yearly average over the five -year period. There were increases in f aculty declaring Non -resident alien (2, 4%) and AI/AN (1, 33%), while there was no change in the numbers of Asian (42), two or more (9), or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, which remains at 0. Although Hispanic faculty showed the largest 5- year numerical increase, there was a loss of one, from 203 to 202, for this year. has been a recent increase of 2% in the number of female representation in Executive/Administrative/Managerial employees at FIU. In Fall 2020, fe males represented 6 2% of Executive/Administrative/Managerial employees, which was a slight increase from the 61.6% figure of the previous year. All racial and ethnic groups experienced a percentage increase compared to Fall 2019; the only exception to this trend was in the White racial group, which saw a slight decrease of 3% , and the Two or More group with a n 11% decrease from the previous year. The most significant percentage increases were among Non -resident aliens (100%) and those who identified as American Indiana/Alaska Native (100%) . These increases can be attributed to the university providing various opportunities for the executive/administrative/managerial career development for f aculty , including the President's Leadership Program (PLP) , the Educational Leadership Enhancement Program (ELEP ), and the Leadership Education Advancement Page 367 of 402 74 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Program (LEAP) . LinkedIn Learning is also available and provide s FIU faculty , staff and students access to an online vide o library that features business, software, technology , and creative skills. One of those in -house resources includes the FIU's Chair Advisory Council which is composed of all department chairs at FIU and promotes institutional awareness and shared mission and purpose while giving them a platform to discuss issues and ideas related to departmental governance and management. Our Office of F aculty Leadership and Success in collaboration with the Office of the General Counsel has also initiated a series of Chair Tools of the Trade workshops which address different aspects of the chair responsibilities. These workshops often employ engaging case study scenarios which guide chairs on how to appropriately mitigate conflict and promote compliance with university po licies and procedures. The Office of Faculty Leadership and Success also initiate its inaugural Chair Leadership Development Program for the academic year 2020- 2021.

REPRESENTATION : Recruit, Retain, and develop a Diverse Community PRIORITY: Administrators (Administrator Level 3 and above) To achieve this, we are researching and identifying barriers that impact the recruitment, promotion, and retention of underrepresented minority administrators toward increasing the acceleration of opportunities among the underrepresented minority leaders in the FIU population. Toward their retention, we are focusing on the areas of: belonging (inclusive of mental health) affinity and rewards and recognition. 3 A goal in the minority section represents placement goals in the Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races. Page 369 of 402 76 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: Identifying barriers that impact the mobility of qualified underrepresented minority administrators. Create action plans to remedy and remove identified barriers to increased acceleration opportunities . Create a r eport identifying recommendation s of efforts to effectively restructure to remove barriers noted. TACTICS: Restore certification of interview pools . Establish search committee participation in completing STRIDE training for administrators. Ensure D iversity A dvocates are participants in search committees. Create platforms to engage in listening sessions with underrepresented minority employees. Support the creation of relevant affinity groups. Create 'belonging' climate surveys and report findings and recommendations. Conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis of our current recruitment, promotion, and retention processes. Conduct listening sessions with underrepresented minority employees to understand their roles and challenges in promotional opportunities and their retention in current/existing opportunities. Compile report to recommend actions to be conducted by supervisors/managers. Establish voluntary mentoring programs connecting administrators with mentors from both, dominant groups and underrepresented minority groups who will advocate for participating underrepresented administrators. PRIORITY: Underrepresented Minority Faculty To achieve this, FIU is researching and identifying barriers that impact the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority faculty as well as other historically underrepresented minorities - initially, with a focus on increasing these faculty among our population. Towar d their retention, the focus will be on the areas of 1) belonging (inclusive of mental health) ; 2) affinity; 3) and rewards and recognition. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES : Identifying barriers that impact recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority faculty . Create action plans to remedy and remove identified barriers to increased retention of underrepresented minority f aculty . Create a r eport identifying recommendations and remedies of efforts to effectively restructure to remove barriers noted. Page 370 of 402 77 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT TACTI CS: Establish underrepresented minority f aculty Associations and other affinity groups for underrepresented minorities to build affinity within their areas of interest. Create platforms to engage in listening sessions with underrepresented minority f aculty . Create 'belonging' climate surveys and report findings and recommendations. Conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis of our current recruitment, retention, and promotion processes . For f aculty improvements, additional institutional context is provided here for a better understanding of the strategies used in developing f aculty recruitment, hiring, and professional development programs. These initiatives were initially developed to address issues identified in an internal climate survey condu cted in 2010 and the COACHE Faculty Satisfaction Survey in 2011. The COACHE survey, administered by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, assesses faculty satisfaction on 25 measures including appreciation, departmental collegiality, mentoring, work re sources, leadership, governance, teaching, and benefits. It compares the responses of FIU f aculty to those of f aculty at five peer institutions selected by the participating institution and to a 110 -member cohort of other participating institutions. An \"ar ea of strength\" is one in which the institution scores first or second among the selected peer institutions and in the top 30% of the cohort institutions. An \"area of concern\" is one in which the institution scores fifth or sixth among the selected peer gr oup and in the bottom 30% of the cohort. The 2011 COACHE survey indicated a lack of mentoring as one of the faculty's primary concerns. In response, Dr. Suzanna Rose, as part of the ADVANCE PAID grant, established the Faculty Mentor Program to serve the c olleges housing the sciences, engineering, and social and behavior al sciences. Subsequently, the 2014 COACHE survey identified faculty mentoring as an area of strength. This program has since been extended to all f aculty in all colleges. The NSF - funded PAI D project continued to have a positive impact. By 2015, women represented 18% of tenure -track STEM positions, an increase of 7% over five years. The FIU PAID activities were institutionalized in 2016 with the establishment of the Office to Advance Women, E quity and Diversity (AWED) and the appointment of Dr. Suzanna Rose as Assoc. Provost as part of the Office of the Provost, with substantial funding being provided by Academic Affairs to fund this unit. Since 2017, AWED program offerings constitute the maj or institutional interventions at FIU concerning f aculty professional development. Improvements were noted in previous areas of concern such as faculty mentoring, research support, and hiring according to the 2017 COACHE faculty satisfaction survey, but al so indicated two areas of concern: tenure policies and tenure clarity. AWED added multiple workshops focusing on tenure and promotion strategies beginning in 2018. Additional interventions concerning tenure policies began in 2019 with the establishment of the Office for Faculty Leadership and Success (OFLS), which also is within the Provost's Office. The 2020 COACHE survey, administered in February 2020 just before the pandemic shutdown, indicated that lack of clarity about tenure procedures and criteria w as no longer a faculty concern. Page 371 of 402 78 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT FIU ADVANCE's initiatives are intended to create a faculty -based social system that acts proactively to enhance a culture of inclusion for all f aculty at FIU as well as to advance women and underrepresented minority faculty , particularly within STEM and Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS). Based on the success o f the first NSF PAID grant, it was determined that faculty participation in and endorsement of inclusive excellence programs were the key s to making change at FIU. Therefore, the plan is to continue this largely grassroots approach by engaging faculty univ ersity -wide in AWED programming. New programs were also developed , such as the Bystander Leadership program, to meet the needs of f aculty who indicated they needed more skills to implement best practices. The reporting year, AY 2019 -2020, was Year 4 of th is 5-year grant. Due to the pandemic, the Bystander Leadership program was suspended for Spring 2020, and all training workshops were moved to live virtual settings via Zoom. However, the type and number of workshops were also expanded in this period as re ported below. Faculty Recruitment and Hiring Programs To increase the number of women and underrepresented minority faculty at FIU, STRIDE for Hiring training is required of all faculty within three years of serving on a hiring committee. The pilot program was launched in 2011 for the STEM fields and then expanded to the entire university. Additional training for one member of selected Faculty search committees designated as a Diversity Advocate was implemented starting in 2018 and was expanded to all TT searches in 2019- 2020. These are further discussed below. STRIDE for Hiring Workshops : The STRIDE training was developed using evidence- based practices developed at the University of Mich igan and educates f aculty about best practices to increase diversity in the faculty and address the issue of gender and race bias in hiring. These two-hour workshops, which are updated each academic year, cover issues such as implicit bias that can adverse ly affect the evaluation of applications from underrepresented minorities and women candidates and provides methods and practices such as the use of diversity statements and evaluation rubrics to help committees equitably assess and interview faculty candidates. Impact: There have been over 700 unique STRIDE participants to date. STRIDE workshops were extremely well received by attendees with 87% of participants rating them as effective in helping them understand the benefits of having a diverse f aculty , the role of ster eotypes in career advancement, and in finding solutions for these issues. Diversity Advocate Workshops : One member of each faculty hiring committee attends additional training on effective recruiting and evaluation practices for diverse candidates such as effective job ad writing and how to develop diverse pools, and acts as the point person on the search to ensure effective and equitable search practices are used. STRIDE for Hiring Leaders Workshop: This is like the STRIDE for Hiring Faculty workshop but is tailored for hires into leadership positions and is required for all upper -administration search committee members. Page 372 of 402 79 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Diversity Mentor Professorships (DMP) : The DMP program is a special initiative to recruit excellent research scientists with a history an d commitment to the mentorship of women students and students from domestic underrepresented minority populations. Four f aculty lines were committed to the DMP program in support of FIU ADVANCE, two in the Sciences and two in Engineering. Impact : In the S ummer of 2020, eight faculty lines for any area were promised by the Provost's Office specifically to increase the number of Black f aculty by attracting them to apply for Diversity Mentor Professorships - these positions use evidence of ability to mentor d iverse students and women as one hiring criterion. The result from this initiative will be in next year's report. These programs have resulted in positive outcomes previously that provide evidence for their effectiveness since implementation and have continued to play a role in the reporting period. In 2011, women constituted 11% of tenure -track faculty in STEM and 38% of social and behavioral science f aculty (SBS); the fields in which the pilot program was deployed initially. By 2020, tenured and tenure- track women represented 20% of the STEM f aculty and 40% of the SBS faculty , and 35% of the faculty overall. STEM wom en of color also increased from 1.5% to 2.5%. FIU also was able to meet its goal to increase the representation of women and underrepresented minority faculty overall: From 2015 to 2020, all (tenured, tenure -track, and non-tenure- track) Hispanic faculty increased from 18% (N=221) to 21% (N=291) as a percentage of total faculty , and women faculty from 42%(N=518) to 44% (N -614). However, FIU's Black faculty representation has remained at 5% for tenured and 8% for NTT for the same period . This is an area for improvement addressed below. Faculty Professional Development and Retention Programs: Programs to retain f aculty can be broken down into three major areas as shown below. AWED has developed and administers programs to address each of these three areas. 1. Professional development opportunities to enhance f aculty success in the areas of research (for TT f aculty ), teaching, and service. This means ensuring that all faculty have equal access to resources and opportunities such as appropriate mentoring, hi gh-value service assignments, and training in effective teaching. Programs that address this area include: Faculty Mentor Program : The FIU Faculty Mentor Program (FMP) is in its tenth successful year. The program is now offered to all f aculty ranks, includ ing tenure -line, research, clinical, and instructors. FMP includes one -on-one mentoring, mentor training, networking events, and structured skills -training presentations related to enhancing f aculty productivity. Faculty are paired with faculty from differ ent, but related departments, to provide a broad range of experience and opportunities for professional collaborations. The program directly addresses skills and networking essential to faculty success, thus enhancing retention. Mentoring is particularly e ssential for women and underrepresented minority faculty , who are often outside of the informal informational collegial networks in academia. Page 373 of 402 80 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT Impact: Overall, the FMP has offered deep learning and mentoring opportunities to more than 550 unique participants. In the 2017 Harvard COACHE survey, mentoring was one of FIU's areas of strength, meaning FIU scored in the top 30% of the cohort (112 partners) an d scored first or second among a selected group of five comparison institutions. Since the program began in 2011- 2012, f aculty satisfaction with mentoring at FIU increased substantially and has exceeded that of peer cohorts on the last three Harvard COACHE surveys (2014, 2017, 2020). Chairs' Leadership Workshops : In conjunction with the Office for Faculty Leadership and Success (OFLS), this program offers leadership training that many faculty members might never formally receive as they become chairs of dep artments. This helps not only the faculty participating in the program but those in their departments who benefit from having leaders trained in f aculty development and success. 2. Ensuring appropriate and equitable annual and tenure and promotion evaluati ons. Faculty cannot be retained if they are not provided fair and accurate annual evaluations, and equitable tenure and promotion evaluations. An area of focus is on how service is assigned, evaluated, and rewarded as women and underrepresented minorit ies are often overlooked for high prestige committees, and are also sought after as mentors by female and underrepresented minority students. This type of mentoring is often informal, invisible to others, and unrewarded. T he following programs were instituted to address these concerns: STRIDE Tenure and Promotion (T&P) Workshops: These workshops were developed to recruit, retain, and promote more women and minority f aculty at FIU. This training was partially implemented in 2018 -2019 and is now (2020 -2021) requi red for all College T&P Committee members, Department Chairs, and Deans every five years. New committee members, department chairs, and deans should attend in their first year of appointment. Topics covered include implicit bias, stereotype threat, bias in student evaluations of teaching, types, and amounts of service, and the cumulative effects on career progression of women and underrepresented minority faculty . Best practices in evaluating Faculty tenure and promotion application files are presented, including the use of rubrics tailored to ensure that a faculty member's annual assignment is considered. Chairs are asked to pay special attention to service assignments and recognition for female and underrepresented minority faculty for the annual evaluations. Policy development in collaboration with policy leaders : AWED engages regularly in reviewing FIU's policies and procedures to ensure the intended inclusive excellence. As part of this initiative , the u niversity T&P Manual was updated with the work beginning in 2019 to ensure best practices for equitable evaluation are followed by all units, including so that faculty efforts related to values of diversity, equity, and inclusion will be recognized in the tenure and promotion process as valid and valuable academic contributions. During the reporting year, all departments were required to develop clear guidelines for tenure and promotion as part of their department policies. The new university T&P man ual takes effect in Fall 2021. Salary Equity program : AWED contributes (limited) funding to colleges as a cost- share arrangement to correct salary inequities based on gender, race, and/or compression. Sixteen Page 374 of 402 81 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT (16) salary adjustments were made in 2019- 2020, including adjustments for underrepresented minority faculty . 3. Providing a supportive and inclusive working environment ; this is especially important at the departmental level but applies across the university. College and Departmental Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Plans : These plans are guided by two key goals: to increase the representation of f aculty from hist orically underrepresented groups such as women in STEM and African American and Hispanic American Faculty in all fields; and to enhance the institutional climate to attract and retain women and underrepresented groups at the faculty and doctoral student le vel. Certain aspects of FIU ADVANCE were required to be in departmental plans, including participation in the Bystander Leadership Program, STRIDE hiring workshops, and the Diversity Advocate Program. Departments also may choose from among 60 DEI actions a nd metrics provided by AWED. The actions and metrics include areas such as hiring, retention, and departmental climate. Examples are \"the number of guest seminar speakers from underrepresented groups or talks related to DEI issues.\" Each year, departments choose which goals to pursue and are provided with a report form to fill out at the end of the academic year. These completed reports are submitted to AWED and feedback on each outcome is provided either by AWED or the appropriate College Equity Advisor (s ee below). Equity Advisor Program : Deans of six colleges have agreed to provide one course release annually or summer supplemental funding for an equity advisor jointly selected by the Dean and AWED that participates in STRIDE, Bystander, and other AWED training programs. Embedded within their respective colleges, Equity Advisors (EAs) are a resource for helping departments develop, implement, and track progress on their diversity plans and work with AWED and College leadership concerning policies and proc edures related to diversity and equity efforts. Microclimate Project : The Microclimate Project is designed as both an ADVANCE program and as a research project to explore the complexity of how multi -ethnic cultural climates within FIU STEM departments affe ct the recruitment and advancement of women in STEM, particularly Hispanic -American and African American women faculty . The term \"microclimate\" refers to local social climates within a department that may differ from the larger organizational climate. The university is specifically interested in the intersection of nationality and gender/race norms and behaviors. Analysis of this project is ongoing. Bystander Leadership Program : The Bystander Leadership program is the signature program of FIU ADVANCE implem ented to address departmental and institutional climate. It was designed as an experiential, interactive, behavioral skills training program for f aculty . It was developed, pilot -tested , and conducted as both a research project (Years 2- 3) and as an embodied learning program for STEM and SBS Faculty (Years 2 -5). This program is intended to move f aculty participants from \"insight\" to \"action\" to address observed or anticipated instances of gender and race bias and discrimination among f aculty . The program raises awareness about the interplay between power, privilege, and bias often experienced by women Page 375 of 402 82 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT and minorities. It also provides practice in using a toolkit of intervention responses an d actions in response to situations of bias. The program is intended to develop a social system at FIU that supports and institutionalizes positive change among f aculty in three key areas: (1) demonstrating greater appreciation for diversity and a reductio n in prejudicial attitudes; (2) greater knowledge of and confidence in using prosocial intervention skills and strategies; and (3) increasing diversity -affirming behaviors. Impact: As of March 2020, 343 f aculty (160 women and 182 men) and 11 guests from o ther universities participated in one of 17 workshops offered since 2017. Preliminary results comparing a pre -test with the results from a three -month follow -up survey indicated that the Bystander group showed significant changes compared to the control gr oup in terms of self - reported items including awareness of subtle gender/ethnicity bias in one's environment, awareness of gender/ethnicity bias in one's discipline; confidence in being able to enact gender/ethnic equity interventions; and confidence in en gaging in such actions regularly . Extensive comments in response to open -ended questions included on the three -month follow - up survey also showed a positive effect: \"I think ALL f aculty would benefit from this kind of training program to help them understand various biases.\" \"More than one person [in my department] has participated in the bystander training program which I believe has led to a very responsibly written diversity plan.\" AWED Theater : This is a n FIU -branded theater unit under the direction of Creative Director Jeffrey Steiger, who also has written original scripts for AWED Theater and the Bystander program as part of his commitment to FIU ADVANCE. These scenarios showcase how subtle biases manifest in typical academic situations such as tenure and promotion meetings. The productions may be scheduled by other universities and professional associations. Process and metrics: To document the achievements of the FIU ADVANCE programs, multiple metrics and processes are in place: (1) before the project began, a baseline of the demographics of FIU's faculty was established as a data toolkit that has been monitored and updated annually with special attention to women of color. (2) During the project, the number of events, workshops, and activities and the ir attendance has been documented. Most of the events have been promptly evaluated by participant feedback surveys. (3) Since 2011, FIU has participated in the Harvard COACHE f aculty satisfaction survey conducted once every three years. The COACHE survey has been used to guide and assess the impact of institutional interventions towards inclusive excellence. Overall, as shown in Figure 1, the 2020 COACHE survey (pre -COVID -19) showed major gains in faculty satisfaction that largely are attributed to the activities of AWED and OFLS, which work collaboratively: FIU had nineteen areas of strength and only one area of concern (divisional leadership) based on responses by 46% of the faculty . See Figure 2. Underrepresented minority f aculty satisfaction was in the top 30% of the cohort on 23 of 25 measures and women f aculty satisfaction similarly was high on 20 of 25 measures. Page 376 of 402 83 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT This was a dramatic improvement over the 2017 COACHE survey that identified only five areas of strength along with two of concern (tenure clarity and tenure policies). Women and faculty of color also reported being very satisfied, as shown in Figure 3. o Underrepresented Minority Faculty ( URMs, e.g., Latinx and Black) faculty satisfaction scores were in the top 30% of the cohort of 110 institutions on 23 of 25 measures. o Women Faculty satisfaction scores were in the top 30 % of the cohort of 110 on 20 of 25 measures.

There was little change in the number of women in STEM from 2016 -2020. This caused a reassessment of t he STRIDE hiring workshops and ultimately led to the develop ment of new initiatives such as the Diversity Advocate training, STRIDE for T&P Committees, Bystander Leadership, and STRIDE for Leaders.

DENIED: Faculty for whom tenure was denied during the review process. NOMINATED: Faculty for whom tenure is being recommended by the University For the 2019 -2020 AY, a total of 32 tenure -track f aculty applied for tenure as shown in Part V , Section B. Table 1. Twenty -six (81%) were successfully tenured, two (6%) withdrew their applications, one (3%) deferred to the following year, and four (6%) had their applications Page 379 of 402 86 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT denied at som e point in the process. The person who deferred is not included in the 32 applicants. (1) Disparities related to race: By far the largest racial group to apply were White f aculty , at 66% of the total (21 of 32) although they were only 44% (89/177) of the tenure- track pool in 2019. However, their success rate was the lowest at 76% (16 out of 21). 89% of the Asian f aculty (8 out of 9) had successful applications, and both Hispanic f aculty who applied were granted tenure. The candidate who deferred is AI /AN, and no Black f aculty applied for tenure in the reporting year. Because of the small numbers of non -White f aculty relative to any other racial/ethnic group, nothing can be concluded from these data regarding the presence of bias or barriers. There are likely large fluctuations in the percentage of successful underrepresented minority applicants as the outcome of one application (of only a few/year) will have an outsize effect. (2) Disparities related to gender: In terms of gender , however, there may be real differences in success rates. Although there were more female applicants than male s, their success rates were lower. While 92% (12/13) of the male candidates were granted tenure, only 74% (14/19) of the female candidates were. Two White women and one (1) Asian woman were denied tenure, and both the withdrawn applications were those of White women. Although much res earch already shows that female f aculty have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, these are applications were submitted in Fall 2019 before it, so that cannot be the explanation for the lower success rate of women applying for tenure compared to men. The university 's recent implementation of bias training for chairs, d eans, and college tenure and promotion committees to assist in improving the disparate tenure outcomes for different genders and races , are anticipated to diminish in the future. University guidelines for equitable assignments for instructional faculty : Text below is from the Florida International University Board of Trustees and The United Faculty of Florida -FIU Collective Bargaining Agreement 2018- 2021, pp. 57- 58: (4) Equitable Opportunity. Each employee shall be given assignments that provide equitabl e opportunities, in relation to other employees in the same department/unit, to meet the required criteria for tenure, promotion, successive fixed multi -year appointments, and merit salary increases. 1. (A) For the purpose of applying this principle to prom otion, assignments shall be considered over the entire period since the original appointment or since the last promotion, not solely over the period of a single annual assignment. The period under consideration at this University shall not be less than fou r years. 2. (B) For the purpose of applying this principle to tenure, assignments shall be considered over the entire period of tenure -earning service and not solely over the period of a single annual assignment. 3. (C) If it is determined that an employee w as not provided an equitable opportunity for tenure, as described in this section, the employee may be awarded an additional period of employment requiring the University to provide the equitable opportunity as described herein. In ensuing assignments, the Provost or designee must enforce the decision regarding equitable opportunity. Page 380 of 402 87 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 2021 EQUITY REPORT E.

All but one of those, the College of Law, had tenure applicants in 2019 -2020. T he demographics of the tenured f aculty in each department that had tenure applicants are also reported, as these are the faculty that vote on tenure decisions. There are no department -level T&P committees. Additionally, the School of Hospitality Management and Tourism and the College of Law have no departments. For Law, all tenured faculty serve as the College -level Committee. College -level Committees: Of the 92 faculty who served on college -level committees in AY 2019 - 2020, 73% were male and 27% were female. Men were the most represented compared to their percentage of all tenured f aculty (68%) and the most represented compared to tenure -track faculty (57%). This is an area that needs improvement. For race/ethnicity, Whites and Hispanics are the groups most represented compared to all tenured f aculty on the College committees with 62% of the committee being White vs. 58% of the tenured faculty and 16% being Hispanic vs. 12% of the tenured f aculty . The disparity increases with comparison to the tenure -track White faculty which are at 48%. The representation of Black faculty on the committees is equal to their representation among tenured f aculty at 5% and Asians are underrepresented at 14% vs. 23%. The differences in these categories when compared to the tenure -track f aculty change not all for Black f aculty , and minimally for Asian faculty (15%). College -level T&P committees reflect more representation of men and White faculty when compar ing their percentages on the committees to the available pool of tenured faculty able to serve. As service on these committees is highly valued and thus considered an asset to career development, an effort must be made to ensure equitable access to all eligible Faculty moving forward. Department Committees: As noted above, these data consist of all tenured Faculty in departments that had tenure candidates in 2019 -2020, these are the faculty eligible to vote on T&P applications. As these are a subset of all tenured f aculty , the percentages by gender are similar (within 3%) and most categori es of race are as well. The exceptions are Asians, who are underrepresented compared to all tenured f aculty (17% vs. 23%) , and Hispanics, who are overrepresented (17% vs. 12%). These are likely due to differences in representation between different fields. For example, it's well documented that women are underrepresented in STEM fields and Asians are the most represented in E ngineering fields.

Budgetary Incentive Plan FIU is committed to allocating funds to recruit and retain a diverse workforce and student population. In July 2020, the President established the Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as recommended in the Equity Action Initiative (EAI) . The creation of this division is outside of the reporting academic period, but it is important to note the creation in this equity report. President Rosenberg created th e EAI to identify issues of systemic racism, bias, and inequity at FIU and provide actionable steps to eradicate them. That work evolved into the Division of Diversity, Equity , and Inclusion . This division is support ed by a budget and works with every unit within the university to identify and improve diversity, equity, inclusion, and belong. Within the Division of Academic and Student Affairs, the Office of Social Justice and Inclusion was established to work with students to empower social change; advocate for diversity and inclusion; educate for justice and equity; and act with empathy and impact. This division offers programs and resources such as Pride Center, the Women's Center, Ma le Mentoring Initiative, Fundamentals of Social Justice badge, Inclusive Language Guide, and scholarships. The O ffice to Advance Women, Equity and Diversity (AWED ) aims to achieve and sustain faculty equity and diversity as an essential element of FIU's academic excellence. AWED provides stipends to 10 -12 faculty members to conduct faculty workshops on best practices in hiring as part of the STRIDE program. This includes bystander leadership facilitators. FIU's Diversity Mentor Professor Program is a spe cial initiative to recruit multiple excellent STEM faculty to FIU who have a history of and commitment to the mentorship of women and underrepresented minority students in STEM, particularly Hispanic -American and African American students. Diversity Mentor Professors participate in FIU's NSF -funded ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Projects that focus on increasing faculty diversity and inclusion, mentoring, advocacy, and leadership activities. Two f aculty members were designated as Diversity Mentor Professors as part of this program during Fall 2018. Through the annual FIU Service and Recognition Awards , distinguished faculty , staff, and administrators are honored and recognized for their outstanding achi evements and years of service. The President's Access and Equity Award is presented to individuals who demonstrat e a commitment to the spirit of diversity through participation in extracurricular activities and/or formal or informal initiatives at the inst itutional, community, state, regional, or national level, shown leadership through positive interaction among persons of different cultural backgrounds, and behavior which illustrates a commitment to inclusion of persons within the institution who are members of traditionally underrepresented groups. The 2020 recipient was Dr. Isaac Burt , Associate Professor, Counseling Recreation and School o f Psychology and Associate Director, AWED. PART VI. OTHER REQUIREMENTS Page 385 of 402 92 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 202 1 EQUITY REPORT B. President's Evaluation The u niversity President's performance is e valuated annually consistent with the provisions of his employment contract and Florida Board of Governors Regulation 1.001(5) (f). The process for evaluating the President's progress towards equity and diversity goals begins with the President's self -evaluation of his annual goals submitted to the Board of Trustees (BOT) Chair. The BOT Governance Committee provided President Rosenberg with a written assessment of its evaluation, and the Committee presented its written assessment and recommended performanc e rating for the BOT Full Board for approval. Dean C. Colson , Chair of the BOT, led the discussion on the President's Management Review during AY 20 20-2021. June 16, 2021, a specific diversity, equity, and inclusion goal of \"Significant events or milestones towards fostering a culture of belonging and towards eliminating disparities within the FIU community among underrepresented groups \" was added to the President's p erformance evaluation for the 2021- 22 reporting period .

Executive Level Adm inistrators' Evaluations FIU is privileged to have leaders within our community doing an amazing job embracing and actualizing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. In part, it is because of leadership support and stated expectations by our most senior leadership. In keeping with the university's commitment to drive change and elevate cultural consciousness toward achieving organization goals set within the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strateg y, a guidepost for accountability among our FIU executive level administrator s was set through the Executives' DEI Accountability Plan. The goal is to lead by example as an extension of the transformative work that the FIU community is being asked to engage in/with. Components of the Executives' DEI Accountability Plan include: Complete a review of the DEI Launch (institutional mission and guiding values) View TED Talk by Paloma Medina \u2014Let's Stop Talking About Diversity (increase cultural competence) Identify a DEI Advocate for Division (institutional investment in continual learning) Read 'Race Talk and the Conspiracy of S ilence ' by Derald Wing Sue (develop leadership expertise and make an institutional investment in continual learning) Annually review hires, promotions, terminations, retention, and reward strategies as well as demographic make -up (evaluation and assessment ) a. Assess racial and gender gaps identified (evaluation and assessment) b.

ACADEMIC AND CAREER SUCCESS 1. Honors College Academic Partnerships The FIU Honors College continues its support for undergraduate research through the Advanced Research and Creativity in Honors (ARCH) Program which provides student/faculty matching, work shops, training, conference participation and funding, as well as money to support student research. This program provides opportunities for students to engage in supervised research and creative projects under the direction of FIU faculty experts in any s ubject field through the following five options: ARCH Apprenticeship, ARCH Proposal, Honors in the Major (Thesis/Senior Design Project), ARCH Project, and ARCH Thesis. ARCH has seen steadily increasing numbers in the past 5 years, with almost a hundred stu dents taking part in ARCH pre -pandemic. Similarly, the annual undergraduate research conference, Undergraduate Research at FIU (URFIU), the largest multi - disciplinary research conference at FIU, has grown to over 300 attendees pre -pandemic. That success is due to many factors including the incorporation of significant research activities into many of our courses. Additionally , the Honors College is now offering Micro -Credentialing badges. Honors Studies (the domestic and international Study Abroad courses), ARCH, and upper division courses are using Micro -Credential badging as a way to focus student efforts while showcasing the various skills and knowledge which students receive. To facilitate this effort, the Honors College is collaborating with the Office of Micro -Credentials to ensure that these badges communicate the competencies Honors College students are acquiring through out their academic career and will showcase their skills to prospective employers. 2. VMock SMART Resume One of the critical initiatives FIU is implementing to increase students' career -readiness is the expansion of access to the VMock SMART Resume pla tform. Currently, the College of Business and the Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management are using VMock for their students, but this Fall 2021 , Career and Talent Development is scaling up the adoption of the platform to include all FIU student s. VMock SMART Resume is a 24/7 online tool that will instantly review our students' resumes to provide feedback based on parameters we set, criteria gathered from employers, and global best practices. The feedback covers areas such as impact, presentation , competencies, and formatting. The tool also provides an aggregate resume score to assess the strength of the resume bench -marked against their own FIU peer group and a module that allows students to share and get feedback from an FIU career advisor. Students will be encouraged to use this tool as a resource in building and enhancing their resumes with timely feedback that can be easily accessed at their convenience and discussed with a career advisor for further input. VMock will serve as an added layer of support to our students as they explore and navigate their internship/job search and application process. II. ENGAGEMENT 1. Community Outreach and Events: Cafecito Chat Live & City of Miami Beach Resilience Visioning Workshops The Office of Engagement continues to create a virtual meeting space for the FIU and local community via virtual workshops, webinars, networking events, and Cafecito Chats. During the reporting period, over 1,500 people engaged with us virtually and 200 via one in -perso n event. Page 390 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 3 In May, we held our first large scale in -person event with \"Cafecito Chat Live!\" This event was meant to bring together the FIU community and local partners for the first time in over a year. The event took place outside the Primera Casa building at MMC and engaged over 200 FIU students, faculty, staff and community members. In addition to the giant cafetera and snacks, participants were able to re - connect, network, and test the new Microsoft Surface Hub pilot now in the Engagement Conference Room and available to the entire FIU community. The FIU and City of Miami Beach strategic partnership continue to grow. In 2021, we launched the Inspirational Visioning Campaign with Miami Beach Urban Studios, the Sea Level Solutions Center, and City staff. The first workshop was held virtually on July 21, 2021. 111 residents and scholars RSVP 'd for the event which showcased architectural renderings of historic neighborhoods by FIU students who were asked to imagine a future that will be shaped by climate change, sea level rise, sustainability, innovatio n and City of Miami Beach residents. The workshop discussed the Buoyant City study, which evolves Miami Beach's vibrant historic districts through adaptive development. Participants had the opportunity to engage in small discuss groups via Zoom breakout ro om. The following City of Miami Beach and FIU leaders and environmental sustainability experts attended as speakers and conversation facilitators: 1. Amy Knowles, Chief Resiliency Officer, City of Miami Beach 2. John Stuart, Associate Dean of Culture and Comm unity Engagement & Executive Director at MBUS, Florida International University 3. Betsy Wheaton, Director of Environment & Sustainability Department, City of Miami Beach 4. Aris Papadopoulos, Distinguished Expert in Resilience, Extreme Events Institute, Flo rida International University 5. Dr. Jayantha Obeysekera, Director, Sea Level Solutions Center Research Professor, Florida International University 6. Alan Shulman, Director of Graduate Programs in Architecture & Professor, University of Miami 7. Tom Mooney, Di rector of the Planning Department, City of Miami Beach 2. Community Coalitions: Talent Development Network The Talent Development Network (TDN), operated by FIU Engagement, is a collaborative of Miami - Dade County's seven largest academic institutions an d the Miami -Dade Beacon Council with the goal of building a paid internship culture in Miami -Dade. The initiative is fully funded by philanthropy. TDN hosted the second annual CEO for a Day event, virtually, on April 9, 2021. The event brought together over 900 students from our TDN partner educational institutions for a unique opportunity for students to learn, connect, and network with local South Florida executives such as Uber, Google, United Way of Miami Dade, Royal Caribbean Cruiselines, and others. TDN launched CEO for a Day as a community -wide talent initiative in 2020 with the aim to champion Miami's talent by intentionally connecting stude nts from the region's academic institutions with local industry leaders and C -suite level executives. The goal is to inspire industry to build new paid internship opportunities and encourage Miami's talent to pursue opportunities in the local market. Summer Youth Internship Program (SYIP): This Summer, TDN continues to work with Miami Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS) on the Summer Youth Internship Program (SYIP), a 5 -week work - based learning experience with M -DCPS high school students placed in internsh ip sites throughout Page 391 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 4 Miami -Dade County. Through the internship, students are able to gain practical experiences in the workplace, have the opportunity to make direct contact with professionals in the community, and apply their internship learnings to their academic and personal journeys. This year, over 40 students and 30 supervisors from across various departments at FIU are participating in the program. A virtual graduation celebration for the interns was held on August 5, 2021. 3. Future of Work: America n Institute for Research Partnership Dr. Jenesis Ramirez and Umer Rahman secured a $30,000 grant via American Institute for Research and the Lumina Foundation to conduct primary research with Urban Potential Lab participants. Funds are secured and budgets for the researchers' time, and additional support, in the form of research assistants, project coordination support, and reporting/dissemination will be provided by AIR. The purpose of the investigation is to understand how participation in the UP Labs program influences adult learners' decisions to enroll or re -enroll in postsecondary programs during or after participation in UP Labs. In order to understand adult learners' experience and perspectives we will conduct a qualitative study to capture participa nts' narratives about college enrollment and re-enrollments. Data will be collected via surveys, in -depth one -on-one interviews, and two focus groups. The findings will be released in June 2022. III. ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES 1. University Enrollment In collaboration with Adrenaline films, University Admissions produced a one -hour episode of The College Tour. Alex Boylan hosts this documentary series that will be streamed on Amazon Prime and Roku. Each episode provides the viewe r with an in -depth view of a university from the student perspective. University Admissions, External Affairs, and producers from Adrenaline Films selected 19 student representatives from undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. Students described their rationale for selecting FIU and highlighted their experiences as students. For our episode, we included highlights from our preeminent programs, research facilities, student engagement opportunities, Panther pride, and FIU's place in the greater Mia mi community. President Mark B. Rosenberg narrated a special segment of the episode entitled Cafecito Break; in this part of the episode, Dr. Rosenberg regales the viewer with aspects of the unique FIU culture. University Admissions is also spending the summer working on yield projects to ensure the incoming freshman, transfer and graduate classes meet University expectations for size and profile. At the same time, the Office is preparing for fall recruitment and planning a hybrid recruitment plan with both in -person and virtual recruitment events. Summer 2021 As of July 21, 2021, 40,752 students have enrolled in courses for the summer 2021 term. This represents a -4% or -1,744 student decrease as compared to summer 2020 enrollment of 42,496. Student credit hour production also decreased by -17,814 or 6%, from 313,739 in summer 2020 to 295,925 in summer 2021.

For the upcoming year, FIU received more applications across all levels from prospective international students and reversed the earlier downward trend reported in April for undergraduate transfer applicants. FIU is down in admitted international FTIC students driven by the decline in Spring 2022 numbers. The lower SAT/GPA requirements for Summer and Fall reduced the number of students admit ted into Spring who applied to an alternative term. We will continue to monitor this group and encourage them to complete their applications in a timely manner in order to reverse the current downward trend. We anticipate that incoming students will con tinue to encounter substantial roadblocks as they attempt to obtain visas; therefore, we will continue to support international students via online coursework while deferring I -20 entry terms. Table 3 International Applications by Status and Academic Year (as of 07/09/2021 ) Application Status 67 51.15% Undergraduate Transfer 4.62% 1,382 759 121.83% 3. Transfer and Transition Services Transfer Credit Processing and Course Equivalencies The Transfer Credit Processing team entered 65,158 courses and course updates into PantherSoft (student transfer record) from January 2021 through July 12, 2021; they are currently inputting credit - by-exam courses for incoming summer and fall (FTIC and transf er) students. Concurrently, our Course Equivalency team is proactively evaluating courses for all incoming students transfer students - 3,155 courses were evaluated during the last six months. The team is developing strategies to increase proactive rule bu ilding for prospective students. To date, FIU has articulated 84,125 courses for domestic students and 7,086 for international students. Our goal is to increase domestic rules for high recruitment areas outside Florida. Page 394 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 7 Together, this proactive work suppo rts the most seamless transition possible for transfer students, which has positively impacted ou r institution's 2 -year graduation rate for AA full -time students to 55% and improvements in 3 -year rates. FIU, in partnership with the Florida Consortium of M etropolitan Research Universities, University of Central Florida, and the University of South Florida was awarded a Helios Education Foundation $1.25 million grant (4 years \u2014July 1, 2021 -June 30, 2025) focused on accelerating transfer success. FIU funding w ill include transfer student stipends that will help incentivize full -time enrollment or other college expenses (e.g., transportation, books, materials) as well as a new Transfer Student Success Coach, who will work with transfer students receiving the sti pend. Our grant work will be grounded in evidence -based approaches, including qualitative data that incorporates the student voice and lived experiences. Kindly note the press release: The Florida Consortium of Metropolitan Research Universities and Helios Education Foundation Aim to create the most Transfer Friendly Campuses in the U.S. | Florida Consortium of Metropolitan Research Universities Connect4Success Our annual Connect4Success (C4S) Kickoff planning is underway. This year, BC and PBSC will once again offer a virtual program in the summer. MDC will offer a virtual \"C4S preview\" in the summer and an-in person program in early fall. The k ickoff's for PBSC, MDC, and BC will take place on July 23, July 27, and August 6, respectively. The number of students invited to Connect4Success this year was significantly lower than in previous years. To date, 370/1428 (26%) invited students confirmed their admission by selecting the state college they plan to attend. Last year's yield for summer and fall combined was 34%. We are engaging in several new initiatives to surpass this number. For example, in addition to the new \"C4S preview\", we modified our communication strategy with new and more frequent messaging and are working with our three loca l partner colleges on a call campaign to those students enrolled at the college but who have not yet committed to C4S. August 16 was the soft deadline to confirm admission to the program. 4. Financial Aid 2020 -2021 Aid Year Disbursement As of July 20, 2021 The Financial Aid Office disbursed $537.2 million to 44,908 students. For the same period last year, we disbursed $536.1 million to 44,399 students. We will conclude most disbursements for this aid year by the end of September 2021. State-Wide Leadership Our Senior Associate Director of Financial Aid, Katharine Conrad began her term as President of the Florida Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators July 1, 2021. FASFA has over 900 practicing Financial Aid Administrators as members. 5. Office of Scholarships In collaboration with several internal constituents, our Office of Scholarships continues to provide students with emergency support as we return to normalcy amidst Covid -19. Since March 13, 2020, we processed over 47,0 00 applications for emergency assistance. We awarded and processed 32,429 grants to 21,967 unique students; these grants equated to $47 million dollars in awards. The following points summarizes highlights of these awards: Page 395 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 8 a) Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Ec onomic Security Act (CARES, March 2020) - 11,043 awards (10,302 unique students), $ 22 million (all funds spent) b) Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA, December 2020) - 16, 073 awards (15,853 unique students), $19 million (a ll funds spent) c) American Rescue Plan (ARP, March 2021) - 5,313 awards, $6 million spent to date, 58 million remaining to spend through March 2022. 6. University Registrar Graduation Process Update At the end of the Spring 2021 semester, we expanded the use of our enhanced graduation process beyond undergraduate degrees. We collaborated with various campus partners to pilot the use of this process to auto -award: 99% of master's degrees for College of Business 100% of all degrees for College of Law 100% of undergraduate certificates for College of Arts, Sciences & Education Through this process, our department continues to improve customer service for students who can order transcripts with their degree conferred much sooner than previously. Today, we can confer degrees within one week following the end of term (previously this process took about 4 to 5 weeks). Enhanced Electronic Processes We launched new electronic processes via DocuSign to replace existing paper forms: Active Duty, Veterans, Spouses, and Dependents Transcript Request Form Late Add Request Form Late Graduation Application Student Withdrawal Form These new e -forms reduce the time required to obtain approvals, provide both students and staff with a clear routing workflow, and simplify the su bmission of documents. 7. CRM and Enrollment Communications At this time, the Office is updating 250+ communication plans for the 2021 -2022 Undergraduate and Graduate recruitment cycle. We are also updating all reports for recruiters to track their recru itment activities. These reports provide data to recruiters on the effectiveness of these activities. They share this data with their supervisors throughout the recruitment season. We launched two new projects: 1. Request for More Information for the Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. a. Form collects prospective student information. b. Students that fill out the form receive communications about the college, and provide information on how to apply. 2. Financial Aids' Returning to Title IV funds (R2T4) Process Moved to Salesforce a. R2T4 Emails sent through Salesforce will provide data on open rates & click through rates. b. Email replies route to Salesforce as a new st udent case. These cases are visible in a queue for easier management by the department. Page 396 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 9 c. Real time data on R2T4 student cases is available through Salesforce reports. These reports provide leadership accurate and timely information on the efforts associat ed with this process. Our yearly office report highlights our operational efficiencies within the division. The CRM department receives department requests to help with student outreach and salesforce enhancements that support several divisions with their day-to-day activities in the system. Through this report, we establish goals and benchmarks and assess the services that provide for our internal constituents. Department's initiate an internal case request for these features. Since our launch of this i nternal case request future in September of 2018: 1. Student outreach email request has increased by 68% 2. New Project Request has increase by 94% from FY2020 to FY2021. IV. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPORT 1. Security Strategy Update The Division of IT continues to update and enhance the enterprise -wide security strategy to keep up with the ever -evolving cybersecurity challenges. In an additional effort to mitigate risk, beginning in August 2021, all users who log on to any FIU systems will be required to use two -factor authentication (2FA). 2FA provides an additional layer of security that helps minimize the risk of compromised accounts caused by phishing, social engineering and password attacks which have bee n on the rise in recent years. Phishing attacks are a type of social engineering cyber -attack that sends a fraudulent email designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information, such as their password and credit card information, or deploying ma licious software on a user's workstation such as ransomware. Additionally, the division will be making enhancements to the login page to include additional features such as extending the 'remember me' feature from 48 hours to 7 days that will facilitate a better user experience. 2. Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Development The Division of IT is continuously doing its part to educate on cybersecurity and help minimize the workforce gap. For the fifth year in a row, the Division of IT in partnership with the Digital Era Group hosted the Secure Miami Cybersecurity Conference on Thursday, July 15, 2021. This year's conference was hosted virtually and focused on how organizations prepare to move beyond the pandemic and chart a secure path despite rising risks. This virtual event brought together over 400 IT security experts and pr ofessionals from across the country and gave the opportunity for attendees to network with the most highly sought -after security experts. Page 397 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 10 Additionally, the division, in collaboration with the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs, an d New America's Cyber Initiative will be hosting the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Symposium: A Coordinated approach to Supply Chain Risks. The symposium will serve as a precursor to the annual NICE Conference in June 2022. 3. Technology Fee for the 2021/2022 Academic Year The Technology Fee Council reviewed one -hundred and sixteen proposals (116) from academic and administrative units. The final recommendations were submitted to the Vice President and CIO Robert Grillo and Execu tive Vice President and Provost Dr. Kenneth G. Furton for approval.

Innovation, Partnerships and Economic Development StartUP FIU is working with 22 faculty members at various stages of research commercialization. Six new teams completed a regional NSF I -Corps to qualify for national I -Corps. One team, Associate Professor Anu Godavarty's diabetic wound care project completed the national I -Corps pro gram in the quarter and four teams were accepted to the national I -Corps program for FY2022. StartUP FIU staff developed and presented two virtual workshops on commercializing research for 69 faculty. Four faculty teams working with StartUP FIU were select ed by MITRE for initial meetings. Two teams had an initial meeting and no follow up is expected. One team has had two meetings and more meetings are planned (Associate Professor Adela Timmons for ML wellness). One professor met with MITRE in early July. Tw elve of the 18 students that were accepted to Beta Studio successfully completed the program, which centered around local pitch competitions and was critical to the success of our students at the Venture Bites college entrepreneurship competition hosted by Miami Angels and the City of Miami. Three teams composed of nine students advanced to and pitched in the 2021 Hult Prize Regional Summits (Boston and Toronto, held virtually this quarter). This marks the most FIU teams to compete at the regional round sin ce StartUP FIU began supporting The Hult Prize Challenge in 2017. Cohort 4 of the business incubator program launched with 15 new companies in April, bringing total program companies to 48. The companies are all local, small minority or woman -owned busine sses. This cohort included a group of entrepreneur industries outside construction, including IT and marketing. Program participants were awarded 18 anchor contracts from April to June 2021 and procured $1,827,258 vs. $627,351 the same period a year ago. S tartUP FIU Food was awarded a $750,000 grant from Wells Fargo Foundation in May 2021 to develop and expand an online platform that supports and accelerates minority and women -owned businesses with aspirations to expand their businesses online. The team spe nt the second quarter providing free online workshops to over 270 small businesses. The team secured access to capital from Miami Dade County's Credit Union for future website participants and developed a partnership with Legal Services Miami to provide pr o- bono legal consultation and workshops for users of an online platform. The Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship team led two social innovation events for 44 students called Changemaker Chats with university partners focused on gender equity and LGBTQIA activism and two Changemaker Chats with 35 external community partners focused on Miami's growing tech sector and social innovation. As a result of the program's initiatives and data collection efforts, in collaboration with the Office of Accountability a nd Information Management, FIU now ranks 3rd in the nation in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for its work focused on ending poverty (SDG #1), preserving and protecting life below water (SDG #14), and preserving and protecting life on land (SDG#16) as ranked by the Times Higher Education Social Impact Ranking system for 2020/2021. During the fourth quarter, the Technology Transfer group received 30 disclosures, filed 25 patent applications, received 5 patents, and entered into 6 lic ense agreements.

Additionally, for calendar year 2020 results from the annual NAI/IPO survey for the top 100 universities in the world for US patent production that recently came out, FIU ended up in 42nd place overall worldwide . 3. University Graduate School (UGS) For the Academic Year, 3,523 master's degrees were awarded (2% increase compared to the previous year). There was an increase of 6% in research doctorates (from 194 to 206), and 450 BOG Preeminence doctoral degrees were awarded, a 7% increase from last yea r. As of July 19, 2021, UGS received 2,942 applications for doctoral programs, and thus far, we have admitted 783 doctoral Page 399 of 402Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 12 students, a 43% increase compared to last year; 175 have enrolled, the same number compared to last year. We have received 9,077 appl ications for master's degrees (12% increase compared to last year) of which 4,339 were admitted (15% increase compared to last year), and 1,146 have enrolled, an 8% increase compared to last year. During the past academic year UGS launched two innovative programs. The Undergraduate to Graduate Program aims at providing junior/senior undergraduate students at FIU with firsthand lab experience while receiving a small stipend and preparing them to transition to PhD programs at FIU with guaranteed funding from UGS and their home program for 5 years. The first cohort of 5 students started in Fall 2020 and have all enrolled in PhD programs at FIU starting in Fall 2021. In response to a request made by the Graduate Professional Student Committee, UGS initiated the Graduate Student Research Support Program to provide funds ($1,200) for PhD candidates to conduct their research projects. Twenty -seven students were selected on a competitive basis to receive the awards. UGS formally established the Office of Fellowships and Training with the goal of supporting FIU graduate students in seeking external competitive funding and faculty with submission of training grants from federal agencies. As part of this initiative, throughout Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, UGS offered a ser ies of virtual workshops and information sessions to highlight prestigious funding opportunities and provide students with basic overview of grant writing. Staff also provided individual consultations to students seeking and applying to external fellowship s and research grants. Five current and one incoming doctoral students received NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, with two receiving an honorable mention, the largest number of FIU recent awards. UGS continued to engage Graduate Program Directors with a pr ofessional development program so they are better prepared to support their students' needs. In the fall and spring, they participated in a refresher workshop on policies and procedures, and a panel discussion with members of the DEI office to highlight ne w joint initiatives promoting the increase of diversity in graduate programs and strategies for retention of minoritized groups of students. UGS also partnered with HR to deliver training on the new requirements for graduate student hiring processes. VI. ACADEMIC & STUDENT AFFAIRS REPORT 1.

The website allows FIU students to register to participate in t he S.O.S. semester -long program that will offer for - credit graduate and undergraduate courses for enrollees at Florida International University. FIU Online also designed the promotional video for the SoftBank Operator School. B.A. in Global Sustainable Tourism - In January 2021, the Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism launched the fully online B.A. in Global Sustainable Tourism. This degree is a direct response to the shift toward sustainability in all industries and was created in partnership with the FIU Department of Earth and Environment of the College of Arts, Science and Education. Corporate social responsibility programs are multifaceted, and sust ainability paths for organizations must address conservation activities, consumer demand, the operations of an organization and industry governance. This program prepares graduates from the business standpoint and for the interdisciplinary work needed to m ake sustainability a priority in the hospitality and tourism industry. The fact that the new B.A. in Global Sustainable Tourism is available in an online format offers its own sustainability and resilience advantages and is in line with the university's co mmitment to becoming synonymous with sustainability and serving its community, anytime, anywhere. The bachelor's degree speaks to all avenues and, because of its novel approach, has garnered considerable press with mentions on local television and social m edia. The program already has substantial interest for the spring 2022 start. Online Success Webinar Series - Summer 2021, FIU Online focused on increasing awareness of Online Student Success Services and student engagement with a new landing page ( onlinesuccess.fiu.edu ) and the launch of the Online Success Webinar Series.
