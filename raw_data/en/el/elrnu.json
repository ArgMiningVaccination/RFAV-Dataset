Aromachology is a unique field that studies the olfactory effects after inhaling aromatic compounds. Aromatherapy is a complementary treatment methodology involving the use of essential oils containing phytoncides and other volatile organic compounds for various physical and mental illnesses. Phytoncides possess an inherent medicinal property. Their health benefits range from treating stress, immunosuppression, blood pressure, respiratory diseases, anxiety, and pain to anti-microbial, anti-larvicidal, anti-septic, anti-cancer effects, etc. Recent advancements in aromatherapy include forest bathing or forest therapy. The inhalation of phytoncide-rich forest air has been proven to reduce stress-induced immunosuppression, normalize immune function and neuroendocrine hormone levels, and, thus, restore physiological and psychological health. The intricate mechanisms related to how aroma converts into olfactory signals and how the olfactory signals relieve physical and mental illness still pose enormous questions and are the subject of ongoing research. Aromatherapy using the aroma of essential oils/phytoncides could be more innovative and attractive to patients. Moreover, with fewer side effects, this field might be recognized as a new field of complementary medicine in alleviating some forms of physical and mental distress. Essential oils are important assets in aromatherapy, cosmetics, and food preservatives. The use of essential oils as an aromatherapeutic agent is widespread. Detailed reports on the effects of EOs in aromatherapy and their pharmacological effects are required to uncover its complete biological mechanism. This review is about the evolution of research related to phytoncides containing EOs in treating various ailments and provides comprehensive details from complementary medicine.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-28", "cleaned_text": "Essential Oils, Phytoncides, Aromachology, and Aromatherapy\u2014A Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/app12094495](https://doi.org/10.3390/app12094495) [Emerging Aromachology is the study of the interrelationship between aroma and psychology. In detail, it is the effect of aroma on the brain, the subsequent subtle neurological and behavioral changes, and the intertwined psychological variations. It has been an emerging and fascinating subject in scientific society for the past few years. The influence of aroma on humans is a new scientific discipline; hence, the need for independent research papers regarding aromachology is clear [ [2](#B2-applsci-12-04495), [3](#B3-applsci-12-04495), [4](#B4-applsci-12-04495)]. [2](#B2-applsci-12-04495)]. Scientifically defined, aromatherapy is a complementary treatment methodology [ [5](#B5-applsci-12-04495)] using essential oils containing phytoncides [ [6](#B6-applsci-12-04495)] as a tool for therapeutics [ [2](#B2-applsci-12-04495), [3](#B3-applsci-12-04495)]. [7](#B7-applsci-12-04495)] of aromatic plants, representing a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [ [4](#B4-applsci-12-04495)]. The plants hold these oils throughout their thallus structures, such as reservoirs, glandular hairs, special cells, and intracellular spaces. Plants are also protected from pathogenic encounters and temperature fluctuations with the help of these essential oils [ [8](#B8-applsci-12-04495)]. EOs are a concoction of chemical [ [9](#B9-applsci-12-04495)] that can be extracted from different regions of plants, such as the bark of plants, flower petals, stems, leaves, roots, and distillation from resins [ [10](#B10-applsci-12-04495)]. EOs' extraction can be carried out by conventional methods such as steam distillation, hydro-distillation, hydro-diffusion, and solvent extraction, and by advanced methods such as supercritical fluid extraction, subcritical extraction, solvent-free microwave-assisted extraction [ [11](#B11-applsci-12-04495)], and also by the physical crushing of the outermost waxy layer where oil glands are situated [ [12](#B12-applsci-12-04495)]. Several studies have evaluated the therapeutic effects of EOs [ [13](#B13-applsci-12-04495)] as additives and packaging materials in the food industry [ [14](#B14-applsci-12-04495)] and as air quality enhancers in indoor environments [ [15](#B15-applsci-12-04495)]. Some of the well-known aromatic essences are lavender oil, rosemary oil, jasmine oil, and peppermint oil, which have been found to improve cognitive functions, memory retention, pain relief, and mood enhancement and play a role in enhancing physical and psychological conditions affected by stress [ [16](#B16-applsci-12-04495), [17](#B17-applsci-12-04495), [18](#B18-applsci-12-04495)]. EOs may be administered through massage, inhalation, or direct application over the skin or internally [ [19](#B19-applsci-12-04495), [20](#B20-applsci-12-04495)]. However, although inhaling aromas in treating ailments or stress is approved as aromatherapy, its effectiveness is still in question. [2](#B2-applsci-12-04495), [21](#B21-applsci-12-04495)], studies have shown that inhaling aroma at night elicits feelings of sensuality and relaxation, happiness, or exhilaration [ [2](#B2-applsci-12-04495), [4](#B4-applsci-12-04495), [22](#B22-applsci-12-04495)]. Phytoncides are volatile organic substances extracted from plants that possess antimicrobial activities and help in enhancing immune functions through NK cell activity and anti-inflammatory properties. 'Phyton' refers to plants, and 'cide' refers to killing in Greek, thus highlighting the anti-microbial activities [ [23](#B23-applsci-12-04495)]. However, the lack of convincing studies is also accountable for our insufficient understanding. Hence, as part of the emerging investigations focused on aromachology and aromatherapy, the present review is designed to assess the effects of aromatherapy on physiological functions. 2. Chemistry of Essential Oils [24](#B24-applsci-12-04495)]. They are colorless liquids, soluble in alcohol, ether, and fixed oils but insoluble in water, and they possess a particular odor [ [25](#B25-applsci-12-04495)]. EOs combine more than 100 single substances, including terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon derivatives. The structure of EOs can contain allylic, bi-, tricyclic, mono-, and sesquiterpenoids of different functional groups, such as ketones, and alcohols as well as oxides, aldehydes, phenols, or esters [ [9](#B9-applsci-12-04495)]. The loss or absence of any one of the components in the EOs can change their aroma. Oxygenated EOs are more fragrant than the EOs containing monoterpene hydrocarbons [ [26](#B26-applsci-12-04495)]. EOs with C5 units are termed monoterpenes. Monoterpenes are the major component of EOs, responsible for aroma and flavor, and they act as important ingredients in the agricultural, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries [ [27](#B27-applsci-12-04495)]. They include different types, such as nerol, linalool, citronellol, and citral [ [28](#B28-applsci-12-04495)]. Sesquiterpenes usually contain 15 carbons in their skeleton structures with different functional groups such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and alcohols [ anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activities [ [30](#B30-applsci-12-04495)]. Many factors influence the chemistry of EOs, including the plant organ, genetic factors, geographical variations, environmental conditions, type of species the plant belongs to, mode of production, storage conditions, etc. [ [31](#B31-applsci-12-04495), [32](#B32-applsci-12-04495), [33](#B33-applsci-12-04495)]. present in EOs and have been proven to be responsible for the effects of EOs. Any small change in these components may change the aroma properties of EOs. The chemical structure of EO components is given in [Table 1](#applsci-12-04495-t001). 3. Methodology [Figure 1](#applsci-12-04495-f001)). 4. How Does Aroma Work with the Brain? [34](#B34-applsci-12-04495), [35](#B35-applsci-12-04495)], the autonomic nervous system, and the endocrine system [ [2](#B2-applsci-12-04495)]. Aromas can elicit quick emotional changes in humans [ [36](#B36-applsci-12-04495)]. When the aroma from essential oils is inhaled, the volatile molecules bind to the olfactory receptors in the cilia cells. Hence, the electrochemical message is transmitted through the olfactory tract and olfactory bulb to reach the brain's olfactory regions, which stimulates autonomic function and a strong emotional response regarding the received aroma stimuli [ [37](#B37-applsci-12-04495)]. The aroma elucidates different pathways: orthonasal (odor passes through the nose) and retronasal (odor enters the nostrils through the oral cavity) pathways. Both possess different sensory experiences [ [38](#B38-applsci-12-04495), [39](#B39-applsci-12-04495)]. Generally, the perception of aromas through these two different routes excites two different sites in the human brain. Likewise, the different odorant types elicit different responses that depend upon the routes through which the odorants are administered [ [40](#B40-applsci-12-04495)]. Retronasal perception occurs only when the food has been chewed. The inhaled aroma is influenced by factors such as temperature and water-soluble and non-volatile components of the oral cavity [ [41](#B41-applsci-12-04495), [42](#B42-applsci-12-04495)]. Hummel and Heilmann stated that the perception response was larger when an odor was presented retronasally [ [43](#B43-applsci-12-04495)]. [44](#B44-applsci-12-04495)]. From the PC, subcortical projections spread [ [ [47](#B47-applsci-12-04495)] and thalamus nuclei. Furthermore, the thalamus extends its projections the OFC and insular cortex [ [48](#B48-applsci-12-04495), [49](#B49-applsci-12-04495), [50](#B50-applsci-12-04495)]. This network EC, [51](#B51-applsci-12-04495)] olfactory quick signals ( [Figure 2](#applsci-12-04495-f002)). [52](#B52-applsci-12-04495)]. Any VOCs that enter the bloodstream through the nasal or lung mucosa diffuse into the olfactory nerves and the brain's limbic system [ [53](#B53-applsci-12-04495), [54](#B54-applsci-12-04495)]. Odors induce perception, emotional learning, belief, cognitive, behavioral, and other associated emotions [ [55](#B55-applsci-12-04495), [56](#B56-applsci-12-04495)]. Any pleasant or unpleasant odors can elicit olfactory emotions [ [57](#B57-applsci-12-04495), [58](#B58-applsci-12-04495), [59](#B59-applsci-12-04495)] and can produce positive or negative moods, which eventually result in behavioral changes. A positive mood increases productivity and tends to help [ [60](#B60-applsci-12-04495), [61](#B61-applsci-12-04495), [62](#B62-applsci-12-04495)]. A negative mood suppresses prosocial behavior [ [63](#B63-applsci-12-04495)]. If any odor triggers anxiety, it creates a fear associated with that odor [ [64](#B64-applsci-12-04495)]. Thus, the olfactory efferent is wired to the brain to produce a sequence of psychological-emotional responses resulting in emotions, memory processing, and mind-body interactions [ [65](#B65-applsci-12-04495)]. 5. Phytoncides and Their Functions [66](#B66-applsci-12-04495), [67](#B67-applsci-12-04495)]. Approximately 400,000 known aromatic and medicinal plants have essential oils [ [68](#B68-applsci-12-04495)]. Phytoncides were first devised by a Russian biochemist, Boris P. Tokin, in 1928. They are volatile chemicals emitted by plants to defend against viruses, bacteria, saccharomyces, molds, and protozoans [ [69](#B69-applsci-12-04495)] or to prevent decay and herbivore attacks. Phytoncides also exhibit other beneficial effects, such as antibacterial [ [70](#B70-applsci-12-04495)], anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-stress, analgesic, and anti-spoilage activities, and they malaria [ [86](#B86-applsci-12-04495)], anti-septic activity, and anthelminthic activity; in addition, they facilitate wound healing [ [87](#B87-applsci-12-04495)], can act as cholesterol inhibitors [ [88](#B88-applsci-12-04495)], can enhance sleep [ [89](#B89-applsci-12-04495), [90](#B90-applsci-12-04495), [91](#B91-applsci-12-04495)], and even enhance bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics [ [92](#B92-applsci-12-04495), [93](#B93-applsci-12-04495)]. Phytoncides exert allelopathy effects, where these secondary metabolites from plants affect microorganisms, acting as a defence mechanism for plants. Hence, phytoncides are recognized as allelochemicals [ [94](#B94-applsci-12-04495)]. Phytoncides can prevent mucosal damage in the digestive tract and have been proven to have anti-inflammatory effects in the stomach, colon, and other digestive parts such as the esophagus, small [70](#B70-applsci-12-04495)] ( [Figure 3](#applsci-12-04495-f003)). [95](#B95-applsci-12-04495), [96](#B96-applsci-12-04495)]. The sleeping brain and waking brain receive the aroma and react differently. In our study, the temporal activity of the brain was found to increase upon the inhalation of lavender aroma during sleep. Sleep quality was also found to increase depending upon the aroma stimuli [ [97](#B97-applsci-12-04495)]. Many plants, such as pine, garlic, cedar, and onion, can emit phytoncides [ [98](#B98-applsci-12-04495)]. Woo and his team studied the sleep-enhancing effects of phytoncides derived from pine oils. Pine essential oil's most important volatile terpenoid phytoncides are myrcene, - pinene, 3-carene [ [99](#B99-applsci-12-04495)]. Amongst these terpenoids, -pinene is the most abundant and a significant phytoncide with a characteristic odor, hence its use in perfumes [ [100](#B100-applsci-12-04495)]. In our study, inhalation or oral administration of -pinene showed enormous biological activities, such as anxiolytic, (Citrus sinensis; C.sinensis) produces an anxiolytic effect in individuals exposed to an anxiogenic situation [ [105](#B105-applsci-12-04495)]. The aroma of bitter orange (C. aurantium) has shown anxiolytic activity in chronic myeloid leukemia patients [ [106](#B106-applsci-12-04495)], crack cocaine users [ [107](#B107-applsci-12-04495)], and rodents [ [108](#B108-applsci-12-04495)]. [109](#B109-applsci-12-04495), [110](#B110-applsci-12-04495)]. Like -pinene, the oral administration of 3-carene is reported to have a sleep-enhancing effect [ [90](#B90-applsci-12-04495), [91](#B91-applsci-12-04495)]. Previous studies show that the Non-Random Eye Movement augmented by GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic signaling. Thus, phytoncides enhance sleep effects than conventional hypnotics [ [98](#B98-applsci-12-04495)]. [72](#B72-applsci-12-04495), [90](#B90-applsci-12-04495), [92](#B92-applsci-12-04495)]. A study in human prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells showed the antiproliferative effects of aroma oil extracted from Citrus japonica Thunb. (C. japonica) [ [111](#B111-applsci-12-04495)]. Additionally, phytoncides decrease stress hormones [ [112](#B112-applsci-12-04495)] and induce physiological relaxation in humans [ [113](#B113-applsci-12-04495)]. The aroma of C. aurantium restores learning and memory in scopolamine-induced memory impairment and aids in treating Alzheimer's disease [ [114](#B114-applsci-12-04495)]. Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck (C. limon) enhances cognitive performance, mood, attention level, and memory [ [115](#B115-applsci-12-04495)]. 5.1. Phytoncides in Dental Care [94](#B94-applsci-12-04495)]. Microbial attacks on [ [116](#B116-applsci-12-04495)]. Candida albicans (C. albicans) is responsible for this effect on dentures [ [117](#B117-applsci-12-04495)]. Lee and his co-workers used a phytoncide-incorporated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) biocompatible dental polymer [ [118](#B118-applsci-12-04495)]. Their results confirm that the fungal attachment on the dental surface was reduced significantly compared with the control. Phytoncides-incorporated PMMA material can be used as a dental base resin to execute anti-fungal effects and reduce oral biofilm deposition. Eugenol is widely used in dental treatments because of its antibacterial and anesthetic properties. Eugenol has been used in root canal sealers, temporary fillings, and paste for pulp capping. It is also helpful in tooth canal treatment [ [119](#B119-applsci-12-04495)]. Incorporating phytoncide within microcapsules (PTMC) into the denture base can combat denture stomatitis. Phytoncide is released from PTMC at an acidic pH and inhibits the growth of C. albicans [ [120](#B120-applsci-12-04495)]. 5.2. Anti-Cancer Activity of Phytoncides [121](#B121-applsci-12-04495)]. Thirty-seven monoterpenes have been reported for their anti-cancer properties [ [122](#B122-applsci-12-04495)]. -pinene possesses anti-cancer activities against various cancer types, including human hepatocellular carcinoma [ [123](#B123-applsci-12-04495), [124](#B124-applsci-12-04495)] and prostate cancer [ [125](#B125-applsci-12-04495)]. -pinene induces apoptosis in human ovarian cancer [ [126](#B126-applsci-12-04495)] and suppresses the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human breast cancer cells, thus inhibiting cancer invasion [ [100](#B100-applsci-12-04495)]. These anti-cancer activities of -pinene are possible through increased CD56 and CD107a, resulting in enhanced NK cell activation. The activated NK cells release perforins, which easily attach to the cell membranes of cancer cells and induce pores on its surface, leading to the diffusion of granzyme B proteins, resulting in the apoptosis of cancer cells [ [89](#B89-applsci-12-04495)]. Aroma components in the oils of sweet orange (Citrus aurantium var. dulcis; C. aurantium var. dulcis), grape (Citrus paradise; C. paradise), and lemon (C. limon) were also found to induce apoptosis in human leukemic (HL-60) cancer cells [ [127](#B127-applsci-12-04495)]. Blood orange (C sinensis) essential oil inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prevents cell proliferation, and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells [ [128](#B128-applsci-12-04495)]. 5.3. Benefits of Exposure to the Forest Environment [129](#B129-applsci-12-04495)]. During stress, cortisol secretion increases through the increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system. Phytoncides have many positive effects, such as stress reduction, reducing cortisol levels, minimizing blood pressure, and enhancing the immune system and autonomic nervous system [ [130](#B130-applsci-12-04495)]. A handful of studies evaluated the effect of phytoncides on improving immune function [ [131](#B131-applsci-12-04495), [132](#B132-applsci-12-04495), [133](#B133-applsci-12-04495)]. The biogenic VOCs were profoundly found to regulate blood pressure and endocrine activity, reduce blood glucose, maintain mental health by relieving stress, boost immunity, treat respiratory diseases, and fight cancer aids patients with hypertension [ [142](#B142-applsci-12-04495)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ [143](#B143-applsci-12-04495)], chronic heart failure [ [144](#B144-applsci-12-04495), [145](#B145-applsci-12-04495)], and chronic stroke [ [146](#B146-applsci-12-04495)]. Forest bathing with phytoncides promotes brain function by producing relaxation, reducing mental stress, promoting cognitive ability, and stabilizing the mood [ [147](#B147-applsci-12-04495)]. In recent studies, more attention has been given to the physiological relaxation effects of forest environments [ [148](#B148-applsci-12-04495), [149](#B149-applsci-12-04495)]. The forest environment enriched with phytoncides will increase parasympathetic nervous activity (a sign of relaxation), suppress sympathetic nervous activity (a sign of reduced stress) [ [130](#B130-applsci-12-04495), [150](#B150-applsci-12-04495), [151](#B151-applsci-12-04495)], reduce blood pressure [ [152](#B152-applsci-12-04495)], reduce heart rate [ [153](#B153-applsci-12-04495)], and diminish the level of stress hormones such as salivary cortisol [ [148](#B148-applsci-12-04495)]. 6. Essential Oils and Their Health Outcomes [154](#B154-applsci-12-04495)]. [155](#B155-applsci-12-04495)]. Besides health disorders and irreversible diseases, stress also negatively impacts human emotions. Managing stress can address those negative consequences [ [156](#B156-applsci-12-04495)]. Aroma oils can be inhaled or massaged over the skin; the applied oil vaporizes and stimulates the olfactory system [ [157](#B157-applsci-12-04495)]. L. angustifolia aroma oil reduces mental stress and increases arousal [ [158](#B158-applsci-12-04495)]. Likewise, Yuzu essential oil (Citrus junos Sieb. ex Tanaka) reduces negative emotional stress [ [159](#B159-applsci-12-04495), [160](#B160-applsci-12-04495)] and inhibits platelet aggregation, which could be helpful in individuals with a high risk of cardiovascular disease [ [161](#B161-applsci-12-04495)]. [162](#B162-applsci-12-04495)], reduces vibrations and promotes relaxation [ [163](#B163-applsci-12-04495)], and increases alertness [ [164](#B164-applsci-12-04495)]. Aromatherapy reduces blood pressure, anxiety [ [165](#B165-applsci-12-04495)], and agitation [ [166](#B166-applsci-12-04495)] in dementia patients. Aromatherapy with essential oils such as linalool, santalol, cedrol, piperonal, true lavender, and sweet orange oil improved sleep in the elderly with dementia [ [167](#B167-applsci-12-04495)]. The inhalation of essential oils seems to lessen depression and increase the sleep quality of postpartum mothers [ [168](#B168-applsci-12-04495), [169](#B169-applsci-12-04495)]. The essential oils of sandalwood, sweet marjoram, and lavender are purportedly used in sedation, relaxation, treating anxiety, and relieving irritability, loneliness, insomnia, and depression [ [170](#B170-applsci-12-04495), [171](#B171-applsci-12-04495), [172](#B172-applsci-12-04495)]. [163](#B163-applsci-12-04495)]. Chamine and Oken evaluated the stress-reducing effect of lavender aroma. The results show that lavender aroma promoted post-stress cognitive performance. Hence, the protective effects of lavender aroma on working memory prove that aromas protect cognitive function after stress [ [173](#B173-applsci-12-04495)]. Lavender aroma lessens cardiac excitation, reduces BP, and is effective in hypertension and palpitations [ [154](#B154-applsci-12-04495)]. The aroma from Litsea cubeba (L.cubeba) is used in treating cognitive discomfort. It was found to improve mood and reduce stress and confusion by reducing the salivary cortisol level in healthy individuals [ [174](#B174-applsci-12-04495)] ( [Table 2](#applsci-12-04495-t002)). [175](#B175-applsci-12-04495)]. Pain induces fear, which further deteriorates social interactions and produces anxiety, depression, and stress [ [176](#B176-applsci-12-04495), [177](#B177-applsci-12-04495), [178](#B178-applsci-12-04495)]. The aroma of agave (Polianthes tuberosa; P. tuberosa) essential oil reduced test anxiety [ [179](#B179-applsci-12-04495)]. The aroma of lavender and bergamot EO can act as an antidepressant and relaxant. Pleasant odors encourage a positive mood [ [170](#B170-applsci-12-04495)] and alleviate negative emotions [ [180](#B180-applsci-12-04495)]. Bitter orange essential oil (C. aurantium) reduces first-stage labor pain and anxiety in primiparous women [ [181](#B181-applsci-12-04495)]. Ginger (Zingiber officinale; Z. officinale) and orange essential oil (C. sinensis) reduce knee pain in older adults [ [182](#B182-applsci-12-04495)]. Bergamot (Citrus bergamia; C. bergamia) essential oil possesses anti-nociceptive and anti-allodynic properties and modulates the sensitive perception of pain [ [183](#B183-applsci-12-04495)]. Bitter orange (C. aurantium) and damask rose blossom (Rosa damascena mill L.; R. damascena) aromas, together, were found to improve the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome [ [184](#B184-applsci-12-04495), [185](#B185-applsci-12-04495)].
