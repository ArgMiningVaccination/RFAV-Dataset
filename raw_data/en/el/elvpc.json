I treat patients with asthma, atopic dermatitis, immune deficiencies and many other conditions. I love working closely with my patients to manage their care and find a solution to what is ailing them. Thanks to new technology and research, we have a plethora of information, studies and evidenced-based medicine to guide physicians as we provide patient care. While these guidelines are helpful, I also believe it is critical to get to know each of my patients as individuals. The human body is complex and we all react to diseases and treatments differently, so I take the time to listen and understand how my patients are feeling and how their health is impacting their daily life. Being able to help my young patients feel better gives me the greatest satisfaction. In addition to providing patient care, I am also actively involved in the editing of various medical journals and in the education of young physicians. Currently, I am the associate editor for a couple of journals including the Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology. I believe lifelong learning is important, especially in the medical field where new discoveries take place each day. Through teaching, I hope to pass on my love for learning and inspire the next generation of immunologists to continue to ask questions, broaden their horizons and explore the unknown. I also hold an academic appointment at the University of California, Davis as clinical professor of medicine in the Department of Rheumatology, Allergy and Clinical Immunology and serve as their associate program director for the Allergy and Immunology Fellowship Training Program.
