Vaccine product innovations offer important means to simplify logistics, increase the acceptability and safety of immunisation, minimise missed opportunities, and facilitate outreach. There is increasing recognition of the need to employ targeted solutions to extend vaccine access to reach the unreached. The VIPS process involved in-depth research, stakeholder consultations, and development and application of a methodology capable of evaluating a variety of technologies at different stages along the product development pipeline continuum. The work required understanding countries' needs to consider the expected financial and non-financial impacts of innovations; developing common principles across the Alliance to assess the long-term benefits of product innovations; and convening a platform of stakeholders to articulate a clear and aligned perspective on priority innovations. By prioritising innovations in vaccine products, the goal of VIPS is to provide greater clarity to manufacturers and partners to inform and influence investment decisions. VIPS outcomes also represent a first step to mobilise key decision-makers and funders and chart a strategic pathway forward for the prioritised innovations. More details can be found on the methodology, process and outcomes; scope of innovations assessed within VIPS; and VIPS Steering Committee here: The VIPS - Vaccine Innovation Prioritisation Strategy - process concluded in May 2020 with a decision to prioritise 3 innovations / approaches for which the Alliance will engage in to advance development, policy and access: The next steps for the VIPS Alliance are to define end-to-end strategies for the three prioritised innovations, including developing clear action plans to accelerate their advancement to uptake and impact. The VIPS Alliance's long-term vision for vaccine micro-array patches (MAPs) is to implement MAP products for priority vaccines to overcome immunisation barriers to ensure equitable access to, and improved effectiveness of, vaccines in LMICs and contribute to global health security. To achieve this long-term vision, the VIPS Alliance has developed an end-to-end five-year Action Plan for vaccine MAPs that: More details on the five measurable target outcomes and underlying activities that have been identified can be found in the Public Summary of the VIPS Alliance Action Plan for MAPs (link below). The public summary is a condensed version including key background on MAPs and the list of target outcomes and activities. A longer version of the Action Plan is available upon request.

D escription of innovation: ? Vaccines need to be stored at their proper temperature to maintain their potency, which is commonly at 2 -8oC. ? Vaccines can be exposed to multiple freeze -thaw cycles and long durations of sub -zero temperatures along the different segments of the cold chain . For freeze -sensitive vaccines, this can result in physical, chemical and immunological changes to the formulation, reduced potency of the vaccine, administration of sub -optimal vaccine , local reactions to the vaccine such as st erile abscesses, and increased wastage (if the freeze exposure is identified and the vaccine is discarded) (1) . ? Many vaccines are freeze -sensitive, including those containing aluminium adjuvants. When vaccines containing aluminium adjuvant are frozen, the anti gen -adjuvant particles agglomerate and sediment which results in the irreversible loss of potency. ? Freeze damaged vaccines can be detected using the ?shake test?, but it is not always performed given lack of training and the need for a control vaccine to c onduct the test. ? Developing novel freeze stable formulations using different excipients could prevent agglomeration and stabilize the potency of vaccines. ? The addition of excipients such as glycerin, polyethylene glycol 300, or propylene glycol (PG) have been demonstrated to reduce the freeze sensitivity of Hepatitis B vaccine (2) and other vaccines contai ning aluminum adjuvant including diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP); and pentavalent (hepatitis B, DTP, Haemophilus influenza type VIPS Phase I Executive Summary Freeze Indicator on Primary Vaccine Containers pdf](/news/document-library/12-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-freeze-indicator-primary-vaccine-containers) [12 VIPS Phase I Technical Note Freeze Indicator on Primary Containers pdf](/news/document-library/12-vips-phase-i-technical-note-freeze-indicator-primary-containers-pdf) [13 VIPS Phase I Executive Summary Intradermal Devices pdf](/news/document-library/13-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-intradermal-devices-pdf) VIPS Phase I Technical Note Intradermal Syringes pdf](/news/document-library/13-vips-phase-i-technical-note-intradermal-syringes-pdf) [14 VIPS Phase I Executive summary Liquid Heat Stable Formulations pdf](/news/document-library/14-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-liquid-heat-stable-formulations-pdf) [14 VIPS Phase I Technical Note Liquid Heat Stable Formulations pdf](/news/document-library/14-vips-phase-i-technical-note-liquid-heat-stable-formulations-pdf) [15 VIPS Phase I Executive Summary Microarray Patches pdf](/news/document-library/15-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-microarray-patches-pdf) [15 VIPS Phase I Technical Note Microarray Patches pdf](/news/document-library/15-vips-phase-i-technical-note-microarray-patches-pdf) [16 VIPS Phase I Executive summary Oral Fast Dissolving Tablets pdf](/news/document-library/16-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-oral-fast-dissolving-tablets-pdf) [16 VIPS Phase I Technical Note Oral Fast Dissolving Tablets pdf](/news/document-library/16-vips-phase-i-technical-note-oral-fast-dissolving-tablets-pdf) [17 VIPS Phase I Executive Summary Plastic Needles For Reconstitution pdf](/news/document-library/17-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-plastic-needles-reconstitution-pdf) [17 VIPS Phase I Technical Note Plastic Needles for Reconstitution pdf](/news/document-library/17-vips-phase-i-technical-note-plastic-needles-reconstitution-pdf) [18 VIPS Phase I Executive Summary Prefilled Blow Fill Seal Droppers Dispensers pdf](/news/document-library/18-vips-phase-i-executive-summary-prefilled-blow-fill-seal-droppers) [18_VIPS Phase I_Technical Note Prefilled Blow Fill Seal Droppers Dispensers pdf](/news/document-library/18vips-phase-itechnical-note-prefilled-blow-fill-seal-droppers-dispensers-pdf) 11.06.2019 Page 1 of 17 VIPS is a Vaccine Alliance project from Ga vi, World Health Organization, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, PATH and UNICEF Prefilled polymer BFS dropper s /dispenser s Comparator ?: Single dose vial (liquid ) and dropper/dispenser Section 1: Summary of innovation 1.1 Example images : PATH prototype of BFS oral squeeze tube in a five -dose strip Image: provided by PATH 1.2. D escription of innovation: ? Blow -fill -seal (BFS) is an aseptic filling process that is widely used to produce a variety of pharmaceuticals in polymer primary containers. In the blow -fill -seal process, a polymer resin is melted into a parison, which is blown into a mould , filled, and sealed, all in a continuous process within a single piece of equipment. This is in contrast to preformed polymer primary containers, in which the container is first produced and sterilized, and then shippe d to a different site for filling and sealing. ? A wide variety of different container designs are feasible with BFS . o For oral or intranasal vaccines, BFS containers can be designed as squeeze tube dropper or dispenser devices for delivery of the container?s contents directly to the mouth or nostrils. This approach is the focus of this Technical Note. o For single -dose parenteral vaccines, BFS containers can be used similar to glass ampoules, with the top twisted off and an AD N&S used to draw up and inject the vaccine. BFS containers can also be designed with inset septum, similar to a glass vial. These innovation s are reviewed in the Parenteral BFS Primary Container Technical Note. o BFS has the potential to be used for production of compact prefilled autodisabl e devices (CPADs), which are reviewed in the CPAD Technical Note. ? For the existing vial presentations of liquid and lyophilised vaccines, single dose vials, rather than multi -dose vials (MDVs) were used for the comparator, because in most cases, the innovation being considered is a single -dose presentation. However, when multi -dose vials are currently used by countries and would be the true comparator for countries , a comparison against the multi -dose vial will also be condu cted under Phase II if this innovation is prioritised and for antigens where multi -dose vials are used by countries.

MAPs consists of an array of micro -projections on a patch . The micro -projections are coated with or are composed of, vaccine in a dry formulation. When a MAP is applied to the skin, the vaccine is delivered into the dermis and/or epidermis layers. ? MAPs can be administered without an applicator , by applying pressure with fingers, or using an integrated applicator. ? Like solid -dose implants (SDIs), MAPS are sharps -free devices that could potentially be used with all injected vaccines (once they have been reformulated). However, development of MAPs is more advanced than SDIs and current MAPs do not have a separate applicator, which will likely be needed for SDIs. Stage of development ? Various formats of MAPs are being developed for vaccine delivery by several different developers. ? Three developers have tested influenza vaccine MAPs in phase I clinical trials , and preclinical development is underway with other vaccines, including measles -rubella (MR) . ? MAPs for delivery of non -vaccine products, such as teriparatide (for osteoporosis) and Zolmitriptan (migraine), have been evaluated in phase II and III trials respectively.

The projections are coated with, or composed of, vaccine in a dry formulation. When applied to the skin, the vaccine is delivered into the dermis and/or epidermis, which a re rich in antigen presenting cell (APCs). Several different formats of MAPs are being developed: ? With, or without, applicators; when present, the applicator can be a separate component or integrated with the MAP. The most advanced MAPs in development either have no applicator or an integrated applicator. Therefore, MAPs with a separate applicator are not considered in this assessment; ? Solid micro -projections coated with vaccine; ? Micro -projections formed of vaccine plus biocompatible excipients that dissolve or biodegrade in the skin; ? Hydrogel micro -projections that swell in the skin and act as a condui t for diffusion of the active ingredient from a backing layer (primarily in development for drug delivery). In theory, MAPs could be used for administration of any type of vaccine, although there might be some vaccine -specific limitations: it might not be possible to formulate some vaccines so that they remain potent during the manufacture or storage of MAPs; some vaccines (in particular th ose formulated with an adjuvant) might have unacceptable levels of local reactogenicity when delivered into the skin; a nd in some cases, MAPs might not have the payload capacity for the vaccine plus necessary excipients, or it might not be possible to concentrate the antigen sufficiently so that it can be loaded onto the MAP. Summary of vaccine and innovation compatibility : Microarray patches ( MAPs ) could potentially be used to deliver any vaccine that is currently administered by injection with needle and syringe (N&S). The technology does have some features that might however preclude its use with some vaccines, in particular: 1. Reactogenicity: MAPs deliver vaccines to the skin rather than intramuscularly (IM) or sub -cutaneously (SC). The subsequent initial immune response takes place near the skin surface and is more visible as local reactogenicity, than with IM or SC injections. While this administration route may offer the potential for dose -sparing for some vaccines, reactogenicity seen with MAP delivery of some ?more -reactogenic? formulations might not be acceptable to recipients. The reactogenicity seen with MAP delivery of some ?more -reactogenic? vaccines might not be acceptable to recipients. The inherent reactogenicity of any of the priority vaccines has NOT been considered in this analysis, and no vaccines have been excluded on this basis. Reactogenicity due to inclusion of an adjuvant HAS been considered (see below).

SDIs consist of vaccines (including antigens, adjuvants and excipients) that have been reformulated into a solid format . This is typically shaped like a needle that is sharp and strong enough to be implanted below the skin and the dose it contains either dissolves immediately or is released slowly. ? In some cases, SDIs are contained in a cartridge or cassette for easy handling. ? An applicator is used to propel the SDI into the skin using a spring or compressed gas. The applicator might be separate and re -usable, or integrated and single use. ? SDIs could be regarded as an alternative to microarray patches (MAPs) as they should not have the reactogenicity of MAPs and possibly have a higher payload. But SDIs have other drawbacks such as the need for an applicator and being earlier in development than MAPs. Stage of development ? SDIs are in a very early stage of development . ? No clinical studies with vaccines have been published.

After injection, the dose either d issolves immediately or is released slowly depending on the formulation. Some SDIs are contained in a cartridge or cassette for easy handling prior to administration with a n applicator to propel the SDI into the skin using a spring or compressed gas. The applicator might be separate and re -usable, or integrated and single use. Summary of innovation applicability to vaccines : Solid dose implants (SDIs) could potentially be used to deliver any vaccine that is currently administered by injection with nee dle and syringe (N&S). The technology does have some features that might however preclude its use with some vaccines , as the product is developed , in particular: 1. Adjuvants: The need to dry the vaccine for incorporation into the SDI might preclude the use of some adjuvants, including those based on aluminium salts (such as alum). We have assumed that manufacturing process es will be developed that are compatible with aluminium salt based adjuvants, or that it might prove to be technically feasible to rem ove the adjuvant from the formulation of some vaccines such as HPV and HepB whilst maintain ing immunogenicity. For some vaccines however (RTS,S and HIV) we have assumed the adjuvant will not be suitable for SDIs, nor will there be interest in re moving the adjuvant. a 2. Payload. Antigens need to be available at a sufficiently high concentration ( which might be higher than standard bulk harvests) to enable a full dose to be loaded into a SDI . The amount of vaccine required to be loaded onto a SDI relative to the yields of the manufacturing process has NOT been considered in this analysis, and no vaccines have been excluded on this basis . 3. Route of delivery . SDIs will not be suitable for use wit h vaccines that are currently delivered orally. Live -attenuated rotavirus vaccines, and E TVAX , the candidate vaccine selected as the exemplar for Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) have therefore not been considered for use with SDI s. The candidate M.t b vaccine VPM1002 is a recombinant BCG so will need to be delivered intradermally (ID) thus SDIs will not be suitable for administration of this vaccine. The vaccines considered, or not considered for use with SDI s in this Technical Note are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. a Alumimium -salt based adjuvants and saponins might be compatible with SDIs, but oil -in-water adjuvants are unlikely to be suitable.
