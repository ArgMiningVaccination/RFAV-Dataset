G.M. WOERLEE 33 Nurturing Suspicion What College Students Learn About Science Skeptics complain about postmodern attacks on science in college \"science and society\" classes but don't address the reasons these criticisms are so persuasive. When college students don't learn about the complexities and social dimensions of scientific inquiry, they are vulnerable to the egalitarian appeal of postmodern relativism. Skeptics must confront this problem.

Debunking of unsupported claims has a cherished place in science and in scientific skepticism.) A more appropriate term, one I like, is \"explainers.\" Following good, critical investigation, science- oriented skeptics often can explain things. Without denying the validity of one's powerful, puzzling personal experience, scientific investigation can pro\u00ad vide a plausible natural explanation. That's when this business gets rewarding. We have two such articles in this issue. In \"Darkness, Tunnels, and Light,\" G.M. Woerlee, an anesthesiologist prac\u00ad ticing in Holland, seeks to explain the \"wondrous\" phenomena often reported since antiquity by the dying or those recovering from near-death experiences. As an anesthesiologist he has to view both bodily and mental phenomena from a physiological perspective. He started his inquiries out of curiosity, and he ends up showing the ways the functioning of the body can generate seemingly profound experiences of darkness, tunnels, and light. B.D. Gildenbcrg explains an entirely different subject. He describes once- classified Skyhook balloon-launch programs during the early decades of the Cold War (beginning in 1947). You'll see show how these extraordinary bal\u00ad loons and the events surrounding their payload recoveries likely provided stim\u00ad uli for a host of themes that have become part of UFO lore. These balloons were huge\u2014double the size of the Hindenberg. Their operations were secret because they were part of missions to spy on the Russians or at least take large packages of instruments aloft to gain useful information about Soviet threats. Gildenberg's revelations are those of a participant. He worked thirty-five years with Skyhook balloon operations. Reading his article, and learning about once-classified projects like Project Gopher and Project Grab Bag, one can almost (almost) sympathize with UFO believers when they attributed semi- accurate reports of strange sightings and surrounding military hush-ups to alien spacecraft. In another vein altogether, we offer a heartfelt confessional from a former New Age author and leader, Karla McLaren. She describes the anti-science cast of the New Age movement and her painful struggle to escape its grip and embrace skepticism, whose style wasn't particularly open or welcoming. She ends up thanking prominent skeptics for their contributions, but I think she offers some valuable lessons we can all take to heart. In \"Nurturing Suspicion,\" Phil Mole draws upon his personal experiences taking graduate-level \"science and society\" classes. He describes the distorted, negative view of science that students get in such courses. Postmodernism pre\u00ad vails, and science becomes a caricature. Finally, Douglas M. Stokes, a knowledgeable internal critic of research methodology in parapsychology, trains his keen critical eye on Brenda Dunne, whose \"relaxed methodology\" doing remote viewing experiments at Robert Jahns laboratory at Princeton seems central to their reported (and disputed) successes.

The report, \"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking,\" was written by Seth Shulman and issued on behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The 38-page report (available at www.ucsusa.org) states: \"A growing number of scientists, policy makers, and technical specialists both inside and outside the govern\u00ad ment allege that the current Bush administration has suppressed or dis\u00ad torted the scientific analyses of federal agencies to bring these results in line with administration policy.\" The findings cover many policy areas, including environmental protec\u00ad tion, abstinence/sex education, and pre-war claims that aluminum tubes found in Iraq were to be used for enriching uranium\u2014and thus creating nuclear weapons. In response to an EPA report on the effects of climate change, the report charges that \"the Bush administration has sought to exaggerate uncertainty by relying on disreputable and fringe-science reports and preventing informed discussion on the issue.\" While acknowledging that previous presidents also engaged in distorting and manipulating science, the report concluded that the Bush administra\u00ad tion's efforts to do so were \"unprece\u00ad dented.\" The White House largely dis\u00ad missed the report as a politically driven collection of unrelated incidents that do not constitute a pervasive anti- science bias. Still, many of the report's findings have been independently verified. One high-profile example, Iraq's aluminum tubes, was the subject of a 60 Minutes II segment titled \"The Man Who Knew\" (February 4, 2004). It featured Houston Wood, a senior scientist at Oak Ridge Laboratories and an author\u00ad ity on uranium enrichment by cen\u00ad trifuge. Wood and virtually all other scientists concluded that there was no link between the tubes and a nuclear program, yet their findings were at odds with Bush administration claims. While a CIA report advocated the administration's view that the tubes were to be used for developing nuclear weapons, a set of technical experts from the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge, Livermore, and Los Alamos national lab\u00ad oratories reviewed the CIA analysis and disagreed with its findings. Independent investigations by the State Department's intelligence branch and the International Atomic Energy Agency also concluded that the tubes were unsuitable for ura\u00ad nium enrichment. This information was presented to Secretary of State Colin Powell and others prior to their remarks on the topic. Yet Powell embraced the discred\u00ad ited CIA report and downplayed the collective scientific position, testifying that \"Most U.S. experts think [the tubes] arc intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium.\" Wood stated that politics overrode science in how the information was presented to Congress and the American people. \"Science was not pushing this forward. Scientists had made their evaluation, made their determination, and now didn't know what was happening.\" 60 Minutes II correspondent Scott Pelley asked Wood about Powell's claim: \"Do you know even one [expert] who says yes, these arc for nuclear weapons?\" Wood replied, \"I don't know a single one, anywhere.\" In this case the true scientific consensus was apparently exactly the opposite of what was stated by the administration in mak\u00ad ing its case for war. \u2014Benjamin Radford Benjamin Radford is managing editor of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and author of Media Mythmakers: How Journalists, Activists, and Advertisers Mislead Us (Prometheus 2003). Is Georgia Out of Her Mind? It is probably all over but the shouting now, but once again leaders of my beloved Georgia have succeeded in mak\u00ad ing my state the object of worldwide ridicule. Elected State School Super\u00ad intendent Kathy Cox first made interna\u00ad tional headlines when she tried to remove the word evolution from the state school curriculum in January (see sidebar on fol\u00ad lowing page). The brouhaha over that forced Cox to change her mind, helped greatly by complaints from former President Jimmy Carter, from the Atlanta Constitution, and from many CSICOP supporters and allies (including from me, from the National Center for Science Education, and from professors at the University of Georgia and Georgia State University such as Barry Palevitz and Sarah Pallas). Even Governor Sonny Perdue, a fellow Republican and archconservative, condemned removing the word, though he made it clear that he SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 5 NEWS AND COMMENT President Carter Defends Evolution in Biology Classes In early 2004, the Georgia state superintendent of schools Kathy Cox ordered the term evolution removed from the proposed biology curriculum. It was, she said, \"a buzz word that causes a lot of negative reaction.\" In its place, Cox sug\u00ad gested \"biological changes over time.\" After heavy criticism from educators and scientists, Cox apologized and replaced the word. Among those outraged was former President Jimmy Carter. who weighed in with the following statement: As a Christian, a trained engineer and scientist, and a professor at Emory University, I am embarrassed by Superintendent Kathy Cox's attempt to censor and distort the education of Georgia's students. Her recommendation that the word \"evolution\" be prohibited in textbooks will adversely effect the teaching of science and leave our high school graduates with a serious handicap as they enter college or private life where freedom of speech will be permitted. Nationwide ridicule of Georgia's public school system will be inevitable if this proposal is adopted, and additional and undeserved discredit will be brought on our excellent universities as our state's reputation is damaged. All high school science teachers, being college graduates, have studied evo\u00ad lution as a universal clement of university curricula, and would be under pres\u00ad sure to suppress their own educated beliefs in the classroom. lilt- existing and long-standing use of the word \"evolution\" in our state's text\u00ad books has not adversely affected Georgians' belief in the omnipotence of God as creator of the universe. There can be no incompatibility between Christian faith and proven facts concerning geology, biology, and astronomy. There is no need to teach that stars can fall out of the sky and land on a flat earth in order to defend our religious faith. Fortunately, it is the responsibility of the State Board of Education to make the final decision on the superintendent's ill-advised proposal. thought \"intelligent\" design/creationism deserved equal time. It turned out that backing down on the word was trivial compared with the rest of her proposal. As Professor Pallas noted (quoted in Colin Campbell's column in the Constitution on February 10), other ideas that would have been censored included \"the ecological impact of humans, age of the Earth, common ancestry, plate tectonics. Big Bang theory, and the history of life, the Earth and the universe.\" After a further firestorm of criticism. Superintendent Cox appears to have backed down on the broader destruction of the science curricula in Georgia. By mid-February, the Georgia Board of Education announced that it \"expects the new Georgia curriculum to be world- class, beginning with full inclusion of the recognized national standards in each curriculum area.\" Cox appears, as of this writing in late February, ready to go along with this radical idea. As columnist Campbell wrote on February 11, a major question still remains: \"Why the changes in the first place?\" The superintendent is, after all, a graduate of a highly regarded school (Emory University in Atlanta) and thus is unlikely to be as ignorant as her proposed changes would suggest. Campbell's conclusion seems likely to be right: that creationists tried \"to hijack our biology classes.\" The hijacking appears to have been thwarted. All may be well that ends well, as this embarrassing story appears to have ended. But there's an important lesson to be learned: protecting science and sci\u00ad ence education cannot be taken for granted. We must remain vigilant\u2014and not just in Georgia. \u2014Ed Buckner Ed Buckner is Southern Director fir the Council fir Secular Humanism and a native Georgian. Jury Verdict a Pain in the Neck for Chiropractors Chiropractors across North America went into damage-control mode after an Ontario (Canada) coroners inquest jury found that neck manipulation was the cause of the death of a forry-five-year-old Toronto woman. The five-person jury announced their verdict on January 16, 2004, bringing to a close the nearly two-year-long inquest, one of die longest in Ontario history. It found that factory worker Lana Dale Lewis's death was an \"accident\"\u2014that is, caused by the high chiropractic neck manipulation she received about two weeks before her death. The jury had only three choices for the cause of death: undetermined, accident, or natural causes. Lawyers for Canada's major chiropractic organizations had argued for two years that Lewis's stroke and death were the result of natural causes including her high blood pressure, smok\u00ad ing, obesity, migraine headaches, and alcohol consumption. Calling her a \"walking time bomb,\" they told the jurors that neck manipulation had nothing to do with her stroke and death. The jury, after examining 250 exhibits and listening to the often-conflicting tes\u00ad timony of twenty experts, found that her death came as a direct result of the upper neck adjustment administered by Toronto chiropractor Victor Emanuele. Six days after the manipulation, Lewis was admit\u00ad ted to hospital suffering from a stroke. She died from another stroke on September 12. Amani Oakley, the young lawyer for Lewis's large, working-class family, called the decision a \"complete and utter victory.\" Not surprisingly, Tim Danson, the high-profile lawyer for the Canadian Chiropractic Association and the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, said the verdict was \"perverse\" and characterized the inquest a \"massive miscarriage of justice.\" Danson claimed two world experts did not get to testify at the inquest and he threatened to appeal die decision. The lawyer for the coroner's 6 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT office called Danson's charges \"utter and complete nonsense.\" Its not surprising that the chiroprac\u00ad tors would come out swinging after the decision. Though the inquest process is supposed to be a nonadversarial search for the truth, the chiropractors had three high-priced legal teams at the inquest (one for the individual chiropractor, one representing the Ontario College of Chiropractic the provincial regulatory body, and one for the association and the teaching college). It is estimated their col\u00ad lective legal fees were well over two mil\u00ad lion dollars. Danson said negative media coverage associated with the inquest had caused a 25 percent drop in business, costing chiropractors in Canada more than $100 million. The verdict is likely going to cost them even more. Among the jury's seventeen recommendations are items that may give potential chiropractic patients pause. Jurors advised that chiropractors obtain written informed consent from every patient before performing a neck adjust\u00ad ment and that every patient be given an information sheet with risks and stroke symptoms clearly spelled out. They called for a database to collect all adverse events following neck manipulation and for large-scale studies into high-neck adjust\u00ad ments and stroke. The verdict is especially important because the inquest almost never hap\u00ad pened. After Lewis's death in 1996, the coroner's office invited three top chiro\u00ad practic officials to a meeting in an effort to avoid a time-consuming and cosdy inquiry. According to the coroners pre\u00ad sent that day, the chiropraaors agreed to inform their membership of the dangers of upper-neck manipulation and to take steps to inform their patients. They never did. In 1999, the Lewis family called for an inquest. Their request was denied in 2000. But when chiropractors began tak\u00ad ing out ads in local newspapers trumpet\u00ad ing the lack of an inquest as proof that Lewis's death was unconnected to neck manipulation, the family appealed and an inquest was finally called. The family also launched a $ 12 million lawsuit against the chiropractor who treated Lana Lewis. The inquest was a tortured affair, marred by constant legal wranglings and delays. At one point, more than ninety slides of Lewis's artery went missing only to be returned months later by the lawyer of one of the chiropractors; the original representative for the family. Dr. Murray Katz\u2014a well-known chiropractic critic\u2014 was dismissed after the chiropractors pro\u00ad duced private letters and e-mails they said were received in a plain brown envelope; and Danson, the chiropractors' lead lawyer, even made a motion to have the family's lawyer dismissed only months before the inquest's conclusion. In the end, these tactics did not sway the two-man, three-woman jury. Their landmark ruling was only the second of its kind in Canada. In 1998, a Saskatchewan inquest direcdy linked a chiropractic neck adjustment to the death of a twenty-one-year-old Saskatoon woman. Laurie Jean Mathiason suffered a massive stroke on her chiropractor's table on February 4, 1998, immediately follow\u00ad ing a neck adjustment. She died three days later. An inquest found there had been a traumatic rupture of her left verte\u00ad bral artery. All the jury recommendations, designed to prevent similar future deaths, concerned chiropractic neck manipulation. Their instructions that all chiropractors provide literature about the risks of chiropractic treatment in the waiting rooms and that the profession work with the government to conduct studies to determine the incidence of stroke associated with neck manipula\u00ad tion were never carried out. Canada's 5,000 chiropractors esti\u00ad mate that they perform approximately 10 million to 14 million neck manipu\u00ad lations a year. \u2014Paul Benedetti Paul Benedetti teaches journalism in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies at the University of Western Ontario.

Saddam: Not Even Remotely Viewed Remote viewing is defined by The Skeptic's Dictionary as \". . . the alleged psychic ability to perceive places, per\u00ad sons, and actions that are not within the range of the senses. ...\" In short, it would include the ability to \"see\" people and things from a distance. The December 13, 2003, capture of Saddam Hussein in the now-famous \"spider hole\" about nine miles south of Tikrit, Iraq, begs the question: Where were all the psychics and remote viewers? Couldn't they have provided the loca\u00ad tion of this torturer and killer of hun\u00ad dreds of thousands? To my knowledge, there was no for\u00ad mal prediction on record\u2014before the capture\u2014by any alleged psychic or remote viewer regarding the whereabouts of this ruthless killer. Of course such an accurate prediction would have saved the United States government scores of dol\u00ad lars and probably many lives. It's interesting that remote viewing predictions are readily made when they tend to be vague or unimportant\u2014such as \"seeing\" mountain ranges on Jupiter\u2014a gaseous planet. Perhaps this is why the CIA abandoned remote view\u00ad ing in 1995: They tried it, and it didn't work. If psychics have failed to pass die James Randi Educational Foundation's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, they're not likely going to be able to collect the $25 million reward for information leading to Saddam's capture. But all is not lost for remote viewers: Maybe they can provide the precise location of Osama bin Ladern \u2014Bryan Farha Bryan Farha is a professor at Oklahoma City University and a member of CSICOP's astrology subcommittee. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/hme2004 7 NEWS AND COMMENT Community College Biologists Oppose Alternative Medicine In November 2003 the Empire State Association of Two-Year College Biologists (ESATYCB) voted to con\u00ad firm a position statement opposing any association between community college biology instruction with the unscien\u00ad tific beliefs of chiropractic and other alternative medicine schemes. The ESATYCB is the first statewide educa\u00ad tional organization to openly oppose the encroachment of alternative medi\u00ad cine into undergraduate academic biol\u00ad ogy education. Alternative medicine uses the lan\u00ad guage of science, but convolutes scien\u00ad tific reasoning to justify its undemon- strated claims. Sales pitches that sound similar to research findings abound on the Internet and in print. Televised infomercials, uncritical news reports, and sensationalized \"investigative\" pro\u00ad grams are blurring the line berween that which is considered accepted science and that which is not. Inevitably, this widely disseminated and attractively packaged pseudoscience finds its way into biology classroom discussions. Recently, associations between alter\u00ad native medicine and well-regarded edu\u00ad cational, governmental, and medical institutions have been created. These relationships emerge as de facto endorsements of alternative medicines theories by respected groups. This per\u00ad ceived validation of \"junk biology\" undermines the task tors whose responsibility is the presenta\u00ad tion of science-based information. The ESATYCB has no authority over New York State's community college biology departments. The expectancy is that the policy statement will \"red flag\" alternative medicine as a questionable source of science-based information and provide support for educators who openly question dubious medical claims. \u2014Frank Reiser Frank Reiser is president of the Empire State Association of Two-Year College Biologists. Position of the Empire State Association of Two-Year College Biologists On Alternative Medicine The Empire State Association of Two-Year College Biologists strongly dis\u00ad approves of the association of academic biology departments at two-year colleges with unscientific and anti-scientific philosophies and practices. These are common among Chiropractic, Naturopathy, Homeopathy and many other practices known as \"complementary and alternative medicine.\" Such affiliations are likely to undercut scientific and critical thinking in the curriculum and hinder colleges trying to maintain high standards in science education. Additionally, such associations serve to legitimize unscientific and anti-scientific philosophies and practices and weaken the public's understanding of science at a time when a full appreciation of the scientific method is sorely needed.

Noted Researcher, Melvin Harris, Dies For the friends and admirers of British researcher Melvin Harris, the bells that rang in New Year's Day 2004 instead should have tolled mournfully. Harris died unexpectedly that afternoon at the age of almost 74, survived by his devoted wife Maureen. A writer, broadcaster, and television researcher, Harris became a highly respected authority on nearly every topic on which he set his sights. Whether it was the Amityville Horror hoax, the alleged prognostications of Nostradamus and Jeane Dixon, or the supposedly ghostly manifestations of spiritualist charlatans, Harris was sure to illuminate and dispel mystery. His 1986 Investigating the Unexplained remains a definitive work (reissued by Prometheus Books, 2003). He was also a leading expert on the grisly Whitechapel murders of 1888. In his Jack the Ripper\u2014The Bloody Truth (1987) and The Ripper File (1989), he shot down myriad \"solutions\" to the killers identity that were based on fan\u00ad tasies or fiction. His own solution, which he proposed in his The True Face of Jack the Ripper (1994), was, correct or not, a cut above most. Harris worked as a researcher for the BBC as well as for the popular Yorkshire Television-produced series, Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World and Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers. The Clarke series producer, Simon Welfare, described him as \"a great unsung hero\" who typically kept a low profile but\u2014 when ready with \"all the facts wonderfully checked\"\u2014then \"came out with guns blazing.\" Welfare termed Melvin Harris \"the best researcher I've known.\" And Isaac Asimov once wrote to him: \"You do mar\u00ad velous work, I admire you gready.\" No doubt many others echo those sentiments and mourn the loss of Melvin Harris and his contributions to rational inquiry. \u2014Joe Nickell Joe Nickell is Senior Research Fellow for CSICOP. 8 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT Cold, Icy Sedna Newest and Farthest Member of Solar System A small, cold object three times farther from die Sun than Pluto is die newest object in our solar system\u2014and die far\u00ad thest yet discovered. Named Sedna, for the Inuit goddess who created sea crea\u00ad tures of the Arctic, it is 1,000 miles in diameter, about diree quarters die sire of Pluto. The planetoid\u2014it's too small to be called a planet\u2014has a highly elongated orbit and is now 8 billion miles away from die Sun. It takes 10,500 years to make one orbit. Its temperature is about minus 440 degrees F. \"The Sun appears so small from diat distance diat you could completely block it out with head of pin,\" said die leader of die research team, Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology. NASA, which funded the research, announced the discovery March 15. Discovery photo of the distant new planetoid Sedna. NASA announced its discovery March 15. Sedna was discovered November 14 with a 48-inch telescope on Mount Palomar. Sedna is apparently die largest solar system object discovered since Pluto in 1930 (tiny Pluto's status as a \"planet\" has in recent years been under strong challenge). Sedna is probably die first detection of die long-hypothesized \"Oort cloud,\" a distant repository of icy bodies that periodically make dieir way into die inner solar system as comets. Sedna appears to be die second most reddish object in die solar system, after Mars. \u2014Kendrick Frazier Kendrick Frazier is Editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER San Francisco Legislator Pushes Feng Shui Building Codes A California lawmaker has proposed diat the Golden State \"adopt building stan\u00ad dards that promote feng shui principles\" in order to increase the \"positive energy\" available to die state's millions of resi\u00ad dents. The non-binding resolution was put forth in January of 2004 by Leland Yee, Assistant Speaker pro Tempore of die California State Assembly, and urged the state architect and cities across die state to adopt design standards consistent widi die Chinese principles of feng shui. As a press release put out by Yee's office explains, \"The structure of a build\u00ad ing can affect a person's mood, which can influence a person's behavior, which, in turn, can determine the success of a per\u00ad son's personal and professional relation\u00ad ships, and the aim of Feng Shui architec\u00ad ture is to study how die environment in which people live may affect their lives, and influence their quality of life.\" Feng shui, which translates as wind and water, is a collection of ancient Chinese traditions intended to improve a person's life through the carefully planned layout of buildings and die objects wiihin diem. Feng shui integrates several concepts of Asian mysticism, most essentially the flow of chi, or energy. Supposedly, chi can be manipulated, redirected, and even blocked by one's environment. According to feng shui tra\u00ad dition, positive chi is influenced by such things as natural lighting and materials, electronic equipment, and good airflow. Artificial lighting and materials, an \"unlucky\" or \"unbalanced\" building shape, clutter, and even keepsakes diat stir up bad memories can all produce negative chi. Feng shui contains plenty of common- sense techniques such as eliminating clutter to reduce stress and painting rooms in certain colors to encourage a good mood. But it is also rife with archaic superstitions, such as avoiding unlucky numbers, keeping toilet lids down to pre\u00ad vent chi from going down die drain, and placing mirrors at strategic points to deflect negative energy. Though the principles originated in China four to five thousand years ago, a simplified version of feng shui has become a worldwide fad in recent years, especially among businessmen looking to increase their success. Corporations are also buying into the feng shui craze: Merrill Lynch, Citibank, and Donald Trump have all utilized feng shui princi\u00ad ples for their properties. But this may have less to do with a desire for good chi dian with business savvy: some CEOs may view this as a strategy to win over Asian clients, for whom bad feng shui can be a deal-breaker. Despite California's reputation as somewhat New Age-y, the harshest criti\u00ad cism has come from within die Golden State. \"Frivolous bills such as these may cause a few chuckles, and even a mention by Jay Leno, but in reality they're no laughing matter,\" fumes a Modesto Bee opinion writer (February 18, 2004). \"Every bill introduced in die Legislature, no matter how mundane or silly, con\u00ad sumes staff time for research.\" Spokes- people for the California Building Standards Commission (CBSC) and the California Building Industry Association have also criticized die resolution, citing the shortage of affordable housing and the substantial numbers of rules and reg\u00ad ulations that already govern the construc\u00ad tion of new buildings. \"My gut feeling of it is diat in diese times widi the bud\u00ad get, cuts to resources, cutbacks, we're looking at the highest priority issues,\" said Stan Nishimura, executive director of the CBSC. \"I don't diink diis is our highest priority.\" \u2014John Gaeddert John Gaeddert is the Assistant Director of Communications for CSICOP.

While some Christians have praised its \"biblical authenticity\" and others have criticized its \"brutal vio\u00ad lence and portrayal of ancient Jews\" (Tokasz 2004), a major source for much of the movie has received comparatively little attention. Playbook Reportedly, Mel Gibson \"accidentally stumbled upon\" a book\u2014 The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, first published in 1833\u2014which \"planted a seed in his mind and finally played a large role in motivating him to make the film\" (Book 2004). In fact, Gibson (2004) termed the book \"great back\u00ad ground and foundation material.\" Unfortunately, the book consists of the \"visions\" of a German nun, Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774\u20141824). As a child she had an invisible \"guardian angel\"; experienced .ipp.iriuon.il encoun\u00ad ters with Jesus, Mary, and various saints; and displayed a special sensitivity to any\u00ad thing held sacred (\"Life\" 1904). In short, she exhibited many of the traits indica\u00ad tive of a \"fantasy-prone\" personality (Wilson and Barber 1983). That is not only the personality type of numerous religious visionaries, but also of countless spiritualist mediums, alien abductees, and other fantasizers. They typically believe they have special powers, often Joe Nickell, CSICOP Senior Research fellow, is author, co-autftor, or editor of numerous investigative hooks, including Inquest on the Shroud of Turin and Looking for a Miracle. 1,-1 including the ability to communicate [fje with higher entities\u2014a sort of adult ver- ,ii, sion of a child's imaginary playmate. ans A mystic, Emmerich may also have ty\" been a pious fraud. She made a show 'io- of being Christlike, even sleeping on Yg\" planks placed on the ground in the ich shape of a cross, and from the age of e|y about twenty-four claiming to receive the pain of Jesus' crown of thorns. Soon, blood was flowing down her face. After she was accepted into an Jly Augustinian convent, she supposedly ous received \"a mark like a cross upon her irst bosom\" and still later exhibited a full | a array of stigmata (i.e., the wounds of 1 a Christ's crucifixion), the She was subjected to a three-week ;on medical examination in 1819, but \"this ck- examination appears to have produced no particular effects in any way\" (\"Life\" of 1833). Neither science nor the Catholic lne Church has ever authenticated a single ,s a instance of stigmata. Indeed, many stig- ian matics have been proven fraudulent in_ (Nickell 2000; 2004). Still later Emmerich claimed to prac- [jy. rice inedia. That is the alleged ability to >rt, forgo nourishment by suspending all eat- ca- ing and, sometimes, drinking (Nickell |ity 1993, 225-229). Emmerich supposedly lot subsisted only on wine, and eventually )us \"only pure water\" (\"Life\" 1833). She was ess never properly investigated, but some iCS> inedics who were were exposed as frauds. J|y Visions ten ^ Anne Catherine Emmerich's purported rch visions\u2014which provide far more elabo- of rate and intimate details of Jesus's final ing hours than do the gospels\u2014are also sus- nd pect. According to Catholic writer Ian Wilson (1988, 76): In these we follow the elaborate preparations and ceremonial for the Last Supper. Wc are accorded flowing descriptions of the judgment hall of Caiaphas and the palace of Pilate. Not a blow seems to be omitted from Jesus's savage scourging by six drunken and blood-thirsty sadists. We arc told of housewife Veronica wiping Jesus's face with her veil. We learn how special holes had to be dug for me three crosses. And we grieve with the holy women as they wash Jesus's lifeless body and lavish it with unguents in preparation for his burial. Wilson continues: But it is precisely this welter of detail that gives rise to most disquiet. Just how satisfied can we be that her account of the Last Supper is authen\u00ad tic? Should we really believe her asser\u00ad tion that the Last Supper chalice once belonged to Abraham? Does her description of Caiaphas's mansion accord with modern excavations of the city's first century priestly dwellings? Is it not a little suspicious that the Veronica story as she describes it owes nothing to any orig\u00ad inal gospel and everything to medieval legend? Docs her assertion that Adam was buried at Golgotha owe more to symbol-seeking tradition than accurate reportage? How sure can wc be that Jesus's body was washed and anointed before burial? The gospels do not specifically say so, and according to some, when a Jew died a bloody death the religious requirement was that he should not be washed in order that his life's blood should be buried with him- Interestingly, Emmerich (1904, 137-138) envisioned Jesus' mother, Mary, and others wiping up the \"sacred blood\" from Jesus' flagellation, presum\u00ad ably to this imagined dote\u2014repeated in Mel Gibson's The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June J004 11 Passion of the Christ\u2014the linen towels were provided by the wife of the Roman prefect, Pilate. Gibson even goes further: whereas Emmerich only claimed to see Pilate's wife \"send\" the cloths, Gibson has her deliver them in person. Ian Wilson concludes: One could go into detail on the way Catharine [sic] was anachronistic or just plain wrong on point after point. . . . But perhaps more telling is the absence in her visions of any con\u00ad vincing \"period\" feel, and the inclu\u00ad sion of many stories, like that of Veronica, difficult to accept as any\u00ad thing other than apocrypha. Emmerich's handling of Veronica's tale is instructive. Representing one of the Stations of the Cross in Catholic rit\u00ad ual, the medieval story derives from ear\u00ad lier legends (dating back to the fourth century) concerning certain miraculous self-portraits of Jesus. Over the cen\u00ad turies, one type of these came to be known as \"Veronica's Veil.\" According to a pious legend, Veronica was a Jerusalem woman who took pity on Jesus as he struggled with his cross on the way to Golgotha. In some versions of the tale, she gave her kerchief or veil to Jesus so he could wipe the blood and sweat from his face, and\u2014in return for her generosity\u2014he miraculously im\u00ad printed the cloth with his holy visage. There were numerous such portrait veils, known, not surprisingly, as \"Veronicas.\" However, the term is believed to be a corruption of vera iconica, that is, \"true image,\" the corruption prob\u00ad Veronica tale. (Although the \"Veronicas\" were suppos\u00ad edly miraculously bestowed, they were actually painted. To explain how there could be many of the \"original,\" another story was invented which told how die holy image could supernaturally duplicate itself [Nickell 1993, 19-22].) Anne Cadierine Emmerich, who was steeped in Catholic traditions, knew diat Veronica was a made-up name, deriving from \"vera icon\" [sic], but she claimed it was used to \"commemorate\" die woman's brave act. Emmerich somehow divined diat Veronica's real name was Seraphia, and she added other unlikely details. Anti-semitism? Gratuitous Violence? Much of what critics have objected to in The Passion\u2014namely the portrayals of Pilate and the Jewish high priest, Caiaphas, as well as what many have viewed as anti-Semitism and gratuitous violence\u2014appears to derive largely from Emmerich. The movie's depiction of Pilate as vacillating and as eventually succumb\u00ad ing to Caiaphas's desire that Jesus be crucified (Tokasz 2004), seems to come straight out of Emmerich. She refers to \"The undecided, weak conduct of Pilate\" who was \"That most weak and undecided of all judges.\" In contrast, Caiaphas, she says, \"even went so far as to endeavor to exclude from the Council all those members who were in die slightest degree favorable to Jesus.\" According to her, Caiaphas made no effort to conceal his hatred of Jesus (Emmerich 1904, 108, 132, 147). Although at times Emmerich simply speaks of Jesus' \"malicious and cruel ene\u00ad mies\" (122), at other times, whether intentionally or not, she appears to malign an entire people. She refers to \"the wicked Jews,\" \"the hard hearted Jews,\" \"the cruel Jews\" (101, 106, 115), and other disparagements\u2014reflected in Gibson's The Passion in the sinister countenances and actions of Caiaphas's followers. Regarding the film's extreme vio\u00ad lence, while acknowledging that The Passion offers a \"meticulous evocation of its time and setting,\" Entertainment Weekly added (Jensen 2004): It's also, apparently, the Most Violent Story Ever Told. The scourging of Christ\u2014for some. The Passion's most gruesome sequence\u2014sounds like a textbook lesson in torture, with Gibson's camera doting on the instru\u00ad ments used and the flesh-rendering damage they can inflict. And the textbook that obviously pro\u00ad vided the lesson is, again, Emmerich's The to Emmerich's visions (134): . .. [T]hey then dragged his arms to such a height that his feet, which were tightly bound to the base of the pillar, scarcely touched the ground. Thus was the Holy of Holies violently stretched, without a particle ol cloth\u00ad ing, on a pillar used for the punish\u00ad ment of the greatest criminals: and then did two furious ruffians who were thirsting for his blood begin in the most barbarous manner to scourge his sacred body from head to foot. The whips of scourges which they first made use of appeared to me to be made of a species of flexible white wood, but perhaps they were composed of the sinews of the ox, or of strips of leather. She further envisioned: Our loving Lord, the Son of God, true God and true Man, writhed as a worm under the blows of these bar\u00ad barians; his mild but deep groans might be heard from afar; they resounded through the air, as a kind of touching accompaniment to the hissing of the instruments of torture. These groans resembled rather a cry 12 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER of prayer and supplication, than moans of anguish. ... The Jewish mob was gathered together at some distance from the pillar at which the dreadful punish\u00ad ment was taking place. ... I saw groups of infamous, bold-looking young men, who were for the most part busying themselves near the watch-house in preparing fresh scourges, while others went to seek branches of thorns. And so on, in this extreme detailing of violence. The scope of Emmerich's The Dolorous Passion is essentially that chosen by Gibson for The Passion. Although an article in Christianity Today magazine noted tiiat Gibson did not follow Emmerich slavishly, it did concede the debt, acknowledging, \"Many of the details needed to fill out the Gospel accounts he drew from her book\" (Neff 2004). A \"Catholic\" Film? And that is the point many seem to have missed. Con- J servative Catholic com- J mentator Cal Thomas 5 (2004) stated that the 8 Veronica incident was the \u00b0 only \"doctrinely Catholic\" element he could see in The Passion, thus ignoring the heavy reliance on a Catholic \"visionary\" for much of the film's content. The emphasis on Mary is another strongly Catholic element. The film does stop short of making Mary a major object of veneration (creating what some refer to as \"Marianity\" [Craveri 1967, 32] or, especially when expressed before statues and other images, as \"Mariolatry\" [Ashton 1991]). Yet Gibson, who has been struck by the positive evangelical response to The Passion, admits that is all the more amazing since \"the film is so Marian\" (quoted in Neff 2004, 35). The focus should not be surprising since Mel Gibson is a devout Catholic. Moreover, the film's Jesus, Jim Caviezel, insisted each day's filming begin with the celebration of Mass (Neff 2004, 30). The result is a film that offers neither an historical nor a fundamentalist view. Of course, historically, apart from later Christian sources, there is virtually no evidence for Jesus' crucifixion\u2014or even his very existence. There are merely a few texts that many critics hold to be \"too uncertain or too late to provide any support for the Gospel story, with the only substantial piece of it [allegedly by the Jewish historian Josephus] easily dis\u00ad creditable as a total Christian forgery\" (Doherty 2001, 47; see also Price 2003). As to the accounts of the Passion in the gospels, they are not only very brief, but scholarly analysis demonstrates that they ate also untrustworthy. For exam\u00ad ple, as Jesus seminar scholar Robert Price (2003, 321) observes, \"The cruci\u00ad fixion account of Mark, the basis for all the others, is simply a tacit rewrite of Psalm 22, with a few other texts thrown in.\" Jesus' exclamation\u2014\"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\"\u2014 comes verbatim from Psalm 22; also from that Psalm are the piercing of the hands and the feet, the casting of lots for he garments, and other story motifs. Small wonder that a filmmaker would look elsewhere for details to fill in an oth\u00ad erwise sketchy oudine. But Mel Gibson's heavy reliance on a dubious \"visionary\" is unfortunate, producing not a praisewor\u00adthy cinematic account of a story essential to Christianity but merely another tech\u00ad nically impressive yet pseudohistorical Hollywood shockumentary.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 13 SPECIAL REPORT Belgium Skeptics Commit Mass Suicide LUC BONNEUX Last year, the major health insur\u00ad ance companies in Belgium de\u00ad cided to cover part of the costs of homeopathy. \"Covering\" is a bit strong: only 20 percent of the costs are reim\u00ad bursed. The Belgian companies never theless offer a quality label to quackery and an encouragement premium to con\u00ad vince the uninformed public that home\u00ad opathy has medicinal properties. The poor patient remains in the dark about the real properties of homeopathy, a magic as powerful as the miracle at Cana, where Jesus Christ changed water into wine. In homeopathy, alcohol and water are beaten into powerful drugs. When SKEPP, the (Flemish) Belgian skeptical organization, attacked the health insurance companies for wasting people's money to promote quackery, we got the traditional response: \"People like it.\" Insurance payers love to be deceived, so let's deceive diem. SKEPP suggested reimbursing red Bordeaux wine, as peo\u00ad ple love red wine, too. We were not jok\u00ad ing: there is a trillion times more evi\u00ad dence that red wine (taken in modera\u00ad tion) is good for your health. \"Traditional doctors do not perform evi- Luc Bonneux has been associate professor in public health at the Utrecht Medical Centrum (the Netherlands). A medical doctor and scientist, financially supported by the people, he says he has a duty to pro\u00ad tect the public from quacks and frauds. However, he joined the Belgian skeptics (SKEPP) for esthetic reasons. \"In our short journey through Deep Time, understand\u00ad ing makes the trip more beautiful and more enjoyable.\" dence-based medicine.\" The CEOs of the insurance companies did not explain to SKEPP how quackery would improve the quality of medical practice. It cannot be the idea to add, to the dangerous quacks abusing modern medicine, the somewhat less dangerous quacks selling water and silliness, or is it? And of course, the final argument was that \"Hom\u00ad eopathy is cheap!\" It may cost Belgium $18 million per year, or some $1.80 for every Belgian, for something that does not work. Is $ 1,000 cheap for a car that cannot, and never will, operate? The Belgian health insutance companies deliver astonishing insights in economy. The Belgian skeptics were exhausted and overwhelmed by such well-crafted arguments. Seeing the errors of the skep\u00ad tic's ways, they resigned themselves to committing mass suicide by drinking a lethal dose of terribly toxic and danger\u00ad ous drugs: snake poison, Belladonna milk, petrol, and cockroach. Dog's milk does not sound that dangerous, but try milk\u00ad ing a pit bull. To assure immediate death, these powerful drugs were immensely dynamized: the daring skep\u00ad tics selected the over-die-counter 30C homeopathic solutions (reimbursed by the health insurance, if prescribed by a certified quack). A dynamization of 30C means the poison is diluted 10** times. That is a one followed by sixty zeros. The whole earth (estimated at 10\" molecules) is way too small to hold a single molecule in diat dilution. That is, in homeopathic terms, an awfully powerful dilution. The immensely \"dynamized\" spirits of arsenic and snake poison (not to mention the pit bull milk) will rise from the liquid, and kill the skeptic on the spot. All important newspapers and TV stations were recruited to witness the terrible extermi\u00ad nation of these dangerous minds. It would he a great loss to Belgian academia, a terrible blow to all these narrow-minded people that do not understand the miracles of homeopathy. Among the twenty-three suicidais were a hoard of professors from medical and other faculties, a rightly famous publi\u00ad cist and television program maker, and even a few normal people armed with nothing but common sense. The guy who spawned the idea of the skeptical suicide was Joeri Mesens, indeed an ordinary young man. Once a true believer he became an apostate of homeopathic salvation after conducting self-designed, skeptical experiments on his poor children. Several times he with\u00ad held life-saving homeopathic wonder drugs from one of his two sick children, observing that both of them recovered in exactly the same amount of time. The idea of suicide came to him after an argument with his mother, a true believer in homeopathy. She was horri\u00ad fied when he proposed to drink all of her drugs at once. The idea was taken over by Tom Schoepen, editor-in-chief of the SKEPP's magazine Wonder en is Gheen Wonder (Miracles Ain't Miracles). The son of a once famous Belgian country and west\u00ad ern singer, his looks are better than Johnny Depp's. He effortlessly raises highly undiluted hormone levels in fel\u00ad low human beings blessed widi a second X chromosome, and bewitches our 14 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (female) minister of Public Health. Alas, they fall for his looks, but they resist his arguments. They know someone who has been cured by homeopathy, and even more, they know several people who know someone who has been cured by homeopathy, which is obviously an unbeatable argument to subsidize quack\u00ad ery (some jokes about the average Belgian intelligence seem true). As a matter of course, Schoepen and Mesens were joined by the Fidel Castro of the Belgian anti- quackery rebels, the Scourge of Homeopathy, professor in Medical General Practice Wim Betz. Betz treated the press and the public to a talk on homeopathy and on the products selected for the skeptical sui\u00ad cide. Betz did not need a Castro diatribe of eight hours; a solid twenty minutes was enough to butcher homeopathy: the homeopaths were so kind to deliver their own satirical texts. To be sure the suicidals knew all the risks, Betz cited copiously from Kent's Materia Medico, which covers sixteen pages on arsenic, twenty-four on Belladonna, and twelve on snake poison. We learned among other things that arsenic \"patients\" suf\u00ad fer more at the seacoast, are restless, drink with small sips, and have a ten\u00addency to develop wrinkles. If you feel that your organs arc escaping tJirough your vagina, or if you bark like a dog, you are more of a Belladonna patient. However, if you lose gas from your vagina and dream of snakes, dog milk is your poison. Finally the time had come. The skep\u00ad tics on death row solemnly queued to personally select their own toxin: \"In Flanders fields the skeppies glow, to take their poison, row on row.' In front of the assembled national press they filled their chalices and drained their drinks, fully expecting to meet their Maker (if He existed). The skep\u00ad tics didn't succeed in their suicide attempt, however. All of them sur\u00ad vived. Those who had come by car had to wait before returning home, a bit dizzy from the alcohol on their empty stomachs. Indeed, homeopathy in alco\u00ad hol at the liberal dose of a bottle a day might decrease your cardiovascular risk (but a good Bordeaux is still a lot cheaper and infinitely better). The attempt was amazingly well cov\u00ad ered by all the national press media. CANVAS, the equivalent of BBC 2, re- broadcast James Randi's homeopathy documentary, where a carefully con\u00adtrolled experiment showed that Randi's $1 million was safe: there was not a shred of evidence that homeopathy dif\u00ad fered from the pure solvent. It shows that a few drips of acidic humor in a good idea are more efficient than long serious articles. Not so many people know that homeopathy attributes its presumed effects to ridiculously large dilutions (delusions?). Most of us, including Prof. Betz, who once followed a serious course of home\u00ad opadiy, have \"believed.\" Being progressive and social, we were critical about die modern drug industry and embraced \"ecological\" and \"natural\" alternatives. But diere is nothing social or progressive about deluding people. Permitting your\u00ad self to be deceived by a silly theory that was outdated and untenable even in the nineteenth century does not show an open or tolerant mind. It only shows you are gullible and an easy prey to smooth talking quacks. We hope some more peo\u00ad ple discovered this, thanks to our (unsuc\u00ad cessful) suicide Acknowledgments Luc Bonneux Vander- masscn and Paul de Belder for assistance and ^|' SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 15 RESEARCH REVIEW I Am Freud's Brain MARYANNE GARRY AND ELIZABETH F. LOFTUS Long ago, Freud theorized that we could banish our upsetting expe\u00ad riences out of conscious aware\u00ad ness, burying them away in an emo\u00ad tional Superfund site. Of course, like all toxic waste dumps, the buried material would still leach its poison into our everyday lives. The job of the therapist, then, is to take charge of the cleanup effort; help us unearth our dangerous memories and begin to deal with them. Freud was never quite clear whether this mechanism should be called repression or suppression, and he was also never quite clear whether the process happened automatically or effortfully. But no mat\u00ad ter what we call it\u2014let's call it repression for now\u2014Freud never really explained how repression might happen. Recently, University of Oregon psychology pro\u00ad fessor Michael Anderson and his col\u00ad leagues announced that they've figured it out. What they've done, according to various media reports, is show how the brain represses information. Maryanne Garry is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut, and her research area is human memory Address: Victoria Uni\u00ad versity of Wellington, School of Psychology, Te Kura Maatai Hinengaro, Box 600, Wellington New page: www. vuw. ac. nzlpsyclstafflmary anne-garrylindex.aspx. What did Anderson and colleagues do? To answer this question, consider Anderson's earlier study that set the stage for his recent one. The earlier study was published in 2001, by Anderson and Collin Green, in the prestigious journal Nature (Anderson and Green 2001). They asked people to take part in a three- stage experiment. In the first stage, sub\u00ad jects learned forty word pairs (such as ordeal roach), so that when given the first word as a cue (such as ordeal), they could report the second \"target\" odier word {roach). In the second stage, subjects sat at a computer screen while a cue from each pair (ordeal) appeared on die screen. When each cue appeared, subjects were given either a remember instruction\u2014to think about the target word (roach)\u2014or a suppression instruction, to not think about die target word. In the third stage, every\u00ad one took a memory test. During the test, subjects were given all the first word cues, and their task was to recall each target. For example, when given the word ordeal Elizabeth Loftus is Distinguished Professor of Psychology & Social Behavior and of Criminology, Law & Society at the University of California\u2014Irvine. She is past president of the American Psycho\u00ad logical Society and author of twenty books and more than 375 scientific articles. She received her Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University, and her major interest is human memory. E-mail: elofius@uci.edu. Web page www.seweb.uci . edulfacultyllofiusl. their task was to recall roach. The central question was whether subjects would be less likely to remem\u00ad ber word pairs that they were asked to suppress compared with a baseline mea\u00ad sure: memory for word pairs that were not presented at phase two. Anderson and Green found that being asked to remember the word improved memory for it, and that sometimes being asked to suppress the word impaired memory for it. They concluded that their results \"support a suppression mechanism that pushes unwanted memories out of awareness, as posited by Freud\" (Ander\u00ad son and Green 2001, 368). The new research by Anderson repeats the basic experiment, but with a twist. This time, subjects were scanned with an fMRI during the second stage, to measure brain activity while they tried to either think about or to suppress the target words. At the test, memory for each target word was tested twice, once with the original cue word (ordeal) and once with a new word that was related to the target word (insect). As with their earlier work, this time Anderson et al. found that, relative to baseline (a condition where no presenta\u00ad tions of the pair occurred during the sec\u00ad ond stage), die \"remember\" instruction produced more remembering. The sup\u00ad pression instruction sometimes pro\u00ad duced more forgetting. This overall pattern was true regardless of whether memory was tested with the original cue 16 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (ordeal) or with the new related word (insect). In addition, subjects showed a different pattern of brain activity when they were instructed to think about words versus suppress them, and more activity in the frontal cortex when they were successful at the suppression task. What do these findings mean for die notion of repression? Anderson and col\u00ad leagues have one answer. In the opening sentence of their recent paper, published in the journal Science, they claim that their behavioral findings demonstrate a psychological mechanism for \"die vol\u00ad untary form of repression (suppression) proposed by Freud\" (Anderson et al. 2004, 232). By the closing paragraphs, Anderson et al. claim that they have demonstrated a neurobiological mecha\u00ad nism for repressing traumatic experi\u00ad ences. To the media, the authors seem unabashedly enthusiastic about the Freudian implications of their results. In a press release (EurekaAlert! 2004) coauthor John Gabrieli, of Stanford, said, \"It gets you past the possibility dial there's nothing in die brain that would suppress a memory\u2014that it was all a misunderstood fiction.\" Lead author Michael Anderson went a step further. \"This suggests a neurological basis for how people can actually shove some\u00ad thing out of mind,\" he told the New York Times (Anahad 2004). \"There's no question that we're tapping into some\u00ad thing that's relevant to the experiences of people who survive trauma and find the memories become less and less intrusive over time.\" For other interpre\u00ad tations, you might turn to die media. But they, too, seem to have embraced this research. The brain \"can be trained to forget\" trumpeted die BBCnews Web site (BBC 2004). Anderson et al.'s work, gushed CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, might even help us understand how soldier Jessica Lynch could have repressed memories of her traumatic experiences (CNN 2004). Many in the psychological commu\u00ad nity, however, have drawn decidedly dif\u00ad ferent conclusions. Why? Let us first consider the results of Anderson et al.'s memory test. The suppression instruc\u00ad tion caused memory to be about 10 per\u00ad cent less accurate\u2014if we average across both the original and new cue tests. The worst memories were when subjects were asked to suppress the target sixteen times and then tested with a new cue, but even then, they still remembered about 80 percent of die target words, compared to about 87 percent baseline performance. That's a far cry from mas\u00ad sive repression. In fact, it is a far enough cry from repression that a team of prominent scientists at Washington University, St. Louis has been unable to replicate the basic finding. That is, while Anderson and colleagues have now twice found that the suppression instruction causes poorer memory per\u00ad formance, John Bulevich, Henry Roediger, and David Balota have twice failed to find any such effect (Bulevich, Roeidger, and Balota 2003). That is not to say there is no suppression effect, but it does mean that it might be rather frag\u00ad ile. Fragile suppression, of course, sounds like it has little resemblance to robust repression. Still, let us assume that the suppres\u00ad sion effect exists. If so. Harvard profes\u00ad sor Daniel Schacter (Schacter 2001) and University of California-Berkeley pro\u00ad fessor John Kihlstrom (Kihlstrom 2002) have both given us a second reason why some scientists have not embraced Anderson et al.'s new claims. In writing about Anderson's 2001 study, Schacter pointed out a problem that applies to the new Anderson paper as well: both papers tell us about memories for mun\u00ad dane words. How well then, Schacter wondered, do those findings help us to understand repression? After all, one of the hallmarks of Freudian notions of repression is that we push distressing, threatening, personal information out of awareness, not mundane irrelevancies. Now let us consider the neuroimag- ing results, which showed that subjects had different brain activities when they tried to remember words dian when diey tried to suppress diem. There are at least three reasons why these results are unsurprising. First, consider what peo\u00ad ple do if diey are trying not to remember something. As neuropsychologist Larry Squire told the New York Times, \"It's possible [that when subjects are trying to suppress, they] are simply directing dieir attention elsewhere and using a lot of energy and brain resources to think of something different. I don't think it is necessarily an indication of active repression\" (O'Connor 2004). Perhaps, then, we should not be surprised that asking people to do different tilings causes activity in different brain regions. Second, Anderson et al. found that when subjects were asked to remember words, they showed more activity in their hippocampus. But after all, they did remember more words in diat con\u00ad dition, and the hippocampus is linked to remembering. Third, Anderson et al. need to compare brain activity for gen\u00ad uinely suppressed words\u2014words that subjects could not recall on eidier mem\u00ad ory test\u2014and unsuccessfully suppressed words (that is, words that they thought of even though they had tried to sup\u00ad press them). Anderson et al. did not report these crucial data. Some researchers have questioned the basic idea behind fMRI research itself. William Uttal, author of The New Phrenology (Uttal 2001), argues that cognitive constructs such as thoughts and thought processes are too unpre\u00ad dictable to pin down to a specific area of the brain. If, as Uttal points out, there is little consensus about what constitutes many mental processes, then why should there be consensus about what pans of the brain are in charge of those mental processes? Surely the study of repression constitutes such an area of lit\u00ad tle consensus. After all, the basic argu\u00ad ment in repression is not how it happens but if it happens. And it is worth bear\u00ad ing in mind Uttal's warning that fMRI results are worryingly dependent on what lab they come from, and dial brain activity caused by what is supposed to be the same cognitive construct can vary by an entire brain quadrant or more. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 17 Still, these researchers are convinced that they are onto something bigger. \"There's no question that we're tapping into something that's relevant to the experiences of people who survive trauma and find the memories become less and less intrusive over time,\" Michael Anderson told die New York Times (O'Connor 2004). Interestingly, however, earlier research suggests that trauma survivors are no better than any\u00ad body else at ejecting unpleasant memo\u00ad ries. In 1998, Richard McNally and col\u00ad leagues used a method similar to Anderson's, but they looked specifically at the effect of trauma history on the ability to forget positive, neutral, and trauma-related information (McNally et al. 1998). Three groups of women par\u00ad ticipated in their study. In the PTSD group were women who were sexually abused in childhood, and who met the criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In the trauma-exposed group were women with similar histories who did not have PTSD. In the control group were healthy women with no history of sexual abuse. The women saw a list of positive, neutral, and trauma-related words. Each word appeared for two sec\u00ad onds, then it disappeared; half the time, the women were then instructed to remember the word they just saw, while the other half they were instructed to forget it. All the groups remembered more words when they were asked to remem\u00ad ber them compared with when they were asked to forget them. The PTSD group remembered just as many trauma words as the other two groups, but fewer positive and neutral words. More inter\u00adesting is what happened when the women were instructed to forget the words. We might predict that women with PTSD would be especially good at forgetting trauma-related words, but not show any particular tendency toward forgetting other words. Interestingly, however, all three groups performed similarly: they remembered more \"remember\" words than \"forget\" words, and there was nothing unusual about the PTSD group. Put another way, women with PTSD weren't particularly skilled in banishing traumatic words out of their awareness. In 2001, McNally, Clancy, and Schacter did a similar study on a group of women who claimed to have recov\u00ad ered memories of child sexual abuse (CSA); another group of women who suspected they had repressed CSA mem\u00ad ories but had not yet recovered them; and a control group. Regardless of the emotional valence of the words, all groups remembered \"remember\" words better than \"forget\" words. In other words, women who claimed to have a history of forgetting unpleasant infor\u00ad mation did not show any special talent for doing so in this study. So when Anderson et al.'s subjects suppressed their words\u2014where did they go? Drawing parallels between their research and Freud's ideas, John Gabrieli mused that buried memories can still wreak havoc. \"It's lurking in them some\u00ad where, and it has consequences even though they don't know why in terms of their attitudes and relationships\" (EurekaAlert! 2004). Do these missing words still lurk in the subjects of Anderson et al.? We do not know. What we do know is that Anderson's study is not about memory for trauma. In that sense, it has nothing at all do with repres\u00ad sion. Their subjects were not chosen because of a traumatic history; they were not suffering from PTSD, and the words they were asked to remember could hardly be construed as traumatic events. In fact, the closest they come to a trau\u00ad matic event is pairing the word ordeal with roach. References Anderson. Michael C and Collin Green. 2001.

Some have undergone makeovers, trans\u00ad forming themselves from ordinary psy\u00ad chics to psychic sleuths and beyond\u2014 communicants with the Great Beyond, in fact. One such purveyor is Phil Jordan, whose flagging career has been given new impetus by popular TV mediums (i.e., those who purport to communicate with the dead). Jordan has climbed aboard that spiritualist band\u00ad wagon. 1 donned a disguise to get close to him and check out his alleged powers. Ascendant Stars Among the superstar psychics is John Edward. Born John MaGee Jr., he began his career as a card reader at psychic fairs. However, when he learned that names and other \"validating informa\u00ad tion\" sometimes applied not to the liv\u00ad ing but the dead, he changed his billing from \"psychic\" to \"psychic medium.\" His appearances on Larry King Live\u2014 which has become a prime venue for spiritualistic hucksters\u2014helped him launch his own television show. Crossing Over. Revealingly, on Dateline NBC a program with which I assisted, Edward Joe Nickell is a former private detective and author of numerous investigative books including Crime Science and Psychic Sleuths. was actually caught attempting to pass ofF previously gained knowledge as spirit revelation (Nickell 2001a). Edward was to forego the psychic- sleuth route, but not so the Montel Williams show's resident clairvoyant, Sylvia Browne. (Born Sylvia Celeste Shoemaker in 1936, she acquired the name Brown\u2014to which she added an e for effect\u2014from the third of her four husbands.) Since childhood she has claimed to have an invisible companion, and she reports seeing apparitions, talk\u00ad ing to ghosts, having clairvoyant visions, making psychic medical diagnoses, divining past lives (including fifty-four of her own), and possessing other pow\u00ad ers (Browne and May 1998). Such an array of traits is indicative of what psy\u00ad chologists term a \"fantasy-prone\" per\u00ad sonality (Wilson and Barber 1983). Browne purports to be a \"psychic detective.\" and she has also gotten on the talking-with-the-dead bandwagon, appearing frequently as a medium on Larry King Live. Her offerings are fre\u00ad quently wide of die mark, but callers and a helpful Larry King help her transform frequent failures into successes. For instance, one woman, who had asked about her dead husband, learned that Browne saw \"something about a clot.\" The caller agreed, saying, \"Yes, he had a so ire brain hemorrhage at the very last minute,\" although, in fact, a hemorrhage is the opposite of a clot (Farha 2003). Although Browne committed to undergo a scientific test of her alleged powers by famed paranormal investigator James Randi, she subsequently reneged. On Larry King Live she had agreed to take Randi's \"million-dollar challenge\" in no uncertain terms: \"Are you willing to take his test,\" King queried the claimed clairvoyant, and she replied. \"Yeah, what\u00ad ever test it is.\" However, her later excuses prompted Randi to write her. saying: \"Of course, if you arc afraid of taking the test, or you are aware that you cannot pass a simple double-blind test of your claims, you may wish to further obfuscate the matter by producing more excuses and problems.\" Browne's response was to refuse receipt of Randi's certified letter (Farha 2003). Among many other psychics who have discovered they too can talk to the dead are James Van Praagh (who has been overshadowed by the fast-talking John Edward) and Rosemary Altea. Both have also enjoyed some media suc\u00ad cess, including appearances on Larry King Live and other venues. (I debated both on radio programs in 1998 [Nickell 1998].) Still another is George Anderson, whose now-waning career was also once boosted by Larry King (Anderson 2004). Lesser Light Enter Phil Jordan, psychic sleuth cum spiritualist. He was, he says, \"raised on dreams,\" and from about the age of six experienced clairvoyant visions. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 19 Prompted in part by \"severe unemploy\u00ad ment,\" he decided to offer \"psychic con\u00ad sultations\" to the public. Two years later, he launched his reputation as a psychic detective by supposedly locating a miss\u00ad ing five-year-old boy. Although Jordan claims to have been helpful in other cases, it is this one that receives the most attention in his autobiography, / Knew This Day Would Come: A Personal Journey to Psychic Awareness (Jordan 1999, 58-64). The case\u2014the rescue of Tommy Kennedy in Tioga County, New York\u2014 began on August 3, 1975. Young Kennedy had wandered away from his family at Empire Lake, and some searchers feared he might have fallen into the water and drowned. Using psy- chometry (or object-reading, an alleged type of ESP) Jordan supposedly received impressions from the boy's discovered T- shirt. Jordan announced, \"He's alive,\" and, producing a sketch, said, \"that's where they will find him.\" Subsequently, Jordan led searchers into the woods where \"they found the exhausted five-year-old, under a tree in the exact location sketched by the psy\u00ad chic the night before\" (Randies and Hough 2001). Unfortunately, the story has become \"mythologized,\" according to Kenneth L. Feder and Michael Alan Park, who investigated the Kennedy case for my book Psychic Sleuths (Nickell 1994). They demonstrated how facts have been exaggerated and the story subjected to various embellishments. For example, the psychic's own accounts (Jordan 1977, 1999) fail to mention the T-shirt, a detail given in Arthur Lyons and Marcello Truzzi's The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime (1991, 74), citing Fate magazine and the tabloid National Enquirer. It is repeated by Jenny Randies and Peter Hough in their cred\u00ad ulous Psychic Detectives (2001, 86-88), which, astonishingly, ascribes the Kennedy case to 1982! Moreover, Jordan's map was vague and contained erroneous details. It was appar- endy of little use in the search, during which Jordan supposedly received vibra\u00ad tions telling him \"to go here, to go diere\" (Feder and Park 1994). Jordan had, by his own admission, chosen an area of the woods that \"no one had searched\" (although Randies and Hough [2001] report odierwise). \"Just as I was ready to give up, he says, \"I looked down and saw the footprint of a young barefoot human headed up the trail.\" Even with such good luck, Jordan happened to be elsewhere\u2014 in a ravine\u2014when other searchers in the party actually located the lost child. They had heard him \"yelling for help\" (Jordan 1999, 58-63). Figure 1. Phil Jordan, alleged clairvoyant and medium, at the bar of his Seneca Falls, N.Y., hotel where he gives spiritualist readings. (Photo by \"Johnny Adams,\" a.k.a. Joe Nickell) A 1989 television re-creation further exaggerated the story, leading Feder and Park (1994) to conclude, \"It is curious indeed that this case, with all of its con\u00ad tradictions and odd coincidences, is con\u00ad sidered an example compelling enough to be singled out in a television docu\u00ad mentary more than a decade after the fact.\" And, of course, it has also been fea\u00ad tured in mystery-mongering books such as that by Randies and Hough (2001). Revealingly, the powers of Jordan and his ilk were illuminated by something of a national test case, when Washington, D.Ci intern Chandra Levy went missing for many months. Thousands of self- proclaimed psychics offered \"clues\"\u2014 Sylvia Browne, for example, visualized \"some trees down in a marshy area\"\u2014 but their offerings were of no use what\u00ad soever. After Levy's remains were acci\u00ad dentally discovered in late May 2002, some of the failed psychics attempted to match their vague speculations with the known facts (Radford 2002). This is a technique called \"retrofitting\" and is a mainstay of alleged psychic detectives (Nickell 2001b, 125-126). Makeover In 2001 Phil Jordan's fame as a psychic seemed in decline. However, in that year he purchased The Gould Hotel in Seneca Falls, New York, and began offering \"Psychic Dinner Floorshows\" twice a week. Also on Saturdays he scheduled \"The Spirit Connection,\" which his promotional literature describes as \"a show similar to The John Edwards [sic] Show on TV\" (\"Phil Jordan\" 2003). Jordan, who was made an honorary sheriff's deputy for his efforts in the Tommy Kennedy case, is also a licensed funeral director and ordained minister of a non-denominational Christian church. Potentially, he could help police find a missing body, secure the crime scene, supply a coffin, preach at the funeral, and give periodic updates from the person in the spirit realm! To assess Jordan's spiritualistic ability, I decided to sign up for one of his shows. Since I had featured him at chap\u00ad ter length in a book (Nickell 1994), I decided it was best to adopt a pseudo\u00ad nym and to disguise my appearance. As \"Johnny Adams,\" a somewhat homely old yokel with nerdy hornrims, I attended Jordan's ses\u00ad sion on August 9, 2003, with some four dozen other hopefuls. Arriving early, I soon found my small table, its name- plate lettered with a red felt marker, \"ADAMS 1.\" Sitting on a stool, Jordan tried to provide readings for nearly every sitter. Some of his first readings seemed to leave die targeted individual puzzled, prompting that blank look\u2014albeit sometimes with a nodding head\u2014that seemed to say, \"I'm trying to make a connection.\" His was a standard \"cold- reading\" technique (in which the reader 20 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER artfully fishes for information and tosses out vague statements he hopes the sitter will interpret and validate). His most accurate reading seemed to occur when he told a woman about \"John\"\u2014described as having worn a hel\u00ad met of some kind\u2014who had passed over. The lady was baffled, but another woman several feet behind her claimed the reading as her own, and supplied some information that allowed Jordan to offer further statements she seemed willing to accept. After a fifteen-minute break, Jordan resumed, answering a few questions and continuing with the readings. Then, looking at me, he said he really had to come to \"this gentleman\" next. He stated he saw a woman, possibly my mother, who had swollen legs before her passing. 1 regarded that as a miss. He also mentioned a man who had \"raised hogs.\" That could describe my grandfather Nickell (who was a farmer as well as a member of the Kentucky state legislature), except that he was any\u00ad thing but the plain-spoken, matter- of-fact type the medium described. Jordan also claimed to tune in on a man who worked for a railroad, but that was utterly meaningless to me. I have also been unable to relate to someone named \"Charlie\" whom Jordan foresaw having a positive influence on my life in the near future\u2014how near was not specified. One might have thought that\u2014if he really had clairvoyant abilities\u2014Jordan would have done better. He could have mentioned my mother's Alzheimer's, or at least foreseen the life-transforming news that arrived shortly after my read\u00ad ing: die discovery of a daughter (along with two grandsons) I had not known about! (Not to pick on Jordan alone, this profound fact also went unmen- tioned for thirty-six years by countless palmists, card readers, astrologers, clair\u00ad voyants, and mediums. It makes you wonder: where are their powers when you really need them?) And with me so near, shouldn't Jordan at least have gotten the name \"Nickell\"? Couldn't he have announced, \"I see an impostor,\" or have sensed tremendously negative vibrations com\u00ad ing from my direction? After die reading, Jordan inscribed a copy of his self-published book to me, addressing me as \"Johnny,\" and happily posed for a photograph (figure 1). He seemed, well, totally clueless.

Usually I focus on a particular aspect of the scientific methods, sometimes discussing a single experiment, to try to learn something about how science works. Occasionally, however, it pays to step back and take a broad look at the entire forest, rather than concentrating on individual trees. In the following, therefore, I will pro\u00ad vide a very short history of the major ideas in philosophy of science, which the reader can use as a handy reference and a key to read future and past columns on the subject. The first philosopher to attempt to ground what today we call science in a rigorous methodology was Aristotle (384\u2014322 B.c), who emphasized deduc\u00ad tion, i.e., the process by which one reaches a conclusion beginning with some speci\u00ad fied premises (which are assumed to be true). Deduction is at the basis of logic, but it turns out to be of much more lim\u00ad ited use in science, because\u2014while an excellent way of working out die implica\u00ad tions of a set of premises\u2014it does not lead Massimo Pigliucci is a professor in the Department of Ecology & Evolution at SUNY-Stony Brook and author of Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scien- tism and the Nature of Science. His essays can be found at wunv. rationally speaking.org. by itself to the discovery of new facts about the physical world. We have to wait until the seven\u00ad teenth century for Francis Bacon (1561\u20141626) to propose induction as die core of the scientific method. For Bacon, we are able to make generaliza\u00ad tions about the world building on a steadily expanding knowledge base from which we extrapolate and make predic\u00ad tions. The problem with induction is that\u2014unlike deduction\u2014it cannot yield certain knowledge, but something more akin to an educated guess based on past experience (see this column, May/June 2003 and March/April 2004). During the twentieth century things moved pretty quickly, with several major contributions to our understanding of how science works being published over the span of a few decades. Karl Popper (1902-1994) thought that science makes progress not through the confir\u00ad mation of theories, but by way of their falsification. Because there is always the possibility that more than one theory can account for the available facts. Popper reckoned that a theory can never be shown to be true, however, if the facts contradict the predictions of a theory, surely it must be discarded, which is how science then makes progress. Imre Lakatos (1922-1974), one of Popper's students, sificationism wouldn't do, because scien\u00ad tists in fact don't throw away a theory at the first sign of difficulty. This is reason\u00ad able, since there may be other explana\u00ad tions for why a given prediction failed, including possible problems with the conditions of an experiment, with the analysis of the data, or even with rela\u00ad tively minor aspects of the theory, which could be improved and tested again. Lakatos then proposed that science works by a succession of \"research pro\u00ad grams,\" which can be viable and lead to new discoveries, or \"degenerate.\" A degenerate program is eventually 22 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER abandoned because there is a widespread sense rJiat it is no longer fruitful. A more radical view of research pro\u00ad grams was famously advocated by Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996), who saw science as an alternation of two modes of operation: during \"normal\" times, scien\u00ad tists work widiin a generally accepted framework (a paradigm) to solve specific Paul Feyerabend (1924-1994), who thought that there really wasn't any such thing as the scientific mediod, and that all approaches to truth should be given equal access to funding and public resources\u2014the market of ideas would then establish the best ways to go. As appealing as Lhis view can be in some circles, it led Feyerabend to seriously The problem with induction is that\u2014 unlike deduction\u2014it cannot yield certain knowledge, but something more akin to an educated guess. problems, or puzzles. From rime to rime, however, the dominant paradigm is no longer sufficient, and an increasing num\u00ad ber of puzzles go unresolved. This cat\u00ad alyzes a situation of crisis, which is resolved only when a new general frame\u00ad work is proposed chat allows science to resume its normal activity: a paradigm shift has then occurred. Even more radical than Kuhn was contend that astrology, for example, should be studied regardless of what astronomers say about the illusory nature of constellations. More recently, several philosophers of science have proposed a way of think\u00ad ing about science rooted in the mathe\u00ad matics of the Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), and therefore termed \"Bayesianism.\" According to the Bay-esian view, scientists consider several possible hypotheses simultaneously, and continuously confront them with the available data. After each round of data- theory match-up, they re-evaluate the likelihoods of each theory being correct, given the facts. No theory ever reaches a likelihood of one (certainty), in agree\u00ad ment with Popper; but no theory can truly be entirely discarded either (a like\u00ad lihood of zero), following Lakatos. However, the likelihood of a theory can be orders of magnitude higher than any of its competitors, which means that the theory in question is accepted tor all effective purposes as true. Until the next round, that is. Even die Bayesian scenario, as intu\u00ad itively appealing as it is to the practicing scientist, is far from providing a prob\u00ad lem-free explanation of how science works, and the discussion among philosophers to understand how scien\u00ad tists do it will likely continue for quite some time.

James Moseley, franchiser and organizer of the past thirty-four conferences, has visibly slowed down since the last time I saw him. We reminisced how at the 1980 NUFOC in New York City, he had treated the speakers to a splendid dinner at the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World Trade Center. \"We won't be doing that again,\" he remarked, mak\u00ad ing it clear that he didn't mean just for the obvious reason. In spite of a very favorable location, the preregistration for this year's conference was smaller than the state's average grade-school class size. Once a celebrated party ani\u00ad mal, Moseley excused himself to the assembled tipplers and turned in early. The UFO business isn't what it used to be\u2014only about eighty people turned out for a world-class conference in the heart of Los Angeles. From a distance, die skeptic might assume that big money is being made fleecing the gullible with books, conferences, maga- Robert Sheaffer's World Wide Web page for UFOs and other skeptical subjects is at www.debunker.com. zines, and videos. The truth is, apart from the occasional blockbuster like Whitley Strieber's Communion, these days UFO promoters count themselves lucky if they can break even. UFO Magazine is struggling to resume publi\u00ad cation, organizations are shrinking, and book sales are extremely slow. The one bright spot, selling UFO videos, is mod- esdy profitable for only few dealers, assuming that they don't spend much in travel and shipping costs. But don't con\u00ad clude from the above that levels of UFO belief are dropping. UFO belief is prob\u00ad ably as high as ever, but with the growth of die Internet and die sensationalized pseudo-documentaries on cable TV channels, it's just gotten harder to squeeze money from the believers. UFO enthusiasts can get the titillation they are craving without having to pay much, if anything, to get it. One recent UFO conference that did show somewhat better attendance was die First Annual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference held in Henderson, Nevada, this past November. The conference attracted about 200 attendees, meaning that its organizers probably broke even. Perhaps the most dramatic piece of evi\u00ad dence, as recounted by Moseley, was Art Campbell's description of a tiny shoe he says he found on the Plains of San Augustin in New Mexico, a location that reportedly had its own UFO crash. Because this shoe is so small and narrow that it could not fit even a child\u2014at least not any child of this earth\u2014the implication is that the shoe must have been worn by an extraterrestrial. The noted UFOIogist Budd Hopkins stepped outside his usual role as a pro\u00ad moter of UFO-abduction claims to regale the Crash Retrieval Conference with the story of a supposed UFO crash that occurred in 1963 north of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Perhaps this is a sign that UFO-abduction mania is fading and crash-retrieval claims may be taking its place. Hopkins's presentation featured \"two videotaped, firsthand interviews of hospital and ambulance workers diat responded to a call from state police. Upon arrival, there were three small alien bodies and an extrater\u00ad restrial craft. The bodies were X-rayed and examined, but soon after, the Air Force confiscated the evidence and told witnesses that 'this never happened' and not to tell anyone.\" Once again, intre\u00ad pid UFOIogists got \"this close\" to hav\u00ad ing their eagerly sought, smoking-gun evidence, only to have it snatched away by the Conspiracy. And what is it about New Mexico that seems to induce equipment failure in UFOs as they fly over? At least half a dozen saucers must have crashed in Roswell, if all the con\u00ad flicting crash-site accounts are to be believed. San Augustin, Aztec, and now Albuquerque\u2014the state is a veritable saucer graveyard. Probably the Reticulans know it as \"the New Mexico Triangle,\" where their craft seem to 24 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER vanish without a trace. In Arizona, some shops sell as a novelty item a Flying Saucer Pilot's License, valid in that state. If such a license is sold in New Mexico, it should be scrupulously avoided, as it seems that every attempt to fly a UFO across New Mexico results in a new crash-retrieval site. But one alleged UFO crash that's currendy getting a lot of attention took place a long way from there, in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. According to witnesses, just before 5 P.M. on the clear winter afternoon of December 9, 1965, a \"fireball\" that \"seemed to be under some type of intelligent control\" appeared to crash in the woods near Kecksburg (sec http://ufocascbook.com/ Kecksburg.html). State police respon\u00ad ded to reports of an object crashing, but didn't find anything. But according to some accounts, the military cordoned off die area, and hauled off an acorn- shaped metal object to some unknown destination. The Sci Fi Channel premiered a sen\u00ad sationalist pseudo-documentary on October 24, 2003, tided \"The New Roswell: Kecksburg Exposed.\" As one might imagine, it leaned heavily toward the claims that a saucer crashed and was covered up by the military, giving short shrift to any skeptical explanations. The only problem with the so-called \"Kecksburg Crash\" is that the object was identified long ago, was reported to have crashed in many different places, and is known to have actually disintegrated above Ontario. What the UFO believers are calling the Kecksburg Crash is known to astronomers as \"the Great Lakes Fireball of December 9, 1965\" Indeed, it is one of the best-studied fire\u00ad balls in history, because of the clear skies and mild weather that permitted large numbers of people to sec it. It has been written up in leading astronomy jour\u00ad nals, including Sky and Telescope and the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (for the details see my Web page on the case at www.debunkcr.com/ Kecksburg.html). Indeed, so much information was available on this bril\u00ad liant meteor that astronomers were able to determine that before it encountered Earth, it was in an eccentric orbit with a period of approximately 2.43 years, tak\u00ad ing it from past the orbit of Mars at its farthest point from the Sun to just inside Earth's orbit, where the rock met its doom. Even before any UFO claims began to surface about it, the Great Lakes Fireball was cited as illustrating the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. Prof. G. W. Wetherill, a professor of geophysics and geology at UCLA who investigated the incident, was quoted in Sky and Telescope (February, 1966): \"The fireball was observed by many people in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and to a lesser extent in neighboring states. In newspaper accounts, a great many supposed impact sites were reported, both in southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Frag\u00ad ments were claimed to have fallen in Ohio and Michigan. These imagined happenings arose from the impossibility of estimating the distance of an object in the sky. Almost everyone who saw the fireball thought it was much closer than it really was. When it disappeared behind a house or a tree many people thought it had fallen only a few hundred yards beyond.\" Nor is any of this information partic\u00ad ularly new. Astronomer Robert Young debunked the Kecksburg Crash claims when they first appeared on the TV show Unsolved Mysteries \\n 1990, which got extremely high ratings. (See \"Old- solved Mysteries: The Kecksburg Incident,\" SI, Spring 1991). Young's paper was revised and reprinted in the book The UFO Invasion (Frazier, Karr, and Nickel, eds. Prometheus Books, 1997). It has been carefully ignored by UFO proponents. The Sci Fi Channel has clearly done an extremely good job of leading the public astray. A poll on its Web site revealed diat 67 percent of those taking the poll believed that the object at Kecksburg was an \"alien craft\" versus only 27 percent who chose one of sev\u00ad eral prosaic explanations. But the next time you hear someone routing Kecksburg as \"the new Roswell,\" at least you'll know that this new crash claim is just as bogus as the old Roswell. But before you go off feeling too skeptical, ponder this: the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence has just got\u00ad ten five times more likely, at least according to leading British bookmak\u00ad ers. They recently cut the odds diat the Prime Minister will acknowledge the existence of ETI by the end of 2004 from 500:1 to 100:1 (see www.william hillmedia.com/index_template.asp?file= 2782). No word on what prompted the re-evaluation, but perhaps they've been watching the Sci Fi Channel. Perhaps the most exciting recent development in woo-woo land was the announcement by George Noory, host of the late-night talk show Coast to Coast AM, that he would be participating in an experiment in time travel with the \"physicist and hypnotherapist, Irving Glotch.\" Glotch's device is said to per\u00ad form \"dimensional\" rather than \"physi\u00ad cal\" travel. \"eye \"special tones,\" and a to transport the fearless trav\u00ad eler backward (but not forward) in time. (See www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/ 2003/12/17.html#glotch.) Glotch re\u00ad minds his listeners not to confuse his time-travel device with his \"teleporta- tion\" device, which works on different principles. \"I teleported a small plant and a mouse from point A to point B. But cannot disclose anything else at this time on this subject.\" Appropriately, timc-onztii Noory will be wearing \"an aluminum suit, although Glotch insists that this is not \"necessary,\" but merely \"helpful\" in con\u00ad taining \"the force field.\" Glotch, who says he has been working on his time- travel device for twenty-four years, explains, \"The field of universal life is an uncharted force. George Lucas was correct in his Star Wars movies about the force.\" Noory says that the time periods he is most interested in exploring are Roswell, New Mexico in July, 1947, and the mid sixdi century, to see if an aster\u00ad oid impact caused the Dark Ages. Asked if Noory will be safe traveling so many centuries from home, Glotch replied I believe he will,\" which seems to leave open the possibility that Noory might get stuck back in the Dark Ages, where such nonsense belongs. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 25 NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO Satan in a Sicilian Fridge The next World Skeptics Congress will be held October 8-10, 2004. in Italy (see www.cicap.org/congress). For this reason, I am devoting four columns to popular Italian mysteries. The previous ones were on a very special liquejying blood and a case of scientific fraud related to the Shroud of Turin. Should you come to the Congress, you could take advantage of your trip to visit these famous enigmas. Last February 11, the Reuters news agency distributed an extraordinary news item titled \"Sicilian town battles 'demonic' blazes.\" The article began, \"A Sicilian town is struggling to work out why dozens of household items from fridge-freezers to furniture keep mysteriously bursting into flame, terrifying locals and sparking theories of demonic activity.\" Since mid-January, in fact, dozens of electrical goods and pieces of furniture have been reported to \"spontaneously go up in flames,\" causing a great deal of damage in Canneto di Caronia, a small town perched on the Mediterranean island's rocky coast. \"I've seen unplugged electrical cables burst into flames with my own eyes, but I just can't explain it,\" said a local police- Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, author, lecturer, and co-founder and head of CICAP, the Italian skeptics group. His Web site is www. massimopolidoro. com. man who did not want to be named. \"I've never seen anything like it.\" Some fires have spread to engulf houses, and police decided to temporar\u00ad ily evacuate some forty residents. \"There has been a sense of panic, and people have been evacuated from their homes,\" said Salvatore Mezzopane, who works at the town hall. \"We're trying to find the cause of the fires, but there are no answers yet.\" Italian utility Enel tried cutting power to the town after die first reports but the fires continued. Tullio Martella, the regional civil defense chief, stated on tele\u00ad vision: \"What is happening in this area is an unexplainable phenomenon, certainly an anomaly. I can say for sure that there arc no previous cases like this one.\" The experts were no closer to explaining the phenomenon; theories ranged from arson to a freak power surge or even poltergeists or demonic activity. \"I've seen things like this before,\" Catholic exorcist Gabriele Amorth told Italian newspapers. \"Demons occupy a house and appear in electrical goods.... Let's not forget that Satan and his fol\u00ad lowers have immense powers.\" This is when we were drawn into die story. We Have Come to Film the Devil Focus, the top-selling, popular science magazine, asked me if I could investi\u00ad gate die case and men report for them. So on Friday die 13th, I went off to Sicily along with Roberto Spampinato, a photographer from the magazine. What we found on our arrival was that the only hotel in Canneto was filled widi journal\u00ad ists from all over the world: CNN, BBC, Associated Press, and everyone else was (or had been) there. A crew from Denmark told us that they had come to \"film the devil.\" Not surprisingly, they later left a bit disappointed. The locals were quite fed up with all this media mania. They kept saying that diey don't believe in ghosts and even less in demonic activity. When an exorcist announced his intention to visit the town, he was openly invited to stay home. But this is not what some journalists wanted. They need sensationalism, and we witnessed a few examples of manipu\u00ad lation, such as when a reporter from a local TV station insisted that a lady who had been evacuated\u2014who though upset was very quiet\u2014should instead scream and curse on camera in order to make die interview \"more effective.\" She did not agree and die reporter lost his temper. We were then allowed by die firemen to enter die evacuated area and look around under their surveillance. We immediately noticed that, in contrast to what die newspapers said, this was not a \"town\" diat had caught fire, but a few houses on a private road (an area of 350 meters), where the inhabitants are all related to each other. Damage ranged from blackened electrical cables to burned pieces of furniture. All the fires 26 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER started from cables burning, and there had never been electrical appliances behaving strangely by themselves. There was not much else to see diere. We were told diat die phenomena had stopped when die area was evacuated, and die only single episode after diat was a very suspicious blackening of a young man's shoe sole, right after entering his own house alone to recover somediing. \"At the moment, there is nodiing rel\u00ad evant to report,\" says Giuseppe Maschio, professor of chemistry and head of die various experts gathered here. \"The Ministry of Telecommunications mea\u00ad sured electromagnetic fields; I nil, Telecom, and Railways technicians tried to find possible electrical leakages. Nothing out of the normal was found.\" So what could cause tJiese phenom\u00ad ena? \"The hypothesis on which we are working now is diat of a technical acci\u00ad dent, but we still don't know the cause,\" says Maschio. Others are less caurious. \"I sent a few vulcanologists,\" says Enzo Boschi, Presi\u00ad of the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, \"to make technical measurements on possible magmatic movements down deep in the earth, but we found no indication of possible volcanic or seismic activity. If this was really a natural phenomenon, it wouldn't be restricted to such a small area. I personally find all diis very odd and do not exclude the possibility of fraud. If you think about it, nothing extraordinary has happened since the area has been evacuated.\" However, fraud was the only possi\u00ad bility that die local chief of the Carabinieri was ready to leave out. Mystery Solved? After a few days, newspapers announced triumphantly that the mystery \"had been solved.\" The explanation, said Tullio Martella, lies in an unusual the\u00ad ory formulated by Professor Giovanni Gregori from the National Research Centre. The theory has to do with geo- thermal energy coming from under\u00ad ground and reaching Earth's surface in spikes. According to Martella and Gregori, die litdc town of Canneto is on top of one of diese spikes, and diis is what has caused all die phenomena. If this explanation satisfied at least some newspapers and the Governor of Sicily, other prominent physicists, such as Professor Tullio Regge from Turin's Polytechnic and Professor still needed confir\u00ad mation and lacked details, diey wrote in a press release from CICAP, die Italian skeptics group. A few hours later, die National Department of Civil Defense stated diat \"it still is not possible to endorse one dieory or anodier.\" Massimo Polidoro and an expert from the civil defense examine a few burned cables. Photo: Roberto Spampinato. We were ready to leave beautiful Sicily widi no satisfactory answer when we received an e-mail message from a telephone company technician who was called right after die first few fires. The man, Sergio Conte, told us that he was sent on location by his company, Telecom, because some thought that die problem was in their lines. He did all his testing but found diat all was normal and there were no power leakages or surges. \"The most common reason for an electrical cable to catch fire,\" says Conte, \"is because it transmits too much electricity, like in a prolonged short cir\u00ad cuit or when lightning strikes an electri\u00ad cal line. In bodi cases, diere is overheat\u00ading: the cable gets red hot and die insu- lant around it catches fire and burns anything close to it.\" The situation was quite strange in Canneto, since all cases of overheating took place on exposed cables and not on diose running inside walls. Conte sliced up some burned cables and nodced something else of interest: \"Overheated copper is easy to spot because it becomes very dark and is quite fragile; however, here die copper inside the cables was perfectly spotless and all looked normal. This meant rhar the electrical explana\u00ad tion would not do, the heat was not coming from the inside of the cables but from die outside.\" Another interesting fact was that all cables running more than three meters high, out of easy reach, had not been burned. \"Also, it was clear from the type of burns that the heating was com\u00ad ing from a heat source placed below each cable. While I was conducting my controls, nothing strange happened, and so I can't say what had really burned those cables.\" However, since there were \"experts\" around him who kept on saying diat this was an unexplainable phenomenon, Conte tried a little experiment. \"I turned my back and with a small lighter I had in my pocket, I burned up the outside of a piece of cable I was holding. When I showed it around, it was promptly found to be identical to the mysterious ones. . . .\" Whether something fishy had been going on in Canneto\u2014and for what rea\u00ad sons\u2014is up to die police to determine. A formal inquiry has now been started. However, what many outside of Italy were led to think, as one Scottish corre\u00ad spondent put it, was that \"one of Europe's richest and most industrialized nations is once again hitting headlines around the world as a country where superstition and fear of the paranormal remain pan of modern culture.\" For this embarrassing result, we have to thank some journalists eager to spice up dieir news either by altering what die locals really said (none of them considered paranormal explanations) or by inter\u00ad viewing publicity-seeking exorcists and self-anointed experts. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 27 Darkness, Tunnels, and Light Stories of darkness, tunnels, and bright light told by those who report near-death experiences actually have a basis in the structure and functioning of the eyes, the brain, and other sense organs that operate during these experiences. G.M. WOERLEE Darkness, tunnels, and light are wondrous phenom\u00ad ena sometimes reported by the dying, as well as those recovering from near-death experiences (NDEs). These experiences have been reported since antiq\u00ad uity. Along with many others, I first learned of these experi\u00ad ences from a film I saw in 1990 called Flatliners. The film showed amazing and improbable medical apparati used in an equally improbable and dramatic location. Even so, I was stimulated to read more, and became fascinated by the pos\u00ad sible physiology of all aspects of NDEs. I am a physician specializing in anesthesiology, and have worked as a consultant anesthesiologist in Holland since 1980. An anesthesiologist is not someone who just knocks 28 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER patients out, sits down, opens a newspaper, and waits for the sur\u00ad geon to finish his work; instead, he or she keeps patients alive and insensible to pain during operations, and ensures that patients survive their operations in the best possible condition. This work requires me to view all bodily and mental phenomena from a very basic physiological perspective. So in my practice, I ask myself, \"How can the functioning of the body generate this phe\u00ad nomenon? What is the mechanism? How does it work?\" My approach to the study of NDE phenomena is very similar, which is why this article is about the ways die functioning of the body can generate darkness, tunnel, and light experiences. Darkness, tunnel, and light experiences are part of the so- called \"core-NDE\" described by Kenneth Ring, an eminent NDE researcher in the 1970s and 1980s. He described the core-NDE as having the following components (Roberts and Owen 1988): feeling blissful sensations; leaving the body; entering a tunnel or darkness; perceiving a bright light; and entering the light. Wonderful, fantastical experiences ... but what is the mechanism? How can they be explained? Many people offer explanations ranging from the preposterous to those worthy of serious consideration. Among them: Real experiences of a spiritual or immaterial realm. The immaterial is unseen, unheard, and unable to be sensed or measured empirically; it is unprovable. A dream arising from the collective unconscious. The great psychoanalyst Carl Jung proposed this idea. Indeed, inculca\u00ad tion of cultural identities and myths certainly occurs during the upbringing of each person. But the invocation of these aspects of each person's unconscious to explain tunnel, dark\u00ad ness, and light experiences is to use an explanation that is just as unprovable as is any immaterial or spiritual explanation. Recollection of the birth experience; an explanation pro\u00ad posed by the late Girl Sagan. This is a curious and dubious explanation. After all, babies' eyes are shut during birth, their brains and vision are undeveloped, and there is no way to know what a baby experiences. Furthermore, why should people undergo a repeated birth experience while dying? The effects of drugs and medicines. Most people undergoing these experiences arc not under the effects of any drugs or medicines. Carbon dioxide intoxication or oxygen starvation. Many people undergoing these experiences are not suffering from carbon dioxide overload or oxygen starvation. A flood of endorphins (morphine-like substances in the brain), released by the dying brain. This is a compelling idea, but an inadequate explanation, and at best very difficult to prove.

In 1989, Tom Troscianko and Susan Blackmore reasoned that there were more nerve cells within the visual cortex representing the central parts of the retina than there were representing its peripheral parts. A computer simulation of increasing neural noise in the visual cortex induced by drugs or disease revealed a blob of white light gradually increasing in size, which, when viewed on a screen, gave viewers the sensation of moving down a tunnel toward a bright light and finally being enveloped by the light (Blackmore 1991). An elegant idea, but it neglects basic facts, such as die relative oxygen consumptions of retina and brain, as well as the fact that people can \"see the light\" while at the same time seeing things around them. These facts render the neural-noise the\u00ad ory an inadequate explanation of tunnel and light experi\u00ad ences, except perhaps for situations where rhere is epileptic nerve activiry within the visual cortex. What is another explanation for these experiences? After all, they are real experiences. People who have undergone them are neither mad nor hysterical, and diey really have undergone darkness, tunnel, and light experiences. But how? I began my study with the light experience, distilling its properties from the stories I heard and the many reports I read. These proper\u00ad ties are: people see bright light; the light does not hurt the eyes; this light is seen not only during NDEs undergone by apparently unconscious people, but also reported by the con\u00ad scious dying; and no one else can see this bright light. The Lovely Brightness' Any successful physiological theory about the light experience must be able to explain these properties. After my medical stud\u00ad ies, I left Australia to specialize in anesthesiology in England. While there, I worked in the now defunct Hackney General Hospital, as well as the equally defunct Mothers' Hospital. This latter was an obstetrics hospital in the impoverished district of Clapton in London's East End. Because I'd practiced there, a report related by Sir William Barrett in the book Death-Bed Experiences attracted my attention (Barrett 1926). I knew the hospital, how the rooms appeared, and how they were lit, as well as the nature of the women who came there to have their babies delivered. In Barrett's report, a dying woman first saw only darkness, and subsequently saw a \"lovely brightness,\" as well as \"bright forms.\" The obstetrician reported her observa\u00ad tions. At one point she wrote: \"But then she turned to her hus\u00ad band, who had come in, and said, 'You won't let the baby go to anyone who won't love him, will you?' Then she gently pushed him to one side, saying, 'Let me see die lovely brightness.'\" A matron was also present, and reported: \"Her husband was leaning over her and speaking to her, when pushing him aside she said, 'Oh, don't hide it; it's so beautiful.'\" These two sentences reveal that this woman saw the \"lovely brightness\" because her medical condition caused her pupils to widen. The woman was dying of heart failure, and lethal heart failure causes oxygen starvation; severe oxygen starvation causes the pupils to widen. Furthermore, sympathetic nervous system activity is maximal during lethal hean failure, and this also causes the pupils to widen. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lune 2004 29 No one else in the room saw the bright and wonderful light, and nowhere does this report mention that the lighting in the room was increased. The size of the pupils of the other people in the room did not change because the level of illumi\u00ad nation in the room did not change, so they did not see the bright light. This woman pushed her husband aside because he did indeed block the light. So she saw bright light because her pupils widened, admitting more light into her eyes. Light enters the eyes through the pupils, and the diameter of the human pupil varies from 1 millimeter to as much as 10 mil\u00ad limeters. A small calculation reveals the magnitude of the effect of pupil widening: the area of the pupil through which light is admitted into the eye is a circle, and pupil area = 71 (pupil radius)2. This means that the amount of light entering each eye can increase by as much as 100 times. Pupil widening is indeed a likely reason she saw a \"lovely brightness.\" Another sentence in this same report also caught my eye: \"She lived for another hour, and appeared to have retained to the last the double consciousness of the bright forms she saw, and also of those tending her at the bedside. . . .\" Fascinating\u2014and also very revealing. As an amateur pho\u00ad tographer, I realized this was also an effect of pupil widening. Pupil widening reduces the depth of field. A person whose pupils are widely dilated not only sees bright light, but only clearly sees people upon whom the eyes are focused, while all other people are seen as bright and blurry forms. So this unfor\u00ad tunate woman interpreted the bright and blurry images of out- of-focus people elsewhere in the room as \"bright forms.\" The optical effects of pupil widening were very likely the cause of the \"bright light\" and \"bright forms\" seen by this woman. However, to her and her family, as well as to all observers, the experiences and observations she reported while dying were not just mental and optical manifestations of a mundane biological event. Instead, they were an intense and wondrous confirmation of deeply held socio-cultural beliefs in a life after death. This story beautifully illustrates how pupil widening due to a multitude of causes can arouse visions of \"bright light\" and \"figures of light.\" Oxygen Deprivation At the same time as I read this account, I was also studying the effects of oxygen poisoning and oxygen starvation, and learned that both tunnel and darkness experiences could be caused by oxygen starvation. Oxygen is an essential ingredient in complex chemical reactions within all cells of the body, generating vital, energy-rich chemicals. Oxygen starvation can occur when there is: too little oxygen in the air; abnormal lung function; abnor\u00ad mal heart function; too little blood; anemia; abnormal red blood cell function; obstructed or severed blood vessels; abnormal cell function; or any combination of one or more of these factors. Oxygen starvation causes failure of all the organs and tissues of the body, and the eyes and brain are most sensitive to its effects, failing before any other organs. Furthermore, the retina has a higher oxygen consumption than the brain, which is why oxygen starvation causes the functioning of the retina to fail before significantly affecting the functioning of the brain. Oxygen starvation does not cause all parts of the brain to fail at the same time. The brain stem, which generates 30 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER consciousness, is the part of the brain most resistant to oxygen starvation. Therefore, oxygen starvation will cause vision to fail before causing a loss of consciousness. And indeed, the experience of fainting proves this. Fainting is due to a sudden, fortunately temporary, failure of blood flow to the head, resulting in oxygen starvation of the brain and loss of con\u00ad sciousness. Just before losing consciousness, many people notice that everything suddenly \"went gray,\" \"went dark,\" or \"went black.\" Perception of grayness or darkness is a conscious experience, so tJiese people are actually saying diat their vision failed before they lost consciousness. Some people also report tunnel vision just before losing consciousness. Oxygen starvation can cause both tunnel and darkness experiences. The reason for this lies in the structure and functioning of the blood sup\u00ad ply of the retina. The macula is the optical center of the retina; it has the greatest blood supply, while die flow of blood to the retina decreases with distance from the macula according to the inverse square law. Yet the oxygen consumption of each part of the retina is much die same, so oxygen starva\u00ad tion will cause failure of peripheral vision before causing total visual failure. Indeed, experiments with oxygen starvation in human volunteers prove this fact. This is why tunnel experiences occur only in NDEs caused by oxygen starvation, while toxins and poisons cause a \"pit experience\" before causing failure of vision. So oxygen starvation explains why not everyone has a tunnel experience during an NDE. Oxygen starvauon also explains why the tunnel experience is not a true component of the NDE, but is instead a manifestation of the cause of the NDE (Greyson 1983). Somatic Sensations Aha, say the critics, but during a \"tunnel experience\" people feel themselves moving, flying, or being drawn through a tun\u00ad nel toward a light or entering the light. So they say oxygen starvation cannot be the cause of tunnel and light experiences. Yet oxygen starvation explains these sensations very well. Furthermore, a close study of the way oxygen starvation affects conscious perception of sensations explains all these things without the necessity of invoking a human soul, paranormal sensations, or immaterial spirit worlds. The human brain is about one and a half kilos of jelly-like tissue contained within the protective confines of the hard bones of the skull. Mind is a product of brain function, and all sensations enter the brain as signals conducted into the brain along sensory nerves. The mind only knows what is happen\u00ad ing widiin the body, to the body, and in the world around the body by interpreting the sensory nerve signals conveying sense data into die brain. So if tliese sensory nerves transmit signals into the brain indicating that the body is moving, falling, or flying, the conscious mind perceives the body to be moving, falling, or flying. Furthermore, if the brain malfunctions, even normal sensory signals transmitted into the brain may be interpreted incorrectly. And die malfunctioning brain may even misinterpret normal sensory signals as sensations of movement, falling, or flying. Oxygen starvation is a common cause of brain malfunction, as well as die cause of the terminal loss of consciousness of more tlian nine in ten dying persons (Murray 1997). And oxygen starvauon causes malfunction of muscle spindles, the sense organs diat provide die brain with most of its information about body position and movement. Muscle spindles are special muscle structures sandwiched between die fibers of every muscle. There is about one muscle spindle per 1,000 ordinary muscle fibers. Muscle spindles are both sense organs and muscle fibers, sensing and transmitting to the brain sensations of weight, of movement, of falling, of floating, and of flying. Moreover, the tensing and relaxing of muscle spindles relative to the surrounding muscle fibers also generates similar sensations. Severe oxygen starvation causes convulsions. Muscle spin\u00ad dles sense these movements and transmit the sensations to the brain. Victims may also sense odiers attempting to aid diem. The brain malfunctions during oxygen starvation, causing muscle spindle tension to differ from die tension of die sur\u00ad rounding muscle fibers. Body parts where muscle spindles are relaxed relative to surrounding muscle fibers feel heavier than normal, while body parts where muscle spindles are tenser than the surrounding muscle fibers feel lighter than normal. Again, all these phenomena have been well established experimentally. During NDEs caused by oxygen starvation, a combination of brain malfunction, abnormal muscle spindle function, ran\u00ad dom movements due to convulsions caused by oxygen starva\u00ad tion, and movements of the oxygen-starved person's body made by people treating and helping the person all combine to generate sensations of movement. When this is combined with a total loss of vision, tunnel vision, or die effects of pupil widening, sensations of moving through darkness or a tunnel toward light can occur. Some people also say diey felt them\u00ad selves being \"drawn to die light.\" This is quite possibly a result of the initial restoration of central vision, followed by an increasing restoration of peripheral vision as oxygen supplies to the eyes increase. A person undergoing such an experience would first see a small spot of light at the end of a tunnel which would gradually increase in size to envelop die whole Oxygen starvation is a common cause of brain malfunction, and causes malfunction of muscle spindles, the sense organs that provide the brain with most of its information about body position and movement. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lune 2004 31 visual field. This would give die illusion of moving toward a light at die end of a tunnel, and even of entering the light as retinal function was restored. All these things make it possible to explain and understand the sequence of events during NDEs caused by oxygen starva\u00ad tion. Consider a report in Return From Death (1986), written by Margot Grey. Grey reported the story of a woman who nearly died in childbirth. This woman reported diat \"I was moving very rapidly down a long, dark tunnel. I seemed to be floating. I saw faces which came and went and who looked at me kindly, but did not communicate. I did not recognize them. As I got nearer to die end of the tunnel I seemed to be surrounded by a wonderful warm glowing light.\" The terminal loss of consciousness while dying during childbirth is always due to oxygen starvation caused by con\u00ad vulsions that can occur in late pregnancy (due to a toxic con\u00ad dition called \"pre-eclampsia\"), massive blood loss, heart fail\u00ad ure, amniotic fluid embolus, hyperventilation, etc. An expla\u00ad nation of die sequence of events related by this woman is that she lost consciousness and all memory of events. Her resusci\u00ad tation restored consciousness and her memory, but the oxygen supply to her retina was still insufficient to restore vision and normal sensory function. All this caused sensations of moving in a dark tunnel. Furdier restoration of the oxygen supply to her body restored central vision, which together with widened pupils caused her to sense movement toward a bright light at the end of a tunnel. Her recovery progressed, and retinal func\u00ad tion was fully restored, but not normal vision or brain func\u00ad tion\u2014so she felt herself moving out of the tunnel to be enveloped by the light. Finally, delivery rooms are kept warm so the newly born babies do not cool down after birth. This was die warmth she felt. Darkness, tunnel, and light experiences are wondrous, seemingly paranormal experiences. Nonetheless, it is evident that they can be explained by the body's responses to oxygen starvation. The combination of tunnel and light experiences can only be explained by oxygen starvation, and nothing else. Other associated experiences, such as darkness and out-of- body experiences, can also be generated by odier changes in body function induced by a wide range of different conditions. This explanation of tunnel-and-light experiences does not constitute conclusive proof that this is the only mechanism by which diese experiences can arise. After all, this explanation does not preclude paranormal or immaterial explanations. But it is an alternative, provable physical explanation that accounts for all aspects of these experiences, as well as making it possi\u00ad ble to predict when these experiences are likely to occur.

When college students don't learn about the complexities and social dimensions of scientific inquiry, they are vulnerable to the egalitarian appeal of postmodern relativism. Skeptics must confront this problem. PHIL MOLE Six years ago, while finishing my graduate public-health coursework at an Illinois university, I took a class that forged my interest in skepticism and critical thinking. The course, called \"Behavioral Sciences in Public Health,\" cer\u00ad tainly had anything but this purpose among its educational goals. This course was a local species of a relatively new genus\u2014the \"science and society class,\" examining the cultural and social contexts and implications of scientific discovery. Students frequendy encounter these courses in graduate school, usually as an interdisciplinary-studies class required by their department curriculum. While the specific content of these classes varies, a surprising number of them teach a highly radical view of science that exclusively focuses on its real and imagined deficiencies. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 33 Much of die time, these classes confuse rather than clarify issues pertaining to science and society. For example, the syl\u00ad labus for \"Behavioral Sciences and Public Health\" promised to help students \"become suffkiendy confused about the com\u00ad plexities of professional life,\" to teach them information needed to \"critically participate in public health-care practices\" and create a \"thick reading of one's social position.\" I am still not sure what the first and last objectives mean\u2014perhaps I was \"sufficiently confused.\" But I learned soon enough that the class was not interested in teaching students to critically par\u00ad ticipate in public-health care or in anything else requiring sci\u00ad entific literacy. The course was not a balanced, critically informed discussion of the merits and limitations of science. It was a lopsided diatribe against the arrogance of science and its suppression of other, allegedly valid \"ways of knowing.\" We read articles claiming the language, assumptions, and methodologies of science to be inherently sexist and imperialis\u00ad tic, and fundamentally opposed to die role of intuition and the expression of femininity. An article by Ruth Hubbard main\u00ad tained diat scientists construct fact claims in order to justify their own economic positions and prevent the social mobility of women and ethnic minorities (Hubbard 1990). We perused the writings of Sandra Harding and Luce Irigaray and read more testimony diat science represents the ideologies of white males seeking to disenfranchise, deflower, and discredit femi\u00ad ninity at every opportunity. These authors discussed \"alternate epistemologies,\" suppressed by chauvinist scientists, and con\u00ad sidered conventional science inherently inauthentic. Harding directly implicated the ethics and methodology of traditional science in \"wrong-headed environmental policies and rhe long- recognized alienation that people in industrialized societies feel from their culture, communities, and 'true selves'\" (Harding 1996). Other articles went even further, comparing profes- Phil Mole is a freelance writer who frequently writes about issues relating to science and philosophy.

I recently completed a second \"science and society\" course as part of a graduate educational-studies curriculum. This course, called \"Introduction to Research Purposes and Methodologies,\" proved remarkably similar to the earlier course. We learned repeatedly that science was seriously flawed and that scientific inquiry was only one of many possible methods of learning about the world. There was a similar emphasis on feminist alternatives to science and the same emphasis on \"patterns of male dominance\" inextricably woven into rhe methodology of science. A paper by Lee Harvey presented a new paradigm of social research, rejecting the traditional ethnographic goal of objective explanation. Lee alleged that the conventional approach reeks of cultural presumptions and moved to replace it with a methodology \"which attempts to link the detailed analysis of ethnography to wider social structures and systems of power relationships in order to get beneath the surface of oppressive struc\u00ad tural relationships\" (Harvey 1990). Many of rhe other papers, with varying intensity, renewed the charge that science is bigoted and exclusionary. To the authors of these articles, science is but a flickering shadow in Plato's cave and can claim no superiority to other methods of describing ultimate reality. If the light of scientific reason dispelled the rival shad\u00ad ows of intuition, old-world folk medicine, and anecdotal evi\u00ad dence, these authors preferred to praise the darkness. An Incomplete Education: What Science Classes Do Not Teach My initial exposure to the criticisms of science in \"Behavioral Sciences and Public Health\" stimulated me to learn why these critics were reaching such radical conclusions. To learn more about the source of their ideas, I had to train myself in philos\u00ad ophy of science and the rules of critical thinking. As a result, I can now see even more clearly than ever that the authors usu\u00ad ally included in \"science and society\" courses are deeply mis\u00ad taken in their claims that science is not superior to other sys\u00ad tems of inquiry. They are also mistaken in their judgment that science reflects only sexist and imperialist assumptions. But I can also clearly see that their radicalism is not possible without a deep ignorance of what science is and how it works. Unfortunately, science teachers and other supporters of science play a large part in propagating this scientific ignorance. Skeptics are often quick to disparage postmodern critics of sci\u00ad ence but slow to address rhe larger science-education problems that allow their message such a large measure of success. Both critics of science and the college students they seek to indoctrinate obtain their scientific knowledge from science classes in high school and college. Bodi groups leave these classes with an incomplete image of how science works, and The course was not a balanced, critically informed discussion of the merits and limitations of science. It was a lopsided diatribe against the arrogance of science and its suppression of other, allegedly valid \"ways of knowing. 34 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER this ignorance shapes their receptiveness to radical deconstruc- tions of science. Too often, science textbooks and professors present science as a codified body of theorems and facts, and ignore die messy history of arriving at our current knowledge. To a point, this strategy is understandable. There is only so much time in a semester, and teaching about all of die false starts, dead ends, and conceptual confusions in the history of science threatens to gobble up valuable class time. Yet we can\u00ad not properly understand how science works if we do not pay due justice to diis complexity and learn how and why scientists choose one scientific dieory instead of anodier. This com\u00ad prehension requires us to examine what rival theories coexisted with the theories that eventually gained accep\u00ad tance and the reasons these theories seemed attractive to scientists of that time. Why, for instance, do physicists no longer believe an invisible ether permeates all of reality? If the ether is simply a silly outlandish idea, why did so many brilliant scientists think the ether existed in the first place? When we examine specific episodes in scientific history, we see diat social and personal biases do not necessarily impede the search for objective truth. James Clerk Maxwell developed his laws of electro\u00ad magnetic radiation in the nineteenth century while retaining the common cultural belief in die existence of the ether. Maxwell even believed the existence of the edier was necessary for the propagation of electromagnetic waves. After all, the existence of a wave apparently implied the existence of a medium. Just as ocean waves require water to travel, electromagnetic waves also require a medium through which to be transmitted. Einstein later rendered die concept of the ether unnecessary with his dieory of relativity, but Maxwell's equations are no less valid. The truth of Maxwell's equations did not depend on the real\u00ad ity of die ether, because his theory contained much else diat is true and useful. Similarly, the existence of scientific bias docs not under\u00ad mine the validity of evolution. Charles Darwin was thinking of Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population when he conceived of the \"struggle for existence\" at die center of his theory of evolution by natural selection. He was working with a Victorian cultural bias toward individualism that predis\u00adposed him to stress competition for limited resources in his model of evolutionary change. This emphasis on selection allowed him to explain how new species could form through a series of modifications but did not emphasize the role of non\u00ad selective forces in evolution. Since Darwin's time, evolutionary researchers of different theoretical persuasions have correcdy demonstrated that much evolutionary change does not reflect adaptation due to direct competition between species. We cur\u00ad rently realize that selectively neutral mechanisms such as genetic drift play major roles in evolution, but we do not reject Darwin's The Origin of Species. Darwin's great book still contains the most cogent demonstrations of the reality of evolution and still provides the basic intellectual frame\u00ad work for modern discussions of evolution. These examples show mat scientific truth is not all or nothing and progress does not cease because scientists have cultural and ideological biases. We simply need scien\u00ad tists to differ in dieir particu\u00ad lar biases and a system of sci\u00ad entific inquiry open to new viewpoints and facts. This is not to say that diere have not been many egregious errors in the history of science and many times when sexists and racists used die veneer of sci\u00ad entific fact to bolster their dubious claims. Nevertheless, even socially biased scientists can and do make lasting con\u00ad tributions to scientific knowl\u00ad edge. The nineteendi-century scientist Paul Broca used comparative anatomical stud\u00ad ies to \"prove\" blacks were mentally inferior to whites, but he also made important discoveries in cognitive neuroscience. He completed important studies of aphasia\u2014an inability to use language resulting from a localized brain injury. We may rightly deplore his racism, but we cannot erase his accom\u00ad plishments. We also cannot ignore the fact diat odier scientists eventually exposed die flawed methodology of his comparative brain studies and debunked his racist conclusions. Competing biases among scientists are a major reason for the success of scientific inquiry. Credulity: The Consequence of an Incomplete Education What happens when students never learn about die historical development of science\u2014when diey never comprehend die SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 35 significance of the scientific method? They leave their science classes with a highly idealized, intellectually impoverished view of science that is highly vulnerable to attack. When they encounter modern cultural criticisms of science in \"science and society\" classes, they have no larger perspective to balance against these claims. They never learned that great scientists have often been fantastically wrong and never learned about the role of bias in developing scientific theories. As a result, any evidence that scientists do have bias, or that they some\u00ad times make mistakes, causes them to question the validity of the entire scientific enterprise. In Christopher Hitchens's memorable phrase, \"utopia becomes the subconscious enabler of cynicism.\" If students initially learned anything about the complex social history of science, they would have some intel\u00ad lectual armor against the ideologically charged claims of mod\u00ad ern science critics. Even worse, teachers of \"science and society\" classes are doing very little to broaden the perspectives of their students. Students study only the ideas of the far, radical left\u2014the \"mar\u00ad ginalized\" souls who scoff at criteria of judgment and decry the elitism of anyone claiming to have real knowledge about the empirical world. Instructors do not provide exposure to responsible scholarship about the social underpinnings of sci\u00ad ence or any works written from non-radical perspectives. The absence of a more balanced selection of readings is especially puzzling, given the abundance of quality material available in most good bookstores or in peer-reviewed journals. Yet neither of the \"science and society\" classes I took bothered with diese texts. Students did not have opportunities to read such fair- minded works as David Hulls Science as a Process, Helen Longino's The Fate of Knowledge, Michael Ruse's Mystery of Mysteries, or any number of important articles from history-of- science journals such as Isis and Osiris. Instead, students read the same tired bromides about the \"social construction\" of sci\u00ad entific knowledge and die oppression of \"die Other\"\u2014with the latter word usually capitalized lest we miss the message. Indeed, none of the readings in either class I took cited any respected science historians or philosophers or even acknowl\u00ad edged their existence. As currendy taught, \"science and society\" classes do not nurture the critical thinking abilities of students. They only nunure a deep suspicion toward all truth claims, particularly those claims perceived to clash with the political ideals of stu\u00ad dents. The corollary to this rejection of truth claims, paradox\u00ad ically, is the promiscuous acceptance of truth claims. If there are no valid criteria for accepting the truth of science, then vir\u00ad tually any idea about the empirical world is valid and there are no authoritative reasons to reject or accept any particular idea. There is only one idea students believe is objectively true, and that is the idea that all truth is relative. And in a climate of rel\u00ad ativity, they feel free to campaign for their own subjective visions of reality and accept those ideas that best accord with their intuitive sense of what the world ought to be like. They dismiss questions about what the world actually is like as hopelessly naive or symptoms of the dreaded disease of elitism. Much has been said about the influence of postmodernism on radical critics of sci\u00ad ence, but my own experience convinces me that we are simply seeing a modern variation of a long democratic tradition: mistrust of authority. Postmodernism, with its fancy jargon about social con\u00ad structivism and observer-mediated reali\u00ad ties, has simply reinvigorated the anti-elit\u00ad ism and ideological relativism always pre\u00ad sent in democratic societies. In a deep sense, postmodern relativism is simply a new language for reclaiming the emotional attachment to egalitarianism fostered by grammar and high-school history classes. Students taught a sanitized vision of modern society in which die tenet diat \"all men are created equal\" later bumps against the hard realities of inequality and the role scientists have played in strengthening those inequalities. The radical relativism of postmodernists touches just the right chord widi these jaded students. In a world where heroes have clay feet and justice is elusive, postmodernism pro\u00ad vides the solace of believing diat egalitarianism still dirives in the intellectual plane. If all men are not created equal, they can at least take comfort in the equality of ideas. Thus, most critics of science are acting from admirable motives. When they complain of the marginalizing effects of traditional science, they believe they are acting in the spirit of equality. They believe that science isolates and trivializes other groups to solidify its own status, and they want to res\u00ad cue these isolated voices from perceived oblivion. But they fail to realize a fatal flaw in their approach. By emphasizing only the flaws and biases of science, they present a skewed image that not only contradicts responsible scholarship but also erodes both public understanding and support of sci\u00ad ence. In a society largely dependent upon scientific knowl\u00ad edge, these are dangerous ideas. Indeed, the greatest irony hidden from modern critics of science is that they are actively undermining the very foundation of the democratic society they claim to cherish. Democracy can flourish only in a The greatest irony hidden from modern critics of science is that they are actively undermining the very foundation of the democratic society they claim to cherish. Democracy can flourish only in a climate of rationalism that sees some ideas as true and others as false. 36 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER climate of rationalism that sees some ideas as true and others as false. Science, with all of its limitations, is still the best methodology for discovering this truth. This realization, however, requires some familiarity with the real methodology and ideas of science\u2014not just postmod\u00ad ern caricatures of them. It is quite easy to convince students to devalue science when they never learned what science is in the first place. Teachers innocent of the slightest knowledge of sci\u00ad ence cultivate the ignorance of students, and they even con\u00ad vince students that this ignorance serves progressive political interests. They encourage students to adopt a purely political view of science and do not encourage them to acquire the sci\u00ad entific knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary for informed discussion. The student emerges from \"science and society\" classes with no valid criteria for evaluating scientific arguments and comes to believe that only political and rhetor\u00ad ical considerations really matter. Who makes the most impas\u00ad sioned speeches for political egalitarianism? Who seems to be sticking up for the rights of the underdog? Students learn to banish the notion of scientific objectivity with a shrug and embrace the rhetoric of anyone invoking die ideals of equality and democracy. Their minds become mere flotsam and jetsam adrift on the waves of rhetoric. You can almost feel die collec\u00ad tive shifting of their opinions during class discussions, while dieir peers present reductive, emotionally appealing sum\u00ad maries of various positions in complicated scientific debates. Would they so easily succumb to these ideas if they had learned more about realities of scientific inquiry instead of only the idealized fantasies presented by science teachers or the dystopian fantasies of radical science critics? Conclusion: What Then Is to Be Done? Skeptics should acknowledge the depth of the problems entan\u00ad gled with postmodern criticisms of science. Too often, we have ridiculed the radical critics without trying to understand the appeal of their ideas or the conditions necessary for the accep\u00ad tance of their message. The preceding analysis should demon\u00ad strate that most students learn nothing of importance about the nature of science in their core science classes, and this igno\u00ad rance leaves them receptive to alternate models of scientific inquiry. Not surprisingly, students are most appreciative of those descriptions of science that best satisfy their own long\u00ad ings for justice and equality. After learning thai science is much more contentious than their high-school and college courses led them to believe, these students crave emotional solace. They want the kind of certainty that only relativism can provide, in which indifference to the very idea of authority erases all real doubts. \"Science and society\" classes address this need and fill the intellectual void partially created by the incompleteness of the students' earlier science courses. As a result, postmodernism erases the helpful doubt that stimulates real thinkers to rigorously challenge their own preconceived notions and pursue the difficult pleasure of objective truth. To remedy this situation, we have to change the educa\u00ad tional process itself. First, we need to address the history and philosophy of science in core science curricula. Presendy, stu\u00ad dents in high-school and college science classes learn only die end products of scientific inquiry, and none of its inherent methods and ideas. If students are to fully understand the suc\u00ad cesses of science, they need to learn about its failures and the historical contexts of scientific ideas. They have to understand the way science thrives from competition between rival scien\u00ad tists with opposing biases and ideologies. This knowledge will give students a broader intellectual defense against the plain\u00ad tive but ill-informed claims of modern science critics. Some students, unfortunately, enter their \"science and society\" classes with no core science courses to their credit. For this reason, universities need to ensure that these classes provide students with a balanced perspective about science, not simply indoctrination into radical politics. Students should have the opportunity to read what experts in the phi\u00ad losophy and history of science have to say and understand the logic of scientific inquiry. Classes that do not provide these opportunities cannot claim to provide a responsible educa\u00ad tion. They leave students poorly prepared for participation in a scientific, democratic society. Throughout American history, there has always been a tension between the productive ideal of allowing open pur\u00ad suit of truth and the counterproductive ideal of simply sub\u00ad ordinating all questions of truth to public opinion\u2014the establishment of tyranny by majority. If the latter ideal com\u00ad prises die current goal of \"science and society\" classes, the former ideal may prove an effective remedy. A democratic malady requires a democratic cure. We skeptics need to focus our attention not only on exposing the sham egalitarianism of postmodernism but also on showing that science is a bet\u00ad ter foundation for democratic ideals. As scientist Robert Lawrence Kuhn recently stated, \"Science needs democracy as much as democracy needs science. Vigorous scientific research reflects democratic principles in action, and free and open scientific inquiry cannot take place without the protec\u00ad tive support of a robust democracy\" (Kuhn 2003). If we try to teach students about the complexities of scientific inquiry, we can lessen the nurturing of suspicion and more effectively nurture the thinking skills needed to become that greatest of rarities in modern society: an informed citizen.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 37 The Cold War's Classified Skyhook Program A Participant's Revelations Classified high-altitude, long-duration flights of huge Skyhook balloons, which often returned their secret payloads to the surface, began in 1947 and continued for several decades. This secret Cold War program was the likely progenitor of many key aspects of UFO mythology. B.D. GILDENBERG Iwas busy calibrating instrumentation for top-secret Project Mogul in the spring of 1947. In retrospect, I was totally unaware of the project's actual identity. My secu\u00ad rity clearance was for the lower rating of confidential. I was unaware of the project title for another forty-eight years, until 1995. Welcome to the arcane world of classified Skyhook pro\u00ad grams and Cold War intrigue. In this review, I hope to reveal many of those once-classified programs, how they generated UFO mythology, and why that relationship has not been fully addressed. I write from a thirty-five-year professional career as a Skyhook balloon specialist and direct experience with most 38 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER of the programs in these revelations. I was also an investigator for a special Project Blue Office and years later worked on the Pentagon Roswell report. A Skyhook balloon provides constant-level performance at a predetermined altitude. It is usually constructed of special plastics and can lift tons of payload for durations of days or longer. The latter capability was once highly classified. Skyhook balloons were huge. The average size of those dis\u00ad cussed in this article was double the six million cubic feet of the Hindenberg. Their diameters were about 300 feet with a flaccid length of 430 feet. Primarily cruising in the stratos\u00ad phere, the balloons change color at high altitudes during sun\u00ad rises and sunsets, while the Earth below is almost dark. These characteristics equate to a superb UFO generaror. It is therefore more than a coincidence that die birth of this vehicle in 1947 coincided with the origin of the twentieth cen\u00ad tury UFO epidemic. That epidemic was highlighted by the Roswell incident, with Project Mogul the prime seed. That relationship has already been detailed in a number of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER articles (for example, Thomas 1995). The Skyhook Program The prime launch site for Project Mogul was Alamogordo Air Base in New Mexico, west and therefore upwind of Roswell. The 1947 launches were in June and July, but there were ini\u00ad tial UFO reports around the East Coast prior to the summer (Brookesmith 1995). These were preliminary test launches from New Jersey and Long Island. There were also sightings in the summer of 1947 in the western and northwestern United States. A 1949 Air Force investigation (Trakowski 1949) could not correlate those sightings with Project Mogul, but the Air Force was unaware of a Navy program launching cluster balloons in Colorado that same summer. Coordination between branches of the military was limited in the years just following World War II. Accordingly, the dilemma of that 1949 report added fuel to a developing UFO mythology. Clusters of weather balloons launched from both New Mexico and Colorado triggered reports of flying saucers sighted in formations throughout the West. They briefly pre\u00ad ceded plastic Skyhook balloons, but their performance as con\u00ad stant-level vehicles was marginal. An iniii.il government coverup for Project Mogul saw an assembled crew not associated widi the project launching a simi\u00ad lar configuration, but without the classified payload. Newspapers were invited to die launch again at Alamogordo Air Base. Years later, as the Roswell legend resurfaced, UFO proponents denounced Project Mogul as a cover-up for their alien event. B. D. Gildenberg has had thirty-five years of continuous experi\u00ad ence with Skyhook operations and an additional twenty-two years as a consultant. He has authored or co-authored articles in many skeptical magazines. His other background experiences include cryptography in the World War II Pentagon, work on the Pentagon Roswell reports, and involvement in astronaut tests prior to NASA. E-mail: hmnbb@wayfarerl.com. At Alamogordo AFB headquarters, Mogul was listed as a guided-missile program. That represented a further cover-up procedure. The actual purpose of the project was stratospheric detection of distant nuclear bomb tests. Unknown to Roswell enthusiasts were classified programs that operated for decades afterward, based on Project Mogul technology. One unclassified derivative was Project Blue Book, the Air Force investigation of UFOs. An initial sponsor was the Air Material Command, headquarters for Project Mogul. Blue Book originated in January, 1948, under the title Project Sign. Project Mogul prompted the initial development of a USAF Skyhook facility at Alamogordo AFB (today Holloman AFB). It was eventually governed by the Cambridge Research Laboratories in Massachusetts and became the prime USAF Skyhook launch site, still active today. Project Blue Book had outlying reporting offices throughout the country. Their func\u00ad tion was to gather UFO reports and send them to the Blue Book main office at Wright Field, Ohio. At Holloman AFB, the Blue Book office was situated in our Skyhook Balloon building. That choice was biased by the sig\u00ad nificant percent of reports generated by our relatively new vehicle. This office was also unique in that it, like the Wright Field Center, analyzed reports. I joined the Holloman Skyhook group in 1951 for a thirty-year tour and immediately became involved with Project Blue Book. There was a more discrete reason for this special Blue Book role. In 1951, we became the primary center for unclassified Project Moby Dick. In at least one pro-Roswell book that pro\u00ad ject was erroneously dated 1947 and classified as secret (Randle 1994). Such misinformation contributes to the mythology of government cover-ups. Rumors and Cover-ups Project Moby Dicks stated purpose was to study stratosphere wind trajectories, as defined via three-day Skyhook flights. After training for over a year at our location, crews and equip\u00ad ment moved to three West Coast sites for the operational phase. Although the announced purpose did result in final reports containing those stratospheric trajectories, rhere was actually a secretive phase. Moby Dick was in fact a cover-up for top-secret project WS-119L. Beside the alphanumeric title, secret projects have secret names that vary for different phases. This program was called Project Gopher at our Alamogordo AFB launch site. It later accumulated titles including Grayback, Moby Dick Hi, Gentrix, and Grandson. Even the WS prefix was a cover-up, since it was not a weapon system. The actual project goal was balloon recon\u00ad naissance of the Soviet Union. The entire subject is extensively covered in an excellent book by historian Curtis Peebles (Peebles 1991). Project Moby Dick was actually gathering tra\u00ad jectory data for Project Gopher, although the information also generated unclassified data for meteorological applications. We flew five Gopher (WS-119L) test flights in 1951 and 1952 from our Air Force Skyhook Center. The payload was kept in a hanger during flight preparation under continuous SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 39 armed guard. Outsiders noticed this and ensuing rumors eventually generated tales including a secret Project Aquarius. In Randle's UFO Casebook (Randle 1989) he notes, \"a possible Project Aquarius; Headquarters may be in Alamogordo with an important Branch in Montana.\" In fact, we did have an auxiliary training camp in Montana. The mythology of Project Aquarius is nebulous but has something to do with an MJ-12 committee maintaining communications with Roswell aliens. All this intrigue came to a head when the CIA suddenly showed up at our office and at launches. UFO reports peaked in 1952, as our local Skyhook activity increased from ninety- two hours the previous year to 694 hours aloft. Moreover, launches from the Moby Dick West Coast sites were com\u00ad mencing. Eventually they, along with additional sites in Missouri and Georgia, contributed 640 flights. Pre-flight preparation of four-ton reconnaissance camera launched by a Skyhook balloon. The CIA requested that we not identify most of those sharply increasing Skyhook reports. The strategy was to gener\u00ad ate a UFO outbreak over the USA extending to the USSR when our WS-119L Skyhooks arrived there. Ironically, the ploy initially worked, since the Soviet Air Force could not intercept die first wave. They allowed their public to play our UFO game. The strategy ended after a few leaking Skyhooks were shot down and the payloads were exhibited, along with protests, to President Eisenhower. Thus, complex interplay of Moby Dick, WS-119L, and UFO reports defined the unique role of our Blue Book office in that era. Since top-secret WS-119L was not declassified until more than thirty years later, that intrigue can only now be addressed. Although initial phases of WS-119L were launched from Europe and Turkey, a final phase, WS-461L, was launched from the Pacific. There was a direct parallel to Moby Dick, where unclassified Project White Cloud launched Pacific flights to obtain trajectory data for WS-461L. In the April 1994 issue of Omni magazine, a retired airman proclaimed solid proof of UFO activity. He had glimpsed logs from the European NATO Command Center for 1958. They reported UFOs coming out of the USSR at 100,000 foot altitudes. That nicely described WS-461L flights cruising in from the Pacific Ocean launches. The entire Skyhook reconnaissance program produced marginal data, but its recovery techniques phased into satellite programs. Moreover, die Soviets were so impressed they actu\u00ad ally developed several high-altitude aircraft dedicated to inter\u00ad cepting our Skyhooks! In the 1960s, Premier Khrushchev developed a habit of banging his shoe on the table in protest at the UN. In one such case, he exhibited a WS-119L payload, perhaps with some of our trainees' initials on it. Late in 1952, I spent a month at Edwards AFB, California, to forecast three-day trajectories for Moby Dick flights, as specified in my travel orders. Forty years later, I discovered from Peebles's The Moby Dick Project (Peebles 1991) that I actually had been working on a top-secret program called Flying Cloud, WS-124A! Skyhooks were to be evaluated as a balloon bomber in the event of an actual war. Proposed payloads included nuclear warheads, but the program was aban\u00ad doned as intercontinental ballistic mis\u00ad siles became viable. UFO Mythology There were a number of peripheral events associated with these programs. At Alamogordo AFB in 1952, we dispatched F-86 jet aircraft to see if they could inter\u00ad cept our Skyhooks at various altitudes. The exercise was designed to evaluate what Soviet interceptors might experience when our reconnaissance balloons arrived. The event was described in Timothy Good's Above Top Secret (Good 1988), published thirty-six years later. It represents a classic example of how portrayals of classified mili\u00ad tary testing can become transformed over decades into some\u00ad thing out of diis world. Date and aircraft type were correct but die latter were described as trying to intercept an evasive UFO dial featured hovering and accelerations up to 700 mph. Alamogordo Air Force Base was renamed Holloman AFB in 1953. On October 27 of that year, we launched an unclas\u00ad sified payload. It failed to terminate at die scheduled twelve- hour flight duration, and, six days later, it was detected by the Royal Air Force over die Atlantic headed for London! This of course generated UFO hysteria (Good 1988). Newspapers announced it could not be a Skyhook since diere was presently no such activity in Europe, but altitude and performance reports agreed widi our vehicles capabilities. Ironically, British intelligence officers also knew that but would not disclose die 40 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER objea's identity. They too were involved with the WS-119L program, and test flights were to be launched from Scotland. Yet this incident is still highlighted in UFO literature as a clas\u00ad sic case for their cause. We flew a few classified programs in the late 1950s and 1960s which included special flares at night from twenty-mile altitudes. That was a predictable UFO generator. Philip Corso's book The Day after Roswell (CORSO 1997) con\u00ad tained many significant errors including movements of some of Wernher von Braun's German scientists, who shared our build\u00ad ing at Holloman AFB. Sixty pages were dedicated to a once- secret U.S. Army project for a lunar base called Project Horizon. Plans were initiated in 1959 but were finally cancelled because Project Apollo had exhausted space funds. The story was suspi\u00ad ciously infused with hints of alien activity on the Moon. That was interesting because that same year my Skyhook Center was flying a classified Army project, code named ... Project Hori\u00ad zon! It had nothing to do with lunar bases and involved photo\u00ad graphic studies of the horizon. The purpose was to obtain cali\u00ad bration information for guided missiles. In 1967 and 1969, we flew ever more advanced, classified reconnaissance cameras. These cameras were huge, weighing from 6,000 to 8,000 pounds, and encased in ten-foot cylin\u00ad ders. They were tracked by several helicopters carrying armed military police to surround the payload after landing. With Roswell often downwind, this very likely contributed to that UFO story line, and time compaction is a vital ingredient in creating such myths and legends. Skyhook incidents near to or on the ground, like this pre\u00ad vious case, provoked more UFO tales than balloons at an alti\u00ad tude. There was a cluster of this type of event in the 1960s (Peebles 1994), which evoked much media coverage. It persists today as a hallmark UFO case, and features the most detailed witness descriptions. One of those events had serious overtones, involving sensi\u00ad tive military sites, with no obvious revelations to this date. It is noted in Good's book. Above Top Secret (Good 1988). \"A metallic disc-shaped UFO with bright flashing lights moving slowly over the site. It stopped and hovered at 500 feet then the UFO climbed vertically and disappeared at high speed\" (this was in March, 1967). The location was a Minuteman missile site at Minot, North Dakota. I became suspicious after reading this, aware of a top-secret Skyhook program in that era, with one launch site in the Dakotas. There were other descriptions that rather precisely identified the program, despite scattered inclusions of media mythology. The program was Project Grab Bag, also called Sky Dipper or Cold Ash. Again, there was a cover-up unclassified pro\u00ad gram. Program Ash Can. Both programs involved sampling radioactive fallout debris in the stratosphere. After a brief Navy test sequence, Grab Bag, now under the USAF, became oper\u00ad ational in 1956, extending briefly into the 1970s. Its highly classified signature was due to the fact that a final product involved establishing details of Soviet plutonium production. Even our Project Ash Can attracted more than the usual Skyhook attention, since parachute and payload were snatched in midair by USAF cargo aircraft. That prompted stories of aircraft being attacked by a UFO while the mother ship (the Skyhook) hovered high above. Grab Bag was a special UFO generator. After stratospheric sampling, lifting gas was partially released through a valve in the apex of the Skyhook. The entire ensemble was thus low\u00ad ered to within a few thousand feet of the ground. Then it released a parachute with the payload while the under-loaded balloon rocketed upward to eventually shatter. Since most of these activities occurred at night, Grab Bag generated probably the most detailed UFO events in the literature. For instance, \"A conical shaped object descended from the sky. It hovered at an estimated 3,000 feet. A smaller UFO landed within fifty feet\" (Brookesmirh 1995). This photograph shows Skyhook Ballon 93 leaving the deck of the USS Norton Sound (AV-11) on March 31, 1949. U.S. Navy Photo. That is a precise description of the basic Grab Bag profile. The Minuteman case with a UFO climbing vertically to dis\u00ad appear at high speed sounds very much like the under-loaded balloon zooming skyward to disappear as it self-destructed. Project tracking included three helicopters. If the winds were light, the entire ensemble would be valved to the surface. Again, UFO reports clearly identified the process. \"Floating red lights which moved over a highway and into a field at night. It appeared like a two-story building, with other lights grouped around it. The lattet sometimes hover around the central object\" (Fawcctt and Greenwood 1984). SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lune 2004 41 The payload did indeed have red lights. The other hovering lights were the helicopters. Just before landing the sample would be transferred to another container via a powerful cen\u00ad trifugal blower. That noise amplified the mystery. Occasionally the tracking crew would transfer the sample into metal cylin\u00ad ders, engendering even more strange noises in the dark. Other activity was also reported: \"Radiation fields and other forms of energy have appeared to be directly connected with a hovering or landed UFO\" (Brookesmith 1995). The radioactivity, although slight, was from the sample being transferred by recovery personnel to another container. Readers may wonder why, after recovery. Grab Bag person\u00ad nel would not have notified local authorities without disclosing classification. The answer is diat proceedings were so classified that they could not identify their mission under any circum\u00ad stance. The program was a natural for engendering mystery and a treasury of lucrative narratives for UFO folklore. Meanwhile, at our Holloman AFB Skyhook Center, we continued to launch a variety of classified reconnaissance cameras, now with loads up to five tons. Again, there were tracking helicopters with armed military police (MPs). People in southern New Mexico were used to seeing military heli\u00ad copters on various missions. However, we flew a number of reconnaissance camera missions in 1975 in northeastern New Mexico where military helicopters were seldom seen. This cre\u00ad ated some suspicion. \"Unidentified helicopters\" had also helped to amplify Grab Bag as a UFO generator, triggering later myths involving military helicopters. There was an outbreak of mutilated catde stories in Colorado and northeastern New Mexico in 1975. Strange helicopters were part of die scenario. The Albuquerque Journal reported \"ghost copters\" buzzing ranches (Peebles 1994). The presence of armed MPs onboard added to the frenzy. The FAA Area Coordinator announced an investigation of this outbreak but never revealed what it had found. The FBI also became involved with similar results. Both agencies had quickly discovered it was our highly classified program. Their \"case closed\" reaction is still highlighted today in government cover-up tales. Clearly, secret Skyhook balloon programs magnified govern\u00ad ment cover-ups and engendered numerous UFO stories, sight\u00ad ings, and myths. Classified aircraft also contributed to UFO folk\u00ad lore during die Cold War. The U-2 reconnaissance aircraft fol\u00ad lowed WS-119L operations over die USSR. It triggered similar UFO reports, even while training in die U.S. However, unlike supersonic aircraft. Skyhooks remained widiin sight for long durations, landing widi strange payloads, far from dieir origin. It is important that all this activity be revealed. Project Grab Bag generated the most detailed descriptions of UFOs in the lit\u00ad erature. Even relatively skeptical individuals might have won\u00ad dered about those sightings, believing them to be too complex to dismiss. I hope these revelations provide a vital insight into what was \"behind die looking glass\" of secret Cold War activities. The Pentagon published the first two detailed reports in 1995 (Weaver and McAndrew 1995), demonstrating how top- secret Project Mogul became the initial trigger for the Roswell mystery. Readers may wonder why that effort has not been repeated for once-classified events detailed in this article. Actually, it was only at the urging of a congressman, the late Steve Schiff of New Mexico, that the Pentagon began work on the Roswell affair. Having participated in the preparation of die final report (McAndrew 1997), I can reveal there was sub\u00ad stantial resistance to the whole process. A number of times we thought the enterprise would be cancelled. It was only via last- minute intervention by the Secretary of the Air Force that the report was finally published. Many Pentagon authorities believed diat the Roswell and UFO investi\u00ad gations in general were not worthy of dis\u00ad traction from more pressing matters of national importance. Despite providing accurate hardware descriptions of die programs we have cov\u00ad ered, some reports included stories of onboard aliens and other typical elements of UFO mythology such as stalled cars and skin burns. They were imitating numerous UFO witnesses with a tendency to repeat stories that preceded their own sightings. We can deplore or marvel at the persistent thirst for other\u00ad worldly fantasies, but a sage in Elizabethan England had an apt comment that can categorize even contemporary mythology: So full of shapes is fancy, that it alone is high fantastical. \u2014Shakespeare.

There are those in the field, however, who still reject scientific protocol. DOUGLAS M. STOKES It takes a lot of hubris to become a parapsychologist. One has to have the temerity to come to the conclusion that one's own judgment\u2014and that of a small cadre of rene\u00ad gade scientists\u2014is superior to the collective judgment of the entire scientific establishment when it comes to the reality of phenomena such as ESP and psychokinesis. While such self- confidence is virtually a prerequisite to doing scientific work in parapsychology, too much hubris may be a bad thing. There are some psi researchers who believe that they can ignore the hard-earned lessons about what constitutes proper scientific methodology\u2014knowledge gained over more than a century of intense and often acrimonious debate with skep\u00ad tics. They instead rely on their own \"creative judgment\"\u2014 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 43 -y at # B*\u00a3 g I 5 i i even if that means violating the basic canons regarding accept\u00ad able procedures in psi research. One such researcher is Brenda J. Dunne. Dunne is best known for her work on remote perception, a term she uses to describe the remote viewing paradigm made popular by physicists Russell Targ and Hal Putoff in the early 1970s (see Targ and PuthorT 1977, for instance). In these experiments, an \"agent\" travels to a remote location and a \"percipient\" in the laboratory attempts to describe the location visited by the agent. Dunne began her work on remote per\u00ad ception at Mundelein College in Chicago and the University of Chicago in collaboration widi John Bisaha. She then moved to Robert Jahn's Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) center in Princeton, New Jersey, where she continued her research program. Douglas M. Stokes is a well-known internal critic of research methodology in parapsychology. He was one of the contributors to The Skeptics Handbook of Parapsychology, and a summary of his work may be found in his book The Nature of Mind, published by McFarland in 1997. He is presently a management consultant specializing in statistical analysis with the firm of Sullivan, Cotter, and Associates, Inc. in Detroit. The summer 2003 issue of the Journal of Scientific Exploration (JSE) began with an article by Dunne and Jahn summarizing die results obtained by Dunne to date (Dunne and Jahn 2003). The journal is the flagship publication of the Society for Scientific Exploration and was created in some sense as an attempt at counterprogramming to the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. It publishes articles by scientists whose work has been rejected or ignored by mainstream or \"establishment\" sci\u00ad ence. In the past year alone, JSE has featured articles on qi energy, face-like features on Mars, the Loch Ness monster, electronic voice phenomena, anomalies in relativity theory, transoceanic contacts in prehistoric America, rock that crackle, spark, and glow before earthquakes, biological cold fusion, and the confessions of a grave-robbing UFOlogist. Unfortunately, the JSE has all too often served as a haven and publication out\u00ad let for parapsychologists who feel that dieir work has been unfairly rejected by \"mainstream\" parapsychology (which itself is of course rejected, if not held in outright contempt or dis\u00ad dain, by the actual scientific establishment). However, despite its flaws, mainstream parapsychology has learned and largely incorporated hard lessons about proper methodology in die course of its century-long debate widi its critics in the main\u00ad stream scientific community. More often dian not, die reason 44 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER aspiring parapsychologists' work is rejected for publication by, or criticized in, the mainstream parapsychological journals is ihat it fails to adhere to die basic minimal methodological standards accepted by all competent workers in the field. Dunne's Failure to Randomize The most basic and perhaps most elementary of these stan\u00ad dards is that targets in ESP experiments should be randomly selected. Dunne's research has failed to live up to this standard even once in the course of her nearly three-decade-long and widely publicized research program. At die very outset of parapsychology, it was recognized that nonrandom selection of targets may result in spurious evi\u00ad dence for ESP. For instance, if I tell you that 1 am thinking of an integer between one and ten (inclusive), you may be more likely to guess certain numbers (e.g., seven) rather than others (e.g., nine). If your bias in guessing and mine in selecting the number to be the target are similar (which they are likely to be by human nature), then there will be a greater than 10 percent chance that your guess will be correct. Similarly, in Russell Targ and Hal Puthoffs famous picture-drawing experi\u00ad ments with Uri Geller at Stanford Research Institute, the method of selecting the target was to open a dictionary \"at random\" and draw the first \"drawable\" word on the page. Targ and Puthoff regarded this as a satisfac\u00ad tory approach to randomization. However, in the one example they give of this process, the first drawable word on the page chosen was farmer. (The decision as to which words are \"drawable\" is of course itself subjective in nature.) In the target drawing created based on this word, the \"farmer\" is given not only a pitchfork, but horns and an elaborate tail. To top this off, the word devil was wrinen above the farmer. In attempting to guess this target, Geller, ensconced inside SRI's famous shielded room, drew several religiously oriented pic\u00ad tures of Earth together with tablets, an apple, and tridents or menorahs. If Geller and the person constructing the target had just been, say, viewing a collection of paintings by Hieronymous Bosch or watching a clip from The Exorcist, this may have prompted them both to construct drawings with reli\u00ad gious themes, producing a spurious match. As I pointed out in my review of Targ and Puthoff's book when it was first pub\u00ad lished (Stokes 1977), if the dictionary word can be interpreted diis loosely, then the target selection process cannot be said to be random at all. In Dunnes initial research, the target location for each trial was ostensibly randomly selected. (Recall that Dunne's remote perception research involves an agent traveling to a remote locauon, while a percipient attempts to divine the nature of die location through ESP.) However, in Dunne's research protocol, the agent took pictures of the target location and these pictures were provided to die judges who rated die degree of correspon\u00ad dence between the percipient's impressions of the target loca\u00aduon and various foil locations. Under this procedure, the target is not randomly selected but rather is nonrandomly con\u00ad structed by the agent through his or her choice of which aspects of the target location to photograph, etc. Thus, had the percip\u00ad ient and die agent, who were often friends, had similar thought processes that day or similar recent experiences, this may have caused die percipient to articulate themes in his or her descrip\u00ad tion of die target location that were similar to diemes in the agent's photographs of the target locauon. For instance, if they were both depressed, die percipient may describe a dark loca\u00ad uon, and the agent at die remote woodland location may focus her picture-taking on shadowed areas beneath the trees rather than on the bright sunlit valley in the opposite direction. Anodicr problem widi diis procedure is that the trials were conducted over a period of several months, so that seasonal changes and weadier panerns could creep into both the percip\u00ad ients' impressions and the agent's pictures.1 I pointed out these problems in two early reviews of Dunne and Bisaha's work in the Journal of Parapsychology (Stokes 1978a, 1978b). Another problem in this early research is that Dunne and Bisaha tested subjects using sampling without replacement combined with trial-by-trial feedback to the subject. When a limited series of target locations is involved, the subject may increase his proba\u00ad bility of a match with the target location by studiously avoid\u00ad ing giving descriptions of targets already seen, thus ensuring that the judges will not match his impression with the previ\u00ad ously seen targets, increasing the probability that they will match his impression with the current target. Even worse, the subject can provide explicit cues to the judges as to which matches not to make (e.g., \"1 feel that die target involves water but is nothing like the marina we saw yesterday\"). These prob\u00ad lems were pointed out early on, both by me (e.g., Stokes 1981) and by Jim Kennedy (e.g., Kennedy 1978). As mentioned above, the target locations were ostensibly chosen randomly in Dunne and Bisaha's early research. However, in a scathing review of Dunne's research program, Hansen, Utts, and Markwick (1992) note that the randomiza\u00ad tion process is inadequately documented in most of Dunnes research. These authors also take Dunne to task for multiple statistical errors as well as the fact that the percipient was not closely monitored in order to limit die possibility of fraud. The PEAR team's response to this critique (Dobyns, Dunne, Jahn, At the very outset of parapsychology, it was recognized that nonrandom selection of targets may result in spurious evidence for ESP. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 45 and Nelson 1992) was less than adequate and rather uncon\u00ad vincing, especially regarding the sort of procedural errors dis\u00ad cussed above. In their most recent publication, Dunne and Jahn (2003) dismiss the critique as \"irrelevant\" and \"incor\u00ad rect,\" demonstrating that they have learned little from such constructive criticism. Current Research In her latest research, Dunne has apparently abandoned the idea that it is necessary to select targets randomly at all. Instead, she has adopted what she calls the \"volitional proto\u00ad col,\" in which the agent freely chooses the target location. Of the 336 \"formal trials\" reported in her latest overview of her research program (Dunne and Jahn 2003), 211 utilized the volitional protocol and are thus absolutely worthless as evi\u00ad dence of ESP and only 125 involved the (ostensibly) random selection of the target. Dunne's latest procedure is to have the agent and percipi\u00ad ent check off a list of \"descriptors\" regarding the target loca\u00ad tion (e.g., whether the scene is \"confined or expansive,\" whether it is \"noisy or quiet,\" whether it involves the presence of water, is indoors or outdoors, etc.). The degree of match between the descriptors checked (or rated) by the percipient and agent is then compared to the statistical distribution of matches between the percipient's descriptor list and those pro\u00ad vided for other locations on other trials. However, the same problems exist as for die pictures taken by the agent in Dunne's early research. The location is not the target; rather the target is the agent's description of the location. Common thought processes and common experiences can thus lead die agent and the percipient to provide similar descriptions. For instance, if diey are in glum mood, they may both rate the location as \"confined and quiet\" rather than as \"expansive and noisy.\" The agent may even consciously or unconsciously bias his ratings to correspond with those he believes the percipient is likely to give. In an appendix to their paper, Dunne and Jahn attempt to deal with the issue of common rating biases between the agent and percipient by making comparisons only within agent-percipient pairs. This, however, does not address the issue of biases rJiat may fluctuate from trial to trial. Also the problem of the percipient's avoidance of descriptions of previously seen target locations remains. There is a very clean procedure available to the PEAR team that would avoid all of these problems: create a pool of targets for each trial prior to the trial, and have the target descriptions prepared before the trials. Then choose a target location ran\u00ad domly from the pool, and compare the correspondence of the percipient's description with the chosen target location against those of the alternative locations that were not selected. This procedure was pointed out to the PEAR team over a decade ago by Hansen, Utts, and Markwick (1992) in their extensive critique of Dunne's program. Dunne and Jahn claim that there is no problem with their relaxed methodology, as the trials using better procedures (e.g., ostensibly random selection of targets) yielded results that were just as strong as those using more a more relaxed method\u00ad ological standard (e.g., the volitional trials). However, even the best of their procedures is so woefully inadequate as to render their results useless. And why embark on a research program using a flawed procedure that will prove noching even if striking results are obtained? Jahn and Dunne claim that the odds against their overall results being due to chance coincidence are more dian ten mil\u00ad lion to one. But chance is not the likely explanation, methodological inadequacy is. Thus, Dunne and Jahn have amassed impres\u00ad sive evidence for some type of anomalous phenomenon. Unfortunately that anomalous phenomenon is not ESP or \"remote perception\" as diey call it, but rather the unending folly of a research team that should know better by now (if only they would listen to their \"unfair\" criucs in die \"mainstream\" para- psychological journals). Note 1. For example, the percipient may describe dripping red leaves on a rainy autumn day and glistening snow on a bright winter day. these elements will likely be captured in the agent's photographs as well, enabling the judges to match die target locations to the percipients' impressions without any ESP on the part of the percipient being involved at all.

She thanks the skeptical community and agonizes over how the messages of scientific and critical thinking could be made more effective in communicating with her former New Age colleagues. KARLA McLAREN I've been studying the conflict between the skeptical com\u00ad munity and the metaphysical/new age community for a few decades now, and I think I've finally discovered the central issue that makes communication so difficult. It is not merely, as many surmise, a conflict between fact-based view\u00ad points and faith-based viewpoints. Nor is it simply a conflict between rationality and credulity. No, it's a full-on clash of cultures that makes real communication improbable at best. I know this firsthand, because as a former member of the New Age culture, I struggled for years to decipher the lan\u00ad guage, the rules, the attitudes, and the expectations of the skeptical culture. Yet for a great while, all I could hear from the skeptical culture was noise\u2014and confusing noise at that. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 47 I'm not really sure how to introduce myself, except perhaps with this paraphrase: \"I have seen the enemy, and she is me.\" I'm an author and healer (or I was, actually) in the metaphys\u00ad ical culture. I wrote about energy and chakras, auras, healing, the different kinds of psychic skills . . . the whole shebang. I've traveled throughout the states doing book tours, seminars, and workshops. I've appeared at all the top New Age venues, such as the Omega Institute, Naropa University, and the Whole Life Expo (which I call the Hell Life Expo, but that's another story). My books have been translated into five languages, and I've even had a title in the One Spirit Book Club. Understanding the metaphysical/New Age community and culture has been a central focus of my life and my career. I'm not just a member of the New Age community\u2014I've also been a purveyor of the very things the skeptical commu\u00ad nity is so concerned about. I've been involved in metaphysics and the New Age for over thirty years, I've written four books and recorded five audio learning sets in the genre, and I was considered one of the leaders in the field. I'm not in the field any longer, but it's hard to truly disap\u00ad pear when so many of my books and tapes are already out there. It's also hard to disappear when I don't really know what to say to tlie people in my culture. The cultural rift is so extreme that anything I say will prove that I have gone to the other side, the wrong side\u2014the side of the enemy. In actual fact, however, I have just seen enough to know that the skep\u00ad tics and the critical thinkers have some extremely pertinent and meaningful things to say. I've now studied enough skepti\u00ad cal and scientific information about paranormal abilities and events to question many of the precepts upon which my work was based. More important, I've seen enough to understand firsthand the real costs of the New Age. I've also learned to understand the differences and similari\u00ad ties in die New Age and skeptical cultures, so that I no longer react in a stereotypically offended fashion when I or the people I know and love are referred to as frauds, shams, or dupes. I understand now diat these terms are not meant disparagingly, for the most part. I understand now that these terms often mask a great deal of care and concern for people in the New Age cul\u00ad ture. It's sometimes hard to unearth that concern\u2014it often requires an almost anthropological capacity to understand the cultural differences between us\u2014but the concern is there. Until I understood that concern, I couldn't find myself in the skeptical lexicon. I couldn't identify myself with the uncar\u00ad ing hucksters, the wildly miseducated snake-oil peddlers, mega- lom.mi.iL.il eastern fakirs. I couldn't identify my work or myself with the scam-based work or the unstable personalities so Karla McLaren has been a member of the metaphysical/New Age culture for thirty-two years. She has authored nine titles in the genre, including Emotional Genius, Energetic Boundaries, and Your Aura & Your Chakras: The Owner's Manual. She is now decon\u00ad structing her career, and is returning to (real) college to get her (real) Masters in Sociology and Behavioral Sciences. She is currently co- writing a book on bridging the skeptical and New Age cultures. roundly trashed by the skeptical culture, because I was never in the field to scam anyone\u2014and neither were any of my friends or colleagues. I worked in the field because I have a deep and abiding concern for people, and an honest wish to be helpful in my own culture. Access to clearheaded and carefully presented skeptical material would have helped me (and others like me) at every step of the way\u2014but I couldn't access any of that infor\u00ad mation because I simply couldn't identify with it. Until now. I'm writing this piece as a thank you letter to the skeptical community. I want to thank you for helping me to fully understand just how much bad training I've been exposed to in my metaphysical/New Age culture (actually, it's not my cul\u00ad ture any longer, but for simplicity's sake, let me continue to claim it for the duration of this piece). But I'm also writing as an attempt to open a dialogue, and perhaps to begin bridging the precipitous chasm that exists between our two warring cul\u00ad tures, because at this point, the lion's share of people from my culture can't really hear much (if anything) from the skeptical culture. And that's a real shame. This cultural divide is making it nearly impossible for me to be honest in my own culture about the changes I've made. Right now, my Web site says that I'm on sabbatical. I've cancelled all workshops, turned down numerous book contracts, and I'm slowly deconstructing my career. I've cleared out files, e-mails, and letters, thousands of letters, from people who considered mc an expert. I'm turning down all requests for interviews and con\u00ad sultations, and I'm going back to school to get my degree in sociology and behavioral sciences. If I write another book about the New Age culture, I want to write it as a sociologist\u2014not as a mystic or as a naysayer, because neither of those positions has been truly helpful to people in my culture. The fight between our cultures has often been an ugly and confusing one, and in all honesty, that fight can't be won the way we're fighting it. I'm tired of seeing so many people get hurt when so little good comes of that hurt. So I'm going to try something new, and I'm going to try to find a way to expi\u00ad ate the damage I feel I've done. But first I need to find the words to tell people in my culture what I'm doing and why. On one level, my story is not a typical one, because I'm not simply a New Age follower who finally woke up. However, even though it is unusual and perhaps even unheard of for someone in my position to make a complete turnaround, I think the process I followed is fairly typical. I started out in my youth, knowing (through direct experience) that the things I learned in the New Age and metaphysics were true, and that naysayers were just that. After a time, though, I began to ques\u00ad tion the things I saw that didn't fit\u2014the anomalies, the cures that didn't work, the ideas that fell apart when you really looked at them, and so forth. I wrote passionately about the trouble I saw in my culture, and I even became a voice of rea\u00ad son. Sadly, though, every time I tried to research the things that disturbed or troubled me, I hit a wall. That wall, built of deep cultural differences and decades (or centuries) of distrust, meant that I could find nothing within my culture that could help me think critically. Critical think\u00ad ing and skepticism live in anorher world from mine\u2014they live 48 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER across a chasm where no bridge and no safe passages exist. It wasn't until I became a citizen of the Web that I was able to undertake the harrowing journey across that chasm and land, finally, on solid ground. How did a card-carrying, aura-wearing, chakra-toting leader of the New Age become able to understand and even\u00ad tually embrace the skeptical culture? Well, it took quite a while, so let me start at the beginning. I first encountered the New Age in 1971, when I was ten years old. My mother had been experiencing numerous arthritic symptoms that just weren't responding to medical care, and she was headed for a wheelchair. Somehow, she found a yoga class, and slowly, she became well again. She also became a vegetarian (which was very avant garde at the time) and we began frequenting health food stores in search of unusual things like whole grain cookies, cod-liver oil, and bean sprouts. Our lives changed very swiftly, especially after Mom became a yoga teacher herself and entered more fully into the metaphysical/New Age culture. Yoga has been jokingly called the \"gateway drug\" to the New Age. That was certainly true for us. Our family fell apart over this massive change (though my par\u00ad ents' marriage was rocky anyway), as my father was and still is a skep\u00ad tic with a strong intellect and good native training in scientific and critical thought processes. One of my brothers, who is now a mathe\u00ad matics professor, joined with my father, while the rest of us kids (four total) went along in our own ways with my mother's interest in metaphysics, spirituality, and the New Age. We switched from conventional medicine to homeopathic care, learned to meditate, and joined groups that listened to supposedly \"channeled\" beings\u2014we became a part of the \"in\" crowd. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, and went to high school in Marin County (the epicenter of the New Age explosion of the seventies and eighties), so I was surrounded at all times by unusual people and experiences. It was a fun and often exciting time, and though I much preferred the magical world my mother showed us to the mundane world my father defended, I was always a very bright and skeptical person. Even in my early teens, I was able to see right through ques\u00ad tionable things like est, Scientology, breatharianism, urine drinking, and the really dangerous cults\u2014yet that same skep\u00ad ticism and intelligence actually helped me validate other unusual experiences (of which I had many). I knew many psy\u00ad chics and alternative healers who seemed to be very good at what they did, and I directly experienced healings and psychic readings that I couldn't logically refute. In that period, it would have been wonderful to come upon skeptical and critical thinking techniques, but alas, crit\u00ad ical thinking wasn't taught in my high school. I didn't even know the category existed! When I went to junior college, I took geometry and logic for my critical thinking courses and thus I missed out on the subject once again. In my education, I didn't gain the skills I needed to help me understand what was occurring when New Age and metaphysical ideas and techniques seemed to work. My empirical experience \"proved\" the validity of things like psychic skills, auras, chakras, contact with the dead, astrology, and the like\u2014and I had very little in my intellectual arsenal at that time to help me understand what was truly occurring. For instance, an understanding of cold reading would have helped me a great deal. I never knew what cold reading was, and until I saw professional magician and debunker Mark Edward use cold reading on an ABC News special last year, I didn't understand that I had long used a form of cold read\u00ad ing in my own work! I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone\u2014I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis. To be fair, a skeptical move\u00ad ment did arise during my early teens, but it unfortunately created a deep cultural rift that continues to this day. In the seventies, Uri Geller became popular. My first real contact with someone in the skeptical culture was watching James Randi on television, just tearing Geller to bits. I didn't understand what was happening. Uri Geller appeared on the Mike Douglas show and on the Merv Griffin show, and you could clearly see him perform his paranormal feats right there on television. Surely Mike and Merv wouldn't be involved in lying to the public? I really did\u00ad n't understand what Randi's problem was with Geller, and my friends and I thought Randi was very vitriolic. I didn't learn about critical thinking from Randi\u2014what I learned was that some people just had it in for healers and people witJi paranor\u00ad mal gifts. I know he would not like to hear this, but it's still true: James Randi's behavior and demeanor were so culturally insensitive that he actually created a gigantic backlash against skepticism, and a gigantic surge toward the New Age that still rages unabated. I certainly understand and support James Randi's anger, frustration, and even vitriol now (especially after having lived SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 49 through the New Age for so many decades), but all I could see then was a very sarcastic man who seemed to attack Geller per\u00ad sonally. Now, after having been a regular visitor to Randi's Web site (www.randi.org), I can see him as a deeply caring man who works tirelessly for an important cause. I also see that he is very concerned about some of the unbalanced New Agers who write to him in barely legible missives. I empathize with Randi, because people like that write to me, too (though I take on the role of hero in their fevered fantasy lives, while Randi is treated as a villain). Now that I can see him as an individual and under\u00ad stand his culture, I can see James Randi as the excellent (and intense) man he is\u2014but it took me a while. Had Randi under\u00ad stood the New Age culture back when Uri Geller was becom\u00ad ing popular, he could have easily spoken in a way that might have been heard\u2014or at least in a way that wouldn't have caused such a violent backlash. Or perhaps I'm being too idealistic. I certainly didn't understand the skeptical culture until I spent real time considering it as a culture\u2014and I know from my reading that most people in the skeptical culture don't understand the New Age culture at all. As a result, the yelling between our cultures just becomes louder while the real communication falls into the chasm that divides us. You see, I've been speaking to people in this New Age cul\u00ad ture in their own language, and though I certainly was heard, I don't think that, in the end, I really did any good. Growing up as I did in nutty, kooky Marin County, I was able to see some of the most egregious examples of New Age chicanery\u2014 and as I matured into a writer and healer, I always warned against them. The problem is this: In my culture, you can't openly attack anyone or their character, and you can't use truly focused skepticism. In my culture, personal attacks are consid\u00ad ered an example of emotional imbalance (where your emo\u00ad tions control you), while deep skepticism is considered a form of mental imbalance (where your intellect controls you). Both behaviors are serious cultural no-nos, because both the emo\u00ad tions and the intellect are considered troublesome areas of the psyche that do very litde but keep one away from the (sup\u00ad posedly) true and meaningful realm of spirit. When I wrote my books and recorded my audio programs, I had to write and speak so carefully that it took most people two or three read\u00adings to figure out that I was direcdy challenging many of the foundations upon which the New Age is built. Actually, my culturally sensitive capacity to attack without attacking and criticize without criticizing was so effective that some avid readers still don't know what 1 was saying. From a vantage point outside the New Age culture, my cul\u00ad ture's disavowal of emotions and the intellect may seem very strange and nearly inexplicable. Nevertheless, it is a very real cul\u00ad tural component that must be understood and considered if any useful communication is going to occur. If we want to success\u00ad fully communicate with someone, we've got to understand not just their language, but the cultural context from which their lan\u00ad guage springs. From what I've seen in both the New Age and the skeptical cultures, this understanding is absent. I certainly didn't understand the skeptical culture until I spent real time consider\u00ad ing it as a culture\u2014and I know from my reading that most peo\u00ad ple in the skeptical culture don't understand the New Age culture at all. As a result, the yelling between our cultures just becomes louder while the real communication falls into the chasm that divides us. In all the din, people in my culture hear what they deem to be hyper-intellectual and emotionally charged attacks upon their cherished beliefs, while people in your culture hear what they deem to be wishful thinking, scientific illiter\u00ad acy, and emotionally charged salvos in defense of mere delusions. This is of course a tragedy, but after reading through the skeptical literature for the last three years, I feel that this tragedy may be avoidable. I understand your cul\u00ad ture now, and I understand the concern, care, and interest you have for the people in my culture. I'm now able to read past text I once considered inflammatory and see the dedication behind it\u2014not just your dedica\u00ad tion to competent research and information- gathering, but your dedication to clear communication. I see your faith in human intelligence, your anger about swindlers and charlatans, your open-minded ability to question author\u00ad ity and accepted wisdom, and your willingness to fight to fur\u00ad ther a cause close to your heart. My favorite people in the New Age culture share these same qualities. I feel that people in your culture are capable of reaching out to my culture in sen\u00ad sitive ways that will have a chance of being heard\u2014because it's vital that you are heard. It's vital that a way be found to help people in my culture question, think about, and critically interpret the barrage of information and misinformation they receive on a daily basis. However, it's also vital that the information be culturally sen\u00ad sitive. For instance, the first time I visited the skeptical health care Web site called Quackwatch, it felt as if I were walking into enemy territory. \"Quack\" is a very loaded word\u2014it's a fighting word! Though site owner Dr. Stephen Barrett has every right to call his excellent Web site anything he likes, I 50 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER wonder why it couldn't have been called, for instance, Health Watch, Healinglnfo, DocFacts, or something equally nonthreatening. Why do I have to type the word \"quack\" when I want a skeptical review of the choices I make in med\u00ad ical care? And why do I have to spend so much time translat\u00ad ing on the skeptical sites I visit\u2014or just skipping over words like scam, sham, quack, fraud, dupe, and fool? Why do I (the sort of person who actually needs skeptical information) have to see myself described in offensive terms and bow my head in shame before I can truly access the information available in your culture? I have a selfish reason for asking these questions, because one of my first ideas was to make my own Web site a culturally sensitive portal to the skeptical sites\u2014yet I cannot find a way to do so. I've got a Web page mock-up brewing in my files\u2014a page that I've rewritten maybe fifty times or more\u2014that tries to introduce the concept of skepticism in an open and nonthreaten\u00ad ing way. I'd like to include links to the bril\u00ad liant urban legends site (snopes.com), to Bob Carroll's online Skeptic's Dictionary (skepdic.com), to CSICOP and the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (csicop.org), and to The Skeptic (skeptic.com). I also really wanted to include Quackwatch (quack- watch.org) and James Randi's site (randi.org)\u2014but I just can't find the words. Sure, I can use my site to prepare people for the journey, but I know from experience that they would be in for quite a shock once diey clicked on the links. I mean, it's one thing to find out that much of my culture and belief system was based on gossamer and hearsay, but it's another thing altogether to see people like myself being denigrated and pitied. I found your culture and persevered through die (perhaps unintentionally?) insulting text and the demeaning attitudes because I had a serious need. I had a need to understand the avalanche of New Age ideas, gadgets, meditation techniques, and personalities I encountered as my career gathered momen\u00ad tum. I saw so much as I traveled and spoke to people in my culture, and so much of it worried me that I began to use the Internet to organize diis avalanche and acquaint myself fully with information in my field. It was a harrowing journey, to say die very least. I waded into your culture for much-needed information, and ended up losing my own culture in the process. During the most difficult throes, I joked that I would have had to cheer up to be merely despairing\u2014and that I would have had to calm down to be merely enraged. I'm still working through this. What I see in the tragic dash between die New Age and skeptical cultures is that, for the most part, die skeptics have not yet been able to speak in a way that can be heard. Certainly, neither have people in my culture been able to per\u00ad form that same feat. I see some scientific types working in the New Age culture, trying to prove diat chi exists or prayer works (or whatever it is diey're doing this week). There's an awful lot of scientific jargon all over the New Age now, and while it's sad to see science being bent and mangled by my culture, I have to say that it shows we're listening to you. It shows that we're trying to get it right\u2014to say things in a way you can hear. I know that my culture's sloppy and disre\u00ad spectful use of science is something that angers and confuses many people in the skeptical community, but can we look at it in a different light? People in my culture have heard you and we're trying to answer\u2014but we don't understand you. Our cultural training about the dangers of the intellect makes it nearly impossible for us to utilize science properly\u2014or to identify your intellec\u00ad tual rigor as anything but an unhealthy overuse of the mind. 1 know that sounds silly, but think of the way you view our capacity to dive deeply into matters of spiritual or religious study. You don't often treat our rigor as scholarship, per se (though it takes quite an intellect to understand and organize the often screamingly inconsistent sacred canon)\u2014instead you tend to treat our work as an overabundance of credulity or per\u00ad haps even a stubborn refusal to listen to sense. It is possible that our two warring cultures will never build a bridge across die deep rift that divides us. I know that in my own case, die transition from my culture to yours was long, arduous, and deeply painful. It was not an easy traipse across a well-constructed bridge. In essence, I had to throw myself off a cliff. I had to leave behind my career, my income, my cul\u00ad ture, my family, my friends, my health care practitioners, most of my business contacts, my past, and my future. I say diis not to garner sympadiy bur to show what the leap truly entails. The New Age is a complete culture with its own rules, ideals, infrastructure, and social life. When I finally realized that my cultural training had me teetering on a foundation of can\u00ad dyfloss and dreams\u2014and worse, diat my work had encouraged others to teeter alongside me, I was inconsolable, yet I had absolutely no one to turn to. People in my culture have heard you and we're trying to answer\u2014but we don't understand you. Our cultural training about the dangers of the intellect makes it nearly impossible for us to utilize science properly\u2014or to identify your intellectual rigor as anything but an unhealthy overuse of the mind. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/tune 2004 51 I've made it, I think, through my rage and horror at my own complicity in helping people remain susceptible\u2014and perhaps through my grief and despair (though that's more cyclical) about my own miseducation. Now I'm considering what to do from here. I've discovered in just the few (less than ten) conversations I've had with faith-based people that skeptical information is absolutely threatening and unwanted. What I didn't understand until recendy is that when you start questioning these beliefs, there's a domino effect that eventually smacks into your whole house of cards\u2014and nothing remains standing. Opening the questioning process is a very dangerous thing, and people in my culture seem to understand that on a subconscious level. In response to their extreme discomfort, I've become completely silent around believers\u2014which is hard, because they make up most of my friends, family, and correspondents. If I were in this business for the money, I would have never seriously questioned what I was doing. I would have turned back as soon as my research challenged or threatened me. But I wasn't in it for the money. I was there to help people, often very disturbed people who were trammeling after this cure, that device, these gurus, or those miracle supplements. I tried to help people in my culture make sense of all the ideas and gadgets that were coming at them with such rapidity, but I was unable to make even a dent. When I understood fully that, no matter how good my intentions, the mere mention of things like auras, chakras, and \"energy\" brought with them a host of truly unsafe and untested assumptions\u2014and that I was lead\u00ad ing people into an arena where skepticism and critical think\u00ad ing were forbidden\u2014I knew that it was time to stop, and stop completely. It was a wrenching, isolating, and despair-filled decision, but since my focus is to help others, it was the only ethical or moral shift for me to make. I respectfully ask that you in the skeptical community con\u00ad sider making a similar (though hopefully not so jarring) shift in your behavior and approach to us. I understand now, after years of reading and research, that the skeptical culture exists because of a very real concern for the welfare and well being of others. Of the two cultures, I can honesdy say I now vasdy pre\u00ad fer the skeptical one. However, I know firsthand that the skep\u00ad tical viewpoint cannot be heard or assimilated in the New Age and metaphysical community; it is anathema, and that's a shame for every single one of us. It is a shame because the search for the truth, the concern for the welfare of others, the need to be treated with respect, and the need to be welcomed in a culture\u2014are all things my people share with yours. We have a different language and different references, but we share these basic human needs. I would ask you to respect our humanity, and approach us not as if you are reformers or redeemers. I would ask you to approach us as fellow humans who share your concern and interest in the welfare of others. I would ask you to be as culturally intelligent as you are scien\u00ad tifically intelligent, and to work to understand our culture as clearly as you understand the techniques, ideas, and modalities that have sprung from it. We arc a people, not a problem. I think I have found a way to speak across the chasm, to you. I am now learning to perform that same feat in reverse\u2014 to talk to people in my culture about your culture, but that's a lot harder. I first need a rest, and I need to be in a real school, studying real science and getting a real degree (people in my culture tend to pursue offbeat degrees in offbeat subjects at offbeat schools). Watching people in the New Age has been as hard on me as it has been on you. Underneath all the magic, the wise ghosts, and the never-ending remedies lies a well of pain and loneliness that is immense and overwhelming. 1 always saw it\u2014I always saw the excruciating truth of my cul\u00ad ture, and I thought I could help. That I didn't help\u2014not truly\u2014is possibly the greatest devastation of my life. I need to heal from being a healer. My voice was an important one in my culture; therefore, I've got to take responsibility for what I've done. I need to edu\u00ad cate myself and come back into the fray in a healthy and respectful way. Maybe by the time I've organized my thoughts, a bridging culture will already exist. Maybe I'll find a way to be heard\u2014or to translate the skeptical lexicon in such a way that people in my culture can access it without being insulted or shamed. One thing I'll be sure to stress is the fact that there is actually more beauty, wonder, brilliance, and mystery in sci\u00ad ence than there is in the mystical world. One of the biggest falsehoods I've encountered is that skep\u00ad tics can't tolerate mystery, while New Age people can. This is completely wrong, because it is actually the people in my culture who can't handle mystery\u2014not even a tiny bit of it. Everything in my New Age culture comes complete with an answer, a rea\u00ad son, and a source. Every action, emotion, health symptom, dream, accident, birth, death, or idea here has a direct link to the influence of the stars, chi, past lives, ancestors, energy fields, interdimensional beings, enneagrams, devas, fairies, spirit guides, angels, aliens, karma, God, or the Goddess. We love to say that we embrace mystery in the New Age culture, but that's a cultural conceit and it's utterly wrong. In actual fact, we have no tolerance whatsoever for mystery. Everything from the smallest individual action to the largest movements in the evolution of the planet has a specific meta\u00ad physical or mystical cause. In my opinion, this incapacity to tolerate mystery is a direct result of my culture's disavowal of the intellect. One of the most frightening things about attain\u00ad ing the capacity to think skeptically and critically is that so many things don't have clear answers. Critical thinkers and skeptics don't create answers just to manage their anxiety. Maybe I'll find a way to capitalize on my culture's thirst for answers, and my people's capacity to work with conflicting information (metaphysical ideas change every six months or so and therefore people in my culture are very accustomed to switching mental gears). I have faith now that I didn't have before: faith in your culture's concern and integrity, and faith in my culture's curiosity and capacity to learn new things. I've also learned firsthand that bad training, though damaging, is not a life sentence. I have a lot of work and research to do, but I do see a possi\u00ad bility now that I didn't see before. I want to thank you for your work and your efforts to protect people like me from harm. You make a difference. I hope one day to be able to do the same. 52 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS Fact, Fiction, and Strained Symbolism JOSEPH P. SZIMHART I he Da Vina Code. By Dan Brown. Doubleday, Random House, Inc., New York, 2003. ISBN 0-385-50420-9. 454 pp. Hardcover, $24.95. When I purchased The Da Vinci Code after the New Year arrived in 2004 I was aware that it was a best seller in 2003 (and still is) and that millions of people have read it. Until then I ignored the reviews and had little idea of the con\u00ad tent. Some reviewers early on had said author Dan Brown's research was \"impeccable.\" Brown's editor continues to stand by his man saying that Brown made nothing up save the fictional, con\u00ad temporary story wrapped around sensa\u00ad tional religious controversy. After I browsed through the story initially I realized what I was in for and why all the ensuing critical flack from art histo\u00ad rians, religious scholars, and Catholic apologists. I was about to go on another the-Catholic-Church-has-it-all-wrong, New Age ride. The story begins at night in the Louvre Museum in Paris where an albino monk dressed in a hooded cloak shoots a curator in the stomach. The monk, Silas, is a radical numerary member of the ultra-conservative Opus Dei sect of the Catholic Church. He wears a cilice, a thong that cuts flesh, around his thigh, and he flagellates himself bloody as part of a self-purification cult in accordance Joe Szimhart has been a specialist in cult information for two decades. He also is an artist, and he works in the mental health field. He lives in Douglassville, Pennsyl\u00ad vania. E-mail: jpsz@fast.net. to Opus Dei guidelines. Silas works for someone he knows only as \"the Teacher,\" a wealthy Briton who we later find out is obsessed with finding die Holy Grail of Arthurian legend. The curator happened to be the leader of a secret sea (the Priory of Sion) that hides and protects the Grail and a cache of ancient manu\u00ad scripts that could prove that Jesus Christ had fathered a child. Sarah, widi Mary Magdalene. According to a fringe leg\u00ad end, Mary and her followers as the true Christians fled to France and perhaps England to avoid persecution from Peter and the Apostles. Their \"secret\" and the Jesus bloodline was protected through the centuries via other sects like the Templars. In the novel a conservative Pope has died and a new, liberal leader\u00ad ship in the Vatican emerges, one that would rescind Opus Dei's significant sta\u00ad tus as a prelature. The Teacher, identified at the end as Leigh Teabing the ultra- wealthy Briton, finds a way to manipu\u00ad late the Vatican and Opus Dei to get his hands on the Holy Grail. Sir (he is a Knight) Teabing utilizes the latest in surveillance equipment and extensive research to pin down informa\u00ad tion about the Grail, which he believes should have been revealed. He does not want to be exposed as the one who forces the secret from the Priory, so he devises an elaborate scheme. He convinces the Opus leader, Bishop Aringarosa, that the Grail secret will indeed be revealed, thus creating a catastrophe for Roman Catholicism and wiping out Opus Dei's reason for being. Aringarosa has a secret meeting with Vatican officials who already know about the potential devas\u00ad tating Grail revelation, and they strike a deal. The Vatican pays the Opus leader 20 million euros in Vatican bonds to find the Grail and destroy the evidence. In return Opus would retain its standing and the Church could survive. He con\u00ad vinces the devoted Silas, an outcast all his life, to kill each of the four men who hold the secret after they reveal it. Teabing however plans to get the Grail for himself in the end. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 53 BOOK REVIEWS Enter Robert Langdon, a well- known Harvard professor of religious studies who specializes in symbolism and arcane wisdom. The curator wanted to meet him in Paris, as Langdon had written a manuscript that inadvertently revealed the secret that the curator and only three others held. Before he died on the floor near the Mona Lisa, Sauniere, somehow managed to strip off his clothes, then arrange his body according to a famous Leonardo da Vinci drawing of a naked man in a cir\u00ad cle, \"the Vitruvian Man.\" Sauniere also managed to write some symbols in visible and invisible ink and in his blood on and around his body. Enter Sophie Nevue, a French criminal investigator and code cracker, along with Bezu Fache, the lead French crime investigator. Sophie hap\u00ad pens to be the curators estranged grand\u00ad daughter. Due to the curator's codes and mysterious anagrams created at the crime- scene, Sophie and Robert arc drawn in (so to speak) to solve the murder, and later the Grail mystery. So, if this is mere fiction, why all the fuss? The book inspired a one-hour, ABC-TV news special and rounds of debates as well as reviews that range from praise to vitriol. I think it is because Brown appears to take his thesis seriously: History would be very differ\u00ad ent had Constantine in 325 A.D. and the subsequent Roman Church not excluded certain sex rites, equality for females, and Gnostic texts from the Christian canon\u2014and he appears to back the story with \"facts.\" However, Brown's novel simplistically claims that under Constantine and the Council of Nicea at a single stroke Jesus was made divine. The reality is that the divinity of Christ was never in question among ear\u00adliest Christians despite the fringe sects that derived new meanings and wrote contrary texts. Brown makes it appear that the Church really did destroy almost all evidence of the truth about Jesus. Brown's primary characters also explain to Sophie how the Churchmen executed over 5 million witches (pagans) and suppressed the sacred feminine principle purportedly valued by Leonardo and other initiates of a god\u00ad dess-based or sun-worshipping pagan cult. Brown does claim at the beginning of the book that \"All descriptions of art\u00ad work, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\" Derivative would have been more accu\u00ad rate than accurate. We do not have to search far to find some of Brown's sources, as he mentions them within the didactic or preachy seg\u00ad ments in the plot. Among his primary sources are: Holy Blood and Holy Grail by M. Baigent, R. Leigh, and H. Lincoln; The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince; and The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail by Margaret Starbird. Scholars have found insurmountable flaws in all these books, books that are highly speculative but with New Age appeal. A book not men\u00ad tioned. Daughter of God by Lewis Perdue (2000), is close enough in plot and content that there has been legal accusation of plagiarism against Brown by Perdue. I read the Perdue book also, and 1 do find significant similarities. Perdue identifies over thirty \"elements.\" However, if you want more thrills and shoot-em-ups, read Daughter of God Criticism from the Catholic front comes from Sandra Miesel, a medievalist in \"Dismantling The Da Vinci Code\" (Crisis, September 1, 2003). Miesel states, \"So error laden is The Da Vinci Code that the educated reader actually applauds those rare occasions where Brown stumbles (despite himself) into the truth.\" Brown's book presents Leonardo's most famous painting, the Mona Lisa, as far more esoteric than the fine, idealized portrait of the lady LA Giaconda appears. Brown's hero, Langdon, finds androgy\u00ad nous symbolism derived from an inter\u00ad pretation of seeming inconsistencies in the landscape behind the figure, and he argues that Mona Lisa is \"an anagram of the divine union of male and female.\" In effect, Brown creates a mockery of Leonardo's intent as an experimental artist. A pentagram (or star) that appears on the dead curator (drawn in his own blood) indicates to Langdon, the sym\u00ad bolist, that Sophie's grandfather knew a code Leonardo used to indicate the sacred feminine eschewed by the Roman Church. Leonardo allegedly inserted as a kind of subtext subliminal signals about the \"goddess\" and the female principle, about sun worship and pagan truths. In my view Leonardo's aesthetic use of geometry transcended any mere refer\u00ad ence to goddess worship\u2014-his was a sci\u00ad entific as well as an aesthetic approach to beauty, not a devious one. Leonardo may not have been the ideal Catholic (Brown's book notes that he was homo\u00ad sexual), but he certainly was not the con\u00ad niving occultist described by Brown. According to biographers Antonina Vallentin and Vasari, at the end of his life Leonardo reconciled with the Catholic Church, took communion, and lamented that \"he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.\" The novel pivots on the pentagram as a feminist marker, and our heroes are off on a whirlwind detective excursion while running for their lives. The French police initially target Langdon as the prime suspect. During their flight from Fache and the police Langdon and Sophie meet with Leigh Teabing, The book inspired a one-hour, ABC-TV news special and rounds of debates as well as reviews that range from praise to vitriol. 54 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS apparendy an ally, at his sumptuous villa where he shows diem a large reproduc\u00ad tion of Leonardo's famous mural. The Last Supper. Wrongly, the novel wants us to believe that the mural represents the moment that Jesus instituted the Eucharist rite, but Leonardo illustrated John 13:21 when Jesus warns, \"One of you will betray me.\" Teabing, die Grail expert, points to the lack of a central chalice in the design as proof diat the Grail is not a material cup. He goes on, with Langdon's acquiescence, to point to a \"V shape between an Apostle to Jesus' right and Jesus as a sym\u00ad bol of die female. He identifies that apos\u00ad de as Mary Magdalene, not the Apostle John who art historians see. Indeed, Leonardo painted John as young and effeminate, but diis was a convention that developed before and during the Renaissance. And one has to ask, if that is Mary, where is John? There are only thir\u00ad teen figures. Teabing also claims that diere is a disembodied hand with a knife (next to Judas) while St. Peter is posed with his left hand in a cutting gesture at the pur\u00ad ported Mary's throat. He says Leonardo wanted to indicate diat the Church had cut off Mary Magdalene as die chosen leader of Christ's church. A transfixed Sophie can only think, \"This is the woman who single-handedly could crumble the Church?\" Mary with her bloodline is the Holy Grail, the womb that held the seed of Jesus. What I see is that Judas obscures Peter in Leonardo's composition, so that Peter's right hand appears awkwardly with the knife, but his left is merely rest\u00ad ing as a caution on St. John's shoulder as John leans an ear toward Peter. The composition rests on two \"W\" shapes that contain four sets of Apostles with Jesus in a pivotal, central pose. If you want to find feminine V shapes you can find many, but you can find nary a Mary. LInfortunately. this may be the novel's weakest lecture, yet it contains the key to the Magdalene/Jesus union around which the entire quest revolves. Brown interprets die evidence in The Last Supper much like an astrologer interprets a horoscope for a client. I once studied astrology and could cast a horoscope in any of several systems. Astrology as a science is completely baseless and unreliable for character analysis to a fault, but astrologers, like good salesmen, can be very convincing, especially if you show interest in their product. Invariably, most folks who want a reading are easily impressed because the astrologer's product is the client's character and fate. We are all interested in ourselves and we will find many \"hits\" or accurate statements in almost any reading (unless you happen to be an informed skeptic). Sophie is very impressed with her experts, Langdon and Teabing, she is in unfamil\u00ad iar territory, and she has an emotional need to support her dead grandfather. Naturally, she comes up with an affir\u00ad mative response. Brown's novel wants us to believe that Leonardo played occult tricks like this on the Church through his many, many lucrative Church com\u00ad missions, when he had only one that was not even completed. The novel claims that Leonardo da Vinci was a Grand Master of the secre\u00ad tive Priory of Sion as were Victor Hugo and the twentieth century French artist Jean Cocteau. There is no evidence that they or Leonardo were members; the Priory of Sion is essentially a new reli\u00ad gious movement that appeared after World War II. It announced its existence in 1962 after formally establishing itself in 1956. This new Priory has no con\u00ad nection to the Order or Abbey of Sion of the Middle Ages as the book claims as \"fact\" on the opening page. The Abbey group was dissolved by King Louis XIII of France by 1619 with die premises turned over to the Jesuits. The Order of Sion disappeared from history according to a Time Watch BBC (1996) program, \"The History of a Mystery.\" Brown states that the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris \"discovered parchments known as Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying numer\u00ad ous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo and Leonardo ...\" as one of his \"facts.\" A fact Brown does not mention is that the new Priory sect leader, the huckster Pierre Plantard, along with an accomplice deposited die Dossiers Secrets into the Bibliotheque. The parchments were fakes all along, as exposed on the same BBC program mentioned above. As for Jean Cocteau (1889-1963), I have a translation of an interesting auto\u00ad biographical book by him called Opium: The Diary of a Cure. Cocteau wrote the journal account liberally illus\u00ad trated in his surrealistic style in 1929 while in treatment for \"opium poison\u00ad ing\" at an asylum in France. Cocteau was a brilliant filmmaker and writer who apparently never gave up opium. The Da Vinci Code states on page 327 that Jean Cocteau was Grand Master of the Priory of Sion from 1918-1963. The Brown book also claims that Victor Hugo was Grand Master from 1844-1885. Cocteau in Opium says, \"Victor Hugo was a madman who believed himself to be Victor Hugo.\" Awkward for Dan Brown, is all I can say. A few final words about mistakes: Opus Dei members do not wear monk's robes. Brown's albino, Silas, apparently sees very well without lenses\u2014highly unusual for someone with albinism. Brown's hero, Langdon, states, \"Ori\u00ad ginally, Tarot had been devised as a secret means to pass along ideologies banned by die Church\" (p. 92). Tarot playing cards (and diey were playing cards, not magical texts used by initiates) arrived in Europe from the Middle East in the fifteenth cen\u00ad tury. The occult Tarot, the progenitor of current Tarot decks, appeared and devel\u00ad oped singularly in France between 1780 and 1880. There is nothing ancient about the occult Tarot and diey hid nothing from the Churchmen who understood very well what they were about (see A Wicked Pack of Cards: The Origins of the Occult Tarot by R. Decker, T. DePaulis, and M. Dummett, 1996). The number of poor souls condemned and executed by the Catho\u00ad lic Inquisitors is not \"five million\" as Brown's book claims. Scholars today set the number between 30,000 and 90,000, with most splitting the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 55 BOOK REVIEWS difference. And to drive one last stake into Brown's grail myth, the Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln claim that \"holy blood\" means \"holy grail\" originates with his fifteenth-century Le Morte D'Athur. Holy Grail should have been le saint graal and not San great. Unfortunately, Brown has his \"Teacher\" proclaim on page 250, \"The word Sangreal derives from San Greal\u2014or Holy Grail.\" And, \"Sang Real literally meant Royal Blood.\" Brown's Langdon criticizes Christians who would take the Bible \"literally.\" Yet, in the end, we find Langdon kneeling in awe at the Louvre at die entry pyramid. He finally \"knows\" where the bones of Mary Magdalene are buried, and perhaps with die cache of secret manuscripts that would crumble the Christian Church. Talk about literal. When pressed to reveal the secret, Langdon argues that he would not \"wave the flag\" of evidence in the faces of the millions of deluded souls who believe that Buddha was born of a lotus blossom, or Jesus of a literal virgin. \"Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical.\" He would not expose the truth because \"Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality. And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people.\" There's more to his argument, but the gist of it is that we should let sleeping dogs lie\u2014I intend the pun\u2014 and not throw them any Magdalene bones. The Da Vinci Code is a decent thriller if the reader is unaware of (or manages to suspend) the reality that undermines the story. Are You Sure About That? PETER LAMAL 8 Preposterous Propositions: From the Genetics of Homosexuality to the Benefits of Global Warming. By Robert Ehrlich. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 2003. ISBN 0-691- 09999-5. 342 pp. Hardcover, $27.95. Intelligent design is a scientific alter\u00ad native to evolution: True or false? Okay, well how about this: You really do not have to worry about your choles\u00ad terol. How confident are you in your answer, and what is the basis for your confidence? The two above propositions are in the set of eight that Ehrlich con\u00ad siders. His purpose is to help us decide which of the eight \"might be true and which are complete nonsense,\" based on the weight of the evidence for and against each. Ehrlich chose these particular propositions because they are controver\u00ad sial and because they have important public policy implications. At the end of each chapter he gives the proposition a rating according to how well the case for it has been made. His rating scale is based on the \"flakiness\" of each proposition. Zero flakes means \"a reasonable degree of Peter Lamal is emeritus professor of psychol\u00ad ogy at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and a Fellow of the Division of Behavior Analysis of the American Psychological Association. E-mail: plamal@carolina. rr. com. confidence that the idea is true based on the evidence, to four flakes, meaning no credible evidence for the idea.\" Ehrlich acknowledges that his ratings are subjec\u00ad tive and influenced by his biases, but says that he will reveal any biases he has. Of course, we can have biases of which we are unaware. The introductory chapter includes questions that we should ask when con\u00ad sidering controversial ideas: How do the proponents of the idea claim to know that it is true? How might the data said to support the idea be interpreted differ\u00ad ently? How can the idea be tested? We are also wisely cautioned against making up our minds too quickly when considering controversial or new proposi\u00ad tions. As Ehrlich points out, if we decide about the validity of a proposition too quickly, we can fall into the trap of filter\u00ad ing all relevant evidence through our pre\u00ad conceived view while failing to give con\u00ad trary evidence sufficient weight. \"That trap is the very essence of prejudice.\" The introductory chapter also includes a useful set of questions to ask when presented with claims of causality by proponents of a proposition, as well as a note on statistical significance. Ehrlich's approach is nicely illustrated in his chapter devoted to the proposition that cholesterol is harmless, advocated by the Swedish physician Uffe Ravnskov. Ravnskov challenges the view, almost universally held by the medical establish\u00ad ment, that high levels of cholesterol in the blood cause coronary heart disease (CHD). Furthermore, Ravnskov believes that high levels of blood cholesterol have little relation to your intake of saturated fats or cholesterol. He also does not believe that arteries are blocked as a result of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Ehrlich presents data from Ravnskov and others and then evaluates the evi\u00ad dence. Ravnskov, for example, has pre\u00ad sented data showing a weak positive cor\u00ad relation (0.39) between age-adjusted mortality from CHD and percentage of fat in the diet across twenty-two coun\u00ad tries. Ehrlich points out, however, that the idea that there are many other vari\u00ad ables besides dietary fat that must be taken into account when considering CHD is hardly surprising. At the same time, however, Ehrlich says that \"Ravnskov is largely correct regarding the lack of hard evidence linking a high-cho\u00ad lesterol diet and heart disease.\" Further on, Ehrlich lists six arguments Ravnskov advances to support his view and offers a rebuttal of each. Ehrich concludes the chapter by say\u00ad ing that Ravnskov has presented some 56 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS convincing data that dietary cholesterol and fat do not, by themselves, have a very significant effect on blood cholesterol and on the risk of CHD. But he says that Ravnskov does not seem to have made his case that cholesterol level is not a significant risk factor for CHD. Ehrlich rates the proposition that high cholesterol is not worth worrying about at two flakes. The other propositions that Ehrlich considers are indicated by their chapter titles: \"Is Homosexuality Primarily Innate?\", \"Are People Getting Smarter \"Can We Influence Matter by Thought Alone?\", \"Should You Worry About Global Warming?\", \"Is Complex Life in the Universe Very Rare?,\" and \"Can a Sugar Pill Cure You?\" Ehrlich impressively covers a wide range of topics, and we are once again reminded of die tentative nature of many assertions made about the world. When discussing the characteristics of theories that are scientific, Ehrlich says mat \"falsi- fiability is die most important of the cri\u00adteria\" used to judge whether a given the\u00ad ory is scientific. But when discussing SETI, he says that its unfalsifiability does not render it nonscientific because \"researchers might actually find a signal.\" This example illustrates the contemporary doubt concerning the weight that should be accorded the Popperian falsifiability criterion. 1 believe the vast majority of the readers of this book will learn a good deal, even if they disagree with some of Ehrlich's conclusions. Darwin as Comic Book Super-Hero JERRY KURLANDSKI The Sandwalk Adventures. By Jay Hosier. 0-9677255-1-8. 160 pp. $20. Jay Hosier begins his graphic novel The Sandwalk Adventures with a parody of a creation myth. Like all parodies, this one extracts the essence of the thing being parodied\u2014just enough to make it recognizable\u2014and presents this essence in an unexpected context. Here we learn soon enough die context of this particular creation myth: it belongs to a colony of follicle mites residing in Charles Darwin's left eyebrow, and refers back many mite-generations to the time when Darwin made his five-year voyage on die HMS Beagle. The Sandwalk Adventures is a historo- scientific comic book, if such a genre exists. As a comic book, it relates an amusing series of conversations berween Darwin and one of the aforementioned mites, a young female named Mara.

Hosier is a well- published biologist on staff at Juniata College in Pennsylvania. As a reader, you sense that he's had to introduce the theory With its clever drawings and engaging style, it should appeal to the specialist as well as the lay person. much older than she and her fellow mites traditionally believed. Much of the fun of the comic book side of the novel occurs when Hosier lampoons die other mites who\u2014against all evidence\u2014cling to a literal interpretation of their myths. Mara is a curious creature, and she wants to know the true answers to the questions that her colony's myths attempt to resolve. When Flycatcher begins explaining his notions of die origin of the to students many rimes, and, in so doing, he's figured out how to present it in an interesting manner without sacrificing accuracy. A reader well-versed in the the\u00ad ory is unlikely to learn much from Hosier's exposition in the graphic novel part of the book, but at the back there is a lengthy annotations section providing details that cannot be served in a comic book format. This section also contains a good deal of biographical information on Darwin, thus fulfilling the book's diird main function. Some graphic novels manage to fuse text and drawing into a distinct art form; The Sandwalk Adventures is not one of them. Hosier is first and foremost a biologist, not an artist. Still, his work is entirely competent, and often witty, as when he visually puns on the well-known \"March of Progress.\" His previous graphic novel, Clan Apis, received a number of awards and nomi\u00ad nations, including a 1998 Xeric Award. The Sandwalk Adventures is an odd but cohesive amalgamation of the absurd and the scholarly. The book pro\u00ad vides an informative, always-entertain\u00ad ing look into the theory of natural selec\u00ad tion and the man who first formulated it. With its clever drawings and engag\u00ad ing style, it should appeal to the special\u00ad ist as well as the lay person. Because we live in a time and place in which Darwinism seems to losing rather than gaining public acceptance, perhaps this book, and more like it, could help to reverse the tide.

The book analyzes the Wedge Strategy's threat to public education and to the separation of church and state. Magnificent Mars. Ken Croswell. Free Press. 210 pp. $60. hardcover. With Mars all over the news now, this beautifully illustrated large- format book with good scientific text comes along at just the right time. The large color photo\u00ad graphs of Mars from a host of Mars-orbiting spacecraft through 2003\u2014and useful color graphics\u2014 put into fine perspective the close-up photos from the surface we arc now receiving from this year from the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The Science of Good and Evil. Michael Shermer. Times Books/Henry Holt, 2004. 351 pp. $26 , hardcover. The author of Why People Believe Weird Things here turns to the question of why people cheat, gossip, care, share, and follow the Golden Rule. The essential ques\u00ad tions of good and evil have occupied people for cen\u00ad turies, but here Shermer draws upon more tionary psycholo\u00ad gists, biochemists, and anthropolo\u00ad gists to instigate a search into the roots of morality and the evolution of our complex ethical sys\u00ad tems. Science, he shows, has a lot to tell us about good and evil. Whatever Happened to Good and Evil? Russ Shafer-Landau. Oxford University Press, 2004. 150 pp. $26, softcover. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, we have seen a resurgence of the language of good 58 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and evil and a comfort with the idea that some moral standards are objective (true independently of what anyone happens to think of them). In this book, Shafer Landau (professor of philosophy, University of Wisconsin) argues that\u2014contrary to much faddish relativist thinking\u2014some moral views art better than others, despite the sin\u00ad cerity of the individuals, cultures, and soci\u00ad eties that endorse diem. Some moral views are true, others false. Individuals, and whole societies, he says, can be seriously mistaken when it comes to morality. This introduction to such ethical questions is written especially for general readers with no philosophical background. Invitation to the Sociology of Religion. Phil Zuckerman. Routledge, 2003. 156 pp., S21.95. softcovcr. This brief guide to the sociology of religion by one of the contribu\u00ad tors to our March/April 2004 Science & Religion issue (an assistant professor of soci\u00ad ology, Pitzer University) is far livelier than its title might suggest. Zuckerman confesses that, unlike most irreligious people, he is fas\u00ad cinated by religion. \"Religion is a personal fixation. I wonder how it is that millions of people can believe the manifestly implausi\u00ad ble. I wonder how it is that millions of peo\u00ad ple can devote their lives to, and even die for, ili.ii which is ultimately irrational. ... I am ceaselessly inter\u00ad ested in the connec\u00ad tion of religion to the arts, to politics, to sex, to war, to ethics, to race rela\u00ad tions, to the media, to general construc\u00ad tion, to family, to law....\" He begins by noting tliat reli\u00ad gion seems to be everywhere. \"Some days it feels like the whole world is reli\u00ad gious.\" (That is true, except in Western Europe.) His guide seems especially relevant now with all the recent popular interest and argumentation about Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ. Everyday Mind Reading: Understanding What Other People Think and Feel. William Ickes. Prometheus Books, 2003. 349 pp. S25. hardcover. The title doesn't ver_y d refer to the outrageous antics of \"psychic readers,\" but to the natural human abilities that we often call intuition or empadiy. The author (professor of psychology, University of Texas at Arlington) has been studying such matters for fifteen years, and this is his summary of that research. He devel\u00ad oped an innovative video-based procedure for measuring people's empathic inferences and used the proce\u00ad dures to study differ\u00ad ent aspects of everyday mind reading. He ex\u00ad plores the validity of the belief in women's intuition, why twins have similar thoughts and feelings, and broader questions such as, are there ways of detecting when someone has a hidden agenda? And how research on every\u00ad day mind reading can be applied to improving parenting skills, improving counseling, or even sales and marketing. \u2014Kendrick Frazier wiiham tch.es, ph.d.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 59 FORUM Let's Beat Them at Their Own Game PAUL GILES By profession I'm a comedy writer. By nature I'm a skeptic. You might wonder why I men\u00ad tion both together. In many ways the two are the same thing. In order for me to do my job I've got to be able to pick out the hypocrisies, inconsistencies, and contradictions in people and situations and point them out in an entertaining way. Okay, basically my job description is wise ass, but it's something for which I now get paid instead of getting sent to the principal's office. Skeptics also look for inconsistencies and contradictions. A perfect example is the oxymoron creation science. But here die analogy runs into trouble. This was highlighted by the two articles in the November/December 2003 issue of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, Chris Mooney's \"King of the Paranormal\" and Bryan Farha's \"Sylvia Browne: TV Psychic Sidesteps Challenges.\" Mooney makes the point that Larry King and his producers air quite a few shows that portray psychics and the paranormal in a favorable light. He then goes on to blame ratings as die reason much more time is devoted to psychics than to skeptics, asking, \"[Sjhould rat\u00ad ings alone dictate the treatment of the paranormal on a television network like CNN?\" Good question. Only there are two things wrong with it. First, dubbing King a \"true lion of journalism\" overstates his place in the Paul Giles is a comedy writer. He wrote 'Unintelligent Design\" in our November/ December 2002 issue. profession. King is known for asking easy questions of all his guests, rarely following up even when a challenge is clearly called for, and usually not press\u00ad ing for answers. It's called throwing soft- balls, and King allows them to be batted over the center field wall like they were tossed underhand to Barry Bonds. It's the style of almost all his interviews. He's the kind of guy whose first question to Adolph Hitler would be, \"You wanted to be an artist when you were young, didn't you?\" Larry King Live is not a news show in the conventional sense, and just because it's on CNN doesn't mean it's going to aspire to the same journalistic standards as that net\u00ad work's other programming. Second, asking if ratings should dic\u00ad tate treatment is not the question we need to ask. It's a fact that ratings drive everything in the entertainment and news industries, and quite frankly it's hard to see why they shouldn't. Television needs to make money. Putting low-rated shows on the air makes no sense from a business stand\u00ad point. No. The question should be, \"Why are ratings so high for King's shows on the paranormal, and why doesn't he give skeptics equal time?\" As someone who's worked in the entertainment world, writing for televi\u00ad sion, radio, and too many comedians, I'd like to answer that. Much as I hate to say it, die psychics are a hell of a lot more entertaining dian we are. The psychics not only tell people what they want to hear, tiiey clearly and confidendy provide \"answers\" to diose seeking comfort and advice. They are personable and charming and every\u00ad thing necessary to promote confidence and rapport with people in an age of media saturation. They wouldn't be in business if they were crabby introverts who didn't care if people liked them. We, on the other hand, when given the opportunity for rebuttal in the media, come off looking like crabby introverts who don't care whcdier peo\u00ad ple like us. We provide no answers, always hedge our statements to appear fair, and counter demonstrations of psy\u00ad chic \"skills\" with the standard retort: Science hasn't been able to prove the existence of you-fill-in-thc-blank. We're everyone's Dad who says, \"You can't go to the party,\" and when asked why, replies, \"Because I said so, that's why.\" The average person doesn't really care what science has proven or disproven. Most of their contact with scientific thought comes from newspaper and television pieces on the foods they eat. They know that last week margarine was healthier than butter, but this week but\u00ad ter is heairJiier than margarine, eating a high-fiber diet will or won't prevent colon cancer (depending to whom you talk to), and foods high in fat make you fat, unless you eat nodiing but high-fat proteins on the Atkins diet, in which case they'll make you skinny. All that comes from men and women in white coats with a lot of alphabet soup after rJieir names who speak for science. Wouldn't you be confused? The psychics and speakers to die dead are never confused and never disagree. 60 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER They don't change their minds every two weeks, only their specialties, depending on what ability is hot at the moment. In many instances they call on the long, unbroken traditions of things like tarot cards and astrology, which by dieir stay\u00ad ing power lend an air of credibility. The average person doesn't understand that changing theories to explain new infor\u00ad mation is a much better tradition. But why can't we be as certain of our\u00ad selves outside of our own publications and circles. Mooney mentioned the Showtime series Penn and Teller: Bullshit! When I watched the first episode I practically stood on my chair cheering. They not only presented an air of confidence in their disdain for the paranormal and provided easy-to- understand damning evidence, they were entertaining. Can we say that? In all honesty, and putting aside our own pos\u00ad itive biases toward the people who rep\u00ad resent the skeptical view, can we con\u00ad tend that our message is presented to the average person in a way that it is not only convincing but interesting? Remember, in the pages of SI we're preaching to the choir, and a rather small choir it is. The forces of irrational\u00ad ity are the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, but we're a trio singing in the subway working to be heard over the roar of the passing trains. Where Penn Jillette called people like John Edward \"scum\" and \"liars\" and other names less printable, the most we seem to muster in the general media is a little playground taunting. \"Oh yeah? Prove it!\" They don't have to. Remem\u00ad ber, they have all the \"answers.\" They're believable. They're entertaining and sympathetic. Belief in their powers is a matter of faith, which to the believer is beyond proving. Penn and Teller have the right idea. Attack but be entertaining. Show how the tricks are done in the popular media. Ridicule and be amusing. A lot of my job is doing that and it works. People are more open to your ideas if instead of preaching the scientific gospel you point out the inconsistencies of the paranor\u00ad mal in such a way that those people think they're in on the joke. Which brings me to Farha's piece. A great deal is made of Sylvia Browne's performance on the September 3, 2001, Larry King Live show. He presents us with a transcript of a reading Browne gave while James Randi, the other guest on the show, watched and listened. He then reproduces Randi's analysis of her reading which Randi placed on his Web site. It's a good analysis. Unfortunately it's too little too late. I saw that show. At every point in the reading I could tell how she did it. I heard her get the diagnosis entirely wrong, pick up the correct answer from the caller, twist around her misses to make them seem like hits, and a number of other things not mentioned in the article or on Randi's Web site. When King asked Randi to explain Browne's SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2004 61 seeming prescience, I gleefully antici\u00ad pated his taking her to task point by point, which would have made her look ridiculous to an audience of millions. I waited, but that bus never came. Randi's response? \"Larry, you're asking me to explain specific things. I don't know who this woman is who called.\" So? He didn't have to explain specific things, just the obvious wrong answers and fishing expeditions. He didn't have to know who the woman was. Who she was would have been relevant only if Browne got everything right. Radier than the triumph this episode is implied to be, it was a disaster. Once again, dur\u00ading the entire show, Browne had all the \"answers,\" and Randi didn't try to explain a thing. He sounded arrogant and above it all. There were so many opportunities to make her look foolish and for Randi to be positive and enter\u00ad taining, and all of them were wasted. I'm not saying we should all be comedians when it comes to promoting the skeptical view. I'm saying that we'll get more on-air time when people write to shows like Larry King Live and say, \"I'd like to see more of that skeptic guy. I liked h\\m. He knew what he was talk\u00ad ing about.\" I'm saying Penn and Teller got an entire series of entertaining shows by going on the offensive outside die radier small world of skeptical media, doing it without fear of legal action because they knew they could easily prove, as we can, that paranormal pow\u00ad ers are the province of the self-deluded and the con artist. I'm saying let's not be so self-satisfied that we feel exposes in our own publications seep into the con\u00ad sciousness of the masses. Let's appear on these shows prepared and ready to argue our points without qualifiers. That's when we'll get equal time. Let's beat the Brownes and Edwardses at their own game. We're smarter than them. Let's prove it. ummer ion 88!

Hoyt concerning anti-vaccinationism, focus\u00ad ing on the pertussis vaccine (\"Anti- Vaccination Fever,\" January/February 2004). One peripheral point to mention is that the pertussis vaccine currently used no longer causes the annoying but transitory reactions that gave credence to the idea that serious reactions are associated with the vaccine. More important, this is not an isolated example of the unfortunate effects of anti- vaccinationism. Great Britain is now suffer\u00ad ing outbreaks of measles, rubella, and mumps because of unfounded accusations by a British gastroenterologist thai the com\u00ad bined vaccine causes autism. Authorities in northern Nigeria have resisted oral polio vac\u00ad cine because of rumors started by a British journalist that AIDS is the result of contam\u00ad inated vaccines. In both cases, abundant evi\u00ad dence negates the connection, but once ideas like those start to circulate, they enter into folklore and arc difficult to extirpate. It gives one little comfort to reflect that anti-vaccinationism is as old as vaccines themselves or to understand that once a dis\u00ad ease disappears due to vaccination, people begin to doubt that they need it. The para\u00ad dox is that in much of the world, vaccines are badly wanted but unavailable, while in developed countries they are often attacked. Stanley A Plotkin, M.D. Doylestown, Pennsylvania The Netherlands had a measles epidemic only three years ago among people who do not vaccinate because of their extremely con\u00adservative Protestant religion. They do not question the efficacy of vaccination, but they consider it sinful. There were 3,000 cases of illness and three fatalities. One of the fatalities was a seventeen-year- old boy on die island of Walcheren. After such a case, the vaccination percentages increase mysteriously and the epidemic ends. This same area was also hit by a polio epidemic some ten years ago. These people live in close- knit communities with little contact with the outside world. They have a separate high school, and during the epidemic, physicians who wanted to educate the students were not allowed to use the word vaccination. Memory is short in my province of Zeeland: the provincial GGD (Joint Health Services) warned recently that the vaccina\u00ad tion percentage for D(k)TP in Zeeland (89.9 percent) was below the international stan\u00ad dard of 90 percent, not to mention the gen\u00ad eral Dutch average of 95.3 percent. But \"fortunately,\" Zeeland also has a clas\u00ad sical homeopath who specializes in children and who can quite easily treat all these dis\u00ad eases and their complications with homeopa\u00ad thy. He also successfully treats children who get diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or other seri\u00ad ous illnesses after their vaccinations. Our present laws allow this kind of person to practice medicine\u2014he is not a medical doc\u00ad tor. The Netherlands is a paradise for quacks. Marie P. Prins Oost-Souburg, The Netherlands The anti-vaccination misinformation being circulated is indeed disturbing. What is even more frightening is that the naturopathic physician in our town is selling the \"Opti- Protect Vaccine Alternative,\" which she states is \"a homeoprophylactic protocol designed to confer immunity against stan\u00ad dard childhood diseases.\" She even issues a certificate to parents that certifies that \"the above individual has been protected against the standard grouping of childhood diseases including: diphtheria, German measles, HIB, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, and whooping cough.\" My husband went to the office to do his own investigation and was flabbergasted to hear that this naturopath could mix up a vac\u00ad cine against most every known disease (or as many as my husband could think up at short notice). So misinformed parents can now make the decision not to vaccinate and still feel their children are protected with these fraudulent vaccines. The vaccines come in capsule form for die amazing price of US$250. We have called Health Canada and every consumer-protection organization we can find, and there doesn't seem to be any\u00ad thing one can do against this public-health fraud. I just picked up your magazine at a local grocery store, and suddenly I don't feel so alone. Thank you for your excellent publi\u00ad cation. Audrey Cope Qualicum Beach, British Columbia Canada I know personally that pertussis is a serious disease\u2014I had a case myself three years ago and was extremely sick for over a month. However, the numbers presented by Mr. Hoyt arc useless, since neither the whole-cell vaccine nor the acellular vaccine, when given in early childhood, provide protection after age ten. In addition, in the U.S. (and probably in other countries), reporting of pertussis is highly variable. My anecdotal experience indicates that doctors normally do not even consider pertussis as a diagnosis. Only an estimated 10 percent of pertussis cases are reported, and underreporting is greater among adults. As a result, the incidence statistics are suspect\u2014an increase in awareness of pertus\u00ad sis by doctors could easily cause a dramatic increase in reports. And since the incidence statistics include both incidence among chil\u00ad dren younger than ten and children and adults older, no conclusions about vaccine effectiveness or vaccination rates can be drawn from them. For example, Guris, et al. reported that overall increases in pertussis incidence in the U.S. between 1990 and 1996 were due to increases in rates among ten to nineteen-year-olds, while rates among children and infants were stable. 1 favor vaccination for pertussis with the acellular vaccine, but think the arguments in Mr. Hoyt's paper do not hold up to critical examination. Don Karz Madison, Wisconsin Bimini Beachrock The article by Eugene A. Shinn was excellent (\"A Geologist's Adventures with Bimini Beachrock and Atlantis True Believers,\" January/February 2004). He reviewed the history and placed die contretemps in 64 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR context, provided a number of helpful pho\u00ad tographs, and included a thorough explana\u00ad tion of the scientific inquiry in terms that I, a layman, could understand. However, sad to say, as the author recognizes, the true believ\u00ad ers will remain unconvinced and in the dark. They seem to have turned off their critical thinking capability, if they ever had it. You may be aware that in 2003, the Minimi \"road\" was shanghaied by the author of 1421-.The Year the Chinese Discovered America [reviewed in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, November/December 20031- Briefly, part of his tale, which he presents as nonfiction his\u00ad tory and which he continues to flog with a straight face, is that twenty ships of a 1421 Chinese fleet sailed into shallow water, eight hit reefs, ripped their wooden hulls, and put in at Bimini Island for repairs. They built the \"road\" with their ballast rocks, a \"slipway\" to facilitate pulling the ships up, out of the water for repair. Never mind that the \"road\" is more or less flat and parallel to the beach and never would have accomplished its stated mission. 1421 is full of such audacious nonsense. The author has no real evidence for any of the other claims I have examined, only an awe- inspiring imagination. Sources are cited, to be sure, but it turns out they don't support what the author claims. Bill Hartz Long Beach, Washington Talking with True Believers This is one skeptic who does not \"dread con\u00ad January/Febru\u00ad ary 2004). I enjoy them\u2014always have. Rather than battling your friend's belief sys\u00ad tems with a sword (as depicted in the accom\u00ad panying cartoon in the article) it's better to encourage the true believers to question your disbelief. This tactic will make them less defensive and more open to your critical way of thinking. The benefits of playing the \"gentle skep\u00ad tic\" (for want of a better word) are: (1) you do not have to be an expert in every cult, pseudoscience, or religion and thereby risk losing a skirmish on an imperfect offensive battleground; (2) each challenge helps you to perfect your own personal rational episte- mology; and (3) anger and confrontation are avoided and you keep your friends (or stu\u00ad dents) in the long haul. President Eisenhower once said, \"I don't care what a person believes in as long as he believes in something.\" When people find out you don't believe in anything you can't keep them away. It's a lot of fun! John C. Holden Omak, Washington Thanks for an entertaining read. It brought back memories of many frustrating discus\u00ad sions I have participated in. I take issue, however, with Mr. Mole's comment near the end of the article: \". .. these same abilities do not . . . exempt us from the responsibilities of teaching others.\" I submit that while it may benefit society and perhaps us to teach others when opportunity presents itself, the responsibility actually lies with the others themselves. When a person's choice lies between a comfortable belief and an uncom\u00ad fortable challenge to that belief, that person often chooses comfort, by free choice. I know this to be true, because I have on occa\u00ad sion actually caught myself doing it. Juergen Baumann Vancouver, British Columbia Canada How Scientists Discover Burton S. Gunman's claim in \"The Real Method of Scientific Discovery\" (January/ February 2004) that \"Deduction simply allows us to work through verbal puzzles and determine, for instance, that if some Aargs arc not Blobs and all Crans arc Blobs, then some Aargs are not Crans\" is wrong, because ilicie is much more to deduction than that. Elementary logic is usually introduced in terms of such puzzles and simple deductions. But consider that mathematics U introduced in terms of numbers and counting to chil\u00ad dren. Gunman's claim is akin to someone claiming that \"Mathematics simply allows us to work through simple arithmetic and determine, for instance, that 6 times 7 is 42.\" In an earlier article (May/June 2003), Massimo Pigliucci also dismissed deduction as trivial, and I wrote a letter (September/ October 2003) pointing out his mistake. I am disappointed now to sec another article where the writer also misunderstands the scope and application of logic. Readers of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER deserve an accurate and thoughtful explanation of the role, power, and limitations of logical deduction. John Grant Baltimore. Maryland Burton Gunman's argument (January/ February 2004) that science is based on abduc\u00ad tion, not induction, overlooks that abduction is a situational description of induction. Inductive inferences posit predictions about the unknown based upon generaliza\u00ad tions derived from patterns within the known. But Guttman claims: \"A scientist does not make a lot of particular observa\u00ad tions and then try to generalize from them to some hypothesis H.\" Instead Guttman pro\u00ad poses this abductive inference as an alterna\u00ad tive to induction: 1. Some surprising phenomenon P is observed. 2. P would be explicable as a matter of course if H were true. 3. Hence there is reason to think that H is true. However, the second premise requires induction to determine what would be expected to occur in the normal course of events. Describing inductive inference, David Hume observes: \"We transfer the past to the future |. . . and) we transfer all the dif\u00ad ferent events, in the same proponion as they have appeared in the past\" (in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding). To determine what would be \"explicable as a matter of course,\" we must consult past experience and detected patterns therein. From that we hypothesize probable courses of events in the future. In other words, we transfer patterns from the known to the unknown via classical Humean induction. Therefore, abduction does not supplant induction but instead usefully describes it within the situational context in which it occurs. Despite any number of challenges over the years, Hume remains correct. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Mj,y|M( 200.1 6S LETTERS TO THE EDITOR induction is the method of experimental, or scientific, reasoning. Ian Goddard Rockville, Maryland Judging Authority Jere Lipps's 2004) was well timed rel\u00ad ative to an argument I've been having with some friends who are psychotherapists. I have repeatedly challenged their \"authority\" to judge people, especially when some ol their behavior is at least questionable. However, their tendency is to stack the deck in their favor. Using the following \"diag\u00ad noses\"\u2014only a partial list\u2014taken from the DSM-IV, their bible of disorders, they are capable of declaring those who challenge them of having a mental disorder. 31281: Conduct Disorder, Childhood- Onset Type or Oppositional Defiant Disorder 3129: Disruptive Behavior Disorder NOS [not otherwise specified] 31381: Oppositional Defiant Disorder 3152: Disorder of Written Expression VI581: Noncompliance with Treatment V7101: Adult Antisocial Behavior 31234: Intermittent Explosive Disorder 30023: Social Phobia I wonder if that's how the Soviets kept their dissidents in the psychiatric institutions and how people in our own society are often marginalized in the same fashion. Timothy P. Scanlon Hyattsville, Maryland Explanations Must Predict As much as I like Massimo Pigliucci, I must take issue with his recent argument that sci\u00ad entific explanations don't need to predict anything (January/February 2004). I am quite certain that is untrue. Explanations must predict something, or else we could never find or present any evidence those explanations were true. Contrary to Pigliucci's thesis, the necessary role of suc\u00ad cessful prediction is true of every claim accepted as scientific fact. His examples only prove this point against him. Consider tornadoes. Our scientific expla\u00ad nation of tornadoes certainly docs generate predictions: tornado warnings arc based on the fact that the explanation for tornadoes tells us the conditions required for and con\u00adducive to tornado formation. So we can identify times and geographical areas where tornadoes are likely or unlikely, possible or impossible, and even estimate their probabil\u00ad ity of occurrence. After all, the ability to pre\u00ad dict when something is probable is still a pre\u00ad diction (consider quantum mechanics). And it is precisely because these predictions have been successful (statistically in the field and, not incidentally, in recreations of tornado phenomena in the laboratory by recreating the hypothesized conditions) that our expla\u00ad nation of tornadoes is accepted as a scientific fact. Otherwise, it would not be. At best, it would join the category of \"untested hypotheses\" that is filled by, for example, quite a lot of cosmological theory. So our explanation of tornadoes does allow predic\u00ad tions (in the field and in the lab), and Pigliucci is wrong to claim otherwise. And that explanation is only accepted because its predictions have proved successful. As for chaotic systems (Pigliucci's one other example), if we know the defining equation for a system, we can predict the pattern its data will exhibit (the kind of shapes and frequencies it will exhibit, and so on). Even though, as with tornadoes, we can\u00ad not predict the exact and specific dips and swells in any given pattern of data, we can still predict the overall shape and behavior of that data over time. And it is precisely because chaos theory can predict just such particular patterns in data that the scientific community believes it is a correct explana\u00ad tion of those patterns. And let's not forget the fact that chaos theory predicts that cer\u00ad tain kinds of computational technology (those that employ nonlinear calculations) will in certain specific circumstances be more successful than others (those that employ lin\u00ad ear calculations), and this has been borne out in practice, as nonlinear computation has been employed to improve even cell phones. So once again, both in the field and in the lab, chaos theory makes predictions, and is accepted as scientific fact only because it makes those predictions and those predic\u00ad tions have come true. Richard C. Carrier Columbia University New York, New York Relics Not Worshipped I found Massimo Polidoro's column on liq\u00ad uefaction miracles involving blood relics (\"What a Bloody Miracle!\" January/ February 2004) very interesting and enlight\u00adening. The opening paragraph, however, contained a misstatement I wish to correct, and it failed to mention what I think many scientists would consider the most interest\u00ad ing relic in Italy. Polidoro writes, \"Even personal garments that belonged to martyrs and saints are still kept and worshiped in various Italian churches.\" Not exactly. Catholic doctrine reserves worship for God alone, not for relics or even for the saints with whom relics arc associated. Relics are physical objects associated with people who had an exem\u00ad plary relationship with God. They can serve as foci for worship (of God), but they are not themselves objects of worship. Scientists visiting Florence may be inter\u00ad ested and surprised to find the finger-bone of a revered seventeenth-century Italian dis\u00ad played in an ornate reliquary in the Institute and Museum of the History of Science. The finger belonged to Galileo. Carmen Giunta Associate Professor of Chemistry Le Moyne College Syracuse, New York Science/Pseudoscience Editorial Thanks for your upbeat and informative edi\u00ad torial pseudoscience is on the decline, that is excellent news\u2014but there are other negative trends that worry me. I have a growing con\u00ad cern over limitations imposed on research for political or social reasons. Biotech firms arc leaving Silicon Valley because there are so few stem-cell lines available in the U.S. for medical research. Those who control the U.S. census arc unwilling to use standard sta\u00ad tistical approaches to correct for sampling errors. In California there has been a move to stop collecting ethnic data, one effect of which would be to make it impossible to identify race-based inequities in the applica\u00ad tion of education. Voices are often raised against collecting and analyzing information that would determine the effectiveness of laws, the social consequences of stiff sen\u00ad tences for marijuana users, or the deterrent effects of capital punishment. The DOE is still using \"lie detector\" screening to identify security risks. No one seems to be interested in evaluating the effectiveness of antiterror\u00ad ism initiatives such as passenger screening in airports. And it is difficult to undertake rational comparisons of the risks of basing an 66 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR energy policy on fossil fuels versus nuclear generation of electricity. With a level playing field, science will win, but I am less confident if the playing field is tilted for ideological reasons. Advances in science often have negative impacts on some segments of society. If our leaders perceive the costs of new knowledge as unacceptable to them or their con\u00ad stituents, they could effectively discourage certain lines of research. David Morrison (CSICOP Fellow) Saratoga, California 1 am having trouble with an apparent incon\u00ad sistency in the January/February 2004 issue. On page 4 [Editor's Note]: \"Every PBS Nova television show and countless others on the Discovery Channel and elsewhere are repudiations of pseudoscience.\" On page 34: [\"Fallacies and Frustra\u00ad tions\") \"This kind of ignorance is especially prevalent among paranormalists, who often learn everything they know about a particu\u00ad lar poltergeist haunting or UFO abduction by watching Discovery Channel programs, and aren't aware of the strong counterargu\u00ad ments and other parts of the story withheld from them. . . . The public often fails to real\u00ad ize that programs such as those found on the Discovery Channel have a well-documented policy of denying airtime to anyone skeptical of paranormal claims.\" Can you resolve this? Elin Larson Purcellville, Virginia Kendrick Frazier replies: Our colleague David Morrison is certainly cor\u00ad rect: Distortions, misuses, and abuses of science in the policy arena are a serious concern, per\u00ad haps especially so now. As I wrote in the latter part of my editorial, we intend to devote more attention to such issues in SI (see News & Comment this issue, page 5). As for the paradox noted by Elin Larson, I was trying to encourage those dedicated, hard\u00ad working skeptics who sometimes get discouraged by pseudoscience's perennial popularity I think my general point still holds, that \"good science is everywhere\" and that, in lite long run, \"pseudo- science is no match for it and never will be.\" Rut in regard to the television networks that focus on public affairs and documentaries, and even some material published in scientific jour\u00ad nals, I should have tempered my praise with a rase such as \"with notable exceptions. \" Vaccine News The News and Comment item \"Studies Clear Childhood Vaccine of Links to SIDS, Autism,\" states: \"A study released in March 2003 confirmed that there is no evidence of a link between Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and multiple vaccines given in infancy. Marie McCormick, head of the committee that wrote the March report, said that 'although the timing of infant vac\u00ad cinations coincides with the period is most likely to occur, parents should rest assured that the number and variety of childhood vaccines do not cause SIDS.'\" Not SIDS, maybe, just sudden death. A quick glance at the report's summary, found at www.iom.edu/report.asp?id=5391, shows a much grimmer picture of the rela\u00ad tionship between vaccines and infant death. It's a picture you hide by including only one small part of their findings. Actually, the Committee found that the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject causal relationships between SIDS and sev\u00ad eral vaccines (Hib, HepB. OPV, and IVP). Nor is it adequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between exposure to multiple vaccines and sudden unexpected death in infancy. Nor is it adequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between HepB and neonatal death. In other words, these vac\u00ad cines still could be causing deaths of infants. Finally, the report stated that diphtheria, toxoid, and whole-cell pertussis vaccines arc causally linked to death from anaphylaxis in infants. And yet you want to reassure us that parents are worrying needlessly about vac\u00ad cines? I suppose you think it's okay if some babies die unexpectedly in infancy, as long as the death's not labeled SIDS. You pulled out the one positive finding from the report and ignored all the others, which indicated that further research is needed to prove or dis\u00ad prove links between vaccines and death, and you held back the fact tiiat a link was found between three vaccines and death from ana\u00ad phylaxis. Am I worried about vaccines' effects on my children? Yes. And your misrepresenta\u00adtion of the facts, as usual, hasn't done any\u00ad thing to sway me. Amy Nelson nclsonkritter@hotmail.com Benjamin Radford replies: Instead of a \"misrepresentation of the facts.\" I think we have a misunderstanding of science. A link between SIDS and vaccines has been claimed by some doctors and anti-vaccination activists. That claimed link has been repeatedly scientifically studied, and, as Nelson herself points out. \"the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject causal relationships. \" That is how sci\u00ad ence works: variables and groups are controlled, tested and compared, and either a significant link is found or it isn't. In this case, the evi\u00ad dence did not support the claim. Nelson seems to be arguing backward saying that the link was not disproven. She is correct that vaccines could still be causing death to infants. It's possible: no medical treatment is entirely risk-free, and science does not operate on absolute certainties. As always, the issue is not what is possible but what conclusions the evi\u00ad dence supports. The larger issue, and one that Nelson entirely sidesteps, is tlje real risk to chil\u00ad dren: The evidence strongly suggests that children are at far greater risk from childhood diseases than from the vaccinations given to prevent them. Errata Corrige I beg to differ with the conclusions of the article by Kendrick Frazier [News and Comment) in die January/February 2004 issue. Some time ago, I purchased two mag\u00ad netic shoe insoles for the sum of $52. After using them diligently for a few weeks, I found a significant difference with respect to ordinary leather insoles: the mag- soles hurt like hell! Peter Castruccio Gambrills, Maryland Limitations of Knowledge In a letter (January/February 2004). Rui Vicira offers Putnam's \"Brain-in-a-vat scenario,\" a version of Descartes's \"dream or demon\" hypothesis, as a limitation of knowledge. All species of this hypothesis essentially say that a brain cannot know whether state\u00ad ments about nature are accurate if all infor\u00ad mation is from sources other than external reality. The conclusion is dictated by the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June J004 67 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR premise and thus is unremarkable. More simply, doubt can cheaply be cast upon any finding by repeatedly noting the obvious possibility that, for whatever reason, information or interpretation may be inac\u00ad curate. This provides a shabby refuge for people who think it witty and wise to con\u00ad stantly suggest that science may be wrong, regardless of evidence. We no longer regard mental experience as produced by a passive brain's interface with externality. To prevent the vatted brain's independent activity, Putnam's computer would have to supply the brain's internal processes as well. But such a brain would not meet the functional definition of a human brain. As a nonfunctioning attachment to the computer, it would not even exist in a systemic sense. A further fallacy is that acknowledging doubt renders all statements equally doubt\u00ad ful. If we were cither ignorant ol doubt or certain of it, we would consider all state\u00ad ments equal in probability. Doubt informs us to assess accuracy in terms of probability. Behavior of humans and at leas: some other animals, such as chimps, indicates that they are capable of doubt and they investigate the probable accuracy of explanations for per\u00ad ceived experience. Information in nature vacillates between degrees of probability and certainty. As physicist Heinz R. Pagels pointed out, infor\u00ad mation originates in the subatomic realm on a probabilistic basis. But the resulting infor\u00ad mation that enters the macrocosm has shed its probabilistic, or \"fuzzy,\" character. If knowledge must be stated in terms of probability\u2014if we are philosophically barred from certainty\u2014this is not a practical limita\u00ad tion on science. After all, if a given finding proves to have only a particular probability of accuracy, that simply leaves science more to discover. I doubt, therefore I am. William S. Bunn Algonac, Michigan The principal job of a competent philoso\u00ad pher is to explain away ridiculous ideas of other philosophers. The principal ridiculous idea is that a capable thinker can hold the notion that material bodies do not exist but are only imagined. Hilary Putnam's brain-in-a-vat scenario, as Rui Vieira terms it, would obviously not be evidence against -justified knowledge of rhe real world,\" even if it were true. Both brains and vats are matter, if one wanted to use different words, like spiritual, they would nevertheless have characteristics that we mean when saying, material\u2014separate exis\u00ad tences in a space. The brain-in-a-vat description may be only an illustration of how a material scientist could deceive a material victim, but even there it is a failure. According to Vieira, Putnam writes as though unaware that all conscious beings have bodies with needs, and that, devastatingly to philosophical idealists, these needs arc constantly changing. Even Bishop Berkeley had to assume that God was often making him feel hunger that led him to suppose that he was breaking crusts of bread to put into an idea of a stomach. The fool\u00ad ishness of this train of thought would have led a less opinionated thinker to give up his reasoning even if he had to turn atheist. . . . Harry E. Mongold Manhattan, Illinois It seems strange that we still discuss Cartesian skepticism and Kantian categories (as in Rui Vieira's letter) in response to ear\u00ad lier discussions when the evolutionary devel\u00ad opment of living beings has long been accepted. In a sense, Kant was correct, that our senses of space and time are imposed from outside us, but for the wrong reason. We sense that the world has three dimen\u00ad sions and runs according to time, because that is the correct view of the world. Any animal species will tend to develop those senses that provide accurate and useful infor\u00ad mation about the world in which it lives. An animal whose senses depict the shape of its world in only two dimensions will suffer from competition with animals who sec the world in three dimensions (except when the animal with two-dimensional vision lives only in niches in which lack of three-dimen\u00ad sional perception is of little importance). An animal whose senses depicted the shape of the world in four dimensions would never develop in a three-dimensional world, only in a four dimensional world. The same argument is commonly made about the sense of smell, but without any of the episte- mological uncertainty that we have applied to the sense of space. We lack an acute sense of smell because our ancestors lived in envi\u00ad ronments where smell was not very useful, while dogs have an acute sense of smell because their ancestors lived lives in which the sense of smell provided very useful and accurate information. There is no more rea\u00ad son to apply epistcmological uncertainty to the sense of space than to the sense of smell. In summary. Darwinian evolution pro\u00advides an adequate explanation for the con\u00ad gruence between the world that exists and the information that our senses provide about the existence of that world. It is true that our senses can be misled, as when we perceive the sequence of static images on a motion-picture screen as continuous motion, but we can explain that phenome\u00ad non in terms of the real world. It is true that we have no sense of radio waves, but expla\u00ad nations based on our perceptions of the world demonstrate that they exist; we don't directly sense them because our ancestors could make no use of them. John Forester Lemon Grove, California Ralph Estling replies: My thanks to Rui Vieira (Utters, January/ February 2004) for agreeing that \"there is a great deal of absurdity in continental philoso\u00ad phy. \" He then goes on lo admonish that this absurdity doesn't apply to analytic philosophers like Rene Descartes and Hilary Putnam. A good philosophical thing to do before admonishing someone is to read what he has written. The phibsophers I was \"overly dismis\u00ad sive\" about in my reply (July/August 2003) were those in practice from the late eighteenth century onwards, starting with the German Idealists, and going on from them. Descartes died in 1650. Putnam admittedly is of more recent vintage. Nevermind. The point is that both carried skepticism to heights far beyond the gravitational pull of sanity. (How do I know I exist? Because I think. Ah, but how do you know you think and are not merely a dis\u00ad embodied brain kept in a vat of nutrients by some insane computer? And so on.) Speculation about the unreality of external reality preceded Descartes and Putnam by almost four thousand years, forming tlie backbone of both Hinduism and Buddhism. Life, on the other hand is short and idle speculation, specu\u00ad lation for which no evidence exists or can exist, is long not to say tedious, pointless, and very silly All new ideas given out for public consider\u00ad ation should possess three ingredients: I) a real possibility that they could be true, 2) that they are important, and 3) that they are original. All three. Two out of three isn't enough. The last philosopher to manage this was David Hume (1711-1776). His dates are significant. By the middle of the eighteenth century, science and scientific thought had become well established in the West, and so philosophers and their \"nat\u00ad ural philosophies\" were no longer required Sitting in easy chairs and informing the world what was the true nature of things was no 68 May/June 2004 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR longer sufficient. You now had to go out and learn something, get your hands dirty, perhaps even stink up the parlor with misty chemicals. If you wanted to tell the world about science, you first had to learn something about it. This fact has yet to implant itself in the brains of many modern \"philosophers of science.\" So in the last two or three decades of the eighteenth century, philosophers gave up the unequal battle with science and opted to become pedants. They no longer wrote for intel\u00ad ligent readers but only for each other, half of them proclaiming the obvious, the other half denying it. It all made work for the working academic. . . . Rui Vieira has also submitted another letter, but I think this discussion has consumed enough space for now.\u2014EDITOR Worries About Terrorism Regarding our response to Pinker and Tite's bewilderment (Letters, January/Fcbiuaiy 2004) over our comments of how much peo\u00ad ple worry about being victims of terrorism, we grant that it is difficult to assess hypo\u00ad thetical situations quantitatively. Our pri\u00ad mary resource is a Web compilation of polls on terrorism: www.pollingreport.com/tcrror. him. A sample question that has been asked in CNN/L/&4 Today/GaWup polls almost monthly since 9/11 is \"How worried arc you that you or someone in your family will become a victim of terrorism: very worried, somewhat worried, not too worried, or not worried at all?\" Responses run about 10 per\u00ad cent in the \"very worried\" response and around 30 percent in the \"somewhat worried\" category. We grant that it is a bit ambiguous how \"worry\" translates into probability, but these responses appear to be considerably stronger titan supposing that they are \"at some risk, though not at high risk.\" Alan W. Harris Senior Research Scientist Space Science Institute La Canada, California Arrogance, Not Skepticism If you're a skeptic, you're a skeptic. What's wrong with that? When Myta Jones was respectfully skeptical of Kimball Arwood's article for lambasting NCCAM, was she out of line? Judging from Arwood's reply, \"Pointing to the failings of 'mainstream medicine' is irrelevant to criticism of CAM.\" But how else can we \"compare relative value\" if we are only to talk about the failings of what he refers to as the \"paranormal?\" Atwood came across as a bully for one-sided skepticism. Arvey Olsen Okotoks, Alberta Canada Kimball Atwood is not believable. If he has some pre-history with Myra Jones, he should stale what that is. To launch into the kind of hostile, provocative response that he docs is not skepticism but merely arrogance. To characterize Jones's letter by saying that \"it demonstrates several misrepresentations and fallacies common to apologies\" is not justi\u00ad fied by the contents of her letter. I also have the feeling that some writers in 5/ seem to come with a chip on their shoulders, which is so evident that it gets in the way of any serious investigation of alter\u00ad nate points of view. Arwood's responses are a case in point. . . . Bill Aird Willowdale, Ontario Canada Growing Skeptics Over the last few years, I have come to real\u00ad ize the importance of every skeptic being able to talk about being a skeptic. One of the absolute best resources for me to fine-tune my skills as a skeptic is the Skeptic's Toolbox in Oregon. We need to get more people versed in analyzing extraordinary claims and the extraordinary evidence that is often pre\u00ad sented to support the claims. I think that the Toolbox is a valuable resource that needs attendance by more peo\u00ad ple. To stimulate this, I challenge the folks who return to the Toolbox to bring someone with them or to sponsor someone through a scholarship of some sort. [The next Toolbox will be held August 12-15, 2004.] I'm sure that CFI can find a student or skeptic who could use some help to attend. I for one will bring a person with me next year or I will notify CFI by June that I will sponsor one person who they think will benefit from attending. I hope that others who keep coming back will think about this and hopefully some will be able to make a similar commitment. Herb Masters San Carlos. California ... 'And' a Correction In a letter to the editor Victoria Simmons wrote in response to some remarks by Steven Flora (Letters, January/February 2004), we accidentally omitted a crucial \"and.\" The sentence as she submitted it read properly: \"... he asserts that 'menstruation was celebrated by females of the ancient Celtic and Druid religions.'\" We apologize for dropping the \"and.\"\u2014EDITOR Inappropriate Art It is with a mixture of chagrin and sorrow that I write. No, 1 am not canceling my sub\u00ad scription, but I do wish to protest the car\u00ad toon on page 36 of ihc March/April issue. I can think of no acceptable reason to provide your readers with such a negative, caricatured stereotype of a religious Jewish man, presumably a rabbi. Considering how open anti-Semitism has become in the world, would it not have been better to simply show a rabbi with a bishop and leave out the preposterous nose? Nah. Even if anti- Semitism were at an all-time low, it still would not be appropriate. Perhaps the arrist is at fault, but more so you who after all looked at it and approved it for publication. Please, a bit more sensitivity in the future. Bertram H. Rothschild Aurora, Colorado Several other readers complained about an illustration depicting a man in rabbinical garb and carrying the Torah with exaggerated facial features which can easily be interpreted as phys\u00ad ical stereotyping of those Jewish ethnicity. We apologize to readers who were offended.
