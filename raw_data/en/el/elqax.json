The Select Committee on Nutrition and Hu-man Needs is today continuing an inquiry regarding the mitkionalhealth and well-beino. of the American people fully as important as,I think. its inve4igations over the past several years into the problemof malnutrition from lack of adequate food. There is increasing con-cern, evidenced by professionals and laymen alike, about the qualityof the American diet. Both Department of Agriculture surveys aswell as the Ten-State Nutrition Survey by the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare, indicate a disturbing decline some very important parts of the traditional American diet. This decline isaccompanied, on the other hand, by a striking increase in the con-sumption of an array of nontraditional kinds of snalk foods.This committee has heard testimony from everts in the field ofnutrition education that the potential costs. potential health costs ofnutritional ignorance may be amounting to billions of dollars. Theseexperts have emphasized to the committee the (Tit leaf role that propernutrition education can- and must-1)1;1y as part of a total national preventive health policy. 'Flaw have further emphasized the espon- sibilities that government schools and private industry must playin both developing and implementing* this policy.In its investigation of this issue, the committee has become aware of the, special importance that 'I'V now plays in influencing the Na- tion's nutritional habits. The TV advertising of food products now exerts an enormous new influence on the Nation's children. 'Hie com- mittee has been told that, moderate TV_ viewing by children todayamounts to 5.000 commercials a year and. theoretically, 50,000 coin-(255) 256morcials by the time a child reaches the age of 1(. A heavy propor-tion of these commercials deal with food products and predominatelywith breakfast, and Quack products, The committee, scheduled thesehearings because it believed it bad as special responsibility to investi-gate this area and because it believed that the companies and advertis-ing, noenies, invohed in this area, hae, a reSpOliSihi \\ to reVieW theirpraet leeF and policies in relation to the types of nutrition educationmessage -: that they are gettin across to children.It was for that reason specifically, the committee invited the majormanufacturers of children's cereals, and their advertising. agencies forthose cereals. to testify before us on this coming Wednesday.' Afterindicating a willingness to testify, the companies and theadvertising agencies notified the committee that they respectfullydeclined to testify because of the nature of the hearings that is. be-cause of the scope of the nutrition health questions being raised. Theytook the position that the subject, of the hearings conflicted with acomplaint issued against, the companies by the Federal Trade Corn-1111S31011.I have asked the committee staff and mimic] to the committee toreview that position.2 After examining the nature of the FTC eom-plaint, the staff a dvi.zes me that the FTC eomplain focusino. clu (pies-timk_of restraint, of trade and monopoly power bear only the ,,,1stindirect relationship to the basic kinds of nutrition education, health.anddietque,-,tionswhicharethesubject of thiscommittee'sinvestigation.I eannot. therefore. accept, the refusal of the companies and theadvertising agencies to appear before this eonunittee. I believe theyhave a duty and a responsibility to come forward and provide thecommittee, with the best, information and testiri(,nv possible. I intendto convene, at the earliest possible moment, an e% cntive session of theeomniittee so that the members inay divide what fi,,.ther steps tile), wishto take to insure that this committee's inviry cal, proceed as planned.I'm very hopeful that the companies and advertising agencies willreconsider their position and that we may reschedule their appear-aneec before this commit fee at the earliest possible date.This niorn;no. our leadoff witness is Dr. Jean or the School or nook ikaith.

We are always interested in what you have to say.STATEMENT OF DR. JEAN MAYER, PROFESSOR OP NUTRITION,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BOSTON, MASS.Dr. MA1-131. Thank. you. Senator. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentle-men. I think the importance of advertising and nutrition is perhapsbest illustrated by the fact that a health-oriented magazine undertook SCo:11111011110molit. P, 1%.Se.' APPooli\\ PP Part hearing Tu,da, Dee. 17, 19(1S ;, pp. 11 -11. 257to sponsor a contest on nutritional advertising. This idea was receivedwith enough favor by the nutrition community that the contestwhich is now going to he administered by the Society for NutritionEducationis judged by officially designated members of the Ameri-can Institute of Nutrition. American Dietetic Association. AmericanHome Economics Association, as well as by representatives of con-sumer groups and the advertising industry.The reason the nut rition organizations did take th-, problem of ad-vertising so seriously is because we already know that it has anenormous influence on the feeding habits of the Nation. At a time whencontagious diseases have receded as the major threat to the health ofAmericans and such diseases as cardiovascular (1l ease. diabetes. obe-sit. and dental decay emeroe as the chief threats to the health of theNationtogether with cancerthe importance of nutrition is moreand more evident.Now. its quite, obvious that. the food industry itself believes that ad-vertising is a very potent factor in molding food habits. on't have overall figures available. but -Advertising Age\" every year. P think.publishes in August. a list of the largest advertisers. It becomes quiteobvious, perusing this list. that, the food industry is a very heavyadvertiser. A single company spent. in 1971, as much as $160 million.Soft drink conqmnies are also very large advertisers with expendi-tures. which I see, being in the order of $200 million per year.Advertising to small children is an important component of suchadvertising. Any father or mother who has watched Saturday morningtelevision to see what. the children are exposed to can't help but noticethat advertising goes on at. a very hatch higher frequency than in adultprograms. Also. for that matter, that the advertisements are preparedwith much more care and much more artistry than the programs them-selThe chairman ha already noted that the best, estimatesarri red on the basis of surveys such as the Carnegie FoundationSurveyis that. the average American child may be exposed to as muchas 5.000 food advertisements a year.COM PA NIVS HAVE ABILITY To CM:ATE Goon COMMERCIALSNow. advertising is a morally neutral technique. There are many ex- amples where it can be found to play a beneficial role. For instance,the ads %vhich were judged worthy of recognition by the FamilyI fealth Nutritional Advertising contest judges were, in fact, highlyeducational and artistic creations. It's interesting, Mr. Chairman, thatone of the ads crowned by the committee was an ad produced by one ofthe companies which we learned this morning will not be present totestify : this shows that large food companies are certainly well ablei f they so choose to produce informative and education:1i ads.On the other hand. I think it. is very difficult to escape the conclu-sion that. viewed as a %vhole. the advertising of food is playing a dele- terious' role in the nutrition of the American people. It:s also very dif- ficult to escape. the view that many of the children's food advertise-ments are really nothing short of nutritional disasters. I think perhapsthe best way to judge the effect of advertising is to see where the ad-vertising dollars go. FOOD CLASSED IN DECREASING USEFULNESSI think its legitimate to try to classify foods in perhaps four groupsof decreasing usefulness :Group One would have fruits and vegetables and amid have animalproducts such as milk, fish, eggs, meat and cheese.Group Two would have such useful foods as bread, potatoes,macaroni products, some of the better breakfast cereals, soups, partic-ularly the better ones.Group Three. and we are beginning to go down considerably. wouldhave such foods as tlsugar-coated breakfacereals. most. of thesnack foods. many of the cake mixes.Finally. Group Four, the empty calories group. would have candyand soft drinks and, at the chance of being thought guilty of a horri-ble pun, we might perhaps have alcoholic beverages as a fifth group.Anviarrtsixo Ix REVERSE ORDER or UsErt;Lxi:ssNow, it's fairly obvious to any even casual television viewer thatnational advertising expenditures are in reverse order to the useful-ness of the foods. Group one, the fruits and vegetable; and suchthings as fish, eggs, and meat, receive very little advertising. Advertis-ing for potatoes. macaroni and so on is also very limited.By contrast, if you go to soft. drinks. alcoholic beverages and so onadvertising is an extraordinarily large item. Now. I do not subscribeto a \"devil theory\" of advertising. I could not think that the advertis-ing., profession is made up of people who have set out to deliberatelypervert the food habits of the American population: but the effect. inmany cases. is just the same. I think the reason for this is fairly plain.The foods in group onethe foods produced by farmers, basically.and vhich are consumed almost directly by the population are notbranded. They are produced by a very large number of farmers whodon't have any advertising resources at. their disposal.By contrast, foods in group three and group four are produced bya very small number of manufacturers who have very well establishedbrands of snack foods. candy and soft drinks. and who have enormousresources available for advertising. So that we end up with the fact that the structure of our food industryin spite of the undeniablegood will and excellent intentions of many of its leaders: which ifyou remember. Mr. Chairman. resulted in a very strong endorsementby leaders of the food industry of the concept of nutritional educationat the White House Conference. In spite of all this. the structure ofthe industry and advertising industry end up with the whole. weightof 011011110DS resources of advertising, going; far toward the destructionof our food habits.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MAIN ITEALI PRODLEMI may add that even within each group the same phenomenon isvisible. I would like to make a very strong point of my belief thatgood breakfast cereals are an extremely useful food. At a time when:-cardiovascular disease is our nninber one food problem or health prob-lem, and we are trying. to reduce the fat intake of our population. theconsumption of good breakfast cereals with a small amount of sugarand a large amount of milk- -skim milk if necessaryis an excellent .-259way for people to get a good breakfast and reduce their intake of fat.rnfortunately. what is bein g. propounded to children is extremelyheavily coated cereals with a great deal of sugar. Many of which.mothers assure me, are consumed without milk and which cannot.even if they are en i Jelled with a few vitamins. be considered as goodfoods. In fact, I have some very serious qnegtions as to whether theFederal Trade Commission should. in fact, tolerate the fact that someproducts which have more than 50-percent sugar should be calledcereals. I think they perhaps might more properly be called candy.The promotion of high-fat and high-salt snacks to adults is alsoan effect of concern because of cardiovascular risks. The promotionof high-sugar snacks and soft drinks is a danger for children, as wellas for ;:dults. but to children in particular because of the effect ondental care which sonic of my colleagues will speak about later today.Mr. Chairman, I think we have always accepted, in this country,the idea that the community at large are the trustees for the chil-dren's health. It's on that basis that we have always agreed that com-pulsory vaccination was something which ought to take place inschools. It seems to me thatat the time *len some of our main danger is cardiovascular and dental diseasesthe community, simi-larly, has a special duty as regards children. I believe, that this ought.to express itself by regulations self - regulation if possible, imposedregulation if necessaryon health and nutrition information, andhealth and nutrition advertising as it applies to small children.There already is a precedent by some of the nutritional supplementcompanies going out of advertising to small children by replacing theadvertising withinstitutionally-sponsorednutrition messages.I would hope that large food companies would similarly exercise thesame restraints by stopping advertising to small children. Stop mak-ing small children, in effect, agents in an unconscious blackmail plotagainst their parents of what they are going to buy at the supermar-kets or else the child is going to throw a tantrum. Generally speaking,I hey should work with professionals to improve the nutrition habitsof small children rather thanas is very much the case at this pointhelp debase them.ruErmum STATENIENT OF DM JEAN MAYERIt is obvious from the resources used that the food industry believes thatadvertising is a potent factor in molding food habits. While no overall figuresare easily available, it Is highly likely that the food advertising expenditures oftio Nation total well.over 52 billion : according to Advertising Age (August 19721.tate company alone spent $160 million on advertising. Soft drink manufneturersaccount for additional advertising expenditures of the order of $200 million peryear. Advertising to small children Is tut important component of such mi-ce' tising: On Saturday morning television. it goes on at a ninth higher fre-quency than daring adult programs, with advertisements obviously preparedwith more care and artistry than the programs themselves. It has been estimatedon the basis of foundatIonsponsored surveys that preschool children may watchup to 25.000 advertisements a year, at least 5,000 of which are food advertisement s.Advertising Is a morally neutral technique. Many nxamples can be found whereIt plays a beneficial role, and many examples can be found where the effect onthe \"viewer\" is deleterious. Unfortunately. on the whole. food advertising aspresently practiced in our country seems to work against the nutritional healthof the American people; many children's food advertisements are nothing shortof national disaster. 260Consider where the bulk of the advertising dollars go. If you placed foods indecreasing order of nutritional usefulness, you would have something like this:Group 1: Fruits and vegetables: mill. fish, cgs, meat and cheese.Group 2: Bread. potatoes, macaroni products, somo of the better breakfastcereals. soups.Group 3: Sugar- coated breakfast cereals. most \"snack Peels.\" cake mixes.Group 4: Candy and soft drinks (alcoholic beverages could le. thought ofas a fifth group).It I41 fairly obvious to any habitual television viewer that national advertisingexpenditures are in reverse order to nutritional usefulness. I do not subscribe toa \"devil theory\" of advertising; 4 no means do I think that advertisers set outto deliberately pervert the food babas of the U.S. population. but the effect isthere nit the same. The reason for `Isis is plain : Foods in group 1 are not branded.and are produced by an enormous number of farmers with no advertising re-sources (except through local supemarket advertising). Foods in groups 3 andparticularly 4 are produced by a few companies with strong brands to introduceor protect and with large advertising budgets. The structure of the industry. inspite of the undeniable goodwill and excellent intentions of many industry lead-ers, dictates the results.It may be observed that unlike thb situation In other consumer areas, ad-vertising, even if produced in the billions of dollars, cannot increase overall foodconsumption. This is regulated by the physiological mechanism of the individualswho comprise our population. Whnt adve,Ilsing does is to shift consumption fromone category of foods to another; at present sal too often from better foods toless nutritious foods.The debasement of the fond supply through advertising unfortunately is oftentrue within groups. Let me make it clear that I think that some of the older-es' ablished cerealshot cereals in particular, but many others as wellareexcellent foods, the consumption of which should be encouraged for both chil-dren and adults. In particular, at a time when cardiovascular diseases are amajor threat to the health of the Nation, such cereals, consumed if need be withlow fat milk, are an excellent breakfast replacement for higlecholeateral foods.Unfortunately, those cereal most heavily advertised to children are sugar-cated caveats (a number of which contain over no percent sugar and thereforeought not to be properly culled cereals). According to the testimony of manyyoung mothers, these are often eaten like candy, without milk. In spite of theirbeing enriched with some vitamins and iron, the total effect is one of inadequatenutrition (deficient; in particular. in trace miner:thethere are suggestions thatzinc deficiency may be appearing among U.S. Aildrett. including middle and up- per socioeconomic class children; chromium deficiency may be a factor amongthe elderly).The promotion of high fat, high salt snacks to adults compounds cardiovascu-lar risks. The promotion of high sugar cereals, snacks end soft drinks to (gill-dren is a dental disaster. and may be a factor in increasing the likelihood ofdiabetes In genetically vulnerable subjects: for the past 2 years eft:ism:40mof sugar and corn syrup has exceeded our flour consumpticuwith unpredieta-bie results for the health of the country.Irresponsible advertising policies by large companies who cught to know bet-ter have undeniably helped to produce an annoephere of distrust toward thenational food supply. In this environment. purveyors of all sorts of faddist prd-ucts, sold at enormous and totally unjustified prices, thrive on extravagantcla hus.It is to be hoped that the Congress will see fit to recognize that food, like drumis not a commodity like other consumer goods. Because of its relation to health.at least its advertising specifically to small children should be regulated or Mimi-rutted. It makes little sense to encourage nutrition education where the battlehas already been lost by the time the 6-yeanold enters school.Why not restrict food advertising to adult programs and encourage feud cm:-pa:deg instead to conciliate parents by sponsoringon an institutional, nondi-rected basishotter children's television programs, recreational as well ea edu-cational, than are available now. There are some encouraging examples of thisnew trend : it should be vigorously promoted.Finally, we can hope that the introduction of nutrition labeling will conviceefood cotepanies and advertisers that you can \"sell\" nutritionthus giving auadvantage to the more nutritious foods and reversing the present unfavorabletrend. W can also hope that fruit and vegetable grower. , producers of morenutritious products hitherto hardly advertised (fish jumps to my mind as an 3 exahb) will see their Interest in handing together to produce attractive Mlle-ths:Ibsvd advertising which will Inform the public at the same time as theypromote luperior Thank you, Dr. Mayer.Von say, in your prepared testimony, that the advertising. especiallyof children's &RI today, as preSentir being handled is in some respectsa national disaster. Could you c 'orate on that statement ? That's a ..err strong statement. I womb . if you could just elaborate on it a little as to what von mean.Dr. MAYER. kr. Chairman. I am not a specialist in the educationof small children. I have had five children. I have ofiSered the resultsof many things on them but that i. hardly a professional competence.I bow to the opinion of all my colleagues in that, field, that influencesbefore the children go to school are extraordinarily important.As you know.

I think television is a very striking phenomenonfor small children. equating goodness with sweetness. selling food on the basis of anything except nutrition, on the basis of the fact that it is sweet.that thebox is attractive. that you can get a green monsterif you buy this or that cereal. It lx.coines very difficult. all of a sudden at the age of (t. to revert the whole process and explain to them thatthe first reason we eat is to get t he necessary nut rients.Senator 3Ic(lovnux. The thrust of what yon are saying is that even if we flail g,ld nutrition education programs in the element:11yand secondary schools,at that point itwould probably be too bite to compete with the heavy impact that television advertising has hadon food habits?Dr. MAnu.Well. I would rather have the children either alreadyprceducated, or at least a virgin mind as regards nutrition.rather than already having been manipulated to sell them foods which, inetrect. are not the best foods they could consume. Senator MalovEum. Dr. Mayer. do von recall therecentcontroversy regading the advertising of sugarea vitamins. the complaints that.were made to the FTC on that? If I understand the situation, therewere complaints to the FTC that. it was inappropriate and unwise to teach ellildren to eat vitamin pills as they would candy. What is the reason for that.? Are there had side effects from excessive use of vita-mins or what was thereason for the complaint?Dr.NIAEit. Well. Ithink that one of the things that our contem- poraries need to be reminded of is that we certainly need, every day, a proper supply of vitamins coming from foods in order to survive 262and be healthy. There i; some sense, perhaps as an insurance, partic-ularly for people with ii regular habits or extraordinarily large needsbecause. of pregnancy or nursing or small food intake because theyare trying to cut downtheir weight while remaining very inactive tohave a supplement representing the recommended dietary allowanceif they so choose. There is certainly no justification for having enor-mous doses and particularlycapricious doses of various vitamins in-gested day after day.INnunnsT DANGERS IN VITAMIN DIn the case of supplementary vitamins, _particularly vitamin D,there is indeed a risk of too much vitamin D being consumedwhichin the case of children may end with a growth retardation. If thereis no vitamin D in the diet you may get rickets. Too much vitamin Dih the diet, you may stop growing. Certainly, having nutritional foodswhich are consumed more or less like candy and are very attractivebecause of all that sweetness. Also many are extraordinarily heavilyfortifiedthis is not the way to end up with a rational vitamin intakeand rational intake for children.Senator McGovEnx. Can you tell us what the Food and Drug Ad-ministration regulations are.that is, the recent rides that they havelaid down with regard to vitamin content for foods and dietary sup-plements and drugs?As I understand they spelled out certain percentages that will en-able. us to define what are vitamins, what are dietary supplements,and at what level they become drugs.Dr. 7t.fAyEa. As I remember it. Mr. Chairman. as an ordinary food,r: breakfast food may have un to 50 pr,ent of the recommended dietary allowance per day in a portion. I trunk ,wtween 50 and 150 percent isconsidered a special dietary supplement it.id over 150 percent, it be.comes, in effect. an over-the-connter drugor otOit to bebecause itis beyond the point of dietary supplement.How Do Nr.w FDA REour,.vrioxs CLASS PI:ODUTTS?Senator McGovEnN. Well, the staff has drawn my attention to aproduct here, a cereal product. that is called \"King Vitamin,\" and theadvertising says that it meets 100 percent of the needs, the daily re-quirements of various types of vitamins.T-Tow would that product be classified under these new regulations?Is it a vita in 1i. or a dietz:ry supplement, or a' ilfug----or how does it fitthe new FDA regulations?Dr. 11.vvre. T think it would be a special dietary sunplei ent. i amunhappy about this oversell horsepower race. I think that, if you havean adolescent, particularly who eats three or four portions in -thecourse of a day and then takes a couple of \"vitamins,\" yon tray end upwith children Ivho are fyrossly overdosing themselves with vitamins.This is particularly objectionable in the case of vitamin D.There is also a point which needs to be made very strongly. Vitaminsare an extremely important component of our diet, hut c-n are othercomponents For instance, trace minerals. Cereals, some o; which areextremely highly processed so that their intrinsic nutrient content isvery low. particularly when combined with sugar, which is the proto- 263type of \"emPtv calories,\" are. not a complete food even if fortifiedwith eight or 10 vitamins.Thco was at. least one very disturbing paper last summer pre-sented before the International Nutrition Congress in Mexico City bythree Denver pediatriciansthe senior author was Dr. Hartridgesuggesting very strongly that zinc deficiency was something whichwas appearing in their private patients among middle-class andupper-class children. This seems like an extraordinary occurrence.This, incidentally, led the children not to grow and not to develop.The children were very, very small; but they grew when given zincsupplements. Zinc is a very widespread metal in nature ankl it seemsalmost impossible that American children of well-off families wouldbe deficient in zinc. However, it. becomes possib: when you think ofchildren feeding themselves a cereal containing more than 50- percentsinir, enormous amounts of soft drinks. enormous amounts ofsnacks and, generally speaking, empty calories. I believe it is im-portant to realize thatmuch as I am in favor of enriching cerealswith reasonable amonnts of vitamins and some nutrientsthis doesnot, by itself, mean that the parents have to stop worryino- aboutgiving children a well-balanced diet. This should include a reason.able amount of those primary foods which come from the farmer tothe family essentially unprocessed. I must say I have some difficultyin understanding why the Department of Agriculturewhich ag veknow has always considered that the welfare of the American fannerwas its primary- responsibilityhasn't really made a mom moic vigorous effort to defend the consumption of fruits, of vegetables, and of,generally speaking, reasonable unprocessed agricultural foods.Senator McGovram. That was ol,ing to be my next question, Dr.Mayer. As I understand your testimony you said that because of thecorporate nature of the industry, the economics of the industry, thereis heavily concentrated economic power in those industries that. handlethese fancy new cereals and fortified foods but there is not similareconomic resources available to the producers of the more traditionalwholesome type foods. They don't have the big advertising budgets orresources to do that. So isn't there a serious economic problem here?Ameicui:ri:trAr. F000s '.um Pliomo.nxoDr. M.tyi.at. Well, Mr. Chairman. I think that it really would bea great service to the Nation, as well as to themselves, if producers offruits and vegetables, producers of fish, producers of many of thosecommodities which are not consmned in sufficient amounts. couldband together and have a much more vigorous campaign. Not product-oriented, as such, or brand-oriented, but promoting various types offoods, various types of vegetables, various types of reasonably proc-essed or not over-processed cereals, increasing the fish consumption,ncreasi '44- the cheese consumption and so oil.I think it is extremely important that the defense of agrieulturalproducts really be mounted. Otherwise, we are going to have a foodentirely consumed, made of over-processed foods which are not bythemselves necessarily toxic in any way, shape or manner, but whichbecome dangerous if they become too large a proportion of the diet.Senator McGovmmx. I take it on that basis that a product like this 264called \"Flintstones''it's a vitamin pill that was marketed on televi-sion for some timevirtually is (-Indy. There are pictures of it sayingit is chewable. It is marketed in little pieces of brightly colored sub-stance that looks like a piece of candy. Because of the complaints tothe Federal Trade Commission the companies voluntarily quit adver-tisinr. children's vitamins.Now, if in fact. this productwhich is supposed to be a cerealcontains 100 percent of the daily requirements an adult needs forvitamins and it was thought inappropriate to advertise this producton television, why would notthe same standard prevail here? Isn'tit equally questionable whether we like to stress cereal for children thatis really a concentrated vitamin?\"Aovrarrisisu TO SMALL CHILDREN Is AN Otrrema:'Dr. MAYER. Mr. ClIal MIMI, I not only agree with that, I in generalthink that advertising to small children is an outrage. I think chil-dren under 6children who are too young to go to schoolare alsotoo young to appraise the various factors, certainly particularly con-cerning their health, and ought not to be asked to make decisions onbuying through advertisements directed at them.I think it should much more properly be directed at the parents ofthe children who presumably have the judgment to decide whetherthey want or do not want to buy those products.Senator McGov Eux. I suppose one alternative would be to taite theheavy vitamin fortification out of the product but what do you haveleft then in the way of food value?Dr. MAyEn. Well, I think, again. that. the curious thing is that someof the best cereals ever devised were the older cereals of the sort. ofoats and wheat, hot cereals of our childhood. Those are excellent foodswhich were rich resources not only of good protein but also of vitaminsand trace minerals. I think T am going be extremely unpopular byrmaking this statement, M.Chairman.'-but I don't. think it's too muchwork to require of the mothers of the Nation to get up 10 minutesearlier and have some warm cereals for their children instead of serv-ing those sugar-coated nothings to their children before they go toschool. I think cereals are good food but I think the better cereals arethe ones I would like to see consumed. Sugar-coated novelties are toooften empty calories with, as I say, some vitamins thrown in.Senator Mc Govv.ux. Well. maybe you would be less criticized. Dr.Mayer. to suggest that once in a while' the fathers get up a little earlierto help out there.Dr. MAyEn. Mr. Chairman. I plead guilty of sexism. I will get uptomorrow morning and cook oahneal for the family.Senator Mc Gomm. 'lust one other question. Then I want to yieldto Senator Percy, who has had a great interest in this field.Previous testimony before the committee recommended that a ratherdetailed extensive program of nutrition education should be developedfor elementary and secondary education-1Would you sayin terms of the way this committee ought to proceedor the way we ought to move in terms of trying to develop a national nutritional policythat because of the enormous influence the mass Spe Part 72/NEtComultattta* Recommendations. pp. S-9. 265media has on children and on parents, perhaps the place to begin towork is with the food companies and their advertising agencies to tryto develop a more responsible advertising campaign. And, also to backit up with substantive products that are nutritionally sound? In otherwords, instead of trying to use all these synthetic products and heavilyprocessed foods which are then fortified heavily with vitamins tolevels that. go beyond the needs of children, we ought to concentrate ontrying to get industry and their advertising council to take the leadin the formation of a more intelligent nutrition education program ?Dr. 1favEn. Mr. Chairman, I think this is certainly entirely desir-able. I think we'll go very much faster and I think it will be done in away that we all like better to do it by enlisting the voluntary coopera-tion of the food companies and the advertising companies than to doit by coercion.I think that the introduction of nutritional labeling is a new elementin the nutrition picture and I would hope that it would dispelonceand for allthe oft-repeated statement by the advertising companiesthat \"you cannot sell nutrition.\" I have always thought this waswrong. Mothers. after alland I think we have to recognize that itis the mothers- -who do the bulk of the shopping in the Nation, doit for their families. They have always been comer Led with nutri-tion and are extremely concerned with nutrition now- -especially withthe great availability of snacks and so on. They feel they are losingsonic of the control on nutrition of their children.Nutritional labeling will mean that on every package, hopefully,of food and perhaps on posters at the produce counter, the avail-ability of nutrient informatim will be present to remind everybodyof the importance of nutrition. Nutritional advertising should reinforcenutritional labeling.Nutritional labeling, incidentally, is easier to launch immediatelyfor the packaged foods where the nutrients are added than it is forthe natural foods where there are fluctuations in the amount of nu-trient; in food but. I certainly think it. is just. as important if not evenmore important to label natural foods than it is to label highlyprocessed foods. One would hope that the food companies will pickup in their advertisements the most important element in the labeling.the most characteristic elements in the nutritional label and use itto \"sell.' t he food.PRIMARILY SELL Somalis OF Nt7rmEsTsIn other words. what we need is to have the food companies agree that certainly they are selling taste, they are selling appearance, they may be selling fashion, but. first of all they are selling sources of nutrientsand one is by no means exclusive of the other. In fact, I think it may well be stated that better cooks have not only more palatable foods but more nutritious foods.Senator McGovn.N. There is a story, a lead story in today's issueof the \"Advertising Age\"which is the national newspaper of mar- ketingin which the cereal makers say that these nutrition hearingsare rigged and that is why they won't appear. It's a story that appearsover the byline of Stanley Cohen. The gist, or the article is that theywould have been willing toconic if they had been able to tell the 266good things they have done in the field of nutrition education as wellas some of the problems.I want to make it clear that the committee wants to bear about theconstructive things that have been done by cereal manufaetnrers andby other food industry leaders. We have no insistence simply on hear-ing the dark side of the story, but we did expect to hear other wit-nesses on this.is.Now, I think that one clue in here. the article says, \"lint one cerealindustry representative candidly admitted a major consideration isthat the industry simply does not have persuasive answers on sugar01 children'sTV\".\" I suspect that is the problem. That there reallyisn't very much defense for marketing products to children in thename of cereals that maycontain 50-percent sugar. I think your pointis well taken that these products may be mislabeledbeled or muse correctlycalled candy' vitamins than cereals. But I do want to make it clearthat this committee would like to hear the positive side of what theindustry has done in the field of nutrition education. I'm sure some ofthe things they have done are very impressive.Dr. Mame. Could I make a statement on this?Senator McGovEux. Certainly.Dr. MAI-En. I think there are some very good things that can besaid about cereals just as there are son:e bad things that can be saidabout certain cereals. There are also (rood things that can be said aboutthe cereal industry and what it has done.TV ADVERTISEMENTS \"PUSH\" LEAST USEFUL FOODSFor example, it is obvious they have pioneered in listing theircomponents on the boxes and in trying to piwent nutritional informa-tion. It is also true that some of the ads have been very good. Forinstance, as I pointed out. the Kellogg adfor what is. in effect, avery superior productdidwin one of the entries in that contest.I know, also. some companies like Quaker Oats have had nutritioneducation campaigns, in that case in Chicago. And certainly Kellogg.General Foods. and General Mills have sponsored some very usefulnutrition research. There are thus some very Broad things that can 1wsaid about them. But there is also the problem that. as far as children'scereals are concerned. the advertisements have systeinaticallY pushdthose cereals that nutritionists and dentists would feel are the leastuseful of the foods and products on the market.Senator Mc(ovnux. Well, we appreciate your test hnony. Dr. Mayer.and I am glad that that last point was made. This committee is notinvolved in these hearings for the purpose of overlooking what hasbeen constructive and the efforts that have been made. I think it'sgood to commend the industry on those steps that they have taken andthe money they have budgeted in the field of nutrition education hasbeen worthwhile. What we are trying to do is to get at those areaswhere improvements can be made.Senator Percy?Senator Penov. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry that I couldnot be here at the outset of the hearing. but I was having a privatebreakfast with Mr. George Meany, talking about food prices amongother things. It took a little longer than either of us thought. 267I am happy to note that today marks the beolnning. of the NationalNutrition Week as declared by the American Dietetic Association. Ithink it is very appropriate, then, that at the beginning of such a weekwe are having these hearing. .I have a short statement, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make in lieu ofnot having been here at the opening of thd hearing.STATEMENT OE SENATOR PERCYSenator PERCY. I am pleased to join our chairman in weleoming thewitnessei this morning to the Select Committee on Nutrition andIInman Needs as it continues its study of Nutrition Education. Forquite some time I have felt that. this subjet was a key One for ourcommittee tb explore, if we had any hope of achieving the goal of eliminating hunge and malnntrition in the 'United States. I haverepeatedly urged the committee to organize learing,s on all aspects ofnutrition education and deeply regret I was out of the country whenthese hearings were launched last December. My feeling for the needof these bearings goes back to testimony given by Margaret Mead 1before this committee several years ago when she indicated that in allfields of human knowledge we have tended to progress through theyears; but, in her judgment, nutrition education is one field, in whichwe have regressed. We know less about. itas a people, todaythanwe did at World War II when we were very conscious of nutrition education. We were trying to gain as much benefit from our food,which was under ration. as we possibly could ; but since then we havenot paid the kind of attention to it we should have.Today we are focusing on the place of television advertising innutrition. As I reviewed the December hearing= I was streck by theway in which television advertising has such a very great potential, forboth good and evil, effect on the eating habits of all Americans, par-ticularly children. It. is time we begin to look into these matters byexamining the contents of nutrition advertising aimed at childrenwhich appears on television.These hearings provide its with the opportunity to pursue severalimportant questions whose answeis may be none too obvious.What effect does television advertising actually have on the eatinghabits of children?Should television be used to teach good nutrition to children andif so. how?Whet responsibility, if ally, do food co,. 1) :ides and their advertis-ing agencies ha ve in teaching nutrition to c:ildren ?What, in feet, is the track record of our leading food companies inin forming children about proper nutrition?We must not overlook the fact that literally hundreds of differentfoods and food products are advertised on television. We must avoidsingling out one segment of the food industry for praise or blame whenother segments may be engaged in the same practices. Bnt. let its alsounderstand at the outset that We are here as advocates of good nutri-tion. and that we want to encourage good nutrition among our chil-I See U.S. Senate Seleet Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, Part 1 Prohiemsand Prospeets. hearing of Dee. 19. 1965. anti NE2 with Appendixes.91-722-73pt. 3-2 268then in the most creative, most imaginative, and most effective possibleways.I, for instance, do not want my three grandchildren to be beguiledby television into developing bad nutrition habits. I want this power-ful communications tool to work for their benefit. I assume that ex-ecutives of fond companies who have grandchildren or children feelexactly the same Nvay; and consistent with that, that they will wantto provide programs of as high a quality offering as much informa-tion of a useful nature 'to their listening public as they possibly canin addition to selling their product. How do we accomplish this? Thisis really why we are here.Our chairman has indicated an article that appeared this morn-ing in the \"Advertising Age\" and I ask, at this point, unanimous con-sent that. the entire article be placed in the record.'Senator McGoviirix. Without objection, so ordered.Senator natcv. I was disturbed at the headlines that cereal makersdo feel these hearings are rigged. I can assure. the food industry thatI, for one. would not participate in rigged hearings.In researching back as to how these hearings came about. I findthat it really goes back to an executive session of this committee held.Tanuary 29. in which Senator Humphrey requested that the hearingsbe organized. I don't think he'd -mind my stating that be noted atthat time that the Kellogg Company had announced that it wasdeveloping a series of network television commercials aimed at pro-moting good nutrition among children.Senator Humphrey thought it worthwhile to publicize this initia-tive and find out what similar companies were planning along theselines. I'm sure he felt it best to encourage and to provide publicityto what the industry is doing of a very positive nature.Our chairman quoted from an article, and I notice a paragraphimmediately follownig the one lie read. The same person who admittedthat they were short on some answers and would have to come upwith tbem said. 'Our track record is enormous, in terms of nutri-tional education innovations in TV, on packages, and in literaturewhich we are offering to the public,\" lie said, \"and we are going tosee that Senators get this information, in information kits, and per-haps in statements which we will submit for the record.\"The General Mills Company has issued a statement dated todaythat, starts out, \"General Mills has long been and continues to be veryinterested in being active and helping to educate its consumerspecially in the area of nutrition. . ..into cereal advertising and pro- motional activities,\" and, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consentthat the balance of this statement be incorporated into the record. Itwas just handed to me. I have not read it. I iissinne it is favorable to the indnstry or we would not have been given it, but I think it shouldbe included in the recordin its entirety.Senator -McGovmix. Without objection, so ordered.Senator Pmicr. I would just like to say in closing the statementthat I would hope that the cereal industry would agree to appear be-fore this committee. I can assure them that the members of the UnitedStates Senate are in no sense prejudging any particular industry.1 See Appendix. pp. 31S-21. J 269Sometimes t%:' just have to call the shots us they come: but the wholeprocess of having public inquiry in matters that involve public wel-fare has been so proven through the years that to avoid the testimonywould not be in the best interests of the United States and the workof the United States Senate. I don't think declining to appear isreally in the vested interest of the industry, so I do hope they willcome. forward feeling that they will have a fair hearing and feelingthat these. hearings are not rigged. I can assure them I would not par-ticipate in any kind of rigged hearings. We are anxious to hear but Ithink the industry also will benefit from these hearings and perhapswe can find a way to move forward with a better program.Dr. Mayer, if I could just ask a few questions of you. In your pre-pared statement you state, \"What advertising does is to shift con- sumption from one category of foods to another; at present, all toooften from better foods to less nutritious foods.\"Suppose we were to ban all food commercials on television, par-ticularly chikken's television. Would this result in better nutritionfor children ? In other words, in the absence of advertising wouldchildren shift consumption from less nutrition to better food or must we take other constructive steps to achieve these pals?LET CHILDREN'S MOTHERS DIRECT NUTRITIONDr. MAYER. Senator, the fact is that, you and I and everyone else in the United States is going to eat whether we watch television or not; the total amount of food consumed is really not a function of adver- tising. It means that food is reap}, a commodity very different from other commodities because, by and large, other advertisements try to increase consumption of something, automobiles, venetian blinds,appliances, or what have you.In the case of food, our need for food is set by our own physio- logical mechanism and the question is not \"How much food will we eat?\" but. \"How much of what food will we eat?\" The total amount being set by our general appetite.There is very little doubt in my mind that I would rather have thenutrition of small children directed by their mothers than by the tele- vision box. Reluctantlybecause I think that the television certainly is a great tool of education, if properly usedmy answer is: \"Yes, I think small children would be better off if there was no food adver- tising directed at them.\"Senator PERCY. Let's just assume a lot of people have a propensity against eating breakfast. I happen to think breakf. st is probably the best, meal to give you a charge and start. But a great many people simply avoid breakfast.Let's assume that the food industry has that; through research knows that. Their job is to sell more cereal. We know there is nutritionin rice, wheat. corn, and other products that cereals are made of, in- cluding oats. They decide that the best way is to entice children through a sweetener and that children will go for sweets. Ts thic, justified. in your judgment. consideting that they have the job of selling their basic product? They know nutrition is in them, but they have to get the children to eat them. I am putting myself in their shoes. What iswrong with that? 1 ',.air end goal and objective 270is wise and they feel through promotional advertising they are goingto overcome the reluctance to start the day with a good bowl of cerealand a lot of milk on it and thus help children start out with a nutri-tional meal rather than an empty stomach.Dr. MAYER. Senator, Pm sure you and your wife have had thatexperience, too. If a child is not hungry in the morning it is just notfroing to eat. I think that it is perfectly true that children cannot gothrough a whole morning, and have it be a useful learning experience,unless they have either had breakfast or have a good midmorningsnack. Cereals can be a very important part of a good breakfast. Theway to make children eat breakfast is very often more painful, how- ever, than to have them watch advertisements. It may just be that youhave to get them up earlier so that they are not hnmediately con-;ronted with breakfast before they are really properly waked up.Senator PERCY. Have you tried this experiment ever?TRADITIONAL CEREALS OFTE.N THE BESTDr. MAYER. Yes, many times. Let me add that when I gave myanswer I did not mean to say that all advertising was bad becausethere are good examples of food advertising. I was saying two things:First of all, with very small children there is some ethical question asto whether selling them things rather than selling through their par-ents is a proper procedure; secondly, those particular products whichare specifically directed at children are not good nutritionally, whenif anythino..they ought to be better than those produced for other agegroups. In fact the traditional products of the cereals companies arestill very often the best. Products directed at adults are often betterthan those directed at children.Senator PERCY. We know that the American breakfast is a phenom-enon. You go around the world and you are given a choice of a conti-nental breakfast or American breakfast and the American breakfastis something we have sold to ourselves and now is being sold to the restof the world.Given the two choices, the continental breakfastcoffee and a bun orwhatever it may he and an American breakfast. ha con a nd egrq.cereal. sugar-coated or otherwise. plus milkwhich has the greatestnutritional value?Dr. MAYER. I can't help but remind the committee this all startedwith Theodore Roosevelt announcing that \"Good men eat breakfast\"and it has been an article of faith ever since. Unfortunately, the answerto the question is a little more complex than this.TYPICAL A'.IERICAN BREAKFAST ...GOOD?The typical American breakfast with bacon and eggs and cerealsand all the trimmings is, in fact, a good breakfast for children end foranyone who is gtowing; pregnant, nursing women as well as children ;but it is a very bad breakfast for you and inc in that it is a high-fat,high-cholesterol breakfast and this is not really with what we oughtto start the day. Thus, oddly enough, in many cases what one observesin a family is exactly the reverse; it is the man in the family whoeats the breakfast not desirable for him while the children are eatingbasically a high carbohydrate breakfast, or no breakfast at all. Senator PERCY. What if you are a believer in i :reakfast as I am, buta good breakfast, and you hold clown the cholesterol. I have Adin milk on my cereal, but I like natural cereal and I have encouragedone company, Quaker Oats. to come, out with it. In fact. my daughterused to make our own and they now have it packaged. I don't thinkas a matter of fact there is sugar in it.I can't help but recall that the head of the Xmerican Dental Asso-ciation addressed the Rotary Club in Chicago one time. He talked about,teeth care to adults. There were 2,000 men in that room and we, had hada very sweet., rich dessert. He said, \"I just took a glass of water :Indswished out my mouth a little bit after the meal and 95 percent or 99percent of what would be accomplished by brushing your teeth wasaccomplished by doing that. You didn't do that. You are sitting thereand that sugar is eating away in your teeth.\"I noticed gradually 2,000 men within the next 3 minutes grab a glassof water and swish it. around and I have beerdoing that ever since.Now its a natural thing.Now. to induce children to eat cereal with sugar or milk, wouldn'tit be best to complement the natural thing? If our research showedtliat by television cominercials. we could induce them to brush theirteeth or swish out their months. wouldn't that be consistent withgood nutrition and health ? Aren't some of these answers much moresimple than we might be led to believe if we just settled down tolearn more about itDr. :%fAviia. The answer is yes and no. As regards to properly purelydental questions. I would defer to the next witness or one of the 'textwitnesses, Dr. James Shaw. who is a professor in the dental schoolat Harvard. and has done actual tests with cereal.The problem of dental health is a very important aspect and I'm sureswishing water is one probable answer.' We are dealing with many cereals where. if you look at the box.you see that sugar is. in many cases. the first ingredient listed.Where there is only one cereal list d after sugar, it means that morethan 50 percent of the \"cereal\" is sugar. I am not against, the use ofsmall or modest amounts of sugar. provided proper dental healthpractices are used. except in special cases lil:e those prone to diabetes.But what we are talking about, is massive amounts of sugar. It is asobering statistic, that for the last 2 years the American people haveconsumed more sugar than it has flour, NIliCh seems almo\u00b1 incredible.The consumption of flour has gone down over the years from some-where about n00 pounds per -person-per-yea to about 105 poundsthis year. And the combination of sugar. which is on the order of 105pounds plus sugar from corn syrup. which is another 10 pounds. meanswe are operating a food supply with people eating more sugar thanflour.Again. we, are talking, about moderation versus really extraerdinaiTabuses. Particularly when you con -icier that a large part. of the popu-lation eats relatively small amounts of sugar. it means we have a lotof children where sugar becomes a gigantic proportionSenator PERCY. What you are talking about is the influence of thesugar lobby, which is almost as good as the highway lobby. I have onelast, question, and then I would like to yield to Senator Suhweiker. 979My last question is. I was quite shocked to read a statement fromthese hearings held last DecemberI read about them in Decemberand they were of worldwide interesta statement by USDA. AssistantSecretary Lyng who said we really did not know enough about thissubject to put together a reliable nutrition education program.' As a leading expert in this field of human nutrition, would you say that is a true statement, and we don't know enough yet?BOMBARDED BY DIVERGENT STATEMENTSDr. MAYR. With due respect to Mr. Lyng, who has done a really splendid job of administering food programsparticularly the foodprograms for the poor in our countryI think this is a very extremestatement. The American people are indeed constantly bombarded on the one hand by self-serving statements which are really part of adver-tising, and on the other by extreme alarmist statements by foodfaddists of various sorts. So that people are getting the feeling thatit is hard to get, nutrition information, that they don't know what tobelieve, that one person is contradicted by another. and so on. But if you stay within the nutrition community. you find that there is verygood consensus on what the nutrition message is. The Society for Nutrition Education has produced a list of recommended material forpeople to read at the family level or the professional level, and I don'tthink there is any doubt but we ought, to have very much betternutrition education components in the schools and particularly as part of the School Lunch Program than we have. After all. we have all chil- dren from the age of 6 to the age of 18 every day in school lunch-rooms. This is a great opportunity to teach nutrition by labeling thefoods they eat in terms of both nutrition and ingredients. This shouldbe supplemented lw dailyexposure to material which could be shownin the classroom without asking for additional work on the part of the teachers, who are busy teaching -the fundamentals of education. Avery large scale, very useful program could be launched, if the Depart-ment of Agriculture would give, it leadership. and a little funding.Senator PERCY. Thank you very much. Doctor. and I would like totake this opportunity to commend you for the tremendous contribu-tion you have made to this field. I think your services to this com- mittee through the years have been valuable and have played a large part in helping us move up to close the gap between the overfed and theless fed. And we are very grateful to you for your expertise and knowl- edge in this field.Dr. MAyr,u. Thank you, sir.Senator MeGovEux. I lin]: the record should show from the very beginning. Senator Percy has been the member of the committee whichhas most consistently pressed for investigation into the whole area of nutrition education and has been interested in this from the firstmonth he was on the committee. Senator Scheiker is the member ofthe committee who conducted the hearings last year and. Senator. we are glad to yield to you at this point. SIN, 72/NE2. P. 143 ..Nr Omni EFFECTS or Smut?Senator SCIIW MEE. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairma a and Sell:ator Percy. Dr. Mayer, we are pleased to have you again before thecommittee. We do appreciate, as the other Senators have said, your linecontribution fromthusarea.I would like to pursue a couple of things in your statement. We aregoing to hear subsequently, I know, from the dental people. wherewe know there is airect relationship between sugar and the effecton their profession. I just wondered. Doctor. do anv of the othereffects of sugar come to your mind in the relationship )Jetween sugar-flaored cereals and the impact on nutrition ? What other researcha real are we inestigating ?Dr. MAyEn. There are several other areas. The dental area is byfar the best established and I think this will be documented veryheavily by my colleagues. There are other dangers in consumption ofvery larre amounts of sugar. First, of all, sugar is the prototype ofempty calories; it brings in calories, but it does not bring along withit any other nutrient in terms of protein, vitamins, ninerals or enrichedfatty acids. The second reason for seeing a potential danger in verylarge amounts of sugar is some intriguing researchwhich I empha-size is at this point still research, but is very suggestive. There are sug-gestions that individuals who have a diabetic ancestry. might be muchmore likely to develop overt diabetes if they consume large amounts ofsugar than if they do not consume any sugar. This is indicated by avery particularly interesting piece of research which has been doneby a very well known investigator, by the name of Dr. Aaron Cohen,at the University of Jerusalem. Ire showed that immigrant groupscoming into Israel who had never been exposed to sugar had an extraor-dinarily low level of diabetes, while similar groups that had comeearlier, and had adopted Western food habits with large amounts ofsugar in their diet, had the 3 to ti percent incidence of diabetes. whichis seen in Western countries.Finally, there is at least one type of blood condition 1 where thereis too much fat, of various types in the blood, which instead of beinglinked as are the majority of such conditions with excessive intakeof saturated fat and cholesterol is linked with too much carbohydratesand in particular too winch sugar. So there are reasons other thandental health and \"empty calories.\" No nutritionist can really enjoywatching this mounting proportion of the calories in the dietnotnecessarily mounting amounts. because people, are tending to eat less,but, the proportion mpresented by sugar is going up and up. I don'tthink any nutritionist can look at that with equanimity.GENETIC ClIARACIERISTICS !N DIABETESSenator SCHWEIKEII. That is a very interesting statement. I previ-ously had the privilege of conducting hearings for the Subcommittee onHealth about diabetes. and your tie-in here between the amount ofI See 72/NE2A.

I appreciate your obser-vation, beea use I think: there is more to it than just dental health, eventhough this is the best, known eause-and-effect relationship.So I appreciate your remarks, we probably should have had yonat, the diabetes hearings before the Subcommittee on Health. too.One other question: You say in your statement, it malts little senseto encourage nutrition education when the battle leis already been lostby the time the 6-year-old enters school.

I think people tend toforget, that sugar was brought back from the East around the 15thCentury, and was then introduced in the Americas in the 16th. Sugaritself is an Arab word, azucar. Then sugar plantations were started bythe Portuguese in Brazil on a small scale at, the end of the 16th Centuryand the consumption of sugar was really very very low until the 19thCentury. I think the consumption of sugar in England was only about6 pounds of sur.ar per-person-per-year in 1830it is now 12 poundsper-person-per-year. Sugar is thus a new food and it is one in whichthe human system. at least many people. are not equipped to live with.Senator SCIIWEIK IL Do Americans have the highest per capita con-sumption of sugar?Dr. lf.tYrn. No, the British do, and therefore British dental healthis notorious.Senator SCHWETKER. How far down client are we?Dr. 3fAyEn. We consume somewhat less sugar than the British, butmore corn syrup. and if I add the two together, I think you arearoma 115 pounds per-person-per-year, a very high amount which 275represents about 1 percent of the food consumed by the Nation. In-cidentally 100 pounds of sugar per year is the caloric equivalent.of about 57 pounds of body fat per year. So one easy way to cut downis not to cut out carb:-..ydrates, but :MAIN SArt.}: Ix name:Senator Entr.n.

This committee might, perhaps, review in l-vertising end decide whether it has a redeeming social significance Ornot. Try perhaps, first of all, a voluntary approach to see what can beachieved by that meansparticularly with the coming of nutrition-alists laboring and, hopefully, more consciousness of the fact that nu-trition ought to be in the message.If that does not work, if the quality of nutritional advertising tochildren continues to be as poor as it. generally is I would certainlyrecommend outright ban to advertising directed to children under 6.Senator ScnwEntEn.

NIZELDr. Niz Er,. My name is Dr. Nizel and this is Dr. James Shaw. andthis is Dr. .Inan Navia. I am the only dentist on this panel. Each ofthese two gentlemen on either side of me are nutritional biochemists.who have made significant contributions in oral science.I would like to give an overview of the dental caries problem inthe \"United States today, and how it has been influenced by sugar consumption.INTRODUCTIONI would like to start by defining the word dental caries. Dentalcaries is the decay of teeth produced by a chemicoparasitic process consisting of acid demineralization and bacterial dissolution. It isa complex disease caused and influenced by many factors. The threemajor ones are a susceptible tooth, decay-producing bacteria, andfermentable dietary sugars:The organic acids that demineralize thetooth are derived from the fermentation of simple sugar such as com- mon refined table sugar or honey. These sugars are incorporatedinto a sticky bacterial film called dental plaque. that adheres to the tooth surface.Incidentally, swishing and swallowing, as was mentioned. prev- iously is not an acceptable method of removing the adherent dentalplaque. Swishing will only remove loose food debris. Only brushingwill remove dental plaque.Dental cavities result from an interaction of at least three factors:1. A caries-susceptible toothwhich is one that. has not beenexposed to adequate amounts of fluorides:2. An accumulation of dental plaque bacteria on the tooth surface;3. Eating or drinking suga -rich foods such as candies, cakes, soft drinks, et cetera.PREVALENCE OF DENTAL DECAY IN THE UNITED STATESThe English word caries is derived from the Latin (mitts, whichmeans rotten. Thus the word.dental caries very aptly describes themost prevalent, nutritional problem in the United States today, namelyrotting teeth. Dental caries affects 98 percent of the people, of theUnited States at some time during their lifetime, more particularly during the firs\" 35 years of life. It is not a life endangering disease,but it can he extremely troublesom:. incapacitating and expensive. It can cause pain, infection, facial disfigurement, chewing impairment.speech impairment and malnutrition.According trhe last comprehensive Government, survey in theearly 1960's, the average adult has about 18 \"yed, missing or filled teeth out of a posQible 32 natural teeth.' A slitof men at. induction centers showed 'Ant the average inductee needed one extraction andabout six restorations among other types of dental services.=The American Dental Association has 104.000 members 3):U(11111remy keen interest on the snbject of sugar and dental caries. They havet C.S. Deot of Health. Education and Filled Teeth In Aildit:. Health Statkties 4 (1967).Personal Commaalen Lon. 277not adopted a specific policy on my recommendations but they do havetheir own recommendations which were first made known in theJournal of the American Dental Association in 1953.In 19(7, expenditures for dental care in the United States totaledabout $4.7 billion and only 40 percent of the population saw dentiststhat year.3 Of this $1.7 billion, about $2 billion was spent for repairof decayed teeth and it is estimated that it would cost $,S billion moreannually to repair completely the damage caused by caries. Even ifadequate funds were available, we don't have enough trained profes--sional personnel to cope with soch a rapidly developing disease. Itis said that this disease develops so rapidly that if all the 100,000dentists in the United- States restored decayed teeth day and night.365 days a year, as many new cavities would have formed at the endof the year as were just restored during the previous year.SOLUTION OF PROBLF.31$ THROUGH PREVENTIoN AND CONTROLThe solution to this problem. then. is prevention and control ratherthan repair. In other words. we should spend more of our intellectualenergies and financial resources in finding and dealing with the causesrather than the of ect4 of this ubiquitous disease.Sonic real progress in dental caries prevention has been made in thelast. decade as a result of fluoridating public water supplies, the useof professionall3 applied topical fluorides and the teaching of plaquecontrol. However. little if any progress has been made in terms of edu-cating and counselingg patients in food and nutrition as they relate todental health. Yet all three of these factors (fluorides, plaque controland dietary advice) must be given equal emphasis to reduce signif-icant lv the init intion or development of dental caries.Forty-three. percent of all the people in the United States drinkfrom fluoridated water supplies.4 It is fair to assume that almost everydentist of the United States can and will apply topical fluorides to theteeth of his consenting patients.It is also fair to assume that more people today than ever before areaware and doing more about brushing and flossinr- their teeth to re-move dental plaque. This has occurred as a result of the active educa-tional campaips in preventive dentistry provided the dental pro-fession by the Armed Forces, dental schools and dental societies suchas the American E2ntal Association and the American Society forPreventive Dentistry.So far. the weakest link in this triad of dental caries prevention isthe lock of nutrition edneat;an and ga;dance with respect to decreas-ing sugar-sweetened snacks and more acceptable, morenutritious alternatives.Evun:mt or SucAn/lIumAx DENTAL CAulLs INTEnnELATioNsiiirThere is an abundance of epidemiological and experimental evidencethat indicates that sugar unquestionably is the principal cariogenicagent in the dietor as Dr. Newbrun says, \"the arch criminal of dentalcaries.\" Sof Health. Fdaeation and Welfare. \"Selected Dental Findings and Sec: State. 19G0-19112.\" Vititl and HenIth Statistics 6 (1M).U.S. Fluoridation Picture After 23 years. 3. Amer. Dent. Assoc. 80: 756, 1970. a278Epidemiologically, a clear relation between national usage of sugarand the increased incidence of dental caries has been demonstrated.For example, 20-24-year-old civilians living in the Near East and FarEast countries who consume an average of 6-19 kilograms of sugarper-person-per-year experienced a decay rate of 0.6 to 5.0 teeth.Whereas, in South American natives where the consumption of sugarvaries from 23-44 kilograms per person, per year, their decay rate iscorrespondingly higher, starting at 8.4 and going as high as 12.16teeth .\u00b0There have been several surveys showing significantly increaseddental caries experience in Eskimos and African tribesmen who wereoriginally exposed to primitive foods and dietary practices and sub-sequently changed to modern types of refined foods. particularlysugars. Another example of the dental health penalties of the so-calledcivilized diets was seen in natives living on an island. Tristan da Cun-ha. In 1938. the diet of the natives of this island consisted of two staples.potatoes and fish but no sugar. Not. a single first permanent cationsmolar was found in any of the young people under the age of 20. In1962. Dr. Holloway went back and found that they were consumingan average of one pound of sugar per week, per person with the resultthat a comparable age group showed 50 percent of their molars to thecarions.GIn Norway during World War II. there was food rationing whichincluded a reduction in consumption of sugar and refilled carbohy-drates with a concurrent increased consumption of potatoes. vegetables.milk and bread. A progreSsive decrease in occurrence of caries wasassociated with these forced dietary changes from 1942 to 1946. How-ever, the caries incidence began to rise in 1947 and 194S as the restric-tion of sweets were lifted.?There have been a couple of institutional studiesan orphan:1,v inAustralia 8 and a mental hospital in Sweden 0 where sugar intake wasclosely supervised and correlated with dental caries development.They were able to clearly demonstrate that the less the sugar intake, thelower the dental caries. Some of the important conclusions that weredrawn from the Swedish study were that although excessive amountsof sugar were dentally deleterious, the form of the sweets (retentiveworse than nonretentive) and the frequency of between meal usagewere the prime factors in promoting caries activity.Them have been several other studies '\u00b0 that have underscored thefact that frequent between-meals eating of sugar-sweetened snacks pro-motes caries production significantly. The reason is that each time thedental plaque on the tooth surface is exposed to sweets 20-30 minutesof acid is produced. Thus, if 5 lozenges. breath mints or cough dropswere eaten one after another within a space of 15 minutes. they mightproduce only 35 minutes of acid. On the other hand, if the same num-ber were each eaten 20 minutes apart, they probably would produce atleast. 100 minutes of acid.Ruscril. A. L.

We must do something in the areaof improving the nutritious value of the snack pro!_rram from a dentalstandpoint. One suggestion is that these snacks be fortified with ananticaries agentphosphatesto decrease the dental decay hazard.Senator McGovEnx. Dr. Nizel, in that connection you have beentalking about the danger of breath mints. What about these spraysthat are on the market designed to sweeten your breath. Do you thinkthey have any bad effect on teeth ?\"CERTS DENTAL DISEASE'.Dr. NIZEL. We don't have any evidence that there is any deleteriouseffect from a. dental standpoint, none at all. But since commercialnames have been mentioned here previously, T mast record :in observa-tion that my dental colleagues and I have noted with some alarm--namely \"Celts Dental Disease.\" People who continuously pop breathmints into their mouth develop &mineralized areas on the drum linearea of the teeth which becomes carious.Senator McGovEnx. Using these little Certs or other similarproducts?Dr. Nrzam.The statistics in sugar consumption in the United States has in-creased dramatically over the last 150 years. We started with 10pounds in 1821 and we are now consuming up to well over 100 poundsper-person-per-year, which amounts to about 2 pounds per capita perweek.The American Dental Association issued some resolves on sugarand dental caries, I will read two of these.First they resolved that the association recommend that dentalsocieties call to the attention of their patients this information onsugar and dental caries. And, second, the association emphasized theresponsibility of manufacturers of sweetened beverages and confee-tions for devising suitable methods for eliminating the dental healthhazards associated with the consumption of their product.Speaking of the stand of the American Dental Association on thesetypes of issues. I also want to brill!, to the attention of this committeethat last year there was passed by Congress the National SchoolLunch Art. In the course of extending that act. Congress restrictedthe ion!, established authority of the Department of Agrieultnre toregulate the sale of food items that would he in competition withthe program authorized under he Child Nutrition and School LunchProgram. Congress thus has opened the door to the placement of vend-inn- machines offering sunlir laden foods which have no real nutri-tional value in elementary schools. These will be sold of course indirect competition with balanced nutritious 'midi programs. We arethen ruing to be asking onr youngsters to make a ehoire betweencandies and rakes which can harm their dental health. and nutritious,well - balanced quality meals provided by the school lunch program.I think this is most unfortunate and the American Dental Associa-tion and other groups did make an effort last year to continue the orig-inal authority of the Department of Agriculture in this matter. How-ever, the effort was unsuccessful.I would make a plea to the committee to take such steps as it canto persuade Congress to reconsider its actions of last year. 280Senator Mc Gomm. In that. connection, Dr. Nizel. is there an alter-native possibility of leaving the vending maehines, but setting guide-lines as to the kind of products that can be put in them?Dr. Nina,. Yes. I would think that that would be a suitable alter-native. setting guidelines as to which foods or snacks are desirable.Senator McGovEnx. See that nutritious foods and snacks are used.Dr. Nrzta.. Yes: I would think it would be difficult to eliminatesnacks entirely. However. I feel that nutritious nonsugar sweetenedsnacks 5110111(1 be the type put into vending machines.To continue with my prepared statement : Sugar sweetened liquidsas well as solid sweets will stimulate the formation and growth ofsticky dental plaque as well as the multiplication of caries-producingbacteria.A. recently controlled experiment with children who consumed 12ounces of soft. drink a day for 3 years showed t .at. they suffered in certain teeth as much as 50-150 percent more decay than anothergroup who drank water. On the whole. the decay rate tended to behigher in the soft, drink consuming group compared with the water-drinking group.\"The conclusions then, that one might draw from these studies, are:1. Population groups that consume large amounts of sugarwill experience much dental decay;2. The quantity of sugar ingested is not the most importantfacto in dental caries causation ;:3. Rather it. is the frequent eating of even minute amounts ofsugar confections or sugar sweetened drinks between meals thatis most important.STATISTICS OX SUGAR CONSUMPTION IN THE 'UNITED STATESThe increase of the per capita consumption of sugar in the UnitedStates has been considerable during the last 150 years. In 1S21, theannual per capita consumption of sugar in the United States wasabout 10 pounds. whereas by 1931 it had grown to almost 108 pounds.\"'The ingestion of this high amount of about 2 pounds per-week-per-person, has continued on for the past 40 years. One indication of howrapidly sugar consumption is increasing in the United States is shownby the amount used by food processors. In 1963 industrial food proc-essors used 3.8 million tons or S billion pounds of sugar; whereas in1961, S.S million tons or approximately 12 billion pounds were usedan increase of :33 percent in 4 years.\"Sugar is the primary ingredient in a number of food products thatare widely consumed in large amounts. Sugar is the primary ingredi-ent in baked goods, confections, beverages, preserved fruits and otherprepared food items. In 1969, the per capita consumption of candy inthe United States was 19.8 pounds: of carbonated beverages 4508-ounce cans; and of chewing gum, 135 sticks. These three productareas alone account for almost 5 pounds of 100 pounds of per-capitaconsumption. rrStelnIterg et el.

Children and particularly adolescents are the most caries - susceptible group. They also have the highest sugar intake and eat the poorest quality diets.2. Over the last 10 years, my students and I have done thousandsof diet evaluations on patients with rampant caries. We never have found a single patient whose caries problem could not. in part, be traced to the patient's inordinate consumption of sugar. 3. The estimated average number of between meal exposures to sugar sweetened snacks in caries susceptible individuals rangesbetween 5-8 per day.4. Sugar sweetened beverages, sugar sweetened chewing gum and hard sucking type candies such as life savers, cough drops or breath mints are the worst offenders. Television advertising ofthese products certainly influences their increased usage. 5. The children's knowledge about nutrition acquired from sec- ondary school systems is extremely inadequate. RECOMMENDATIONSMy recommendations, as result of my own observations. personalexperience and the literature fall into four areaslabeling, advertis-ing, education, and research.1. WARNING LABEISI believe that as the FTC has already done health warning labelson cigarette packages, so should they require manufacturers to labelevery package of sugar-sweetened life savers, cough drops. breathmints, candies, chewing gum and soft drinks with a statement warn- ing the user that excessive frequent daily use of these products can produce significant amounts of dental plaque and dental decay.I have found so ninny people in my practice who don't realize that cough drops are made almost exclusively of sugar and that frequent use can cause cavities. I think it is important that this information becommunicated to the user via warning labels.Furthermore, we ought to label the types and amounts of carbo-hydratesstarch, sucrose, glucosethat are present in processed foodsjust like the types of fats (saturated and unsaturated) are being iden- tified. Not all carbohydrates are equally caries producing, starches being very much less so. We ought to provide the public with this type of information. Just as they are being informed about the types of fats, they ought to be informed as to which kind and what percentage of carbohydrate is sugar and what percentage is starch. 2. ADVERTISINGI would think the FDA and FTC would require whole truths when advertising the. health value of sugar and sugar products. Misleadinp. statements like \"Sugar, it isn't just-good flavor; it's good food,\" which 282touts quick energy but does not describe its tooth decaying properties,is not telling the whole truth about. its effects on health.And I would think we should ban the advertising of sugar sweet-ened products on children's television programs.z. Eouc.vnoxI think the fine bill of Senator Schweiker which provides for grantsfor nutrition education programs in medical and dental schools is astep in the right direction.Encouraging the teaching of nutrition inmedical and dental schools will provide the physicians and dentistswith an understanding of the inter-relationship between the scienceof nutrition and health problems. It will help physicians and dentistsassess the nutritional statusof their patients, prescribe proper diets,and deal knowledgeably with food fads, misinformation and myths.Better nutrition education programs are needed especially at thehigh school and college levels. Professional nutrition educators, not.health teachers, should be hired for these purposes.4. ursEAuciiA ()Teat deal of medical nutritional advances came out of the studyat Framinr1iam, Mass., on diet and heart disease. Similarly, a greatdeal of information can come out of extensive long-term clinicalstudy diet and oral health. Financial support by the Governrfient forsuch a dental nutrition research program is very much needed andhighly recommended.Clinical research should be supported for testing reasonably ac-ceptable sugar substitutes such as miraculin, a protein, and the useof caries inhibiting additives to sugar products such as phosphates.My colleague on the left and I, who both trained at MIT were thefirst trainees of the oral science department where we researched theeffect of dietary supplements of phosphate on reducing dental decay.We think that sugar, for example, might be able to be convertedfrom what is otherwise a caries - producing substance into a relativecaries inhibitory substance by the addition of phosphates.Senator Mc GovERN. Thank you very much, Dr. Nizel. I won't ques-tion further until we hear from your colleagues. but I do want to askwhether or not the recommendations you have made. here are sup-ported by the American Dental Association, as well as your own per-sonal view.Dr. Nint. These recommendations are my personal recommenda-tions. The Dental Association has not taken any formal action on anyof these recommendations at this point. However, I do understand thatthey will be discussing this matter in the very near future. On thebasis of their past action, I feel sure that they will endorse most, if notall, of my recommendations; but at the moment they have not endorsedthese pa rt i cul a r recommendations.Senator McGovEaN. Dr. Shaw, we will be happy to hear from you.Dr. Shaw is Professor of Nutrition, Harvard School of DentalMedicine. 283STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES H. SHAWDr. SHAW. Thank you, Senator McGovern. It is a privilege to be here today, and I am really grateful that our Senate in the United States isconcerned with matters like this and are willing to take the time andenergy to meet to hear opinions like this. Much of what I said in thestatement about causes of tooth decay duplicates what Dr. Nizel hasalready said. Though I came into the field from: a different angle than lie did, he as a clinician and I as an experimental scientist, the het thatwe agree so completely without checking ourstatements in advance is a good example of the unanimity there is within this field on this subject. Senator McGovERN. I might say and also Dr. Navia, that if you wish to just hit the highlights of anything you would like to add in the way of supplementary observations, we do have your prepared statements 1 and they will be made a part of the record, but if you prefer you can just summarize those parts that need to be reinforced.Dr. SHAW. That is what I thought I would do, in view of the value of your time. I would like to particularly emphasize what Dr. Nizel has stated, that the frequency of consumption of sugar-containing prod-ucts and the concentration of sugar are undoubtedly pivotal matters. The degree to which these materials are retained in the mouth and on the tooth surfaces certainly are the elements which determine whether or not a confectionary item is going to be cariogenic or nots20ne area in which both Dr. Navia and I have had considerable experience and we both agree insufficient research has been done is to determine theexact cariogenic capability of specific foods and items. In both our laboratories and those of Dr. Bibby at Eastman Dental Center, we have resear under way to try ana make evaluations of the caries- producing ability of specific foods. These studies are relatively early stages. In our own laboratories at Harvard, we have made some com- parisons between standard varieties on the market of the sugar coatedbreakfast cereals versus the traditional types of breakfast cereals.We have been feeding these materials as individual meals. In otherwords, the cereal wasn't mixed up with the total diet, but was fed separately either alone or with milk. It is very clear from our studies that the sugar coated cereals are much more cariogenic even when milk is added than is the case with regard to the traditional cereals.As far as the amount of sugar consumption in the United States,certainly it has become fantastically high. I comment in my statement that the total amount of sucrose that is available for human consump- tion is over 100 pounds per year. If you figure this out on the average consumption per person per day, it works out to something like 500 calories per man, woman, anViiild. If you are an ordinary sedentary professor, sugar is going to'%upply something like a quarter of your total amount of calories in a day's time. I don't think anybody in the nutrition field would seriously question my statement that this is far too much in any sort of well-balanced nutritional diet.Senator McGovzitx Dr. Shaw, I wonder if I could stop you there. I just have been handed a news release that comes from one of theI See prepared statements, p. 2SS and p. 294. 91-722-73pt. 3-3 284cereal companies, General Mills. It is very short and I wAilkl like toread it to you and have you comment on it. This is dated March 5,1973, \"Statement on Cereals and Caries.\" It reads:To our knowledge there is no published evidence available to indicate thatpresweetened cereals, or cereals in general, cause caries in humans. This is notsurprising, as sugar consumption from cereals is only a sma31 proportion of totalsugar intake. Presweetened cereals account for less than 2 percent of the totalsugar consumption in the United States and less than 3 ^ :cent of total sugarconsumed by children.I wonder if you care to comment on that?DATA Too NEW FOR FORMAL PUBLICATIONDr. SHAW. The statement is certainly correct that Owe is no pub-lished data specifically on humans in the subject. It is very difficultand expensive to do clinical studies where a single food like this istested. And when I speak of having made tests, it is with animalswhere we fed the sugar-coated breakfast cereals as a specific meal orseveral meals during the day in well-controlled experiments. Thesedata are not published either simply because we have only collectedthis information in the last few months. There just hasn't been timefor them to get into formal channels of scientific publications.Senator MCGOVERN. Is there any question in your mind or in theminds of any of you three gentlemen about the harmful effect in theuse of these sugar-coated cereals, as far as dental health is concerned? Dr. SIIAW. My concern is that sugar-coated cereals are just anexample of many items in the typical American diet. I have no ideaof whether only 2 percent of sugar consumption from sugar-coatedcereals is factual or not. I am just concerned that here is another wayin which a considerable amount of sugar is available. I think that thisexhibit over here with 25 or 30 cereal products that contain 50-percentsugar or more is a tragic example of how a tremendous number ofthings are being put into the hands of the public which in themselvesare not so terribly bad, but which exemplify the trends which influence our entire nutritional pattern. The multiplicity of such products leadsus to heavy sucrose consumption beyond the level which is judiciousfor any purpose.Dr. NMI.. Senator, in answer to your question, I would like to makea comment. I think Dr. Shaw and I have both pointed out that it isthe frequency of eating these things that is the important thing. I alsoindicated that small amounts or a few grains of sugar at frequentintervals is just as had as large amounts. The thing that we are reallyconcerned about in the process of dental decay is the repeated toothdemineralization exposure time to even small amounts of sugar. So,it is not the fact,that it is only 2 percent of the total sugar consumedbut how often the child will snack on these sugar sweetened cereals.So it is the frequency of between-meal eating of these things that isreally the crux of the whole situation, as far as dental health is con-cerned. How else are we going to help the youngster to avoid 'mingthese small amounts of sugar sweetened snacks unless we ban themor, at least, inform them of their potential dental hazard in the firstiplace? So it is definitely the frequency and not the amount. Two per-cent of the sugar intake per year represents 2 pounds of sugar peryear. There are millions of grains of sugar in 2 pounds. It takes only 285a few grains in contact with dental plaque to produce dental decay.Senator MCGOVERN. Dr. Mayer testified a few minutes ago he wasexpressing his own personal feeling that we would be better oil eat-ing the old style of cereals of wheat, corn, rice and things of that kind.He was looking at it from a standpoint of dietary effect on the bodyas a whole. Would you make the same judgment about the toothaspects or the dental aspects of it, that we would be better off with theold style cereals and cooked cereals?Dr. Nrain. Yes, cooked cereals in general would be better thansugar-coated ready-to-eat cereals as far as dental health is concerned.The issue that concerns me is that the sugar- coated cereals are used assnack foods between meals; which is very bad from a dental healthstandpoint.Senator McGovnax. Dr. Shaw?HIDDEN SUGAR...Thincimmon SnounDDr. SHAW. I am concerned about the amount of sugar which ishidden and unknown to the consumer. Many of the baby foods, andmany other kinds of manufactured foods contain substantial amountsof sugar beyond what is necessary for normal flavoring. It seems to me that one of the things that should be in the labeling act is a re-quirement that the percentage of sugar in every product should belabeled rather than, or in addition to the percentage of carbohydrates.I think that if you look across the American scene today, it is reallytragic the number of breakfast programs which are supported by the Federal Government, for example, where a kind of sweetened cake isgiven to the youngsters rather than a real breakfast. If you look at these on the basis of protein and vitamins and mineral content, theyare not bad nutritionally. The trouble is, in order to make themattractive, they have been made into cake form with icing and so forth in the hope the youngster will eat them.They have the additional feature of being very handy for the ad- ministrators of the programs; but again, it is a way in which the youngsters are being confronted with something sweet on the basis of here is something that is really good for you. This action consti- tutes an endorsement of high-sugar content as a desirable feature in food.SUGAR IS NOT A FOODI think this kind of ad in the November issue of the National Geo-graphic, for example, is one to which your committee should addressitself. This advertisement was produced by Sugar Information. Thisis after Sugar Information was presented to modify its advertisingprograms. I regret the continued use of slogans such as \"Sugar,it isn't just good flavor, it is good food.\" The ad shows a handsome black youngster eating some kind of sugary confectionery item. I donot believe that sugar is a food.Senator McGovEax. Who sponsored that ad ?Dr. Slimy. It was sponsored by Sugar Information, General P. 0.Box 94, New York, N.Y. There was another one in the series in the Reader's Digest of Deeember 1972. which was quite different with re- gard to the picture, but the message was basically the same. I think here again, it is a matter of sugar being advertised as good food andtherefore the amounts consumed tend to creep up when basically thelevel is already far beyond what is desirable.One of the points that I think your committee should not overlookis the fact that optimal fluoride ingestion and fluoridation of thewater supply is not the complete answer to the dental caries problem.There is a. common fallacy today that you don't have to worry aboutanything else. By reason of the fact that fluoride ingestion duringtooth develor'aent builds up caries resistance, it is true that teeth aremore resistant to the oral impact. However, they are not so resistantthat, if the sugar level is high, and frequency of sugar usage is high,you are not still going to have high caries index. By cutting downsugar consumption and particularly the undesirable forms of sugar,you can add to the benefits that are available from fluoridation of pub-lic water supplies.During the past 3 years, I had the opportunity to serve on an inter-national committee in which an international union of nutritionalscientists were seeking to explore the amount of nutrition teaching inmedical and dental schools. It was particularly true in the UnitedStates, but to sonic extent around the world; there was very low em-phasis upon nutrition teaching in medical and dental schools. Nowthere is considerable variation among schools, so I don't want thisgeneralization to be taken as there is no school that doesn't do a goodjob, but by and large the average is there is much less nutrition educa-tion than is desirable for dental students and dental hygiene students.One thing that we often forget is that, tral.rically, even the mostcarefully prepared fillings and bridges do not prevent the occurrenceof more tooth decay. Only the teaching and the practice of preventivedentistry is effective in reducing the frequency of oral diseases. Theteaching of nutrition in its basic science and applied phases is a veryimportant facet which urgently needs strong emphasis in the dentalcurriculum. Unlike diptheria or tuberculosis, once you have clearedup the original problem, the body has built up immunity. But this is not true as far as tooth decay. It is interesting the extent to which our:students are asking for more nutrition education, than was true a gen-eration ago when I- entered the field.The recommendations that I would like to leave with you are aslisted in my prepared statement.' However, first, I am very gratefulfor Senate Bill 324 that was introduced by Senator Schweiker ofPennsylvania because I believe it represents a constructive approachto the need for more nutrition teaching in dental and medical schools.Practically all, if not all, dental schools are understaffed with regardto sufficient qualified faculty and auxiliary personnel to teach thebasic and applied phases of nutrition. I really trust that Congress willenact S. 324. Further, f suggest that adequate provision in the finalversion be made in this bill for training whatever additional person-nel may be needed to staff the new positions.Second. nutrition teaching needs to be increased at all levels of edu-cational experience, not only in theoretical terms but in the day-to-daypractical experience such as the design and quality of meals served inbreakfast and lunch programs, and t' availability of fruits, nuts, cheese, and other non-cariogemc, low sugar items for snacks fromI See prepared statement, pp. 289-90..1/ food dispensers, rather than the currently available candy, cookies,and sweetened soft drinks. This gets back to the earlier question ofwhether alternatives are available. I believe that they are.Third, advertising in all media, but especially those ads on televi-sion aimed at children, to promote the use of sugar, heavily sweetenedfoods, such as sugar coated breakfast cereals, and candy and otherconfectionery items need to be sharply curtailed. Those allowed foruse should be factual with respect to nutrition in the broadest sense.Fourth, the media, and especially television at times when childrenand homemakers' programs are aired, should be encouraged to carrymore attractive and constructive information, on nutrition and spe-cific subjects such as fluoridation, than is currently the case.Fifth, more information needs to be collected on the earies-prodne-ing capability of specific, foods and on the specific caries-producingcapability of individual sugars and mixtures of sugars.Sixth, manufacturers of foods and confectionery items need en-couragement to search with diligence for ways to reduce the amountsof sucrose, in particular, and probably all sugars in their products.This reduction will require the search for other sweetening agentsand for other compounds to make their products organoleptieally sat-isfactory to the American public. I believe that a. wide variety of foodsand confectionery items can be developed with significantly lowersugar concentrations which are highly pleasing to the American pub-lic and which are simultaneously much less cariogenic.Seventh, Senate Bill 805 introduced by Senator Moss to establish aNational Institute of Marketing and Health contains an interestingconcept. Certainly- a greater need exists for supervision and planningof the kind of marketing and advertising than currently exists in theUnited States. I do not feel competently informed to comment on thewisdom of enacting this legislation. I shall await with interest thefurther discussion of this bill.Eighth, product labeling must include percentage of sugars as wellas percentage of carbohydrates. I think this is imperative in a truthfuladvertising campaign today, in view of the problems of sugar andhealth. Another recommendation which I am reminded to make aboutpackaging, and one which my wife is a strong proponent ofnamely,the prohibition of offers of giveaways or price-reduced merchandise onfood packages or gifts within packages. I don't think that there is oneof these cereal boxes over here which doesn't have some giveaway offer.I think when a package is put on the market, it should have to sell it-self, because of what is contained i.. it. The package should not be pur-chased to obtain some item at a lower cost or free. These \"gifts\" en-courage families, and particularly the children, to want the \"gift\"whether it be a plastic something or other, that dances or bobs, orwhether it is vegetable or flower seeds or plants. This concept shouldbe changed in our advertising scheme.In conclusion I would like to speak of one organization that I thinkdeserves commendation and that is the Nutrition Foundation, which issupported by many of the food industries. I think this foundation overthe years has done a tremendous lot of good on the American scene.I myself am very grateful for the funds they provided in our labora-tory for research and I think Dr. Nizel also has received funds fromthis foundation for teaching within the dental school framework. One of the things I think also needs to be emphasized here is thr.t thefortification of many cereal products with vitamins and minerals isa desire, that is really deceiving, to make up for the hollowness of theproducts that have been introduced by the heavy use of sugar. How-ever, nutritionally the real problem is that this addition of vitaminsand minerals doesn't in any way counteract the influence of the highsugar content.PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES II. SliAWCAUSES or TOOTH DECAYTooth decay results from the action of products of bacterial metabolism ontooth substance. The oral microorganisms causing tooth decay colonize the pitsand fissures of the chewing surfaces of teeth, the interproximal surfaces wherethe teeth touch each other and under some circumstances the smooth surfacesas well. These microorganisms require readily fermentable carbohydrates (simplesugars) in order to metabolize actively. Tooth decay progresses in proportionto the length of time per day that the decapprmincing micmorganistus ::re :ie.Lively metabolizing. The pits and fissures and the spaces between teeth arenatural traps for food where microorganisms metabolize food components to pro.duce products which are related in amount and natut.! to the composition ofthe food.Studies with human subjects over the past 40 years have shown that boththe levels of consumption of the simple sugars and the frequency of their con-sumption are directly correlated with the incidence of tooth decay. Probably thebest investigation of this kind was conducted in a statesupported institutionat Vipeholtn, Sweden at the end of World War II. The findings clearly Judie:lidthat tooth decay was definitely related to sugar consumption, with itebetween-meal smirks being particularly harmful. In addition. such confectionary itemsas toffees and caramels which were both high in sugar and of such a stickyconsistency as to be retained in the mouth and on the tooth surfaces wereespeetally capable of producing carious lesions.Clinical studies are diffieult and expensive to conduct. Laboratory InvestigaMug with experimental animals, particularly rodents, have been specially helpful to examine, corroborate and extend data obtained from human subjeetsand to evaluate potential carbsreventing agents.Animal assays and clinical studies without exception indicate that tooth doe**experience earn be greatly reduced if less sugar Is consumed and If It fg eateattnedless frequently. If the foods and confections which contain high amounts of sugarand which by reason of their consistency are retained in the mouth and par-tintlarly on tooth surfaces were consumed less frequently or were eliminatedfrom the diet, tooth decay in man unquestionably would decrease by ImprevgIveamounts. Many items which are consumed as inbetweenmeal anocks are emiedaily likely to he problems : Cake. cookies. candy, Jellies. and jams. The frequencyof snack consumption plus the kinds of Items consumed coupled with the mi.likeliness of subsequent 0-al hygiene cause items in these eategories to be es.peeially serious. Heavily sugared Items such as frosted breakfast cereals. iceddoughnuts. and sweet rolls also undoubtedly contribute to the high caries activityin our minim*.At present insufficient research has been done to give exact earlogeoleto specific foods and eonfections. A new era of emphasis to collect this kind ofdata is underway as a result of Congress funding the national carieg program--- -a meaningful effort to bring the best information from the research laboratoryand the clinic to bear for the prevention of tooth decay in our Notleu. tworthis poneorshlp. studies to evaluate the specific cariesrodueing ability of in-dividual foods or eonfeetionary items are just beginning in several !shot-91.011es:Dr. Navin at the University of Alabama.

It isvery (dear that items such as sugftr.coated breakfast cereals are much morecm-impute Hon breakfast cereals which have not been sweetened as extensively.Also, cookies of various kinds are much more capable of producing caries thansoda crackers. 289LEVEL or SUCROSE IN TIM AMERICAN METSucrose (table sugar) is the most common sugar in the human diet because ofthe heavy dependence of the food and candy industry upon this compound as asweetening agent and to Owl body and texture in many products. In the neighbor-hood of 100 pounds of sucrose is available annually for human conga:motion byevery wan. woman. child, and infant in the United States. If evenly distributedthroughout the population. this level of consumption would provide about 500calories peer day per capita or one-sixth to one-fourth of our total caloric needs.Additional st:gar is present in the diet: laniese from milk and ice cream, glucoseand fructose from honey. fruits and vegetables. However, the amaunts of thesesugars consumed are far lower than that for sucrose. No clinical or laboratorydata whatever are available to support t..e (Met heard claims that raw sugar.brown sugar, honey, and maple syrup are any less cariogenic than products withcomparable amounts of refined sucrose.With the heavy usage of sugar in the preparation of baby foods and many foodswhere the added sugar is not an essential for reservation or even for a good nat-ural taste, we are conditioned throughout life to sweeter foods than is nutrition-ally desirable. Many foods are consumed without recognition by the user thatsuor has been added unnecessarily in processing. Product labeling is limitedto tiab total percentage of carbohydrates rather than to a breakdown into starchand simple sugars. While \"hidden sugar constitutes a sizable portion of the total.the average man. woman. or child is responsible for adding still more to hisfood intake its a variety of ways.Yet we are constantly being barraged by attractive and not so subtle advertis-ing that \"sugar isn't just good flavor: it's good food: it is quick energy.\" and soforth. even though sugar provides only calories and requires maby other nutrientsfor its metabolism.RELATION or' FLUORIDE INGESTION AND SUGAR RESTRICTION IN CARIES PREVENTIONThe consumption of adequate amounts of fluoride during tooth developmentresults In teeth which are nitwit :mire resistant to attack by cartes-produingmicroorganisms than teeth which are forty 'l with inadequate fluoride. Restric-tions In sugar consumption aid in the ..tertanee of teeth after they have Conned and erupted into the nuadh. These two procedures eomplemeut each otherby helping to prevent tooth decay through two separate pathways.We must continue to press for fluoridation of public water supplies until thepeople in every community have this benefit. At the same time. every bit of preg-Fess in the restriction of sugar consumption espial:01y in those forms and atthose tines which are most caries producing will add to the caries reductions at-tributable to fluoride ingestion alone.NI:v.41110N EDUCATION IN MEDICAL AND DENTAL ScnootsNat only Ithe United States but throughout the world. much less than theneeded emp. asis is placed upon the teaching of nutrition to medical and dentalstudents. Numerous surveys in recent years have indicated the inadequateamount of nutrition instruction that is provided to the &Mal students and dentalhygiene students in most schools in the United States. Instead. the emphasis isapor: reparative technics.. Tragically. even the most carefully prepared fillingsand bridges do not prevent the occurrence of mow tooth decay. Only the teachingand Gab practice of preventive dentistry is effective in reducing the ftrqueheyof oral diseases. The Notating of nutrition in its bask Mence and applied phasesis a very Imp.ant faeet which urgently needs strong emphasis in the dentalcurriculum.RECOMMENDATIONSI. S. 321 represents a constructive approach to the need for more nutritionteaching in dental and medical schools. Practically all, if not all. dental schoolsare understaffed with regard to sufficient qualified faculty and auxiliary per-sonnel to teach the baste and applied components of nutrition. I trust that Con-gress will enact S.:124. Further, I suggest that adequate provision he made in thisbill for training whatever additional personnel may be needed to staff the rabpositions.2. Nutrition teaching needs to 2 -s' inereassed at all levels of the educationalexperience, not only in theoretical terms but in the day-to-day practical expe-rience such as the design and quality of meals ser:ed in breakfast and hunt 90programs, and the availability of fruits, nuts. 0 4 , and othertioncariogenic.low sugar items for snacks from food dispenser -, rather than the currentlyavailable candy, cookies, and sweetened soft drinks.3. Advertising in all media, but especially those ads on television aimed atchildren, to promote the use of sugar, heavily sweetened foods. such as sugar-coated breakfast cereals, and candy and other confectionery items need to be sharply curtailed. Those allowed for use should be factual with respect tonutrition in the broadest sense.4. The media, and especially television at times when children and home-makers' programs are aired, should be encouraged to carry much more attractiveand constructive information on nutrition anespeciflc subjects such as fluorida-tion, than is currently the case.5. More information needs to be collected on the caries - producing capabilityof specific foods and on the specific caries-producing capability of individualsugars and mixtures of sugars.6.

This reduction will require the searchfor other sweetening agents and for other conqxninds to make their products orgatu,leptically satisfactory to the American public. I believe that a wide varietyof foods and confectionery items can be developed with signicantly loner sugarconcentrations which are highly pleasing to the American public and which aresimultaneously much less cariogenic.T. S. 805 to establish a National Institute of Marketing and Health containsan interesting concept.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator Schwei-ker. ladies and gentlemen. I am especially delighted to be here. Mygoal as a teacher is to pass on information. hopefully expecting toproduce some ,:hange, in my students. Today I hope to pass on infor-mation to a group of people that certainly are able to do somethingconcrete for the health of the peop:e. in our country. I am therefor'especially delighted to be here.In view of the fact that I probably have only a few minutes. andthat my colleagues have already stated quite a lot of my own think-ing, I will emphasize two or three points that I feel add another di-mension to the problem of nutrition and oral diseases and oral health.Ntrrurnos OF SPECIAL RELEVANCE TO ORAL DISEASESI want the committee to realize that to oral tissues, nutrition is ofspecial relevance, not only because of their own sp' fic requirements,but because these tissues come in contact with fc 'trice:1. Once directly, when they are masticated 1 .e oral cavity;and2. A second time when, after digestion and absorption, the nu-trients return by way of the circulatory system to nourish thesetissues. 4 991'I'iienutrient composition of foods in the diet can influence- teethat two distinct stages. Preeruptively the chemical composition. as wellas the eruption time of teeth. may be affected. During this period. nu-trients in the diet can also select a pathogenic bacterial flora by enrich-ment of the environment and thus facilitate later the impl. citationtnd colonization of these microorganisms on the enamel su. face oferupting teeth.Posteruptirely. nutrients in the diet can influence microorganismson the enamel surface by facilitating plaque formation and stimulat-ing their metabolic activities. Nutrients may also affect the flow andromposition of saliva in contact with plaque and enamel. and finally,they can contribute to the composition of the outer enamel surfaceand possibly to the formation of the acquired pellicle. These differentpreemptive and posteruptive effects of dietary nutrients have notbeen clearly recognized and controlled in experimental situations andepidemiological studies. and have led to misunderstanding as to thetrue effect. of nutrition in the etiology and development of oral disease.Recently there has been a lot of discussion for example. about theinfluence of protein malnutrition, on mental development. and how itcan effect the intellectual powers of the individual forever. I wouldlike to stress again to you that nutrients and foods can have two effects.One before the tooth erupts, when the tooth is being. formed. and atthat time mitrition and especially. malnutrition can have a very drama-tic effect in increasing the susceptibility of teeth to diseases suchas sari,;. Therefore. when you have a malnourished child. you have achild who is more suzceptikle to dieace and there is not mueli that, can 1w done systematically to increase tooth resistance. Now he can growto be 6 feet tall. and very large and handsome and so on. but his teethbe decayed.Postemptively the foods can also effect, the surface and the amountof saliva and the kinds of organisms that are on the surface of thetooth, and therefore the presence of food ingredients such as earl)\u00b0,hydrates will have very profound effect in terms of developino-diseases such as dental curie=.We have heard before that it is not. only the amount of carbohydrate.It is not only the type of carbohydrate that, we are worried about, butone of the important things that we are to consider is the frequencywith which ve consume carbohydrate-containing foods. This is cer- tainly relevant to our country. because we are really a country that ischanging our dietary habits and we are going from meal eaters toTraditionally sweet, high - sucrose containing foods have fallen intothe dessert. food category. Today a major change is taking place in thefood-consuming habits of people in the United States.I have presented in my statement some tables' that indicate that inthis country, we have changed the way we consume our food andwhile before most people had. or at least tried to have, three squaremeals in a day. today we find that we might have one, and then fouror five snacks durinc the day and this is really constituting our overalleating pattern.Actually. snack foods can hardly be classed as new, since most snackitemscrackers, candies. cookies. lee creams. soft drinks. etc.have preT,ared statement, p. 296. 292been around a. long time. The big change seems to be in consumerattitudes toward snacks and the manufacturers' marketing strategiesto meet the consumers' demand created by (a.) prosperity, (b) a. moreinformal life style, and (c) increased leisure time, plus time for morehome entertainment. Foods included in that study contain substantialamounts of sucrose and are consumed as both snacks and desserts.Today, with increasing frequency, the dessert. habit is considered bymany an indulgence and something that. as much as possible. should beunlearned. Consumption patterns further indicate that, the use ofdesserts or dessert-like products are most acceptable when used notas desserts, but rather as snacks.The tables that I have included in my statement very clearly showto you how the usage of foods has changed and how before then wereconsumed as part of the meal. and today they are being used mostlyas snacks. We have for example, in the item of cake, a 70-percentincrease in the snack usage versus the meal. In the case of cookiesnearly a 40-percent increase. In terms of pies or desserts of other types,we have a 75-percent increase, so we no loiterer consume any of thesefoods that are sugar consumed foods as dessert, but as snat:zs (luringthe day and therefore we are really increasing not only our consump-tion of sugar in this kind of food, but also spreading it out duringthe whole day. This is even more serious because as our populationexpands continually, we are at the same time becoming a youngerNation.Today, nearly half of the Nation's people fall into the under -27-year -old category. According to the Department of Commerce figures,by 1982 we will have increased in number by 22 percent, with 47 per-cent of our population in the under-24-year-old category. A majoritywill be 14-24 years of age.This trend toward a. younger Nation with more individuals in theage groups with a high care-. \"-Peptibility coupled with a changing-life style, which favors an ir.. :\\:.t bed consumption of snack items. manycontaining substantial amounts of sucrose. combines to project, a situa-tion which will contribute to an increase in caries production.Not only do I think we have to look at the problem of pattern of con-sumption, I think that we should restress what. has been said before.foods that contain sugar really have also an impact. in terms of thenutrition of people. Foods compete for space in the stomachs of man-kind. Every time a person selects a sugar-rich food. he does this atthe expense of other foods. These other fools are always better as asource of protein, vitamins and minerals than the sugar which re-places them. Tt is for this reason that we have recommended in thepast that such industrially-produced foods containing high levels ofsugar he enriched with vitamins or minerals and other factors toimnroye the nutritional value and belp reduce their caries potential.Through the use of certain nutrients and agents such as phocphates.which are presently being tested in terms of humans manufacturedfood products can he improved. The fortification of sugar-containinerfonds to make them nntritionally self - sufficient is renllv advisable.91thonalt T recognize there are complex legal and teelmolo,ripaldiffienities which have to be cleared before w can implement thesemeasures.Tt is unquestionably true that the carbohydrate comnonent of foodsis the important caries promoting factor in the diet. Sugars are 293metabolized by the bacteria on the surface of teeth to facilitate itsadherence to the tooth and there produce metabolites which decaytooth enamel. Abundant and frequent consumption of sugar-richfoods therefore enhance caries disease.As it stands today, sugar-containing foods have a caries potentialwhich could be lowered by applying our research efforts and our tech-nological competence to the production of attractive, palatable foodswhich do not endanger the health of the consumer.We have no data to show you what would be the impact on humancaries of substituting sucrose for other sugars, such as glucose or lac-tose, bat preliminary data indicates that foods can be manufacturedwith a reduced amount of sucrose which are palatable, nourishing andwith lower caries potential. Modification of the texture of foods couldalso reduce caries potential probably by reducing the residence timein the oral cavity of food debris. This is also a profitable avenue toreduce the caries potential of manufactured foods.Now with regard to nutrition education in medical and dentalschools, I just want to point out the fact that l feel that good nutritionis the best ally of preventive medicine or dentistry. What. I feel ismost important is that. if leadership is not exerted by the people,who are competent in understanding the problem of nutrition. thenthe result is that other people who are less competent and less respon-sible are going to come in and become leaders and are going to mis-guide our young people that want to know about nutrition, aboutfoods. about the a frects of the abuses in its use. Considering that:(a) sugar is known to be a caries-promoting ingredient in foods:(b) we know that increasing the frequency of food iu*-alr.e is also a stimulating factor in caries development: (c) the per (wail con-sumption of sugar in the United States has somewhat still: aired. butnevertheless. the use of sucrose in manufactured foods has increasedtremendously in the last. 5 years: and (d) because the eating patternof the United States popnlation is changing from meal eaters to thatof nibblers, I really strongly recommend that first of all. nutritionteaching- should be stimulated and supported in medical and dentalschools to insure that health professionals are thoroughly aware ofnutritional facts to be used either in their practice or in patient educa-tion or in health programs for the prevention of the diseases. Andas T said before, their leadership in this field will eliminate the illadvise of people who are not thoroughly trained in this field and yetwill rive false hopes to the large number of people seeking nutritionaland health information.Then secondly. I think that manufactured food products contain-ing high proportions of sugar should be reevaluated from a nutritionaland dental health point of view in the following manner: (a)nutritionally they should he enriched to restorenot to supplementin excess amounts----their hntritional valve to proper levels so as tomake. them metabolically self sufficient :is far as possible: (b) froma dental health point of view. they should bP reformulated. makinguse of those sno-n r substitutes I FI:ould be support for research in thisarea in order to imderstand the efTeets of sugar substitutes. changes 1 294in food texture. and cariostatic supplements on the nutritional quality, the organoleptic acceptability of the food, and ultimately the health of the consumer.And then finally, I suggest that full information should be available in the package as well as in the advertisement of a manufactured food about its nutrient composition and the possible effect on health that the consumption of this product in large amounts could bring to the consumer.I would like to point out filially that there are no short cuts in life. You cannot get good nutrition in a little pill. You cannot. be happy with a little pill. You cannot be healthy with one minute of exercise a day. and I think it must be understood by everyone that. anythingthat is worthwhile requires effort and education to change our whole life. Good nutrition should be brought. into our daily lives, through the use of wholesome foods orderly consumed during the day. If we incorporate it in this manner, we will get the benefits of this way of life. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JUAN M. NAVIAINFLUENCE OF NUTRITION ON TILE ETIOLOGY OF ORAL DISEASENutrition is highly influential in the development of host resistance to oral disease. No other factor, aside from the microbial one. can enhance or retard the disease process as much as variations in the quality, quantity and frequency of foods consumed in the diet. Yet the true magnitude of this component in human oral disease processes has not been sufficiently measured or described. The science of nutrition deals ultimately with the optimal cell requirements of certain essential elements and compounds during the process of reproduction. growth. maintenance, and function. In its broader aspect this science also encom- passes the study of the nutritional requueinems. reactions and interactions taking place in tissues, organs, and finally whole organisms. Foods in the diet provide these essential nutrients and so their nutritional composition, the amount and frequency with which they are consumed, and their physical and organoleptic properties are of special importance to the study of nutrition.To oral tissues, nutrition is of special relevance, not only because of their own specific requirements, but because these tissues come in contact with foods twice: (a) once directly, when they are masticated in the oral cavity and (b) a second time when, after digestion and absorption, the nutrients return by way of the circulatory system to nourish these tissues. - The nutrient composition of foods in the diet can influence teeth at two distinct stages. Preemptively the chemical composition. as well as the eruption time ofteeth, may be affected. During this period, nutrients in the diet can also select a pathogenic bacterial flora by enrichment of the environment and thus facilitatelater the implantation and colonization of these microorganisms on the enamelsurface of erupting teeth.Posteruptively, nutrients in the diet can influence microorganisms on the enamel surface by facilitating plaque formation and stimulating their metabolicactivities. Nutrients may also affect the flow and composition of saliva in con- tact with plaque and enamel, and finally, they can contribute to the compositionof the outer enamel surface and possibly to the formation of the acquired pellicle.These different preemptive and posteruptive effects of dietary nutrients have notbeen clearly recognized and controlled in experimental situations and epidemio-logical studies, and have led to misunderstanding as to the true effect of nutritionin the etiology and development of oral disease. . Nutrients in the diet therefore can influence oral disease in the following ways:(a) By changing the chemical environment of cells responsible for theformation of dental tissues;(b) Influencing, either independently or together with hormones, the cellu-lar enzyme systems involved in calcification processes;(c) Altering protein synthetic reactions and thus modifying the nature mthe calcifying organic matrix of mineralized tissues ;(d) Modifying the rate of flow, quantity or the physical, chemical or im-munological properties of saliva ; 295(C) Enhancing or inhibiting the remineralization process taking place normally on the tooth surface of erupted teeth : and (f) Influencing the multiplication, implantation and metabolism of the plaque flora.In most oral disease processes the prognosis is usually determined by the inter- action of host, microbial and nutritional factors. When they coincide, disease will ensue and when these factors are unbalanced the pathosis may be retarded or even prevented. Host factors involve genetic determinants which affect the qual- ity of enamel, the morphology of teeth, the size ratio of teeth to mandible, the flow level and composition of saliva and other factors. The microbial factor is represented by the bacterial masses in contact with oral tissues. The tooth is normally covered by a dense layer of microorganisms which secrete metabolic products that are in constant contact and interaction with oral tissues. These omanisms, under the influence of the nutrient composition of the diet and other unknown factors, may develop such a degree of virulence that disease (caries or periodontal disease) will become rampant if untreated. Efforts to prevent disease by controlling the etiological microbial agent alone may be frustrating. A total or complete approach to the prevention of disease through modification of all three factors would be most rewarding.NUTRITION AND DENTAL CARIESDental caries is an infectious disease which is also influenced in its etiology by the interaction between microbial, dietary and host factors. Although the disease has existed for centuries, it is now ubiquitous, its incidence is increasing and in many areas it is rampant.This change in the epidemiological pattern could be attributed to increased virulence of the cariogenic bacteria, but in reality diet is the etiological factor considered to be most responsible for this change in the extent and incidence of the disease.The diet plays an important role in the selection, implantation, colonization and metabolic activity of the plaque microflora. Nutrients in the diet may retard or promote the formation and activity of a cariogenic plaque and the understand- ing of such effect,; in lthman caries is extremely important. The dental health status of an individual is thus largely determined by a balance between dietary factors which retard or promote caries.The other important consideration in the nutritional aspect of caries is the dietary pattern or the combinations and frequency of consumption of foods dur- ing the day. The Vipeholm study and other studies have shown that the increased frequency of snack consumption was directly correlated with increased caries scores in preschool children.It is therefore of great urgency to reevaluate and modify the foods used as snacks in order to control the development of caries in a population which seems to be shifting in dietary habits from meal-eaters to nibblers.(a) CONSUMPTION PATTERN OF SNACK AND DESSERT FOODS TN UNITED STATESTraditionally sweet, high-sucrose containing foods have fallen into the dessert food category. Today a major change is taking place in the food-consuming habits of people in the United States.In a convenience food study completed in 1970 for the Iowa Development Com- mission by the Arthur D. Little Co., it was noted that \"various factors such as the fact that members of the family may be away for periods during meal time, have contributed to making the fixed, three-meal-a-day schedule almost a thing of the past. At present, many persons have only two formal meals a (lay, with a third or even a fourth meal being a continuous snacking event throughout the (lay.\" Definitions of snack foods nary from \"finger foods\" to a \"self-contained light meal\" to \"in-between food and beverage items that are consumed under con- ditions of recreation, sportsor relaxation.\" Whatever the definition, the in- dustry is growing. Snack food sales consumption rose 68.1 percent in the period 1956-68. In 1967, an AVISCO snack study reported that over half of all house- wives bought snacks at least once a Week. Almost three-fourths noted they bought more than one type of snack. With more women working, children are kept busy with a wide range of after-school treats until the evening meal is prepared. Actually, snack foods can hardly be classed as new, since most snack items crackers, candies, cookies, icecreams, soft drinks, et ceterahave been around a long time. The big change seems to be in consumer attitudes toward snacks and the manufacturers' marketing strategies to meet the consumers' demand created by (a) prosperity, (b) amore informal life style, and (c) increased leisure time, 296phis time for more home entertainment. Foods ineluded in that study contain:albstantial amounts of sucrose and are consumed as both snacks and desserts.Today, with increasing frequency, the dessert habit is considered by many anindulgence and something that, as much as possible, should be unlearned. Con-sumption patterns further indicate that the use of desserts or dessert-like prod-ucts are most acceptable when used not as desserts, but rather as snacks.In a 1969 Marketing and Economic Report on Frozen Desserts consumptiondata on snacks versus desserts, 4,000 households were surveyed as to their usageof 14 items during the 1062-63 and 1907-68 periods. The results as indicated in achart below demonstrate the shift from dessert to snack usage in most of the foodproduct categories included in this study.

Today, nearly half of the Nation's people fall into the under27-year-old category. According to Department of Commerce figures, by 1082.we will have increased in number by 22 percent, with 47 percent of our popula-tion in the under 24-year-old category. A majority will be 14-24 years of age. 297This trend toward a younger Nation with more individuals in the age groupswith a high caries susceptibility coupled with a changing life style which favorsan increased consumption of snack items, ina ny containing substantial amountsof sucrose, combines to project a situation which will contribute to an increasein caries production.(B) NUTRITIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF TIIF. IIIGII CONSUMPTION OPSUGAR-CONTAINING FOODSAlthough the consumption of sugar in the United States has not increased inthe past 20 years, the per capita consumption is twice the world average. Adoles-cents and young adults consume large quantities of carbohydrates, especiallysucrose.In response to cultural and technological demands, sugar is now so purifiedthat many sugar-rich foods are nearly devoid of minerals and vitamins. andcontribute nothing but calories to the diet. The public expects the food indus-tries to provide food products which are palatable, safe, inexpensive, andnutritious.Foods compete for space in the stomachs of mankind.Every time a personselects a sugar -rich food, he does it at the expense of other foods, and these otherfoods are always better as a source of vitamins and minerals than the sugarwhich replaces them.It is for this reason that we have recommended in the past that such indus-trially produced foods containing high levels of sugar should be enriched withvitamins and minerals and other factors to improve the nutritional value andto help reduce their caries potential.The enrichment of sugar-containing foods with nutrients, and the supplementa-tion of sugar with cariostatic agents such as phosphate, may create problems infood technology which should not be difficult to solve. Enrichment of certainsuga:-rich food products may be undesirable because processing procedures aresevere.Raising the nutritional quality of these products through supplementationshould not stimulate an increased consumption of sugar but rather prevent nutri-tional problems brought about by the extensive use of sugar in manufacturedproducts.If enrichment of sugar-containing foods is advisable for the United States andthe Western Hemisphere. it is certainly even more important in the less tech-nically developed countries of the world where the consumption of sugar-con-taining foods is increasing.The fortification of sugar-containing products to make them nutritionally self-sufficient is advisable, although the author fully recognizes that there are com-plex legal, administrative, and technological difficulties which must be solvedbefore this program can be fully implemented.(C) SUGAR-CONTAINING FOODS AND DENTAL CARIESIt is unquestionably true that the carbohydrate component of foods is theimportant caries promoting factor in the diet. Sugars are readily metabolizedby the bacteria on the surface of teeth to facilitate its adherence to the toothand the production of metabolites which decay tooth enamel. Abundant and fre-quent consumption of sugar-rich foods therefore enhance caries disease.We have no data at this time to show what would be the impact on humancaries of substituting sucrose for other sugars, such as glucose and lactose, butexperimental data indicates that foods can be manufactured with a reducedamount of sucrose which are palatable, nourishing and with lower caries poten-tial. Modifications of texture of foods could also reduce caries potential probablyby reducing the residence time in the oral cavity of food debris. This is also aprofitable avenue to reduce the caries potential of manufactured foods.As it stands today. sugar - containing foods have a caries potentia! which couldbe lowered by applying our research efforts and our technological competenceto the production of attractive palatable foods which do not endanger the healthof the consumer.NUTRITION EDUCATION IN MEDICAL AND DENTAL ScizootsGood nutrition is the best allied preventive medicine or dentistry has. Tolay aside such knowledge would be folly, as there is no way that we can copewith disc: ,:e at a therapeutic level. The highly-trained manpower necessary totreat sick people is nonexisting and costly. 298The teaching of nutrition in dental and medical schools would insure thatsuch knowledge is available to the health professional. Even though there aremany areas which have not been sufficiently investigated, enough is understoodtoday to enable them to use dietary manipulations in the preventive or in thetherapeutic procedures used in the office or the hospital. Nutritional and dietaryinfortuatiou will not only be useful to the patient. but will be carried to thypatient's home, where it may influence the eating pattern of the whole family.The effectiveness of preventive nutritional measure:. relies heavily tat patientself-care. a fundamental aspect of disease prevention.For physicians there are also further reasons for being thoroughly trained innutrition. In recent years the methodology involved in parenteral nutrition hasbeen so developed that now patients for whom there was no hope of saving canbe fed through the vein and brought back to normality. This procedure demandsfull understanding of nutritional principles so as to be able to restore the patientto a level where it can then be treated by other procedures. Advances in tech-nology and methodology such as this one of parenteral feeding will be lost to thepublic if the science of nutrition is not taught along side other health discipline.For dentists there are three areas in their professional activity in which nutri-tional and dietary knowledge will be required :(a) Clinical diagnosis.The dentist is unusual in the sense that in ninny caseshe is the only clinician that has an opportunity to examine individuals for com-plaints other than nutritional problems. His understanding of the expression ofnutritional deficiencies in the oral cavity can be valuable in the diagnosis ofincipient problems before they bloom into overt chronic deficiencies.i b) Therapeutic procedures. which can be supplemented and made more ef-fective by dietary counseling directed to the clinical problems under considera-tion.(c) Health education offered to the patient and through the patient to thefamily unit as a whole.The last two items are of course equally applicable to physicians and dentist.The health education aspect is especially important in the practice of pediatricsor pedodontics, for the young patient can be influenced to incorporate into his liv-ing pattern those dietary practices which will enable him to maintain not onlyoral, but also general health.RECOMMENDATIONSConsidering that(a) Sugars are known to be caries-promoting ingredients in foods(b) Increased frequency of food intake is also a stimulating factor incaries development ;(c) The per capita consumption of sugar in the United States of Americahas stabilized in recent years at a level of approximately 98 pounds, but itsuse in manufactured foods has increased ; and(d) The eating pattern of the U.S. population has changed from that ofmeal eaters to one of nibblers.WE RECOMMEND TILE FOLLOWING(1) Nutrition teaching should be stimulated and supported at medical anddental schools to insure that health professionals are thoroughly aware of nutri-tional facts to be used (a) in their practice, (b) in patient education and (c)in health programs for the prevention of disease. Their leadership in this fieldwould eliminate the ill-advice of people who are not thoroughly trained in thisfield yet they misguide and give false hopes to people seeking nutritional andhealth information.(2) Manfactured food products containing high proportions of sugars shouldbe reevaluated from a nutritional and a dental health point of view in the fol-lowing manner:(a) Nutritionally they should be enriched to restore their value to properlevels, so as to make them as metabolically self sufficient as feasible.(b) From a dental health they should be reformulated, making use ofthose sugar substitutes or cariostatic supplements that would reduce theircaries potential.(3) Support for research in this area should be continued to understand theeffects of sugar substitutes, changes in food texture, and cariostatic supple-ments on the nutritional quality, the organoleptic acceptability of the food, andultimately the health of the consumer. (4) Full information should he available in the package as well as in anyadvertisement of a manufactured food about its nutrient compoation ana thepossible effect on health that the consumption of this product in large amountscould bring to the consumer.Senator McGovntx. Thank you very much. I have broken in severaltimes with questions, so I am going to let Senator Schweiker leadoil' on the questions.senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you very much, Senator McGovern.First I would like to compliment the panel. I think your testimonyhas been very helpful, positive, constructive and enlightening. I alsoappreciate the different members of the panel's reference to my nutri-tion education bill, and I think the support these gentlemen offered isvery helpful to getting it through Congress.LABELING TYPES OF CARBOHYDRATES?1 would like to ask a few questions, and I will begin with Dr. Nizel.Doctor, your statement did mention the possibility of labeling the kindsof carbohydrates, as I recall, that occur in packages. so that we havesome very specific knowledge that we don't have now, which I think isan excellent recommendation. I wonder if you want to comment on thisand also on your suggested substitutes. For instance, can you tell usa little more about this protein substitute ? Is this commercially avail-able, or is it in the research stage?Dr. Num.. There is a Merlin Corporation which is working with aprotein called miraculin. It is derived from a berry which conditionsyour tongue for it short period of time in such a way as to make sour,tart fruits like grapefruit taste sweet. Also, there is another companythat manufactures a different type protein, monellin, that impartsa sweet taste when added to foods.Senator SCHWEIN.1:11. Now, the sugar substitutes that are on themarket, saccharin and others, do they have the same chemical effect on the teeth as does sugar?SUCROSE HAS MAJOR ACIDIC EFFECT ON TEETHDr. Nizim. No, they do not. The major sugar that has an effect on thetooth is sucrose. Sucrose is a disaccharide which breaks down into amonosaccharide and that, in turn, will break down into lactic acid.This reaction does not take place with a sugar substitute like saccharinSaccharin is different chemically and exerts no deleterious effect froma dental standpoint.Another sugar substitute is sorbitol, which is an alcoholic derivativeof glucose. It is metabolized very slowly. It is presently used in theso-called sugarless products. It does not produce acid as rapidly as thesimple sugars do in the dental plaque.Senator ScnwmitEn. I think that is very helpful anti very usefulinformation, as well as your suggestion about warnings. I gatherfrom your testimony as well as that of your colleagues that frequencyof use is the most important factor?Dr. Num,. Yes, I think the public should be informed by labels onlife savers, breath mints, soft drinks, and so forth, that the frequentconsumption of these suga -rich items will be harmful to their teeth.Senator Scnwman. Nov you recommend thht sugar sweetenedfood for children could be banned, and I wonder if you think a ban is justified testified earlier, the 5- or 6-year-old childshould not be the family member who makes food choices based onnutritional values. I think sugar-coated cereals, which are emptycalories and cariogenic, should be banned in the best interest for allconcerned, particularly children.You never find these sugar-coated cereals on the upper shelves of thesupermarkets. I feel like Dr. Mayer does, that these youngsters areeasily misled by advertising and do themselves and others dentalharm by insisting on buying these foods. To protect them against thishazard, these products should be banned.Senator SCIIWEIKER. And you also referred to sugar advertisementssuch as, \"It isn't just good flavor, it is good food.\" And as a miter offact, I saw one last night referrina t'to sugar as \"Great food energy.\"What is your professional opinion of those advertisements?Dr. N1ZEL. Well, this type of advertisement doesn't tell the wholetruth. It describes only one property of sugar. It is true it providesenergy, but so do all other foods. But they ought to tell what else itdoes to the body besides providing energy. When they say it is goodfood, one would assume that it is good for one's general health. And,ithis is not a true statement because even a slight excess can promotedental decay, and diabetes in susceptible individuals. I don't think theword \"Good\" is a proper word to describe sugar because it does notcontribute any benefit to one's general and dental health. In fact, itcan do harm.Senator SCIIWEIKER. I asked Dr. Mayer this question, although Iam not sure there is a known answer, but what relationship do you seebetween children or other people who develop a sweet taste or sweettooth. What is your comment to what happens here?\"SWEET TASTE\" Is ACQUIRED, NOT NATURALDr. NIZEL. My feeling is that taste can be acquired or is learned.One can also wean oneself from the taste of sweets. I know that if youhave been using sugar in your coffee for a period of years, then youdecide to omit the addition of sugar in your coffee, you can conditionyour taste buds to actually dislike the sugary sweet flavor. In fact,most people cannot put sugar back in coffee once they have acquiredor learned to like the flavor of-the coffee. We -.stricted sweets fromour children, and to this dayat the age of 25 hey do not like sweetdesserts. It is just as easy to say \"I dislike sweets\" as \"I dislike bittertastes.\"Senator SCHWEIKER. I want to go back because I am trying thatmyself. If you cut sugar out of coffee, what is your first reaction?Dr. NIZEL. You learn the flavor of coffee yourself.Senator ScilwEiKER. The first reaction is very negative and unpleas-ant, I might add.Dr. NIZEL. At the beginning it is, and then you develop a taste forthe flavor of coffee. This is like putting catsup on everything. Youdestroy the natural flavor of the food. Once you develop a taste forthe flavor of natural coffee, then you will not be able to add sugar.You will find that sweetness may be so distasteful that it can besickening. ea.301Senator SCIIWEIKER. So you are saying this sweet taste is an ac-quired learning habit and as such the obvious educational impact isone of the prime factors and it conditions people asfar asKia.t.000 COMPANY Wm. TESTIFYSenator McGovEnx. Woo.it you yield a moment, Senator Schwei-ker? We have a communication from Mr. Joseph Loaning, presidentand chief executive of Kellogg Company, and I would like to askthat it be made a part of the record. Let ine just read it:The Kellogg Company of Battle Creek, Michigan, has assured me that itstands ready and willing to present its nutrition story and the company's pol-icies relative to the use of Its resources and creative talents of Its own people.and that of its advertising agency, Leo Burnett, to the Senate Select Committeeon Nutrition and Human Needs, or to any other proper committee. However, theeonipany insists on its right to reserve its appearance to :w open and fair forum.The Committee staff obviously doesn't understand the scope of that complaintby the FTC. However, we stand rends to testify on the nutritional aspects ofour products and our methods of disseminating the nutritional value of ourproducts to our customers.That is all the committee ever wanted from the Kellogg Company.the testimony on the nutritional aspects of their products and themethods of disseminating the nutritional value of their products. andI think Senator Schweiker and the other members will agree we willbe happy to receive the representatives of that company any timeit is convenient to the company and to this Committee.And I would also like to ask that a memorandum prepared by thelegal representative to the committee. Mr. James Turner. on thismatter be made a part of the record.' It is simply an analysis of theconflict between congressional hearings and administrative proceeding.If there is no objection, that will be made part of the record.I want to say to our three. witnesses that I have to go to anothercommitment that I am now late for, and I would like to ask SenatorSchweiker to continue the questioning during the committee sessionas he sees fit. I do want to commend the three witnesses for theexcellent testimony today.Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Dr. Shaw, if I may direct a few questions to you at this moment aboutyour testimony. You refer in your statement to tests beino. conductedat Harvard making it very clear that sugar-coated breakfast cerealscause, decay more than unsweetened cereal. Is this a new finding orhas this been kuown before? What is your reaction to the impact ofthat particular, study?Dr. SHAW. T1119 is new. These are experiments that we have beendoing in the last years with funding we have received in part fromthe National Institute of Dental Research. What we Have been doingis to set up caries tests where, during certain times of the day, ratswould have access to a normal diet and during some other parts of theday. they would have other foods or snacks or confections. The ex-periment which I reported here was one in which we compared sugar-coated breakfast cereals with the more traditional kinds. It has onlybeen finished for a fuw weeks and as far as I know, nothing comparableto this has been done.I See Appendix, pp. 31.1-15.a 302Senator Sri, welian. In your statement you make a collide Of weom-memintions, one that television advertisement of sugar prodnetsshould be sharply curtailed: and. two. the rest rietion of smear intakeis especially important during the time in n child's life when heyoung and his teeth are being formed. In essence then. aren't vouthe other members of the panel saying that at the most eliti( ;(I dines inthe person's life h. terms of sugar intake. maxinnzing the impact ofsugar on these pemons will have very deleterious effects in dental cariesand perhaps even unknown areas now. to that we are recommending inessence that we take the situation and minimize the impact in terms ofthe child's health and teeth, preventive medicine, is that what yon aresaying?Dr. SnAw. That is correct. as long as we don't limit it to the bene-fit being. imposed simply during childhood. While the problems aremost acute (hiring childhood. yet they continue on through life. to thatyour statement is perfectly correct, only don't let's limit it to the child-hood period.Senator SCHWEIKER. We don't grow out of the problem just becausewe grow up.rt,Dr. SHAW. Exactly.Senator Senwtami. You also mentioned in commenting on my hillhYthat I lkere is an understafling situation in the sohools regarding nuti-tion. I just wonder if you would elaborate a little bit about what, youfeel the current status of dental school.: are in this regard. You alsomake a goon suggestion about the need for training more technicalpeople in this field.MAJoarry or DENTAL SuHOOLS HAvE No NUTRIENT Prai4oxxiit.Dr. SHAW. Yes. Well. I think when you look at the need for nutri-tion education in the dental schools of the country. it can be sum-marized something like this: Of the G dental schools at the presenttime, certainly only the minority of these schools has anyone on theirsenior faculties whose specialty is nutrition. Actually three of thedental schools with a senior faculty member in nutrition are right here,representing the University of Alabama, Tufts Dental School andHarvard. In these three schools, there is a senior person and there arecomplementary supporting people. As you look around the dentalschools of the country, you will find many schools where there maybe no one who is trained as a nutrition investigator and teacher. Ina number of schools where there is someone on the faculty at a juniorlevel, who has primarily been trained as a dietician who is responsiblefor instruction in applied nutrition. In general there is not an adequatedepth of personnel to teach nutrition in our dental schools.Sc hatorSeinVEIKEn. You are saying these three situations are reallythe main exceptions to the rule?Dr. SHAW. Yes, but there are two or three other schools, but yousee the main representation here.Dr. NUM. In 1968, I ran a survey on the number of dental schoolsthat have a nutrition teaching program. The result of that survey, inessence, said that only about 10 to 15 percent of the schools taughtapplied nutrition. I would say about 40 out of GO schools taught somesmall amount of the biochemistry of nutrition. But when it came to 30:3applying this basic knowledge at the clinical level, there were veryfew schools, :naybe one-half dozen, that taught the applied aspect.Senator SCHWEIKER. I wonder if you could send the committee theresults of that survey ? I don't believe you have that with you at thispoint?Dr. N met. Yes. I will send it to you.'Senator Snwmumt. I think it would be very helpful to us.Dr. Shaw. you also say that it is possible to develop a product withmuch lower concentrations that will be very pleasing to taste and wehave already asked Dr. Nizel to comment. on that. Maybe you wouldlike to expand or elaborate a little more. Maybe this is a key to what.our committee ought to be focusing on. What areas of alternate ap-proach do we have and what are your suggestions?Stcaose Corti)t'r ity t0 Plater.x.rI)r. So.m. I would like to give von an exam ,)le, without namingthe company involved. because I think that would be unfair. I wasasked last .tame to talk to the research and advertising personnel inone of the largo food companies of the United States about what. Iunderstood to be the problem between suers... and other sugars anddental health. So we spent at day together in very careful intimatediscussion of the matter. One very interesting point cattle mit, whichI think ( cemplities what can he done if the company wants to do it.One of the It) people saidYou know. there Is no reason why we can't cut the pancake syrups that we'make in halt as far as sucrose concentrations. There is no reaPai akolutely asfar as palatability that finalise (Inn be cut down by half or even lower and stillhave a marketable tasty pNwittet.I think this is 3111 example of what can happen if you bring the in-format ion to the industry. It gets them thinking about things t hey eau (I() that they never stopped to think about before. If manufacturerswould look at ever one of the products today in which sucrose is usedheavily, with ingenuity and some research as far as what, is taste ile- ceptablp. and what is acceptable as far as toe general month feel ofthe food. major reductions in su.ra use could be achieved. Thesechanges could be made without even thinkint, about other sweeteningagents such as miaeulin, that I)r. Nizel spoke about, and another onewhich is being worked on in Philadelphia. %vide! they call monellin.They are very sweet compounds and readily metabolized in thebody and have absolutely no potential to produce dental caries.So I think the problem with the level of sucrose in so many of ourfoods today is that this has been an easy way and therefore the in-dustry has just kind of slid atom. Products sell better if they aresweeter. so why worry about hi(di sugar cosumption. But with in-genuity and research and a real desire to improve products, there isabsolutely no necessity for the amount of sucrose that is in the productsoday.Senator ScuEnuat. So you are saying without really making many changes in the processing or maketin(r at all, we could accomplish quite a bit without going into sugar substitutes per se?sot avatiable. at(IMOof publication. 304Dr. Sit Aw. Yes.Dr. NAvr.. Just to give example of that kind of approach, I will tellyou for example that wehave ongoing research supported by theNational Caries program of the National Institute of Dental Re-search, and one of the objectives of the research. is to produce andtest for caries, snack foods in which sucrose is substituted for othersugars, and the process ishighly interesting.REFORMULATE SUGAR COOKIE Wrrnorr SUCROSEWe, reformulate a sugar cookie, for example, trying to substitute85 or 00 percent of the sucrose for other sugars. We have tested differ-ent. sugar combinations. that we now know have low caries potential.combinations of glucose, lactose and other sugars. We, take this newreformulated sugar cookie and we have it examined by a taste panel,whirl would give the acceptability snore and once we are sere thatthis is a sugar cookie which would be acceptable to the publ ie. then webring it into the laboratory and test. it in experimental system. We testthat newly formulated sugar cookie in comparison with one that eon-tains sucrose, in a complicated piece of equipment that feeds rats mealsand snacks just like humans do. The first preliminary results indicatedthat the reformulated cookie has lower caries potential in comparisonwith the one that has the original formulation with the full amountof sucrose.Factors such as the changing of the types of sugars used and the useof all technological know how that, we have today in the food industry.can really do a lot of good in terms of lowering the caries potential.This is also true for changes in textures. We can modify slightly thetextures of the food, so the food does not stay in the mouth for a longperiod of time and therefore reduce again car ies potential. These areavenues of research that are open and we have not yet explored them sufficiently, but we certainly should place a lot of effort in thatdirection.Senator SCHWEIWER. Doctor. I would like to ask you one other ques-tion, as long as we shifted to you at the moment. You make the point,and the other members of the pa \"l, also, to some extent, about the verychanging li festyle of Amerieans and how we used to think of some-thing as a dessert food and now it is a dessert. snack. Or a third orfourth or fifth meal food. I gather you feel this has had a very adverseeffect on our nutritional habits and particularly on our teeth. Ts whatyou are saving here. that this shift of eating habits, although it neednot he: has had an adverse effect by the nature of how the shift isocciirring? Is that. what, von are saying?FREQUENCY OE \"SNACKING\" INCREASES CARIESDr. NAVTA. My comment here, is in regard to dental health. In termsof dental health, which we know that if we feed rats two times a day.they will have a certain level of caries severity, but iF von feed thesame admals 5 times during the day or 10 times during the day or 18times. von get a corresponding increase in the amount. of caries. Thishas also been shown in exneimental situations in humans, so we doknow that as von increase the number of feedings during the dav, youincrease the chances for stimulating the disease. Our life style is cer- 1 305tainly in the direction of helping the development of dental caries. Ifbesides. the foods that you are consuming are those that contain a high proportion of sugar, then obviously your chances are excellent for hav- ing a lot of decay?Senator SCIIWEIKER. Ts it also part of this pattern to say. in view of this change of lifestyle, that a higher per capita consumption of sugar probably means a more, frequent use of sugar? In other words.we say that the amount of sugar. per se, is pertaining frequency. Bat, does it also follow, from what you are saying, that per capita changes 10 to 20 years from now, with the lifestyle changes will put this Nation in bad shape?Dr. NAvta.. You would get both, although we have had an increase in sugar consumption during the last 25 years. a very dramatic one. We don't think that during the last 5 years consumption has increased, but. nevertheless, the level we have is more than sufficiently high. We don't need to increase any more to be in bad shape. We are in bad shape now.Senator ScuwEntr.u. I certainly concur. With five small children. Isee, them ruin the evening meal wan snacks and see my wife get herblood pressure elevated for this reason. I think it is a very important point. and I think it is somewhat symptomatic because you can't divorce one from the other if you have small children.Well. I thank :von all very much. I think you have been most help- ful and constructive. On behalf of the Chairman. Senator McGovern, I very much appreciate your testimony. Thank you very much for coming.The committee is in recess, to reconvene on Tuesday at 10 a.m. (Whereupon, at 1:05 p.m. the Select Committee was recessed. tr reconvene at. 10 a.m. on March 6, 1973. in room 1318 of the DirksenBuilding.)

Re: Companies and Advertising Agencies Refusal to Appear to Te'tify. The husiness and advertising agency witnesses invited to te:tify on Starch 7 have declined to appear. While we have not yet received their formal refusals in writing. they have given their reason orally by telephone as being the com- plaint now pending against them by the Federal Trade Commis:ion. Their po- sition is that it would be inappropriate/not in their interests to discuss tf.-ir advertising policies publicly while the FTC complaint ren, lin: unresolved. In the opinion of legal counsel to the Committee. this po-itb nn is not support- able. The FTC complaint (Docket #8883. attached) does not bear directly on the subject of these hearings, which is the advertising of food: to ehildrn on television in the teaching of good nutritional practices. The FTC complaint k primarily a restraint of trade complaint charging that the major mt.ea. com- paniesKellogg. General Mills, General Foods and Quaker Oats have main- tained a concentrated. non-competitive market structure and exercise monopoly power. Accordingly. the complaint alleges that certain advertising practiee-: em- ployed by these companies represent unfair methods of competition. Specifically. the advertising complaint alleges that some advertisements represent or imply that by eating the product a child will be able to perform %trim's physical ac- tivities or feats as performed by athletes.The FTC complaint appears, therefore. to hear only in a most indireet manner on the subject and focus of the hearings next week which essentially what kind of nutrition education are children receiving from the Mink of product...parth,nlarly breakfast products. being advertised to them dewing their primetime?

In the eourse and conduct of their business. respondents now ship. and forsome time past have shipped. their RTE cereals from their respective productionfarilities in various states to locations in various other states of the UnitedStates. and maintain and at all times mentioned herein have maintained. a sub-stantial rourse of trade in RTE cereals in commerce. a. \"pommel-re\" is definedin the Federal Trade Commission Art.4. F.:telt of the respondents is in substantial competition with each and all ofthe other respondents and with other cereal producers in the mannfarture andg:Ilo of RTE cereals in interstate commerce. except to the extent that Pompeii-Ulm has been hindered. lessened and eliminated as hereinafter set forth.5. During the past 30 years the RTE cereal industry has experieneed substan-tial growth. Tn 1940. 453 million pounds of RTE cereal were produred : 900 mil-lion pounds were produced in 1960: and in 1910 over 1 billion pounds of WIT,(weal were produced. The value of RTE cereal increased from $163 million in1030 to over 5650 million in 1970.Tn 1910 ta.ket: in 1910. for in 1970, for 90 pereent. Tn 1969respondents controlled the following approximate shares of the RTE cerealmarket : Kellogg. 5 percent: General Mills. 21 pereent : General Foods. 16 per-rent : and Quaker. 9 pereent. TO 1969 Nabisco and 'Ralston each had on approxi-mate share of four pereent of the RTE cereal market.6. For at lrnst the past 30 years, and rontinning to the present. respondents.and each of them, have engaged in arts or have practiced forbearnee withrespect to the acts of other respondents. the effect of which has been to maintain 310a highly concentrated. noneompetitive market strueture in the production and...ale of RTE cereal.During this period respondents. in maintaining hoe aforesaid market structure.have been, mid are now engaged in, among others, the folloing acts andpractices:A. BRAND IbROLIFERTION. .RODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND TDE3IRK PROMOTIONRespondents have introduced to the market a profusion of RTE, cereal brand,.During the period 1950 through 1970 approximately 150 brands. mostly trademarked. were marketed by respondents. Over half of these brands were halo-duced after 1960. In introducing and promoting these new brands respondentshave employed intensive advertising directed particularly to Milliken. Respond-ents have used advertising to promote trademarks that conceal the true natureof the product.Respondents artificially differentiate their RTE cereals. Respondents Kathie.,basically similar RTE cereals, and then emphasize and exaggerate trivial varia-tions such as color and shape. Respondents employ trademarks to conceal sinbasic similarities and to differentiate cereal brands. Respondents also use pre-miums to induce purchases of RTE cereals.Respondents have steadily increased the level of advertising expenditures forRTE cereals. During the period 1950 through 1970. respondents aggregate alnual advertising expenditures for RTE cereals tripled from $26 million to 5s1million. In 1970. respondents' advertising to sales ratio for RTE cereals aver-aged 13 percent.These practices of proliferating brands. differentiating similar products andpromoting trademarks through intensive advertising result in high barriers toentry into the RTE cereal market.It. INFIR METHODS OF COMPETITION IN ADERTNING AND PRODIT FROMM ION1. By means of statements and representations contained in their advertise-ments respondents:In advertisements aimed at children. represent directly or tty implication. thattheir RTE cereals without any other foods enable t hitting' to perform the physi-cal activities represented or implied in their advertisements.In truth and in fact :Respondents' RTE re real. do not enable children to perform do' iMysical ac-tivitie: represented cur implied in their advertkements. .\\ ehild's ability to per-form such physical activities depends on many other factors. including but notlimited to general body build, exercise. rest, a balanced diet and age.2. By means of statements and representations contained in their advertise-Wilts: respondents Kellogg. general Mills, and general Foods represent. directlyor by implication. that ConSinithig RTE cereal at breakfast :tar Will result in loss of body weight nit bout vigorous adherence toa reduced calorie diet.I bl Will result in maintenance of present bitty weight even if totalcalorie intake increases, or(e) Will result in hiss or maintenance of body weight without adherenceto regular physical exercise.In truth and in fact:Ial Consuming RTE cereal at breakfast will not result in loss of Ludyweight without vigorous adherence to a reduced calorie diet.II)) Coins:ming RTE cereal at breakfast will not result in id. inlenaiireof body weight even if total calorie intake increases.!el ('onsuming- lam cereal at breakfast will not result in loss or maintenance of body weight without adherence to regular :thysieal exercise.By means of statements and representation; contained in their advertise-ments respondents (teller:II Mills and Kellogg:la) Represent. directly or by implication. that failure to eat one oftheir RTE cereals results in the failure t)1 athletes or others ti) Peg form totheir full eapabilities.(b) Represent. directly or by implication. that the ingestion of one oftheir RTE cereals by athletes or others enables them to perform better intheir respective activities. 311In truth and in fact :(a) Failure to eat one Of the RTE cereals of such resliondents n ill notresultinthe taiInre of athletes or others to perform to their lullcapabilities.lb) The ingestion of one of the RTE cereals of such respondents o ill not enable athletes or others to perform better in their respective activities.4. 'I he use by respondents of the aforesaid unfair methods of enapetition advertising and product promotion has the capacity and tendency to mislead con- sumers. particularly children. into the mistaken belief that respondents' RYE cereals aie different from other RTE cereals. thereby facilitating artificial dif- ferentiati,m mid brand proliferation. These unfair methods of competition liae contributed to and enhanced respondents' ability to obtain and maintain immi p. oly prices and to exclude competitors from the manufacture and sale of RTE eal.L. CONTROL OF SHELF SPACEKellogg is the principal supplier of shelf space services for the RTE cereal sections of retail grocery outlets. Such services include the selection, placement and removal of RTE cereals and allocation of shelf space for RTE cereals to each respondent and to other RTE cereal producers.Through such services respondents have interfered with and now interfere with the marketing efforts of other producers of RTE and other breakfast cereals anti producers of other breakfast foods. Through such services respondents restrict the shelf positions and the number of facings for Nabisco and Ralston RTE cereals, and remove the RTE cereals of small regional producers.All respondents acquiesce in and benefit from the Kellogg shelf space program %%hien protects and perpetuates their respective market shares through the re- moval or controlled exposure of other breakfast food products including, but not limited to, RTE cereal products. D. ACQUISITION OF COMPETITORSDuring the pa4 70 years numerous acquisitions have occurred in the breakfast cereal industry. One of the effects of these acquisitions was the el*Mimi of significant sources of private label RTE cereal. Among them are the following. In 1943. General Foods acquired Jersey Cereal Company, a Pennsylvania cor- poration. Before acquisition by General Foods, Jersey Cereal Company was a substantial Competitor in the sale of private label and other RTE cereal. In 1943. Kellogg leased and controlled the manufacturing facilities of Miller Cereal Company, Omaha. Nebraska, a substantial competitor in the sale of pri- vate label and other RTE cereal. In 1938, upon termination of the said leasing agreement, Kellogg purchased the assets of Miller.In 1940. General Foods acquired the RTE manufacturing, facilities of Campbell Cereal Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota, a substantial competitor in the sale of RTE cereal. Following this acquisition, General Foods dismantled the RTE facili- ties of Campbell and shipped said facilities to South Africa.The aforesaid acquisitions have enhanced the shared monopoly structure of the RTE cereal industry.7. Respondents, and each of them, have exercised monopoly power in the RTE cereal market by engaging in the following price and sales promotion practices, aiming others :(a) Refrained from challenging each other's decisions to increase prices for RTE Cereals, and, in general, acquiesced in or followed the price in- creases of each of them :(b) Restricted the use of trade deals and trade-directed promotions for RTE cereals;(e) Limited the use of consumer-directed promotions for RTE cereals, such as coupons, cents-off deals, and premiums.S. Respondents' acts and practices aforesaid have had the following effects, among others:(a) Respondents have, individually and collectively, established and maintained artificially inflated prices for RTE cereals.(b) Respondents have obtained profits and returns on investment sub- stantially in excess of those that they would have obtained in a competi- tively structured nut rket. 312(c) Product innovation has been largely supplanted by product imitation.(d) Actual and potential competition in the manufacture and sale ofRTE cereals has been hindered, lessened, eliminated and foreclosed.(e) Significant changes in the RTE cereal market has been blockadedfor over thirty years.(f IMeaningful price competition does not exist in the RTE cerealmarket.(g) American consumers have been forced to tray substantially higherprices for RTE cereals than they would have had to pay in a competi-tively structured market.9. Through the aforesaid acts and practices:(a) Respondents individually and in combination have maintained, andnow maintain, a highly concentrated, noncompetitive market structure inthe production and sale of ItTE cereal, in violation of Section 7) of theFederal Trade Commission Act.I b) Respondents. 71dividually and collectively, have obtained. sharedand exercised. momandy power in, and have monopolized. the praluetionand sale of RTE cereal, in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Com-mission Act.(e) Respondents, and each of them, have erected, maintained and raisedbarriers to entry to the RTE cereal market through unfair methods ofcompetition, in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade CommissionAct.WHEREFORE, THE PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Federal Trade Commis-sion on this 26th day of April, A.D., 1972, issues its complaint against saidrespondents.NOTICENotice is hereby given to each of the respondents hereinbefore named that the5th day of June, A.D. 1972. at 10 a.m.. o'clo:-.1: is hereby fixed vs the lime andFederal Trade Commission Offices. 1101 Building. 11th & Penna.

By the Commission.[seat.] Cu ARLES A. Toms. Seeretasy. MEMORANDUM OF MARCH 3, 1973Fr011t James TurnerTo: Kenneth Schlossberg, Staff Director, L.S. Senate Select Committee ou Nu-trition and Human Needs.Re: Legal Conflicts between Congressional Hearings and Administrative Pro-ceeding.FACTSThe Select Comteittee on Nutrition and Human Needs extended invitationsto several food pi.,icing firms and their respective advertising agencies to join.as witnesses. an i in.-y into nutrition advertising on television. After first ac-cepting the invitations the business firms involved changed their positions anddeclined to appear saying they were following the advice of counsel with refer-ence to the existence of an administrative (Federal Trade Commission) pro-ceeding bearing scone unspecified relevance to the subject matter of the an-nounced hearingsQUESTIONThis situation presents the following question : Does the fact that an individualinvited to appear as a witness at a congressional hearing and also happens to be aparty to an administrative proceeding of some relevance (uo matter how smallto the subject matter of the congressional hearing offer a reasonable legal justi-fication for declining the invitation to appear at the congressional hearing:DISCUSSIONIt is of course the prerogative of any invited (as opposed to subpenaed) %%it-ness to decline any invitation for any reason. The question for this memoran-dum, however, is raised by the suggestion of each of the six invited witnessesthat their respective legal counsel's have advised them not to appear for legalreasons.Mr. J. E. Locoing, president of Kellogg Co., telegramed his reason for not ap-pearing in essentially the same form as the other companies orally deelined toappear. Ile said, \"Unfortunately, the structure of the proposed hearings indicatethe possibility of a broad inquiry into matters which are currently the subjectof an administrative proceeding to which his company is a party. On adviceof counsel, we feel it necessary to decline the invitation to participate.\"The administrative proceeding referred to (FTC Docket No. 8883 In theMatter of Kellogg Co., General Mills. Inc.. General Foods Corp., and The QuakerOats Co.), concerns the allegation of the Federal Trade Commission that theidentified corporations have monopolized the ready-to-eat cereal business Itdoes not deal %%Rh the ays and means available for the development of nutri-tional advertisingthe subject of the congressional hearing.One of four seetions 1l1 the FTC complo,n specifically alleges that the com-panies have engaged in unfair methods of competition in advertising and product promotion. This section of the complaint concludes \"These unfairmethods of ounpetition have contributed to and enhanced reiliondents' abilityto obtain and maintain monopoly 'wires and to exclude competitors from nmnu-faeturing and sale of RTE ready-to-eat )cereal.\" The ability to advertise cereals nutritionally has at most a peripheral relevance to this section of thecomplaint the only section which deals with advertising.The cereal eempames do not test their argument on the assertion that thesubject matter of the congres,ional bearing and the administrative proceedingare the same. Rather they suggest that the hearing may be of such a broadnature as to include or touch on the material in the administrative proceeding.If Senate committees were limited to the consideration of only those matters(314) o 315which could not possibly be the subject nmtter of a current administrativeproceeding. they wonld be precluded from considering nearly all matters forwhich regulatory agencies have jurimtictitm.Committees are not so tweet The rules governing the right of a committee to subpena witnesses set out the principles governing subject matter conflictsNN it h other legal bodies. Om invitation to testify 7:an legally be turned downfor any reason which the invitee wishes.) The Supreme Court has made clearthat a congressionalttee can subpena any witness it desires in pursuitof the information it desires to carry out its constitutional responsibilities -- even when the information sought can be useful in the prosecuting of pendingsnits.The Court has stated \"It may be conceded that Congress is without authorityto compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the proseeation of pendingsnits; but the authority of that body. directly or through its committees. to require pertinent disclosures hi aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also he of use in such snits.\"Sinclair v. United States,279 U.S. 263 (p. 295). With this Supreme Court ruling as the guiding principle the committee could subpena the witnesses who have declined to appear voluntarily. Thisrule of law added to the fact that the administrative proceeding of concern to the cereal ,Nanpanies bears only a peripheral relationship to the announced purposes '..f the committee hearings suggests that. there is no legal reason for the companies not to appear as witnesses. CONCLUSIONNeither the facts nor the law concerning this situation or the overlap of interest between regulatory agencies and the Congress provides a reasonable legal justification for the invited corporation witnesses not to appear at the subject hearings. . :)I 7227:.;pt 3 [Adverthing Age, Mar. 5, '1731('EREA L SAY NUTRITION HEARINGS RIGGED; wox\"r APPEARBy Stanley E.

Such projects hareto the complete ingredient listing, special dietary information and compositionbreakdown which are detailed on the side panel of every package of GeneralMills cereal.During the past 10 years. more than 180 million boxes eaell of whoatios and\"Total\" have devoted the back and/or side panel to the :added of health ornut rit ion.In the near future, six free consumeroriented nutrition pane:1114m leafletswill be offered on 25 million of the company's food packages: it is anticipated thatrko,000 of these leaflets will be dist Muted.Not only on packages, but also in television advertising, General Mills strivesto promote its cereals in the context of a complete and nutritious breakfast. Mostof thecompany's commercials have shown a nutritious breakfast consisting of(wrenl with milk, toast, orange juice and a glass of milk. This is done in an appeal-ingandentertaining format and in compliance with all appropriate ehildren'sadvertising guidelines.Educational efforts of General Mills cereals are not limited to nutrition. somerecent examples:gue smut; tool:la:six\u00bbDuring the glimmer and fall of 1072, General Mills cereal brands cooperatedwith the U.S. Department of Justice in offering a free drug education coloringbook for children which Mowed young children the proper use of momilPhit'Smany found in the home. This offer Was niade on apiiroxintately 45 million cerealpackages. As a public service, General Mills also advertised the coloring bookin newspapers having a combined circulation of more than 11 million.PACKAGE MO110110:18The company attempts, when :. ;tropristte, to give an educational orichtationto its cereal promotions and pi emiums. For example, current General Millschild cereal packages frequently feature a\u00bb \"Adventures in Learning\" series.Using backs, in-package premiums and mail-in offer.s, this series hasoffered such items as a miniature garden, foreign coins and stamps and a \"super\"ruler. It has also featured edmational discussions of such topics as gravityand therefraction of light.Tativlsrox PitOGUAMINGGeneral Mills hasbeen a recent sponsor of such educational child networktelevision programs as \"Take a Giant Step\" and \"Mr. Wizard,\" has television program whichseeks to Instruct asitentertains. The latter show is sponsored in more than 30 top television markets.(318) 319The company is currently sonsoring the program \"Around the World in Eighty Days,\" which provides children with historical and geographical facts. In addi- tion, General Mills has brought animated versions of a number of English and American literary classics to network television during the past 3 years. 'handed have been such works as \"A \"Robinson Crusoe.\" Of paramount concern to General Mills, of course. is the nutritional quality of the cereals with which the above educational efforts hale been associated. The company was the first to fortify its entire line of cereals with added vita mks mid iron. it was the first to inthmuce a cereal fortified with eight essemial vita- mins ''total,\" in July 1961and child eeril forti- fied wit'. eight essential vitaminsKabomn, in June 1969.General Mills is continually striving to further improve the nutritional con- tent of its products without sacrificing appetite appeal. A enrrent example is Iligh C Trix. available in selected markets, which contains more Vitamin C in a 1-ouni-, . serving than 4 ounces of orange juice.Oth.2r examples. of the company's efforts to provide nutritious foods for break- fast me Breakfast Squares. Protein Plus and Breakfast Wrap-ups. Breakfast Squares is a baked. ready-to-eat. frosted bar Troduct containing all the protein and basic vitamins and minerals needed to start the day. Protein Plus is a ready-teat cereal containing 23 percent high quality protein and fortified with vitamins and iron. Breakfast Wrap-nps is a line of frozen \"meat and filling\" products utilizing sausage or picnic ham surrounding scrambled eggs or hash- bron potatoes All these products are distributed in regional markets. CEREAI.S AND CARIESTo our knowledge there is no published evidence available to indicate that presweetened cereals, or cereals in genmal, cause caries in humans. This is not surprising. as sugar consumption from cereals is only a small proportion of total sugar intake. Presweetened - ovals account for less than 2 percent of total sugar consumption in the United States and less than 3 percent of total sugar consumed by children. NUTRITIOSAL AmomrrisiNGGeneral Mills continually strives to offer commercials which emptiiy an enter- taining format. inclmle the importance of a nutritious breakfast. and comply wit h all a pproprio te children's advertising guidelines.In a typical 3u- second cereal commercial, for example. when General Mills cereals are shown he'ng served, they are shown as part of a nutrition.: breakfast consisting of a bowl of cereal with mill:, toast. orange juice. and a :this.; of milk. GemMills also advertises the importance of a good breakfast on the back or side panels of its cereal packages. During 1972. more than 125 million pack- ages of General Mills child cereals contained nutrition copy describing the im- portance of a good breakfast as well as an example of such a breakfast. This is in addition to the complete ingredient listing, special dietav information, and composition breakdown which are detailed on the side panel of every package of General Mills cereals.The Market Research Corporation of America's menu census data indicate that :16 percent of the U.S. population skip breakfast at least once in a 14-day period. nut 17 percent skin breakfast at least half the time. Further. the data indicaO that nearly time of , breakfasts consumed are nutritionally incom- plete. Against this background, we feel we are malting a significant contribution in the area of nutrition education by commnicating to rbildwn the need to start the day with a nutritious breakfast.

Vol. 47, No. 4, October 19531SUGAR AND DENTAL CARIES'nit: EFFECT ON THE TEETH OF SWEETENED EFVERAGES AND OTHEnSUGAR-C. ENTAINING SUBSTANCESPrevious studies of the Council on Dental Health of the American Dental As%oeiation have resulted in statements calling attention to the adverse effects of sugar on the teeth and in recommendations for reducing sugar consumption as a caries-preventive measure. The recommendations are based. primarily. on two substantiated facts: (1) that the consumption of sugar by a caries-susceptible person stimulates tooth decay and (2) that sugar in the diet frequently becomesa substitute for foods of higher nutritive value.The recommendations of the Council have been challenged principally by manu- facturers of products containing large amounts of sugar. such as soft drinks and confections. Because of the Association's responsibility for safeguarding the dental health of the American public. the Council developed th attached state- ment. documenting the known or potential hazards to dental health resultingfrom :Lc:frequent consumption of sweetened beverages and other sugar - containing substances.A committee of the Council on Dental Health prepared the initial statement. After a critical review by members of the Council fat Dentai Health and the ('tinneil on Dental Therapeutics and by the research eimsnitanN if the .V.sonia- lion. many suggestions were incorporated, and the statement wa, adopted by the wo Councils as a joint report.eEnosE OF Sell:NTH-lc ACMOS'ai.In order to achieve a factual scientific apprakal of the ffe.t of sweetenedbeverages onit appears detail e.- entusI etiolome factors in the process of ear:es. 121 to di:1-'1,s in till greater detail the behavior of the dental harterial plaque through %%idyll the sugar mart operate iii order col a beverage to beeon rarlogenie. and 13i the available evidence concerning (a) the derainit Inc and Ili, the iotenie prdip- ert les of sneh a beverage.EssExrim.

Practically all of tl:ese additional conditions. however,have to operate thromm,:h a bacterial plaque, so only the live highly ecutial fac-tors will be documented. Jay in 11151 stated these essential factors succinctly andlisted four methods for preventing dental caries :1. The complete rest rietll in the diet of the substances from which acids are produeed.2. The inhibition of the enzyme activity which is responsible for the acidproduction.3. The elimination from the oral flora of the bacteria which produce theenzymes.4.

Volker in 1 9 10 demonstrated some variations in the --(du-bilit v of enamel front deciduous teeth. young permanent and old permanentteeth %%hen exposed to weak organic acid. Bibby. Volker and Van Keteren in1943 found, in a study of the reaction of salivas. that streptocoeci forita(1 no 326most rapidly in incubated that actinomyees rankedsecond in rapidity and that lactobacilli were less rapid in the production ofacidity. The same year, Floestano, having studied the behavior of cultures pro-cured from salivas, reported that 121 strains of lactobacilli produced a pHwhich varied from 4.9 to 3.6 while 14 strains carried the acidity no farther thana pH or 5.25, that 39 of 68 strains of streptococci produced a pH of 4.0 to 3that 25 strains of staphylococci produced an acidity of 4.0 to 3.7. and that thelowest pH yielded by 14 yeasts was 5.17.Canby and Bernier in 1942 concluded that the Lactobacilhoi achlophilus hadan important role carious dentin developedsuelt a II-ion concentration as to exclude ordinary oral streptococci staphylo-cocci and some other organisms which do not possess marked aciduric powers.Dietz. in his continuous study of the production inn vitro of plaques and caries,reported in 1943 that lactobacilli and streptococci invariably were recoveredfrom the surfaces of carious lesions, and that occasionally the yeasts andstaphylococci recovered throve on a tomato-agar medium.At this point the question arises, \"What is the critical pH for the initiation ofdecalcification?\" In 1925, Bunting and Pahnerlee were able to decalcify teethslowly in lactic acid at a pH of 5.0: McClelland in 1926 produced distilledlosses of weight in pieces of submerged enamel kept for 12 hours at a pH of 4. :Enright, Friesen and Trencher in 1932 produced Volker and Van Kesteren in 1942found the critical pH of cultures containing, enamel and dentin to be 5.0. Stephan.who contributed so much to the knowledge of plaques during the period 1933 to1943. has established the critical pH under plaques at 5.0 or below.In 1942 Becks associated high counts of lactobacilli with a high incidence ofcarious lesions. and Stralfors in 1943 noted that the higher the pH (neareralkalinity) that is established in dental plaques. the lower the number of lacto-bacilli present. Jay in 1944. 1947 and 1948 reported in detail on how to ridmouths of lactobacilli by a regime which consisted of low carbohydrate diets.and how. thereby. to halt cavitation. Kitchin and resultsof than 10 3-ears. Blayney. of the Zoller Clinic, and his associates madea thorough 'tidy of the bacteria found in plaques. and this group has made alarge contribution to the knowledge of the bacteriology of the dental plaque. In1940. Bradel and Blayney determined that lactolkicilli. in 392 (S2 per cent ) of 477patients studied. were present in 85.4 per cent c f samples. In 1942 Blayney andco-workers reported further details of the five -year continuous study of plaquesremoved from beginning cavities on the proximal surfaees of the young bicuspidsof these 47T patient. from which 3.291 specimens were obtained. Only 2 percent of 333 specimens from the 50 caries-free patients studied yielded positive(Whims of lactobacilli. Harrison in 1940 reported that streptocneei were morenumerous than lactobacilli in the months of rats on eariogenic diets and. whenthe caries activity was inhibited by the addition to the ration of fluoride or iodo-acetic aeid. there was a significant numerical reduction of the lactobacilli whilehe number of streptococci remained the same. in 1911. IIelumens. Blayney andIlarrimm published a fairly detailed report of the bacteria in the plaques whichhad been removed from teeth. The most active producers of acid were found to hecocci gad streptococci width developed a pH of 1.0 in 24 to 39 hours. Some of thediphtheroids and fikiform bacilli developed more slowly a pH of 30. None of the-eacidogenic organisms. however. survived in an avid medium of their own ultimatepH.

Hemmen. and co.worker.. in a 1940 report, stated it wastrue that diphtheroids and aciduric streptococci most commonly were isolatedfrom the material of plaques but 0:(1 not increae during. the initial stages ofdecay. while hemolytic streptocm ci and lactobacilli did show a progressiveincrease (hiring the onset of the lesion. Shaw the hemolytic streptococci wereextremely limited in numbers, they appeared to have little or nn role in caries. In1917. Stephan and Henimens stated, from studies. that laetobacilli. diph-theroids, some sarchme and some streptococci were the only organisms enpableof producing n uffieiently low pH rapidly enough to decalcify a tooth.

He was able to asso-ciate increased caries activity with a high content of sugar in the saliva and aprolonged time for clearance of this sugar. On the basis of his index for cariespotentiality. he classified such foods as candy. honey and sweetened bread as ofhighest potentiality. Recently (May 16. 1953) a brief report from the sameqinly at Lund states that -sugar in the form of toffee is more dangerous thansugar hi chocolate. It is true that Tenseher and Fosdick in 1937 observed in :1study of SS boys that sugar was retained longer after locals or consumption Ofcandy du the saliva:: of those boys most susceptible to caries. Volker and Pinker-ton in 1912 stated a clearanee time slowest after eating sticky candy and fastestafter chewing gum.

Hence, the :::11114.(Tit i(ASIII Pf the ii,efulness of the Iaindqvist index, for example, may be expressedas for that of Bibby.

ENZY3.11: SYS11:MAn appropriate system has been li,ted as an essential factorin the oral degradation of carbohydrates. inasmuch as amylase (plyaimi b. theonly member of this complex system of enzymes found secreted natmally insignificant amounts by the salivary glands. A serious interference with thisenzyme system. at any level of activity prior to the production of acid. can serveto arrest the process of caries and can provide a technic for the control of eerie,.Sonic of the'information which demonstrates the essentiality of such an oralenzyme system next trill be examined.Fosdick. as early as 1939, decided, from two weeks of incubation of glucose%%ith tribasie calcium phosphate and saliva at body temperature. that the en-zymatic fermentation of glucose produced small amounts of pliosphoglyceric,pyruvie. butyric and la elle avid.: %%litchi probably took part in dental caries. III19.10 he reported that the process of degradation of carbohydrates in the metal'%%a, the :1111(b or iinitn to that in nnr,ek fkszny dur museular activity and that. in the mouth. the series of (.117.311es probably was derived from bacteria. liepointed out in ca,es of rampant caries that a pII as low as 4.0 eau he attainedin as short a Bute a, three minutes. and that the lactic :old in the material ofplitlitleS In** increase as much as 200 per cent in the first ten-minute interval'ollowing the ingestion of a sugar solution. In 1911, with C:IttlpOigne allft Faucher. be noted that amylase converts starch to maltose rather promptly lint.for a number of reasons, little of the actin, takes place in tlie mouth. WithBonin. in 1943. he pointed out that most, concentrated sugar solution, produced-11 immediate drop in pH in earieS lesitais (027 patients studied) and that 10r cent solutions of the monosaccharides. fructose and glucose, were the hie;ar solution, tthich produeed on initial (Iron of appreciable magnitude at this1,.s'el of cone( atation. In 1018 lie stated that 13 chemical reactions were neces-sary to carry sucrose down to organic acid.Florcstano. Faber 'and James in from indiviecals no difference in caries-active children. At any rate. diastatic activity maynot be truly a part of fermentation.Barron in 1945 may be quoted :In summary, the series of eleven enzyme systems (the Sth and 10th steps arenonenzymatie) of the first phase of fermentation is made up mostly of specific 331metalloproteins with, is instances. the addition of adenylic acid or its poly- phosphates.Lipner, in 1947, it may be restated, designated, as 1111 essential factor for caries in man, the presence of a monositecharide or a disaccharide or of salivary amylase Available to break complex carbohydrates down rapidly to a form utilizable by resident oral bacteria. Pfeffer in 1918 pointed out that the splitting of the six .:arbor chain, once a monosaccharide is achieved, still is a most com plieated procemrtItelirst step of which involves adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy and hexokinase as a catalyst. The resulting products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and glucose phosphate. Splitting another section front an- other ATP molecule and utilizing a different catalyst converts glucose phos- phate to fructose diphosphate. Continuing the process to lactic acid, Pfeffer tinmerted*12 enzymes altogether 'rl'hich were involved in the fermentation of glucose.Aitken in 1919 sealed monosaccharides under amalgam in prepared cavities for his study of the process of caries and reached the gloomy conclusion that: ... as long as the human race will persist in eating ,arladtydrates, as longas these carbohydrates are capable of being hydrolyzed to the monosaccharidestate when present in the saliva, and as long as the tooth tissue remains perme- able to these substances, we shall have dental caries.Kite, Shaw and Sommues in 1950 fral 13 rats a earies-producing diet for 10 to 25 weeks and fed 13 other tinble rats through a tube, thus by-passing the oral cavity. They found thot non, of the tubefed rats developed carious lesions amt all but one of the 13 controls did. From the results of experiments reported in 1950, Sreelmy, Kireh and Nrsel concluded that \"the acids formed by the action of saliva on suitable substrate occur as a result of microbial fermenta- don\" and that their results \"tend to lend credence to the fact that the enzyme systems involved are int ,.tteellular,\" hence, developed within the microurgauisms.Weisberger, also in 1950, found that intact hums' n teeth, incubated in a solution containing glucose and mixed org.rnisms front the oral flora. developed a pig- mented carious lesion on the laatetratedthe underlying dentin. Cahnalra and Adams in 1951 postulated that immunity to cat ies in those who can inges! large a aounts of sugar is due to an enzyme system (linable of oxidizing some of the intermediate eompounds in the degra-dation of glucose to lactic acid ( r even of lactic acid itself. .11 icrococcus lactily- tieux. they found, was capable of oxidizing lactate rapidly and also pyruvate, acetate and prophmate slightly. Pigthan and Reid in 1952 pointed out that substances ( at..ylopectins, glycogen) %%ere hydrolyzed relativelyrapidly to dextrins (six, sever eight molect tes of glucose) but that these Nneeharides very slowly are redliced to the simpler namositeelm the preceding sut vey of a number of repirk which deal with the degradation of carbohydrates, it should be of interest now to summarize the do. tailof this complex process. West and Todd's textbook will he used as the source of this summary of the degradation of st irches.The necessity for ten enzymes (and a number ti coeuzy.est in order to initiate the activity at the various levels by which the process of degradation of gituae, to lactic add takes place points to at least ten stages in uhich enzymatic inhibitors might prove effective for interfering with dental earie:. A substantial anoinat of research has been devoted to the development of such inhibitors as agent-iss the (41prrol of caries. Should mane of them mace e flective, the finding would lend further stature to the previously steed css,vstinlily of an appropriate enzyme system in the process of varies.The researches of Calandra, Fail-cher and Fosdick in 19.1, Morrill and others in 1945, and Calandra and Adams in 1950. indicate that enzymatic activity of saliva is blocked in the laboratory or mouth by varioter forms of the mtptho- (inflames. In 1943. Stephan. in 1942 and 1943. Bine and O'Donnell. in 1910. Kesel and others, :111d, in 1952, Rae reported separately interference with en* blade activity by carbantide (urea). urease-producing bacteria, and cabantid-nninine. Weisberger in 11)10 and Dreizeo. Green and Spies in 1917 found that the absence of the vitamin B fraet ions. thiamin and nicotinic acid. appeared to interfere u it h salivary production of acid. Dreizen and others in 1941 completed research which indicated that sodium birathite interfered with salivary production of arid. in 1941. Calandra and Fosdiek. Kesel and others, Mann and (driers and Turner and 91-722--73---pt a-- G 332Crowell and. in 1948, Dreizen and Si ies. and, in 1950, Kuser and Fisher sulanit fedreparts of research with amino adds which showed that the presence of curtainof these protein fractions in saliva reduced the production of acid. Fosdick andCalandra in 1947 completed some promising laboratory studies with organicperoXides and glyeerle aldehyde which indicated that glyeerie aldehyde shou'dbe an active inhibitor of an enzyme involved in the degradation of sugars.Shaw, however, in 1930, found it ineffective in the reduction of caries in rats.In 1950. Forbes. Cox and Smith noted that hendecynoic acids and their ammoniumsalts reduced the production of acids in glucose saliva mixtures. In 1949. Dilland Kniesner reported no significant reduction in caries activity by the use ofa penicillin dentifrice. In 1950, Zander, as well as Fitzgerald. *kinder and Jordan.found that penicillin reduced the development of new cavities in study groupsof patients. Ludwick. Fosdick and Schantz in 1951, experimenting with enzymaticinhibitors in dentifrices, found 0.07 percent penicillin the most effective of theagents studied. 11111, Sims and Newman in 1952 found no significant changes incaries activity as the result of the use of a penicillin dentifrice when an experi-mental group of boys was compared with a control group.Obviously, the possibilities of the practical utilization of enzymatic Inhibitorsappear promising but their usefulness in the control of human dental curies is yetto be demonstrated. It may be that Fosdick, Ludwiek :mu Shantz, in 1951, whilethey were studying the extent of retention of these inhibitors in bacterialplaques, pointed out the reason for limited sueeesses in vim to dale. Presumably.the inhibiting agent not only should diffuse into the bacterial plaque butshould be retained there for an appreciable period of time in order to serveas the Nasis for a practical technic of caries control. This finding, at least,highlights the Importance of a thorough presentation of the evidence for the es-sentiality of the bacterial plaque during an appraisal of the effect of sweetenedbeverages on teeth.FACTOR 5. IIACTERIAL PLAQUE1Villi:1111S and Black, it will be recalled, pointed out the importance of the bac-terial plaque in the process of caries in the early 1890's; Williams, in fact, in astudy of over 400 eases, found that, invariably, caries' resulted from acids gen-erated in the mouth under a feltlike mass of microorganisms. Miller in 1902 re-ported that 'films and caries must occur together.\" Bunting and Riekert's exten-sive study of oral bacterial plaques in 1914 led to the conclusion that:..films or colloidal coatings are found upon all teeth; and that they play animportant part in the chain of factors which, by their balance, determine theprocess of caries.Since these early observations of the essentiality of au adherent bacterialplaque as one of the factors in the process of caries, many investigators haveadded information about the behavior of dental plaques. Inasmuch as the dentalplaque appears to be such an important mechanism in the process of caries, sincethe bacteria anti acids involved have to be protected by it and since a number ofsalivary agents which modify caries have to penetrate this barrier, informationabout the oral bacterial plaque will be reviewed in regard to (1) structure, (2)bacteriology, (3) behavior as a selective membrane and (4) acidity.$truetnre of the Dental Plaque.of the earlier investigators, Williams. Millerand Bunting and Rickert, all pointed out that the long, threadlike actimanyeetes,leptothrix and eladothrix. appeared to serve as the basis of the plaque, that thesethreadlike forms entrapped oral debris and provided a shelter for a number ofsmaller organisms in the mouth. Bunting and Rickert pointed out that there wasconsiderable difference in their rate of attachment but, in many cases, a thick,adherent growth would develop in 24 hours.Dradel and Biayney in 1940. studying ground sections of enamel, reported thatthe plaque grossly was a \"feit-like mass with long filamentous forms protruding.\"Miller, Jodi, and Bradel. the Sallie yew stated that the dental bacterial plaquewas a thin Min which adhered tenaciously to a tooth and maid not be removedby a stream of water ar by ordinary swabbing or !washing: that, microscopically.it appeared as a mass of small bacteria embedded in a matrix of filamentousmicroorganisms. the bacteria supplying perhaps half of the total bulk. Dietzin 1913 watched microscopically the development of the plaque. Ile found thatleptothriehoid and oidiumlike organisms served as the base of the plaque, be-coming a thin plaque in one day under which initial etching of the enamel would 333take ',lave one-half hour after the ',roper carbohydrate was applied.

With the plaque sealed to a diffusion apparatus he found that the salivary buffers (0:triton:it es amid phosphates) and the viscous. 111111111104erie. salivary mucin did not pass such a membrane but that soluble earbohyto ales did pass through rawly :11 'hp rate 44 3.2 mg. per day. Mots. working tela somewhat similar membrane obtained from the surfaces of newlyerupted teeth. reported in 1937 that the enamel cuticle (Nastnyth'slebrane). when pineed over windows lu glass slides. permitted the dialysis ofystalloids but lint of colloids.

Others then demonstrated the seleetive permeability of the dental Plaque to a number of substances. Stephan and Miller in year. they showed that Zephiran and LAmerol penetrated plaques and interfered in the expected drop of pH 111 an ill% erse relationship to the thickness of the plaque. In 1943 Stephan also showed that urea in concentrations of 1 to 110 per pent would IH'Itetratc the dental Plaque readily : again in 1944 Stephan and Millerdemonstrated that Zephirtin and saturated solutions of urea would penetrate plaques: in 1943 Muntz and Miller also showed that glucose and urea penetrated the dental plaque: ill 1945 Bruekner. reporting on the selectivity of loneterialplaques developed on cellophane sealed over (1.9 111111. glass tubes. stated that theplaque permitted the passage of midi= bicarbonate at a reduced rate: and Fos-dick, faulwlek and hi 1951 reported the passage aucl prolonged retentionof V011011111 in the plaque.Acidity of the Dental Plaque. Research reported by Etherington and Trimble in 1934 indicated that \"In every instance the plaque interior was more acid thanthe eorrespooding saliva.\" In 1938 Stephan. It may be repeated. determined thatthe pH values of 211 plaques varied from 4,6 to TM. while ID 1989 Miller andMentz reported that the amount of acid in 15 lummu carious lesions varied withthe soluble calcium and phosphorus present. Again, too, it may be repeated thatrnsdiek and Starke pointed out in 1939 that the phi of an individual's saliva canbe too highfor decalcificationto occur while. at the sane' time. the pH in a bac-terial plaque becomes so low that deealcifica t ion takes place.Stephan In 1940 reported in detail the effects of 10 per cent glucose tilers onImeterial plaques when measured in patients' mouths. The %wag(' maxi aula variation found was 2.0 pH units. In 15 minutes after the rinse. all plaques measured showed a phi of 5.0 or less and. about two hours Inter. approached their 334original p13. A second glucose rinse repeated the same finding. Since the greatest intensity of reduction of the pH in pimples was reached daring the first 30 min-utes and was Lyadsta Ily overcome during the next two or thre, hours. it appearsthat the repealed renewal of a carbohydrate which can dim c. into the plaque is important in the development of a cavity.

Stralfors itt1915 observed that the plaque appears to have the ability to ,tore acid and tohinder the saliva fromneutralizing it.Glynn in 1949 reported that only eight hours was required for lactic acid. in concentrations detected in dentalplaques. to penetrate enamel. Neuwirth in 1950 found that citric acid was notproduced from the action of oral microorganisms on glucose. Recently (1952),Fosdick has pal)lished a stimulating review of the belmyior of dental bacterial'plaques. and has listed speculations which might e'-plain the variance in pHdeterminations reported from studies which have been punned.The work reported by Stephan in 1944 seems so important to an anderztandingof the role of the bacterial plaque and so important to a proper appraisal of thecariogenic properties of sweetened beverages that some of his repot js repeatedat this point :Since most of the work wide]] has been reported on acid prodnetion by monthbacteria has not simulated Nonillions in the mouth. it b. worth pointing (lilt someessential differences between studs studies and the experiments described here.The bacteria rrowing on tooth surfaces exist in concentrated masses or \"idaques-which possess a maximum concentration of enzymes and coenzymes in a mini-nun] space with minimum buffering capacity. The acid ^roduction by such bac-terial masses is very mold %rhea carbohydrate is available and. since little Initialbuffering capacity must be overcome. the drop in pH is likewise very rapid ... The subjects (05 in number) were seated in a semi-seeliniat position in a chairequipped with a headrest. They were instneted not to talk during the test. Thelabial :urface, of the upper and lower interior teeth were generally chosen forthe tests because of their accessibility.

Direct pH determinationswere made on the tooth surfaces with a polished -stick antimony electrode usingit vaesnim tube potentiometer. . .The mouth was rinse 1 with 25 e.e. of a 10 per cent aqueous solution of glucose for two minutes following initial pH deter.mietions. The pTT determinations were repealed hus minutes after IlIP glucoserinse and at 10-minute intervals thereafter until the pit had returned to ap-moximately its original value.Before the application of glucose, the pH values of most areas were aroundneutrality except in the eases of extreme caries activity. in which pH voluteswere generally considerably lower.

McClure in 1913, Haggard and Greenberg in 1951. and Miller in 1952 contribute some of this information.Some of the comment on the decalcifying etTe't of acid beverages now may be presented (a.ronofogically. McClelland, commenting op the dissolution of enamel in 1926. presented evidence that a definite loss of weight in pieces of enamel sub - merged in a solution with a under 1.5 takes 'dace within 12 hours. and that decalcification occurs very rapidly in ranges of1.0 to 2.5 (Bridge., and Mat - tice determine d the range fee a ola beverage as pII 2.4 to 2.05). MeClelland con- luded from his study :Certainly the mesen\u00abe of a reaction of 3.5 and below. even if existing for only a few minutes, is a potential source of damage to teeth. Miller and Neuwirth in 1935 reported their observation of cough drops (SO per cent sucrose) and flavored disks (96 per eent sucrose) and flavored bard ea mites (99 per cell, sucrose) held in the mouths of five adult patients daily until dis- solved in the saliva. All experienced extravagant decalcification of their teeth. WestJinlY in 1935 reported a 'somewhot similar study. They stated: When an huh\\ lethal pinoes a piece of ordinary acidified candy in his mouth and ;Mons it to dissolve. slowly against his feet)]. the concentration of the solu- tion at l'ie surface of the cattily (and in contact with tooth enamel) will be very high with a probable pi I of 3 1....They reported further that 10. 20. 10 and 60 per cent water solutions of orange. lemon and lime drops provided an initial plI of 2 5 to 2.5 (slightly less aeid than die coin beverage) and that ill per cent ,olntions in saliva developed a pH of 3.4 to 3.7 as compared with JO per cent solut foes of sucrose in saliva which developed a pH of 3.2. They concluded that repeated use throughout the day leads to seri- w's decalcifieation.Bridges and Mattice in 1939. reporting pit values of representative tomb, commented that the least acid were bananas. figs. papayas. watermelons. can- taloupes and avocados with a pH of 5.0 to 0.0+: while those below pII 3.0 were some grapes. plains. some grapefruit juice. cranberry juice, limes and lemons. In a concluding statement, they reported : It is possible that the future will demonstrate that the pH of food is of little moment. Presumably the most important factor is the property of the individual food in stimulating the flow of gastric juice whether this be attributed to hy- drogen-ion. to other constituents; in the food. or to products of digestion. .. None approximate normal gastric acidity at the height of digestion (pTT 1.0 -1 gl. Bridges and Mattice, of course. were not dentists.Trask, Ziegler and Maloof in 1910 reached five conclusions about the decal- cification of fragments of freshly extracted teeth following quantitative studies of five-days' exposure to the dripping of a variety of solutions. 1. Starches and sugars per se do not deealcify teeth, but lactic acid formed from them may do so.2. Acid foods having n pTI of about or below 111:1S prove to he the most ha- portant factors in dental decalcification. 3363. Other acids than lactic acid in foods have been shown to cause extensivedecalcification of teeth.4. Many commonly used foods are acid and have a pH from 4 to 2.05.5. The alkalis studied do not demineralize teeth.McClure in 1943 found hydrochloric acid, pH 1.5, more destructive of rats'molars than lactic acid, pH 2.4, but citric acid. pH 2.5, lactic acid, pH 3.0, andlactic acid, p c4.0. also would erode rats' teeth. He experimented with youngi2 ,s who %% ere limited in their drinking of fluids 1 changed (mei] 24 hours) to ginger ale, cola drink, grapefruit juice and eanberry juice cocktail. All rats onthese acid beverag(-- experienced deealeilication of their molars. The control rats.drinking water, did not experience this decalcificationMeCay, and Restarski and Restarski, Gortner and MeCar in 1945reported:In an initial experiment, some extracted human teeth were immersed in acommon \"cola\" beverage. When first inspected after two days' immersion theenv, el surfaces were found to be grossly decalcified.Se,ere destruction of the enamel on the molars of white rats (200 rats) wasproduced by allowing the animals to drink the popular soft beverage for periodsof five (lays or more. . ..Preliminary observations on six puppies showed that consumption of softdrinks (500 c.c. per day) also produced gross and microscopic changes on theirdeciduous teeth.Bieri and others in 1946, proceeding on the assumption that limited amounts ofacid beverage would produce erosion of the teen, of rats, dogs and monkeys,tested this assumption in an experimental situation. They reported:1. Drinking of an acetic acid-sucrose solution of pll 2.6 for 1-2 weeks pro-duced mild to moderate etching of ats' molars. C range juice of pH 3.7 decalci-fied the teeth severely in two weeks. Solutions of pH 4.5 caused no etching whenfed for two weeks.2. The permanent teeth of dogs drinking a phosphoric acid-sucrose solution ofpH 2.6 for 130 days showed etching of the enamel....3. Consumption of 16.5 ml. daily for one month of phosphoric and eit:c acidsolutions of pH 2.6 produced noticeable erosion of the deciduous teeth of youngmonkeys.Stafne and-Lovestedt, at the Mayo Clinic in 1947, reported their observationsof the oral conditions of patients examined in this Clinic. Fifty patients who wereusing lemon juice as a therapeutic measure showed evidence of dissolution oftooth structure. They continued their report :Restarski and co-workers stated that the resnits of their observations on ani-mals t drinking a popular cola beverage) did not justify their making any definiteconclusions as to what effects ingestion of acid beverages might have on the teethof man. We have observed in some cases. however, destruction of enamel whichwe believe can be ascribed to the habitual use of acid bevers.ges.In 1948, Wynn and Habil summarized their observations of experiments withrats:Erosion in the lower molar teeth of the albino rat resulted from the daily in-gestion of each of the following canned fruit juices when they were served asthe sole fluid intake over a period of 100 days: apple. grape. orange. tomato.sweetened grapefruit, pineapple, prune.The greatest amount of erosion occurred in the teeth of the animals on apple.grape and grapefruit juice. and the least in those of the ;mini:its on tomato andprune juice.Erosion of a milder degree also resulted from the ingestion of tomato. orangeand sweetened grapefruit juice 3 times a day for 200 days.Complicating the interpretation of studies of decalcification are the findin.:sof Brudevold in 1948. He found that there was a distinct difference in the solu-bility of powdered enamel and intact enamel. of different surfaces of the sametooth. of outer am inner levels of enamel from the same tooth, and of enamelfrom deciduous and young permanent teeth when compared with older pe -mimetic teeth. The values obtained from different laboratories presumably willvary accordingly.Wray and Will m 1949 became interested in the dental effects of soft drinks%Odell were claimed to have a retail value annually in excess of $700,000,000.and they tested the pH produced by a cola beverage in the salivas of 32 youngofheers at the Naval Medical Research hp4 Rate. Ten milliliters of the beverai,e 337n ere held in each mouth. agitated for 30 seconds and then expectorated. Therange in pit of the saliva and solution reef ,.ered tailed from 2.5 to 5.O.Hicks in 1930 and again in 1951 reported the effects of the daily ingestionof large amounts of eitrus fruits and juices on a group of patients, selectedbecause of periodontal irritation or \"sensitive\" teeth. One of the four patientswith sensitive teeth ate daily large portions of sliced fruit salad and drank eightounces of orange. tangerine or tomato juice. The decalcification of this patient'steeth nits similar to that in the teeth of the patients described by Statue andLovestedt.Haggard and Greenberg in 1951 concluded that the ingestion of carbohydrate - rontaining(11(1 not cause significant acidity of the saliva, althoughacidulated beverages such as common fruit juices or soft drinks din result insalivary acidity for short periods. They concluded, further. that decalcificationof the exposed surfaces or sheltered areas of teeth by the action of fruit juicesor soft drinks appeared tini:kely hi the amounts normally consumed. Their finalconclusion may be quoted:It is true that there are, in fact, persistent areas of carbohAdrate and corrosiveacidity on sheltered surfaces of the teeth and under plaques u Welt are protectedfrom dilution and neutralization by the sale it would be expected that this protection would also operate against fart.. acidification by the brief tides of acidity occurring in the saliva after ingestion of the acidulated beverages.Inasmuch as the evidence submitted earlier in the portion of the present re-port dealing with bacterial plaques does indicate that a number of acids candiffuse into bacterial plaques, this latter assumption appears not to be borne outby scientific observations.F3sbury in 1952 tested the action of comp:,rable olutions of hydrochloric,nitric. sulfuric, acetic and citric adds on exposed surface., of extracted teeth. Heconcluded :The results suggest that deLtal erosion of this kind is mrinly controlled bythe pll of the solution. and is independent of the concentration of the solutionby weight. The rate of attack varies, MA-0% er. from acid to acid dne to specificproperties of the acids themselves. Noteworthy is citric acid which is more thantwice as destructive as hydrochloric or nitric acid.tlortner and Kenigsberg, in 1952 experimented with 28 white rats who weregiven daily 20 milliliters of grapefruit juice sweetened by 10 per cent of sucrose.and 25 rats given grapefruit sections. similarly sweetened anti in daily amountst,) provide :Id milliliters of juice. At the end of one week, the animals were sacri-ficed and the lower molars scored for decalcification on the basis of zero for-no effect\" to six for \"extensive destruction.\" The average tooth scores for thejad-e was 3S and for fruit sections 1.5, showing a higher rate of decalcificationby the juice. 'L'o check the possibility that chewing stimulated a greater flow ofsaliva and In-tlee tare buffering, eight desalivated rats were tested similarly,anditwas found that the teeth stillexperienced the same amount of decalcification.Soifer in 1953 reported on a patient who had used excessive vinegar when shewas between 15 and 25 years of age. This patient exhibited extensive erosion ofthe labial surfaces of her maxillary incisors.At this point, it would seem, some legitimate conclusions about the decalcifyingeffect of sweetened beverages and acid fruit juices should be submitted. It wouldappear, from the evidence, examined (3) that a number of soft drinks posses:: ahigh degree of acidity as is shown by their unusually low pH, (2) that a numberof fruits and fruit juices provide a pH below the critical point for the decalcifi-cation of enamel, (3) that decalcification does occur when either are consumedin large amounts or at frequent intervals and (4) that such decalcification shouldnot be significant unless abnormal amounts of such drinks are consumed.Sweetened Beverages and Caries.Tlie final task of this report is to examine thecariogenic properties of soft drinks. The essential role in the process of caries offermentable carbohydrates already has been stated and documented. In addi-tion, the necessity for the introduction into the oral cavity of a carbohydvitewhich can be degraded promptly to lactic acid by the bacterial enzymes pro-duced in caries-active months has been pointed out as a part of this documenta-tion. Furthermore, an adherent, selective bacterial plaque has been shown to benecessary in the formation and development of carious lesions in enamel, and theevidence of the ability of simple sugar solutions to penetrate into dental plaques promptly and to he utilized almost immediately after their ingestion has beensummarized and documented. Finally, it Atould be noted that any cariognicproperty to be ascribed to a sweetened beverage, such as the cola drink alreadydiscussed, must be based on the behavior of a 10 per cent or less solution of su-crose or other readily fermented sugar. A brief, chronological review of somepertinent conclusions a investigators of the damaging potential of sugar solu-tions now appears to be in order.In 1937. Fosdick. Ilansen and Epp le found that saliva stimulated by chewinggum (in older to provide sugar in solution) could be incubated with the pow-dered hard tissue of teeth and could produce decalcificati .on of these tis.-nes. (obtained similar results by adding 5 tan cent glucose. This finding was incorpo-rated into a test for cres activity.In 1942 the Council of Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Associa-tion presented a report on wartime nutrition that appears appropriate to thepresent evaluation. Some of tl:e final statement will be quoted :However, even uih soldiers and sailors supplied with satisfactory rations, thetendency to say in effect \"Let's give the boys what they want : it isn't going to hurt them.- if allowed to go to the extent of permitting intliseriminaleuse of soft drinks and candy. will undermine efficiency. Indiscriminate and uncon-trolled supply of poor food for between-meal eating cannot be condoned withimpunity anywhere.The Council then submitted the final opinion :From the health point of view, it is deNiralde especially to have restriction (olsuch use of sugar as is represented by the consumption of sweetened carbonatedbeverages and forms of candy which are of low nutritional vfdlle. The Council be-lieves it would be in the interest of the public health for all practical means to betaken to limit the consumption of sugar in any form :n which it fails to be com-bined with significant Thaportions of other foods of high nutritive value.Jay in 19.14 and again in 1947 stated bluntly from years of experience thatno foods prepared with sugar are to be used during the first four weeks of controlof an individual's caries by dietary means. The following statement eneompas-v,his sixth specific suggestion for the planning of daily menus:Dn not use the follow bigConfections of any kind ; chewing gum ; beveragesprepared with sugar. similar to those served at fonrtains. and other soft drinkssold in bottles. chocolate milk and chocolate drinkr. ':he use of sugar-coated pillsand cough sirups should be restricted whenever possible. Avoid dentifrices andmouthwashes sweetened with sugar.Tay, it must be noted. has snecee0ed in arrestim, the caries activity index con-sistently in over 80 per cent of his pa tnott----83 4 per cent of tb SO9 pa tient,,listed as participating in the control diet for the first two week. in his 1!117report.Becks, Jensen and Millarr in 19-14 obtained similar results by restricting pa-tients temporarily to a low-sugar diet in which they eliminated :Sugar in and on foods. all concentrated sweets. such as jams. jelly. sirup. honey.raisins, dates. figs. primes. urrants. and (linnet) chewing gum.eonfections. pastries and sweet beverages.Of 1.225 patients experiencing rampant e:tries whose coed m had been fol- towed for one to four year, caries was halted in 1.004 (81.7 per cent). Of thesepatients. 499 Well observed for one year, 111 for two years. 15 far three years.and .ix for four years, t 1 establish that caries activity bad ceased.Kitchin and Permar in 1948, with similar low-sugar diets prescribed for 216caries-arti ve patients (10.000+ lactobacillus counts), obtained a satisfactoryreduction in the number of oral lactobacilli during the restricted initial two-weekdiet. Of these patients, 192 progressed to diet plan two (mote starch permitted)for two \u00abnelcs and SO per cent maintained their low count,.Anderson and others in 1918 found more cavities in cotton rats who were 1'0dried milk than in thoSe who were fed fluid milk. and ern eluded, in the cotton rat.that fluidity was an important factor iu t cries. However, both groups experiencedet:of:hien-1W less caries than those animals fed on a regular dry eariogenie diet.4 )11; er and Pinkerton in 1947 reported :Appreeiable acid production has been observed to lake place within fifteen min-utes in mixthres of glucose. sucrose and concentrated saliv:try debris of carionspersons. Various raw carbohydrates ha% e been shown to be converted to :mid atrates similar to those observed for refined sugar.In this report, they also postulated that the salivary clearance thole of gluemebold be implicated in the process of caries as did Lundqvist in 1952.

The use of a carbohydrate retention value rather than total food retention would seem to be indicated for calculations of deealciffiation potentials of certain. if not all, foods. If this is not done. calculatlons for foods. such as beverages with a low carbohy- drate content, are unduly elevated by including as hose for calculation the 90 per vent hater content. whereas results for foods, such as toffee, are influenced only to the extent of the 10 per cent of other substances eontained. III addition, the fun t that certain foods appear to be retained in mid' greater proportions upon the teeth themselves while others are retained chiefly upon the oral mucous membranes may considerably affect the amount of mid production front these foods on the tooth surfaee.

In addition to the difficulties associated with the measurement of food retention. the significance of the values obtained for acid production of the foods in sun vary -amides must be questioned. Apart from questions which might be ratspd as to nwthods in determining acid formation, it is doubtful whether the values obtained truly reflect the fermentability of the foods in the month.

PREVENTIONCOMBINED UTILIZATION OF AVAILABLE AND IMMINENT MEASURES SHOULD LARGELYPREVENT THIS UBIQUITOUS DisEAsEBy Henry W. Scherp *Dental sari s is localized. progressive decay of the teeth, initiated by demin-eralization of the outer surface of the tooth dne to organic acids produced locallyby bacteria that ferment deposits of dietary carbohydrates. With progressiveloss of tooth mineral and secondary destruction of tooth protein by continuedbacterial action. cavities form which. if =treated. extend and destroy most ofthe tooth. often leading to serious infection of the surrounding tissues. Almosteveryone in the United Slates experiences dental caries to some degree, mostlybefore adulthood. This disease is the leading cause of lost teeth before age 35.when chronic progressive destructive periodontitis (pyorrhea) begins to super.vent.. Though not ordinarily considered to be endangering to life, these two dis-eases are among the most prevalent and troublesome afflictions of man. Bothare consequences of selective colonization of tooth surfaces by bacteria intlig-(MOUS to theoral cavity.During the past decade, dental caries research has experienced an impressiveresurgence on a broad front, catalyzed primarily by experimental substantiationof the concept that caries results-from one or more transmissible infections.Specifically. caries results from colonization of vulnerable surfaces of theteeth by a characteristic group of bacteria, harbored by many members of a sits-eptilde host species and transmitted from them to previously uninfected mem-bers of the same species. These bacteria ferment dietary carbohydrates in situ.principally to lactic acid which, tit susceptible sites, initiates the carious lesion bydemineralizing the enamel surface. In particular. the predominant group of cario-genie bacteria identified until now can metabolize sucrose in a peculiar way,producing extacellularly an from the lactic also store intracellular polySaceharide (amylopectin) during periodsof environmental carbohydrate abundance and utilize it with the fomithition oflactic acid during periods of environmental carbohydrate deficiency. The devel-opment of caries requires critical relationships between tooth surface, oral micro-biota. and dietary carbohydrate. The logical approach to control. therefore, is tomodify one or more of the three factors in this host-parasite-environmentpl ex.Yet despite the advances in our understanding of its pathogenesis, caries con-tinues to he a major public health problem. In the United States, nearly every-one sooner or later develops some caries; it has been estimated that we nowspend about S2 billion annually to repair the resultant damage. Even so. weobviously meet only a minor fraction of the need. Since caries is principally :tdisease of young people, recent experience of the U.S. Army gives a representativepicture of the problem. Army surveys indicate that every 100 inductees require000 fillings. 112 extractions. 40 bridges. 21 crowns. 15 partial dentures. and onefull denture. To repair completely the damage caused by caries nationwide wouldcost an estimated SS billion more annually than we now spend.On the other hand, review of the caries research accomplished warrants ex-pectation that we could greatly speed amelioration of such deplorable statisticsby a concerted effort to apply existing knowledge, to develop established leads.*Theauthor is special assistant to thedirector,National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda,Md.. 20014,for National CariesProgram.(352) atel to foster the fundamental research judged most likely to produce utilizablenew information. To this end the National Institute of Dental Research has eat-Int rked on a National Caries Program.For control of caries, priority must be given to prevention, rather than repairor cure. because there are no clearly evident therapeutic leads that promise todo more at best than arrest a carious lesion once it is clinically detectable. thi theother hand, experience cautions us that prevention will be achieved only gradu-ally. Meanwhile. heavy demand for restorative dentistry %ill continue and so%ill the research for improved restorative materials and procedures. This dis,---cmssion. however. is limited to prevention.In seeking areas %Otero action seems most likely to benefit the most peoplepromptly. three questions were asked. What measures of proved efficacy are beingused inadequately? Mutt measures have been sufficiently proved by preliminaryclinical trials to warrant largesettle field demonstration or national application?What fundamental research is ready for intensive development and clinical trial?The currently most likely answers follow, as they pertain respectively to tooth.diet. mat caiogenic bacteria.PROTECTING THE TEETIIAdequate incorporation of fluoride in teeth, particularly in the outer layers ofthe enamel, remains the one thoroughly proved means to increase resistance ofteeth to caries. The experience of 25 years leaves no doubt that daily intakethroughout life of about 1 milligram of fluoride per person, as commonl -prO-vided by from 0.7 to 1.2 parts of fluoride per million parts of water in publicwater supplies, harmlessly lowers the caries rate by from 50 to 60 percentin permanent teeth and slightly less in deciduous teeth, under present conditionsin the United States. Logically, a national program to prevent caries shouldbe based on universal fluoridation at this level. Yet in 1967 only 52.S percent ofour population using public water supplies received this benefit, 40.3 percent bycontrolled artificial fluoridation and 6.5 percent by natural fluoridation. Twenty-two percent of the total U.S. population, or 44 million persons, do not have -.messto public water systems, though presumably many ingest naturally fluoridated%rater and sonic rtceive controlled amounts of fluoride by other means. Clearlya major effort is still needed, to fluoridate more communal water supplies andby alternate means to get fluoride to the large fraction of our population notthus accessible. The latter group could be reached by controlled fluoridation ofwater supplies at central schools in rural areas; via the diet, as by additionof fluoride to salt. sugar. flour, milk, or other widely consumed foodstuffs; bydirect ingestion of fluoride tablets or solutions: or by do-it-yourself topical ap-plication of fluoride, whether in dentifrices or in aqueous solutions. Essentially,this seems to be a problem of public health administration.What about the enormous number of carious lesions that develop despitefluoridation? Are we recommending a sufficient dosage of fluoride? The thoroughepidemiological studies of the past indicated that more than .1 ppm of fluoridein the water supply (lid not confer much additional protection against caries inpermanent teeth. Some investigators, however, have recommended 2 ppm asmore beneficial for deciduous teeth, though at some risk of slight fluorosis(mottled enamel) in permanent teeth. Alternatively, the fluoride content ofenamel can be increased by direct (topical) application, with practically norisk of fluorosis. Recent studies indicate that intensive topical application offluoride, to increase the fluoride content of the outer few microns of enamelto two or three times the average level acquired from fluoridated water, canreduce caries by as much as 75 to 80 percentthat is, half again as much reduc-tion as isbrought aboutby controlled fluoridation of water supplies. Further-more, the anticaries effect and the elevated fluoride content of the enamel per-sisted for at least 23 months without additional topical application and with-out fluoridated water. By using a slightlyacid-phosphate-fluoride solution and prior treatment of the teeth with cations such as aluminum or titanium, whichcomplex strongly with fluoride ion, it should be possible to reduce greatly thenumber of applications needed to achieve the desired levels of enamel fluoride.Caries that develops despite optimum fluoridation of teeth occurs principallyin the pits and fissures that are a normal feature of the occlusal (grinding) sur-faces of the molars and bicuspids. This vulnerability is usually attributed to impaetion of food residues and bacteria plus thinness of the enamel in theseareas. at least in newly erupted teeth : with age, the enamel thickens and thesusceptibility to caries lessens. On the other hand, it was shown in the 1920*s thatareas with pits and fissures could he protected against caries either by drillingthem out to form wide nonretentive grooves or by preparing them like cavitiesand then filling .hem with dental amalgam. No matter how effective, these proce-dures obviously were not destined to gain wide popularity. Now the same resultcan be accomplished by sealing the ieclusal surfaces with a newly developedadhesive polymer. The surface is clea,:sed. conditioned for bonding by a briefetch with a solution of phosphoric acid and zinc oxide. washed, and dried. Themonomeric adhesive solution is painted on with a fine brush and allowed toflow out briefly to form :t Smooth coat. Polymerization is initiated by a short ex-posure to ultraviolet light of wavelength 3660 angstroms, which is shorter thanthe visible but longer than'the \"stinburn\".range. One year after a single applica-tion. this sealant %vas retained in 99.5 percent of treated sites, which remained-free of caries. whereas 42 percent of untreated contralateral sites in the samemouths had become carious. After a second year, sealant could not be discerned in13 percent of treated sites on permanent teeth or in 150 percent on deciduousteeth :nevertheless, respective caries reductions of 99 percent and 87 percentwere found. 'This simple. rapid, painless procedure can 1e carried ant entirelyby properly instructed and supervised dental-assistants. Optimally. melte-III sur-faces should he sealed soon after eruption of the tooth to protect them duringtheir most caries-susceptible periodthe first several years at least. It will beimportant to ascertain whether such early sealing impedes the previously men-tioned normal maturation and development of resistance to caries. therebypossibly leaving the pits and fissures indefinitely susceptible to caries, if uncov-ered. Even if so, routine inspection and reapplication oP-sealant, if necessary.could compensate for this limitation. Application of this measure on .1 publichealth scale would. of course, have to overcome an enormous manpower proldem,quite likely necessitating a great increase in auxiliary dental personnel.MODIFYING THE DIETAn abundance of epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates thatsucrose is a particularly cariogenic culprit in our modern diet. So far as we knowthis unfortunate property relates to the peculiar way in which sucrose can bemetabolized by cariogenic streptococci. as mentioned previously :admittedly.nmeh more investigation of this paint is needed. Whatever the mechanism, ifwe got practically all of our carbohydrate from starchy foods, and If we wereadequately fluoridated, caries on the crowns of the teeth would almost certainlybe negligible. Such is the case in regions of Southeast Asia, for example. Thoughthe nunffier of subjects is necessarily small. data on persons suffering fromhereditary fructose intolerance point to the same conclusion. These personsare deficient in the liver aldolase that splits fructose-I-phosphate, an essentialstep in human fructoQe metabolif.m. They become violently ill if thev ingest morethan very small amounts of sucrose or fruit containing fructose. Consequentivthey tend to avoid sweetstuffs of all kinds, and combine starchy foods instead.They experience little or no caries.Nevertheless, a low sucrose diet does not necessarily guarantee freedom fromcaries. Teeth in skulls from presucrose cultures exhibit a significant prevalenceof caries. Though the attack rate in the original population can only be eon--lectured. it seems to have been melt lower than in modern times. On the otherhand. some geographically isolated populations currently subsisting predomi-nantly on locally grown starchy diets, and presumably consuming lit tie or nosucrose. experience a caries prevalence as great as half that recorded in un-fluoidated regions of the 'United States. Since nearby groups on similar diet:: ex-perience little or no caries, environmental factors presumably are involvedpos-silov a peculiarly high level of fluoride and other trace elements in theWhether replacement of dietary sucrose by other sugars would retitle,. hu-man caries as effectively asreplacement by starch has not been ascertained :there are no data. In experhnental caries of hamsters and rats, however, glu-cose or fructose, or an equimolar mixture of the two, have on the whole inducedmach le's caries than sucrose. Comparisons between these studies are verydifficult because of differences in strains of animal, consistency and compositionof diets. methods of scoring caries, and measures to ensure presence of cariogenic1. 355bacteria. The reductions in caries activity have been most pronounced onsinfaces of teeth, where development of caries seems to depend on Streptocommmutants and its adhesion dextran produced from sucrose. Inthe hamster, all caries is of this type because of the morphology of the teeth. Inthe deep fissures of the rat molars, on the other hand, food impaction makes ad-hesion unnecessary and indigenous aeidogens, as well as S. malanx. can initiatecaries if provided with various fermentable sugars. such as glucose. fructose.maltose, or sucrose. Substitution of starch for sugars, however, consistently reduces the caries scores to very low levels.Replacement of sucrose in our diet would require quite a cultural and tech-nological revolution. but might not be as impractical as it seems. Trials with can-dies made with a hydrogenated starch hydrolyzate have been made in Sweden.Even if sucrose could be replaced by other sweets in candy or other between-mealsnacks alone, the result might be quite beneficial, judging by animal studies andepidemiological data. Merely reducing the frequency of eating a high-i-ncrose dietsignificantly reduces caries in rats. In humans, increased frequency of between-local eating of sugary snacks correlates with increased caries attack. Further-more, in vitro at concentrations of sucrose below 0.i percent. Streplocoeca.t mou- tons makes little or no dextran. This fact emphasizes the importance of keepingas low as possible the intraoral accumulation of sucrose, whether by reducingthe frequency of intake, avoiding adherent sweetstuffs, or diluting the sucroseiu sweetstuffs with other sweeteners. The consideration,- n this paragraph are,of course, predicated on the as yet untested assumptions in human diets other sugars would be less cariogenic than sucrose.If it is not practicable to replace sucrose in our diet, can anything be added tothe diet to mitigate its cariogenicity? Phosphates are a possible answer. Morethan 150 laboratory studies agree -that addition of any of a wide variety of in-organic and organic phosphates to high-sucrose and other caringenic diets sig-nificantly reduces ca.-his in rats and hamsters. in some experiments almost com-pletely. On average, the phosphorus content of the diet must be doubled to geta marked caries reduction. So far, the cyclic condensed salt, sodium trimeta-phosphate, has been the most effective one. How phosphates mitigate caries hasnot been ascertained, except that they act locally in the oral cavity and seem tobenefit newly erupted teeth the most. Unfortunately, the relatively few clin:^altrials reported so far do not tell us unequivocally whether or not a phosphatedietary supplement reduces caries in humans. Translating the conditions of theanimal model into a regimen suitable for delivering adequate extra phosphate tohumans presents many complexities. Conceivably it might be helpful if a phos-phate were incorporated in sweetened between-meal snacks alone. Also, sincephosphates evidently prevent caries by local action in the oral cavity, frequentdirect application of concentrated solutions to the teeth might be beneficial.Thirty years ago, epidemiologists of the Public Health Service Were struck by the wide variations in caries experience between different localities.difference' were greatest between low-fluoride areas, though they Were dis.eernilde between high-fluoride areas also. It was suggested that varies resistai.cemight Lc attributable not only to the fluoride content of drinking water but alsoto other trace elements or to unusually high concentrations of ordinary con-stituents of the water. Only recently. howiwer, has this experiment of naturebegan to receive the epidemiological and laboratory study that it merits. studyindicates a correlation between low caries experience and increased concentra-tions of boron. lithium. molybdenum, strontium. titanium. and vanadium in thedrinking water. Except for fluoride. however. available data indicate that fromSO to 09 percent of our trace elemkt intake collies from foodstuffs.

Thus, anotherstudy emphasizes the '-alkaline earth\" factor in the soilthe content of stron-tium. calcimn. magnesium, lithium. and potassium and. to a lesser\"tree. zirconiumboron. Though it is clearly premature to eow-ider controlledadministration of such elements to humans. if these correlations can be validatedand shown to signify a casual relation, an anticaries measure as potent as coa-ti-idled fluoridation should to reduei, colquization of the teeth by caringenie bacteria or to suppresc91-722-73pt. 3-8 their activities, as by topical application of antibacterial agents, metabolic reulators to inhibit production of cariogenie products, or enzymes to digest prod-ucts condueing 10 adhesion of bacteria to teeth, and immunological measures.Paradoxically. while strong emphasis has been given to increasing the resistaneeof teeth to caries and reducing the cariogenicity of the diet, proportionately littleattention has been given to antimicrobial measures, possibly because until recently evidem was lacking for specific agents in caries.The caiogenie importance of a group of anaerobic streptococci matins or,Hirt: imligemnisly in the human mouth in widely separated parts of the world andoften eonstitnies the majority of streptococci in dental plaque.

Streptococcal strains closely resembling the carlogcnic S. mutt/usindigenous to rats and hamsters have been isolated by direct culture regularlyfrom human carious lesions. where they frequently constitute the majority ofthe steptocecei. Snell strains induce caries when implanted in the oral cavityin conjunction with a suitable diet in germfree and \"relatively gnotobiotic\" rats.and in hamsters, gerbils. for etiololzicsignificanee of S. mutons in human caries is therefore comparable to Koch's(1SS2) classic evidence for the causative role of the tubercle bacillus in humantubel culosis. Strains of S. fltili(1)18 labeled by acquired resistance to streptomycinhave been implanted in the human oral cavity. The high endemicity of Avild-typeS. \u00bbtalons in the teat population, however, prevents conclusions about the cario-genicity of the implanted strain.Some strains of several other bacterial species have induced corona/ caries inhamsters. gnotobiotic rats, or \"relatively gnotobiotic\" rats. when inthe oral cavity in eonjunetion with a high sucrose Streptococcus sanguis, species, Lactobacillus acidophilus. and Lacto-bacillus easel. On the whole, however, these organisms have induced caries lessregularly and less extensively than strains of Streptococcus mulans, particularlyon coronal smooth surfaces.Lactobacilli, long the leading contender as the microbial factor in human caries.have understandably been eclipsed of late by the evidence favoring streptococci.I believe there is good reason to keep then; :a the running. In addition to theexperiments just cited, showing that monoinfection with some pure cultures oflactobacilli can induce caries in rats. other investigations have demonstrated apreferential accumulation of lactobaeilli. commonly ill conjunction with strepto-cocci. In dental plaque prodomal to caries mid in earious lesions in humans andmonkeys.The greater caiogenieitY of S. ;magus seems to relate to its characteristic ofproducing from sucrose water-insoluble \"dextrans\" adhesiveness of S. mulans to thetooth surface. They adsorb strongly to plain and saliva-eoated powdered hydroxy-apatite and consequently to the tooth surface. Suspensions and glucose-grown(that is. dextrin -free) cells of S. mutous are agglutinated specifically on addi-tion of high-molecular-weight dextrin: accordingly. such cells to dextran-coated Streptococcus sanguis, another ubiquitous dextrin-forminit indigenoof the tooth does not exhibit similar behavior: though its dextral' iswater-insoluble. one must assume that it lac:s cellular receptor sites fm dextrin'.Nevertheless. its dextrin might contribute to plaque acumulation by trappingS.

Long,.continued apposition of suitably acidulated gels.such as agar. gelatin. or cellulose derivatives. to teeth in vitro prodncos lesionsclosely resembling natural early enamel caries. Thus. dextral gel in plaque.acidulated by bacterial fermentation. might help initiate natural caries. A measure which decomposes dextran or impedes its synthesis should mitigatecaries. Accordingly. incorporation of a dextranase preptmilon in the diet anddrinking water. or in the water alone, dramatically reduces both plaque ;lemon-lotion and int ies in hamsters on 11 high-sucrose diet and harboring S. atulanx.Sindiar experiments in rats give less impressive results. particularly in caries ofthe molar tissnres.

Since their antimicrobial spectrum is generally not veryspecific. their use could be expected to hold the oral biota in check overall andthereby entail Is risk of altering its normal balance deleteriously. On the otherhand, ot the higher concentrations that could be used topieally, the specificity ofmany antibiotics broadens, so that they inhibit both graupositlye and gran -negative bacteria. for example.Much evidence indicates that a partial or selective reduction of plaque-form-ing oral bacteria would go far to reduce caries.

Simi; F.A.C.D.*RELATION OF CARBOHYDRATES TO DISEASEThere is evidence that sugar and sugar- containing food contribute to severaldiseases, obesity, dental caries, diabetes mellitus and cardio-vasenlar disease.Yadkin (1957) has pointed out that there is a better correlation between con-sumption of sugar and myocardial infarction than with the consumption of totalfat or of any particular sort of fat. Some of these diseases are discussed in detailelsewhere in this text.Certain problems associated with the carbohydrates are due to metabolic ab-normalities, as In the case of diabetes mellitus. This syndrome is characterizedby the failure of the liver and muscle to utilize_glucose properly. Tlii8 may result?roe either the lack of insulin or the inactivatihn of available _insulin. The resultof this abnormal condition is an increase in lipid and amino acid ntilizaton to cor-rect for the energy deficiency. In consequence. there is an accumulation of acetylCol which, in turn, recombines to form acetoacetic acid. This latter compoundcan then either be reduced to beta hydroxy butyric acid or oxidized to acetone.These three compounds are known as the ketone bodies. Accumulation of ketonebodies can lead to a wide variety of deleterious events which can ultimately resultin death.Diet plays an important role in' the control of diabetes. Design of diets forsuch patients must take into account time interrelationships of the nutrients aswell as the specific needs of the patient.A number of other abnormalities are associated with the carbohydrates. glycogen storage disease (von Gierke's disease). fructosuria, galactosemiaand pentosuria. In each ease, as in diabete. diet plays an important role incontrolling the disease and maintaining the patient in a reasonably normalphysiological state.CARBOHYDRATES TN THE DIETThe multipoint interrelationships of the nutrients give to the living organismsa flexibility which allows it to adapt to a wide variety of environmental condi-tions. It is evident, however that a living system requires carbohydrate. par-mienlarly glucose, in one form or another. The amount of carbohydrate thatshould be included in the diet is questionable. As indicated earlier, people sur-vive in an adequate manner on diets containing as much as 90 per cent carbo-hydrate. On the other hand. the Eskimo-diet contains only about 20 per cent.The proper amount probably lies somewhere in between.The pattern and trend of carbohydrate consumption are influenced by the easeand cheapness of production of foodstuffs that are rich in carbohydrates and thegeneral affluence of the society. Actually, one finds that with an increase in in-come there is a moderate increase in the consumption of calories and protein,considerable increase in the consumption of fat and little change in total carbo-*Ascistant Clinical Professor of Perlodontolocy (Nutrition).

However, with a higher income there is a corresponding increasein consumption of refined sugar. In the wealthiest eountries sugar contributesnearly 20 per cent of the total calories consumed. Compared to other loud com-modities, the worn a production of sugar is increasing most rapidly. The averageconsumption of sugar has increased nearly threefold since the beginning of thecentury. _There is no evidence that one particular source of carbohydrate is better thrillanother. Glucose derived from starch in potatoes or from lactose in milk orfrom fructose in honey is Millie() in exactly the same way as glucose producedby the chemist. Insofar as the diet is concerned, the amount of carbohydratesincluded in the diet is the important fact.It has been stated that the ability of man to create civilization is the result ofhis ability to cultivate and store food, If this be true,-then his ability to utilizea variety of sources of carbohydrate has contributed to this itaccess.THE ORAL RELEVANCE OF the organic matter of bovine andhuman tooth mantel (Burgess a Rt.. 19(10). Stack (1974) has found that It)times as much carbohydrate is fomul in the outermost layer-of-miaw! as inthe inner. Furthermore. in pooled \"chalky'' enamel, which has 3 to 4 times aslunch organic matter ns normal enamel, he has recovered 12 tittles as much car-bohydrate as in normal enamel.In sound dentin Armstrong f1960) found 0.4 per cent \"glacose\" liv'ts of un-refined carbohydrate material and 10 times this amount in carim.s dentin.Furthermore. the fractions of carious dentin resistant to ollatteuase action orautoclaving contain 30 times as lunch carbohydrate inateria/ as sound dentin.This same investigator further Itylattilesiged that the renetion of the with carbohydrates :hiringthe earions process (Armstrong. 19(4).DEXTAL CAinr-sThe development of the correlation between carbohydrates: and den-tal caries is detailed in Chapter Twenty-six: but there are a few additional his-I.:tic:II notes which are informative and interesting and therefore worthy ofbeing included here.The Arab physicians of the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. gave an importantplace to sugar in their pharmacopeia, which may have accounted for the in-creased cultivation of sugar cane. Since sugar had to be imported from Italiaand Arabia. it was a rare and expensive commodity and considered a luxury.When new trade routes were opehed in the fifteenth century by the Portuguese.the price of sugar was lowered and its use for preservation of food became morewidespread. The effect of this increased usage of sugar was reflected in English-men's bad teeth which \"were fairly common at that time among those who couldafford to indulge a taste for sweetmeats.\" In particular, Paul Hentzner observedQueen Elizabeth's black teeth\"n defect the English seem subject theirtoo great use of sugar.\" (Anonymous .[Pertinax] 1964).aficrobiologicat Experiments.From a scientific standpoint. perhaps. the clas-sic test tube experiments of W. D. Miller in the last decade of the nineteenthcentury (1890) can be pointed to as the first of the ongoing investigations theselast 75 years on the mechanism of dental caries production. He established thata ea rbohydrnte substrate was necessary for oral bacterial net ion. and that anaero-bic glycolysis by microorganisms provided the acids which deealeify the mineral`portions of teeth.Fosdick and Burrill (1943) pointed out that the only available substrates fromwhich ncids can ate formed in the month are carbollvdrates, particularly siteraseand glucose. Furthermore. rnpid ncid formation giving a Of as !m as .5 hasbeen shown to occur when slignrs tire placed on bacterial plaques which adhereto human teeth (Steplinn nnd Miller. 1043).The evidence that pure sucrose is a strong decnIcifying agent was brought outby Jenkins et al. (1959) when they incubated cnIcium phosphate as well ns wholeteeth with saliva nnd sucrose. They found thnt far more enleinin phosphate was dissolved when pure sucrose was present than the treacle or cane sugar, partlybeea use the last two substances are heavily buffered.aniputlExperiments.The mandatory presence of carbohydrates in the diet(Shaw. 1954) and its local contact with the tooth (Kite et al., 1950) are nowproved. In Shaw's experiment it was demonstrated that not only did rats haveto be fed some carbohydrate in the diet (more than 5 percent) to develop decay.but even sialmiectomized rodents that usually develop extreme caries when fedaeariogenie diet were caries- resistant when carbohydrates were omitted fromtheir diets. In the experiment of Kite and his associates, caries did not wearin even 1 or 13 caries-suseeptilde animals fed a high-sugar diet by stomach tube:whereas all their littermatm which were fed the same type of eariogenie dietby the usual oral route, developed Some caries.The chemistry of the carbohydrate. mono-, di- or polysaccharide. is also auessent/al consideration with resneet to the degree of Its cariogenic action. Forexample. sucrose or glucose supidements are very butstarches and dextrins are not (Sehweigert,et al.. 1945: Shafer, 1949) The rea-son that starch may not be very cariogenie is that the large starch moleculedoes not penetrate and diffuse through the dental plaque so readily as the smallerdi- and mormsaccharides. Starch is more likely to remain on the outer surfaceof the plaque where It can be washed away and eliminated. On the other hand.the sucrose that has diffused through the plaque will degrade to acid beneaththe plaque and react with the tooth surface. In_rats fed a :algae supplement.caries was a consistent finding (Koenig and Grenby. 19(x5). hot when wheatstarch. white or whole kernel flour, and white flour replaced by brown or fineWats were fed as dietary supplements instead of sugar, caries was practieallynegligible.Another important observation that has been made in experimental animalswith regard to dietary carbohydrate and dental caries is that the cariogenieeffeil of suerase is accentuated when its feeding is initiated during early toothfonnation. development and calcification (Sognnaes, 194S; Volker. that sucrose is replacing a pro-tective mineralizing factor present in trace amounts, uts, perhaps. in natural fods which are more benetitlal to the tooth during its maturation. A sit:milk-ant im-balance in the phosphate: (=inmate ratio created by decreased phosphate andincreased carbonate, MIS found in the enamel of molars of weanling rats thatreceived sugar solutions intraperitoneally during the later part of the sucklingperiod (Lumen. 1961). This havered phosphate: carbonate ratio has with inprased caries (Sobel et al.. 1960).The level of sucrose and glactse in the diet has also been found to be a signitl-eaut eonsideration in the amount of caries produeed. For example. Mitchell et al.(1951) fauna that animals fed a ration with 45 per eent sucrose lucid more cariesthan thase fed rations. with only 15 or 30 per cent. Likewise, Keyes and Likens(1946) flaunt that animals fed sucrose at 40 and 60 per tent !peels showedmore caries than those fed suet'oat a 20 per cent level. The physical form of the earbohydrate is another variable which influencesthe extent of caries production. Sugar in solid form has been shown to be molecarlogenic than liquid sucrose. Of 13 rats that were fed granulated sugar. Indy2 remained varies free. However, 7 of 13 littennate rats were witl t a singleearians lesion Otomreationx.--When a primitive. native-type food intake pattern isreplayed by a civilized sophisticated one. dental caries will increase. This hasbeen shown with the Bantus (Oranje et al.:1935) and Eskimos (Waugh. 1930)and more reently with the natives of Tristan da Cunha (Holloway et al.. 1993).The diet of the Tristan da Cunha islander in 1933 consisted mainly of two sta-ples, potatoes and fish. The average potato consumption per person was about4 times higher. and the average fish consumption was about 3 times greaterthan that of the English. The natives also ate young sea birds, red crowberries.apples and pumpkins. and sparingly of beef. mutton. milk and eggs. In the lasttieeade. this dietary pattern has changed radically because imported foodstuffslike flour. sugar. condensed milk,jam, dried and canned fruit, canned fish andswm:s were made available. They now (tonsillar an average of 1 pound of sugarper week per person as compared to 1938 when they had no sugar. The changein dietary pattern has been areompanied by a simultaneous change in dental2 ft, 363health. In 1938 Sog,unaes found not a single carious first permanent molar evenon radiographic examination in any of the young people under 20 years of age.On the other hand, in 1962 when Holloway et al. made dental examinations ina vomparable age group, they found that 50 per cent of the teeth were carious.In still another large scale general population study the influence of cariesproneness of the kinds of foodstuffs eaten prior to tooth ernption has been noted.The incidence of postwar dental caries and the consumption of sugar during thewar showed a high degree of correlation (Sognnaes, 1948 ; Toverud. 1949). Molars of Scandinavian children were made caries resistant during the war periodwhen less refined foods were available. Three to 5-years later when the teeth wereexposed to a more eariogenic diet. the innate resistance was sufficient to ward offthe local attacking forces of increased sweets. Likewise. the incidence of decayin tirst permanent molars was found lowest in German children-who 5 years previ-ously had been on a low Sugar ration.In addition. there have been clinical trials in orphanages. homes. etc.. that haveadded more evidenee of the inverse correlation between sugar and caries. ''omeof these sti :dies have been explained on a developmental or systemic basis : othershave given more credit-to the local environmental mechanism. 'The answer Kohn-1.1:: lies somewhere between both these philosophies or explanations. For example.in the majority of children ill with diabetes mellitus who ate more liberalamounts of milk, eggs. meat. vegetables and fruit than most children. there %vaslittle or no extension of varies for years (Boyd. 1943). The small number whofailed to observe their dietary regime experienved a lunch higher rate of cares.The children who were put on this low sugar diet early :tad less caries than thosewho started the diet later. Similarly. Howe et al. (1942) showed that childrenwho followed dietary instructions and ate :1 diet of high nutritional totality withsimaltneeous lowering of carbohydrate content hail significantly less tooth dewythan comparable ehildren who were not so counseled. On the other hand. Koehneand Bunting 09341 added large amounts of ea rbohytliates in the form of sugarnrvandyto the diets of children and found an inerease in caries. This emphasizeda local ext Husk faetor as the predominating mechanism.Not 01,!y has clink-al varies research established and eonfirtned the animaltindlitifli respect to the hypothesis that carbohydrates are eszent MI for variesproductimi. but there is some very good evidenc in humans that the type of ea -bohydrate. starch versns sugar. as %veil as the physival form and frequney ofusage are each important variables in the magnitude of caries expienv to beexpected.

These patients have nearly ea ries-free months in spite of the largeamounts of starehy foods that they (nit (Froeseh et al.. 1963).weleontrolled Vipeholm study is probably the Massie illustration of theimportance of the effect of form and frequency of carbohydrate ingest i nn on eariv:development in humans (Gustafson et al.. 1954). A tong-ter. -i-year. nutritionalstudy was carried out on 436 mental patients with a mean age of 32 who wereconfined. practically pormanently. in an institution in Vipehtolm, Sweden. Dietswere carefully supervised as to preparation, and nurses were able to insure eft-tweration of the patients in following the experimental prescriptions.The first year constituted an adjestment period in wide!' a base line caries in-dex was estol'i.-:ted and the patients eonsumed a diet rich in vitamins and otherprotectile.s fonr times a day with no candy or chocolate. The next fouryears consjsten of the carbohydrate study period in whih ten groups were fedthe same basal diet. but they differed from each other in that some groupsbad increased amounts of sugar at mealtime and ethers had increased amountsof sugar Ufa. en meals. There were four main groups:1. Ita,a1 diet2. Ilbsal diet and additional sugar in solution at mealsdiet and additional sugar in bread consumed at meals4. Basal diet and additional sugar in the form of sweets eonsomed betweenmeals.Those who were on the basal diet (the control group throughout the study)had a low caries activity. In those groups who had as mmit as 300 grams ofsucrose added to the meal in liquid form as a beverage or in food preparation. the 364caries activity was only slightly increased. This is about twice the mean sugarconsumption of most Western countries. It is interesting to note that the sameMight caries activity increase was noted in the group who were given bread atMeals. which contained only 50 grams of refined sugar.In alt groups other than those on the basal diet, there was a very significantincrease in dental caries. Even if there was a small amount of additional sugaradded, such as those who ate candy between meals, there was a marked increasein caries activity, indicating that quantity of sugar was not the all important fac-tor to account for this result. Furthermore, when the sweets were withdrawnfrom between-meal periods, the caries activity decreased to the level of theinitial preparatory period.The important conclusion from this experiment is that if sugar with onlya slight tendency to be retained, such as sucrose solution, was ingested at mealsor if sugar-rich bread which has a strong tendency to be retained was consumedat weals, the risk of increasing caries activity Was least. HOweter, when sugarwith a strong tendency to be retained in the month Was eaten between. meals fre-quently. the risk of increasing caries activity was greatest.Lundqvist measnred the time sugar could be detected in the saliva of theparticipants of the Vipeholm study. In '.'igure 4=6 it can be seen that in thosegroups who ingested sugar at meals, regardless of whether it was the controlgroup, or the sucrose group, or the bread group. only four peaks of sugar in thegoliva were noted, corresponding to the four meals. Of special interest is thatthe.siterose groups. who ate twice as much sugar (but at meals) as the controlgroup. had an identical salivary glucose level.In short. dental caries activity increased in connection with consumption ofsugar in sticky form between meals, but it decreased when the consumptionwas interrupted. Furthermore, when sugar was consumed. in solution at meals,in amounts twice the Swedish average consumption, no increase in dental carieswas observed.The results of Gustafsson's and Lundqvist's studies prove severAl points : (1)sugar exerts its caries-promoting effect locally in the mouth. (2) starchy foodslike bread are not so cariogenie as the disaccharide sucrose, (3) the amount ofsugar is not of paramonnt importance, (4) the form and composition of the sweetsiscritical (retentive worse than nonretentive). and (5) 'the frequency of usageis a prime factor in caries activity. These conclusions. particularly about theimportance of at meal or between meal timing of sugar intake. are confirmedby the result of Mack (1949). King et al. (1955), Jay (1947) and Potgieter et al.0950. The first two investigators reported that when extra sugar was eatenat meals no increase in caries was noted. In the last two studies sugar was givenbetween meals and caries increased.In summary, all these in vitro animal and human data certainly point to theadverse MINI of carbohydrates particularly sucrose. on dental earies. But it isrecognized that food habits and ingrained cultural practices are diffieult tochange. particularly when dealing with a disease like dental caries, which is nota matter of life or th'ath. Although some of our attention is being directed tounderstanding the psychologieal and social aspects that influence a patient'sdietary pattern. our Mimi management will be concerned in the future withsubstituting for carbohydrate. foods with less cariogenic potential than sucrose.PERIODOSTIUMThere is some preliminary evidence that earbohydrate foods, particularly those .- that are readily retained and easily fermented. play an important role in theetiology of periodontal disease. The incidence of the periodontal syndrome wasmarkedly increased in rice rats (wide]) are constitutionally prom, to this disease)when fed highly eariogenic diets containing 07 per rent sucrose. Those atiinntlsfed a carbohydrate-free ration experienced maior rechtetion in periodontal soft tissue lesions and moderate reduction in bone loss. Furthermore. animals thatwere fed a diet with reduced dietary carbohydrate and increased lard contentshowed a somewhat lower redaction of periodontal lesions when compared tothose fed hid) sarros4 diets. it is possible that the periodontal syndrome pro-dared by the dietary re,-ime- may be really a reflection of bacterial activity andthe availability of \u00b0Milani nutrition for the growth of these mieroorganistns(Anshan.: et al.. 1071. Another bit of indirect evidence that high carbohydrate diets adversely affectgingival health and even wound healing can be found in the animal studies onprotein-free (Stahl, 1962) and low-protein (Stahl, 1963) diets. Actually, theseanimals were fed diets with 70 to 75 per cent starch content and, in both instances,showed delay in connective tissue and bone repair after being wounded. Further-more, there is the finding of Frandsen et al. (1953), that rats fed on diets con-taining 110 protein and S6 per ceut sucrose showed severe osteoporosis and in-creased rate of bone resorption. Stahl's findings and those of Frandsen and hisassoc;ates might be interpreted as the result of a dual dietary aberration,namely, a protein deficiency compounded by an excess carbohydrate diet. The moreimportant of these two dietary variables in the etiology of the disease was notdemonstrated.Human DataA deterioration in the periodontal health of Tristan da Cunhaislanders from 1938 to 1962 was noted by Holloway et al. (1963). The diet ofthose islanders had changed from no ingestion of sugar in 1938 to 1 pound perperson per week in 1962. Sognnaes reported in 1938 only 10 per cent of adultpopulation showed advance periodontal disease with bone loss and gingivalrecession. In 1962 the percentage of the population afflicted with this disease hadrisen to 32 per cent.The possibility that carbohydrate metabolic patterns might be related to theintegrity of the periodontium 'was investigated recently (Shannon and Gibson,1964). Since the subject;: of this research were healthy males with relativelymild periodontal disease, the object of the study was to use the oral glucosetolerance test as an index of susceptibility rather than a chemical finding corre-lated with the presence of advanced disease. They found no correlation betweenthe oral glucose tolerance test and periodontal health.In conclusion. our knowledge on the relation of carbohydrates to periodontaldisease is still sparse, but the initial experimental results do seem to hold someplomise for developing a tenable hypothesis that this nutrient has periodontaldisease-producing potential.cg.REFERENCESGENERALPigman.

Almost leo percentof the population of the United States is afflicted with it in some degree. Despiteresearch conducted over many years cm animals and num. the cause or causes ofdental decay have not been defined precisely. Nutrition is a basic factor in respect to earies control and to the solution of the dental health problem.Dental decay results when oral bacteria act on teeth that are susceptible todecay. Certain microorganisms are prevalent in tooth surface areas protectedfrom usual cleansing procedures. Carbohydrates. especially t1 isle sugar. ;iceman-lated on the teeth and acted upon by the organisms, readily ferment, and the acidgenerated by this action penetrates the tooth enamel, thus causing, tooth decay.Dental decay in Slisceptilde teeth occurs in direct proportion to the quantity of for----mentabit. carbohydrate in the diet, but frequency of intake and eonsisteney(form) of the food are especially important in the decay process. Carbohydratesthat are sticky and adhere to the teeth are more destructive than those in liquidform. If they are eaten at very short intervals the decay process can he practicallycant hams.A won-balanced. nutritionally adequate, satisfying diet is important for goodnutrition under all circumstances. However. in caries Niteroi it svI'VeA a specialpurpose. Such a diet would inelnde adequate amounts of protein. calcium. andphosphate, plus moderate amounts of sugar. and its satisfying quality Would tendto discourage excessive nibbling. A careful controlled study with children hasshown that, as their diets became more nearly adequate, there %vas :1 tendencyfor the children to adjust voluntarily to lower sugar intake.Dental caries is more prevalent in certain geographic areas than in others,regardless of the economic status of the people or the adeqm.ey of their diet.Efforts to solve this puzzle eventually led investigators to the mineral elementfluoride as the critical factor. Flooride is now regarded as a specific nutrient ofproven value in producing decay-resistant teeth. Research has shown that de- sirable amount of fluoride (one part per million. optimal), occurring natur::1 lyin a community water supply or a %vntor supply adjusted properly in fluoridecontent, can provide a substantial degree of immunity to tooth decay.0(368) 4 013(558NUTRITION EDUCATION-1973 FART 4-TV ADVERTISING OF FOOD TO CHILDRENWASHINGTON, D.C., MARCH 0, 1973 Series 73/NE40 Printed for the use of the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE91469 0 WASHINGTON :1973 For sale bytheSuperintendent of DocumentsU.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402Price 60 cents domestic postpaid or 35 cents GPO liookstoreStock Number SELECT COMMITTEE ON NUTRITION AND HUMAN NEEDSGEORGE McGOVERN, South Dakota, Cita ImamHERMAN E.

We are here today representingmany people who are missing from these hearings, people who havetried to make their voices heard at the FCC and in Congress, who havetried to express their concerns about what television is doing to theirown children, and who have urged action in this small and specificarea. These people are the viewers, the public, the teachers in the class-room, who write to us for information on how to help young childrenhandle the commercial barrage on children's programs, the pedia-tricians and other physicians dealing with children, who ask us whatthey can do to stop TV selling to children. And are here today to speak for the thousands of parents who ask how often they should beexpected to have to say \"no\" to the repeated demands for over-sugared foals advertised to children on TV.(369) 370We cannot bring the 100,000 individuals and groups who wrote to the FCC on ACT's petition to these hearings to tell you personally what they feel. We cannot bring the millions of individuals who make up the major-national organizations who support our position on the unfortunate consequences of TV selling directed to childrenorgani- zations, including the-American Academy of Peliatries, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the American Association of University Women, the National Health Association, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children.Action for Children's Television has already initiated some petitions and rulemaking designed to ptOtect children from exploitation by TV commercials.In January 1970, ACT petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to eliminate commercials from children's television pro- grams and to stop hoSt-selling. This petition formed the basis for a proposed rulemaking and inquiry upon which no action has yet been taken.In November 1971, ACT petitioned the Federal Trade Commissionfor a Trade _Regulation Rule to eliminate the vitamin pill advertising on children's TV programs. In April 1972, ACT also submitted to theFTC complaints against Miles Laboratories, Hoffman-LaRoche, and Bristol-Myers for their vitamin pill ads on children's TV. Although no action has yet been taken by the FTC, as of October 1972, all three companies had withdrawn their pill ads from children's TV programs. ACT feels regulatory action is essential to keep these ads off the air. In December 1971, ACT petitioned the FTC to eliminate TV toy ads directed to children; no action has yet been taken.And in April 1972, ACT petitioned the FTC for a Trade Regulation Rule to eliminate food advertising on children's television programs on the grounds that all food advertising directed to children is misleading and unfair. To date, no action has been taken on this food petition. ACT accepted the invitation of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to testify here, today, because ACTwants you to know that the parents of America are extremely con- cerned and that they-feel helpless.A child watching CBS-TV, channel 7, in Boston, between 7 a.ni. and 2 p.m: on Saturday, October 28, 1972, would have seen 67 com- mercial messages urging him to eat or drink sweetly flavored products. Nearly 10 times each hour the child would have been reminded that the presence of sugar in the mouth is a sweetly gratifying experience.ACT FILING COMPLAINTS WITH FTCACT would like to take this opportunity to announce that we are filing with the Federal Trade Commission today eight complaintsthefirsta series against.major companiesthat advertise on children'stelevision, .against the CBS telev' ion network, and WNAC-TVBostor, for unfair and misleading to17ertising to children.The complaints cite: Kellogg's for Pop Tarts and Danish-Go- Rounds snack foods and Froot Loops cereal commercials; General Mills for Baron Von Redberry and Sir Grapefellow cereals and com- mercials; General Foods Post Division for Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Pebbles cereals commercials; Quaker Oats Co. for Vanilly Crunch cereal commercial; Hershey for instant milk additive commercial; 371Curtis Mar ifacturing Co. for Baby Ruth commercial; and MarsManufacturing Co. for Milky Way candy commercial.Accompanying these complaints is a 23-page additional filing toACT's original petition to theFTC to eliminate edibles advertisingdirected to childrenon which no action has yet been taken.Many of you on this committee are clearly cognizant of the harmfuleffects of the sugar-rich diet which prevails in our country. There canbe no doubt that this diet is a habitual form of behavior, that it islearned during childhood, and that it is unlearned only with extremedifficulty.The role of television ad ...ertising in establishing this habitual dietduring childhood is:a major one. The amount of time children spendwatching these commercials for sugared products, the frequency withwhich they appear, and the amount of money spent by the manu-facturers, to air their commercials are impressive statistics. Takentogether, they are a strong indication of the relationship betweenadvertising and eating habits. We would be foolish to wait for thestudies to tell us that there is a relation between advertising and eatinghabits. We would be foolish to wait for the studies to tell us that thereis a relation between what children watch and what they do; we canbe as sure that this relationship exists as are the advertisers whodepend on it to sell their client's products.A few years ago, before consumerism was in bloom, company exec-utives were more willing to talk frankly about the purpose of theirads and him they felt about aiming the ads at the \"child market.\"There is no real formula for good ads. Our primary goal is to sell products tochildren, not educate them'When you sell a woman on a product. and she goes into the store and finds yourbrand isn't In stock, she will probably forget about it. But when you sell a kid onyour product, if he can't get it, he will throw himself on the floor, stamp his feetand cry. You can't get a reaction like that out of an adult.'Despite the well-documented problems caused by overconsumptionof sugar, the food industry keeps on marketing new sweet snacks andcereals as if it had never heard the messages coming from doctors,dentists, and the White House Conference:Candies, confections and beverages containing sucrose should not be ingestedby children between meals. Food manufacturers should limit sucrose in foodsprimarily intended for consumption by children. Education of the consumer onthis point is essential?FOUR MOST CARIOGENIC GROUPSIn spite of this admonition, the list of products sold to children overtelevision is dominated by the four most cariogenic groups of foods:Caramel, chocolate, cookies, and pastry.On the morning of October 28, 1972, children were urged to eatcandy bars such as Milky Way, Baby Ruth, Kit-Kat, Hershey Bar,Junior Mints, Butterfingers, Mr. Goodbar, and M & Ms; and snackfoods such as Kellogg's Danish-Go-Rounds.

Even if the sucrose is in liquidform and washes away immediately, the acid will persist for up to 20minutes until natural buffering agents in the saliva neutralize it.If, however, the sugar is eaten in a form that makes it adhere to thetooth surfaces, the acid production will continue so long as the sugar is in contact with the tooth. The stickiness of, the particular food hasbeen shown by studies to be the major determinant of its cariogenicity.Dr. Abraham Nizel reported on a study of several hundred 5-year-olds which found that :The children experienced a caries increase which had a linear relation to thenumber of between-meal snacks tliey ate. Specifically, those who ate one snackhad a caries score of 4.8: two snacks, 5.7; three snacks, 8.5: and four or moresnacks, 9.8. It appears that the most important difference between cariogenicand noncariogenic agents is not the amount of sugar ingested but the frequency nJintake.'The importance of this study lies in the fact that it points an accusing finger at one particular group of sugared foodssnacks.And by now we are not surprised to find that this group dominatesthe list of products advertised to children.The study tells us that a child who eats small quantities of sugaron several occasions throughout the day is much more likely todevelop caries than a child who eats one sugar-rich meal. However,these advertisers are simply concentrating on products which, for themost part, are between-meal treats. They are, in addition, deliveringtheir message at regular intervals throughout the between-mealtimes of day. On Saturdays, most of these ads come on between9 a.m. and noon. On weekdays, they appear between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.In view of the findings concerning frequency of intake, the re- petitive between-meal advertising of snack foods must itself beregarded as a contributing factor to the dental cari.ts problem. And,us previously stated, with the example of October 1972, we findsnack foods well-represented in 'be list of TV commercials deliveredto children.DENTAL CARIES- A Ii EALTH PROBLEMAccording to the bureau of community dental programs of thedepartment of health and hospitals in the city of Boston, dentalcaries is the most pervasive health problem among children in thiscountry; 98 percent of the Nation's children suffer from tooth decay.Recently, the bureau conducted a survey of 1,000 children inBoston public schools and found that. 90 percent of them were inneed of dental care for caries. In another study, the bureau foundthat among children up through the age of 19 in the metropolitanarea of Boston, there are approximately 4,000 new cavities everyday.There is ample nutritional evidence to prove that sugared snackfoods offer very little in the way of body growth and maintenance andthat they even have a negative effect of robbing the appetite for morenourishing foods.br. Abraham .4irel, Nutrition in Prerentlre Dentistry: Science endPracate.1972. p.47. 373As Dr. Jean Mayer, Professor of Nutrition at Harvard University'sSchool of Public Health, has stated:The best advice I can give about sugar in any form is: Eat less .6Doctors, dentists, and nutritionists deplore the habit which Amer-ican children have of snacking on sweet, nonnutritional foods betweenmeals. Yet that habit is encouraged and reinforced daily on children'stele vision.In his book, \"Nutrition,\" George H. Beaton says:Probably the two most common defects in children's eating habits in NorthAmerica are the oergenerous uses of very sweet foods in meals and the frequentsnacking between meals with foods high in sugar. It is well known that sweet snacksAhortly before a meal depress the appetite markedly . ..It seems a pity that the so-called \"quick energy\" of sugar is exploited so vigorously. Some mothersare under the misapprehension that their-children need sweets for this reason. Asa matter of fact, any food will provide quick-enough energy and sugar is ourpoorest food, bar none.6Mothers are encouraged not to fall into the \"quick energy\" trapbut to provide their children with wholesome snacks. In other words,parents must act in direct opposition to the volume of ads their childrenwatch on television.-At a time when the body is growing at a more rapid rate and body structuresare developing, the need for quality food is crucial. There is no room in the dietfor \"empty calorie\" foodsthose represented by most sugar-coated and snackfoods. At this time children need balanced diets providing the nutrients neededfor growth?Many parents who are at least partially aware of the harmfuleffects of sugar, prohibit the intensive use of sweets by their children.However, the television ads come fast, and furious, coaxing childrento try Mars bars, M & Ms, and sweetened cereal as between-mealsnacks. Were children to eat as much candy and sweetened snacksas the television suggests, they would never have the appetite foranything else.Adults whom the children respectfather figures, famous athletes,competent older childrenare hourly heard encouraging children toeat candy bars, drink soft drinks, and make friends by sharing sn.cks.The familiar cartoon characters, the friendly announcer, the superstarsall entice children to try the latest gooey, munchy, crunchy, sweetsnack.Cerealone of the hallowed \"basics\"a food children are taughtto eat as part of a balanced diet, has become saturated with sugarand is advertised, in many cases, only on its questionable merit ofbeing \"supersweet.\" Dr. Jean Mayer warns that many of the chil-dren's sweetened cereals are 50-percent sugaras much as somecandy bars.CONFLICT BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDRENFood advertising directed to children sets up a conflict betweenthe parent and the child and, in fact, between the child and anynumber of authority figuresdoctors, dentists, and teachers, as wellas parents.$ Dr. Jean Mayer. article in The Boston (Pobe.

Chairman of the Child Development and Family Relations Section of American HomeEconorni. s Association in a letter to ACT.Feb. 23.1772.9! 869 0-73-2c .. 374In a study of television viewing by children conducted for the Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on TV and Social Behavior, it was found that food products advertised on television are more frequently requested by the child than other products.8 Becauseof these frequent requests, parents are forced into a position of not only refusing the child and entering into a conflict because of it, but they also need to contradict the authority of another adult who is telling the child that it is good to buy \"Pink Panther Flakes.\"A pilot study on \"Mothers' Attitudes Toward Children's TelevisionPrograms and Commercials,\" carried out by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., found that: \"In all income strata, the constant duel of children asking for things and mothers having to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" creates, mothers feel, an unhealthy environment and relationship.9As the President of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry,Dr. Sibley Berman, put it:The American Academy of Child Psychiatry, as an organization primarily devoted to the mental health needs of all children, is deeply concerned with the exploitation of children by many advertisers of the television media. Many ofthese advertisements are directed to the attention of children in order to bring pressure to bear upon the parents to purchase these productsprimarily focditems of questionable nutritional value and toys which add nothing to the child'sphysical and mental development ... Furthermore, the advertisements en courage confrontation and alienation on the part of children toward their parentsand undermine the parent's child-rearing responsibilities.Parents can react to this subversion in several ways. A few stick to'heir guns, taking a hard line nutritionally. They are few and far between. Many battle it-out with the child, giving in to an unwhole- some cereal here, a candy bar there. They shout and lose their temperswhile the children whine, beg, coax, wheedle, and often bity theharmful sweets against their parents' wishes and consume them secretly.The majority of parents, however, are badly informed as to the harmful effects of excessive sweets. They are as gullible about the advertising as the children are and make little or no effort to regulatethe child's sugar intake. Because more soft drinks, candy, and snackfoods are advertised than other types of food, their children eat more soft drinks, candy, and snack foods. The older these children get,the more purchasing autonomy they are awarded and the more harmful snack foods they buy.A medium which could be a powerful educational tool to inform theAmerican public of good health and nutrition is instead a vehicle forfalsehood, misinformation, and misleading persuasion.We have argued that the continual reinforcement of a taste forsweets in children through TV advertising presents several dangersto the health of children; the most significant are dental caries,exclusion of more nutritious foods from the diet, obesity, and otherhealth problems that arise in adulthood as a result of a taste forsweets acquired during childhood.These dangers can be minimized through the vigilance of parentswho possess the knowledge, time, and energy to protect children frombad habits. This vigilance requires a parent to supervise regulartooth brushing, to provide the child with a properly nutritious dailydiet, and to limit the amount of sweets that the child may eat.2 E. A. Rubinstein and George Comstock, Television and Social Behavior, ot. IV. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972, p. 518.Daniel Yankelovich, \"Mothers' Attitudes Toward Children's Television Programs and Commercials,\"March, 1970. 375NUTRITIONAL EDUCATION FOR LOW-INCOME GROUPSThere are, however, many families in which the social, educational,and economic disadvantage make it impossible for parents to assumeproper responsibility for protecting their children from bad food habits. Their parents' lack of knowledge, lack of time, and lack ofincome all conspire to make children in these families particularlyvulnerable to the ill-effects of TV-advertised sweetness.Nutritional ignorance, including ignorance of the relation betweentooth decay and sweets, is found most widely in low-income families,where parents generally have had far less education than membersof higher-income groups. Low-income parents are thereforelessaware of the relationship between diet and health. Their need is for information which educates them to provide themselves and theirchildren with a nutritionally sound diet.Nutritional education is now recognized as a need of the highestpriority for low-income groups. Government agencies at all levelsare trying to fill this need with programs designed to raise awarenessof the nutritional value of different foods and to promote sensitivityto the dangers of dietary inadequacies.The advertisements of sugared food products regularly viewed bychildren result in a reinforcement of poor nutritional habits and in thisway represent a concerted effort to undermine the Government's educational effort. Overconsumption of sugar is, for several reasons,one of the principle dangers of which the educational programs seek tomake people aware. Dental caries, obesity, protein and vitamin defi-ciency, as well as increased susceptibility to heart disease are all likelyconsequences of a sugar-rich diet. And, yet, the most powerful andpervasive information source in the lives of low-income childrenthe television set s systematically developing in them a taste for sugar-rich foods.The Office of Child Development, HEW, recently announced agrant to supply a special series of M minute segments on subjectssuch as health, nutrition, exercise, and emotions, to be aired exclu-sively on CBS-TV's \"Captain Kangaroo.\" One wonders how much in-fluence the segments dealing with nutrition will have when they mustcompete with the \"eat-this\" message in ads for: Kellogg's Toasties,Rice Krispies, Sugar Smacks, Raisin Bran, Corn Flakes, Froot Loops,Sugar Pops, and for Pop Tarts, Hershey Instant Chocolate, SugarFrosted Flakes, and Hershey chocolate bars, all of which were \"CaptainKangaroo\" ads the week of April 5-9, 1971.THE VULNERABILITY OF CHILDRENWhere children are concerned, counter ads or public service spots oreducational program segments which provide correct nutritional in-formation do not necessarily offset the damage done by misleadingfood ads.The law has traditionally recognized that children require specialprotection:Children are not allowed to buy alcohol or cigarettes;Children may not enter into contracts without the assistance ofan adult guardian;Children are not allowed to drive a vehicle until the age of 16;0 eis 376To vote until the age of 18; orTo own a credit card until the age of 21.Yet, in the world of television, a child is treated amadult from the day he begins watching television. mThere are basic nutritional questions that a consumer should con- sider when evaluating a food purchase. Such information is usually not available from present TV commercials. But even if it were, it would be of no help to the child because he is not yet mature enough to phrase such questions, or even think of asking them. We recognize in real lifethat our children are not sophisticated enough to plan the family'smeals, and yet, on television, we expect them to show the most amazing degree of sophistication in coping with the barrage of demands fromthe most persuasive selling medium of all.Dr. Richard Feinbloom, acting medical director, family health care program, Harvard Medical School, and acting chief, Child and FamilyHealth Division, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Boston, gives a clear summary of children's vulnerability to ads.To children, normally impulsive, advertisements for appealing things demandimmediate gratification. An advertisement to a child has the quality of an ordcr,not a suggestion. The child lacks the ability to set priorities, to determine relativeimportance, and to reject some directives as inappropriate .. . The child responds as much to the setting as to the object advertised, unlike the adult, and is unableto separate the two. Thus, the real toy is very often found by the child to bedisappointing ... The child cannot judge the monetary value of advertisedmerchandise, an intrinsic and crucial part of the adult's evaluation andconsideration.Dr. John Condry, professor of human development and psychology,Cornell University, N.Y., has pointed out that it is unreasonable toexpect children to be able to make reasoned consumer choices.... Children cannot be expected to choose that which is best for them simplybecause they are children, and have yet to develop the maturity of judgmentnecessary to anticipate the consequences of a complex choice.'In practice, television is forever tempting children to make choicesby appealing to their fondness for sweet things and attractive toysand their need to be loved. While adults can in some measure discount the appeals made by persuasive commercials, the child is helplessbefore such appeals because he cannot cope with them.CONCLUSIONIt is ACT's position that television could be an effective tool inpromoting better nutrition for both children and adults. For adults,fuller disclosure of nutritional and other information might assistthem in making sound decisions about their family's food consumption.For children, regulations should insure that they are exposed only tobeneficial nutritional information, should they happen to see ads onadult programs. However, on television programs designed specificallyfor children, there can be no compromise. Children are never the proper targets for an advertising campaign, no matter how muchcorrect counterinformation is available elsewhere.ACT has argued that the advertising of foods directed to childrentakes unfair advantage of children's lack of sophistication and matu-rity; that it increases parent-child tensions; that it produces nutri-tional miseducation, which is difficult to unlearn; that the food habits10 Testimony before the FTC, November 1971, p. 11.r , 377promoted by TV aas aimed at children teach that one eats becauseit is fun, it is sweet, or it is the way to get a toy, rather than thatfood is vital to healtI\\ and well-being.Advertisers and brdadcasters may have a strong economic interestin continued advertising to children, but this exploitation of ourchildren is clearly not in the national interest.Unless there is vigorous action to prevent the continind exploitationand miseducation of the Nation's children via food ads, we can expecta continued growth of heart disease, hypertension, and poor dentalhealththe diseases that result from poor eating habits establishedin childhood, which cripple and kill in adulthood.We are grateful that this committee has chosen to focus publicattention on the vital issue of advertising to children through thesehearings. We are hopeful that your efforts, unlike so many similarhearings in the past, will result in action to provide protection forour youngest and most vulnerable citizens.\"Thank you.FRUSTRATED BY LACK OF INDUSTRY RESPONSE?Senator MCGOVERN. Thank you very much, Mrs. Charren andMrs. Sarson.I think you have given the committee an excellent presentation ona problem that we are interested in.I would like to direct a couple of questions to you.I get two feelings from your testimony; one is the feeling that youare locked in a very grim battle with the advertising industry and thefood industry and the broadcasters, as well as the Federal regulatoryagencies.The other feeling I get is your belief that while justice is on yourside, that somehow or other, you are being terribly frustrated bya lack of response by the industry people.Is that a fair sunmar3r of your position?Mrs. CHARREN. I would say it was excellent.Senator MCGOVERN. How do you account for the fact that on aproblem where health professionals and doctors and dentists andnutritionists are in general agreement, they deplore the habit ofchildren snacking on sweets between meals, that all these people haveso little influence in modifying the television advertising?Mrs. CHARREN. I think it is a question of timing. I think thewhole thing happened very slowly. Ten years ago there were few adsdirected to children on television. It was not understood what a goodsalesman the child made.But now that the advertising profession is aware of how they canuse children, they are using them more and more, and it is only in thelast 2 years that the attention of the country was called to this prob-lem, really.Mrs. SARSON. In a study we had done by Dr. William Melody onthe feasibility of paying for children's television without commercials,he outlined the history of children's television. At the beginning, noone would have dreamed of putting commercials on these programsfor children because they didn't realize that children could be sold to.is See also, appendixes to statement, pp. 411-16. 378TV COMMERCIALS TO CHILDREN BEGAN IN 1952In 1952, Miss Frances, of Ding Dong School, did the first personal commercial during a children's program. That has multiplied to the state we are in now, and as parents become aware of what is happening, the public is becoming informed. As you said, the thing is coming to a crossroads where on the one hand the parents consent to the wishes cf the children; and,on the other hand, it is the entrenched industryin a position to which it has grown to great affluenceand looking at the affluence they have gained and wondering what they can do. Mrs. CHARREN. I think the problem is that it is so effective to adver- tise to children, thatno company is willing to give it up without abattle.The other problem, particularly in food advertising to children is when I speak to manufacturers about why it is that it seems the worst cereals are the cereals soldto children, that the companies makewhat could be considered better cereals that are not covered with sugar, why are most ads on children's television the most highly sugared cereals? The answer is: \"It is product diversity, everybody else is doing it, and so are we. We can sell the other cereals to adults, but we can't sell those to children.\"Senator MCGOVERN. Did I understand from your statement that you are recommending an absolute prohibition against any kind of television advertising on children's shows?MTS. CHARREN. That is correct.Mrs. SARSON. That is been requesting.Senator McGovEnx. No advertising at ail.Mrs. SARSON. We could accept one-line statements. \"Sesame Street\" is aired on 43 stations throughout the United States. \"Sesame Street\" allows at the end ofa program, if a local underwriter under-writes the cost of the program, \"This program was brought to you by Smith's Store.\"That is the type of thing we would accept on children's programing. Mrs:-QuAnnEht. We should point out that we are talking about prod- uct tul vivkising. We do not mean, for example, the kind cf spotsthat Miles has made, whichwe think are very good. That Is educational.Mrs. SARSON. Those are educational. Anything that informs thechild in that way is not pushing a product. Mrs. CHARREN. You have to remember the way business works. The products sold to children are products that are not good for children. Nobody is trying to sell children lettuce or cheese; Campbell's does not want to spend a lot of money on that advertising for children.It is more effective to advertise that to adults.You can't have a rule that you, shall advertise to children. The onlything you can say is that you cannot advertiseSenator MCGOVERN. I wonder how you would finance these pro- grams if no advertising were allowed?EFFECT OF REDUCING TV ADVERTISING TO CHILDRENMrs. SARSON. We would have to give you a copy of the study that points out that unlike cigarette advertisingwhere the ads were taken out overnight, causing a vacuum in the industryif the amount 379of advertising was reduced year by year, over 3 years, there may be acertain amount of pressure. If it was reduced over 10 years, or if youreduce the advertising on children's programs over a 25-year period,you would probably have little effect.Mrs. CHARREN. Even in a 5-year period they co Ild develop waysto absorb costs in other ways. There is money from all kinds of sou rtesgoing into children's programing now.Why is it, for example, that the money from HEW, that went todevelop these nutrition spots are being shown solely on \"CaptainKangaroo\"which is a moneymaking program. It made, accordingto an FCC study, $1 million for CBS. Why isn't that availab le foranybody or any program producer who wants to show it on pu blic orprivate television?There is money going in now to programing for children that is notcoining from commercial sources. We just say that if programing forchildren becomes one of the priorities of this country, there could evenbe less of it, as long as it is better.Senator McGovEux. Senator Cook?Senator COOK. Don't you think that this HEW effort is a pilotstudy at this time and it will be expanded? I get that impression.Mrs. CHARREN. I would hope so, but I couldn't understand reallywhy it wasn't the aim to get those spots on as much television as theycould.Senator COOK. I got the feeling that their aim was to find theeffectiveness of that particular type of ad. They happened to pick aprogram that had almost 23 percent of the viewing market with theassumption that this would be a good test market. I would hope thatit will be expanded.Mrs. CHARREN. I am not complaining about the programing, Ithink it is lovely.Senator COOK. By the way, I would like to put this article thatappeared in Sunday's \"Parade Magazine,\" relative to your orgnoiza-non, in the record, if I could, please.I think what becomes very apparent in the analysis of the studythat was made is that we have a situation where the advertiserreally is in direct conflict with the adult in this field.Mrs. CHARREN. That is correct.PRODUCTS OF ADVERTISING AGENCIESSenator COOK. And it is aimed at kind of an intellectual moron,Baron Von Redberry, and Sir Grapefellow. I wonder if we werestill on radio, whether they could sell these things. The answer wouldprobably be they couldn't sell them. What is interesting to me isthat this particular type of product is not only the product of amanufacturer, but ilso is the product of the advertising agency interms of the product names and packaging. Mr. Choate will testifylater. At a hearing of the Consumer Subcommittee, Mr. Choatepointed out that advertisers pretest children by use of laboratoriesand that they are not taking a chance in the marketplace on theseproducts because they know how the products will be recei.When they start to slow down a little bit, then we parents areplagued by another approach, and that is when you can't sell enough'Set AppencUs, p. 380zippy automobiles you put them in the box and you have to buythe cereal to get what is in the box.The gasoline companies. They are doing a remarkable job withthis technique. They are now selling gasoline to our children, not tome, because you have to go to the station so you can get your twolittle automobiles or something else, and so on.Apparently, we now are seeing the effects of the toy companieswho overproduce and decide the next best way to get rid of them isto sell to children within the normal hours they watch TV.The National Football League does a pretty good job of that, also.So I am inclined to feel that the media didn't do us a very goodfavor when they decided to limit advertising in children's program-ing to 12 minutes out of the hour, when it used to be as high as 18minutes.Regarding the cereals themselves, Dr. Mayer said, yesterday, thatif a cereal is as much as 50-percent sugar, then we should classifyit. as candy. I think that would be a very good idea.TV SELL...GOOD OR BADMrs. SARSON. You touched on a key issue when you talked aboutthe products being designed for marketing, which is what happens.We asked one company, \"Why do you design them this way?\" Wefeel it is important to talk to these peopleand we hive talked tothemwe asked why they design them like this. They said, \"Ourmarketing department tells us they would sell.\"This whole concept of creating food to sell instead of creating foodthat was valuable or worth buying has somehow disappeared. If itwill sell on television, it will be a profitable product, whether itis good or bad.Mrs. CHARREN. There is something else you picked up and whichI think is excellent, that is, if we don't stop it, it will get worse. Theyrealize they can sell anything to children. When you can sell gasolineto children without a car, it is a short step to many other things.There are a series of ads that are appearing for Father's Day. Mostparents would prefer their child to make them something ratherthan to go out and buy something. And these things are expensive,too.Mrs. SARSON. The preschool child watching the \"Romper Room\"program could get a free cardboard car for children if they take theirparents to an automobile dealer in the area.Senator Coox. I think the significance and sophistication of adver-tising with sound and sight are really just beginning to really develop.I think what it can introduce in the future is quite phenomenal. Ithink one of the things that bothers me is the Govertunenes role in it.I an: concerned not so much about a prohibition of this particulartype of thing on a nutritional basis, but I get concerned about ourGovernment regulations of this type as it relates to a form of a cen-sorship, which does bother me tremendously. I can tell you in allfeirness that I evaluate my own children. I have a son who is 10, andI can't think of a time within the last 2 years that he said he wantedto buy anything because it was sold on television.Perhaps, the child is o'of the advertiser's target by the age of 10.I would only hope that the advertisers don't take me too seriously,because they will find a way to get to the 10- yea, -old. 381Mrs. CHARREN. If that is true, it is so sad, because all this children'sadvertising is directed at the 1- to 10-year-olds. It should be possibleto ban that. If you can ban advertising to cigarette userswhohave the ability to discriminate between something that might killthem and not taking itit should be easy to eliminate somethingthat is designed to sell to children under 10. That is a very good pointto be made, if that is what those ads are doing.PROTECT ABOVE FTC-DESIGNATED AGE 5 LEVELSenator Cool:. I read in the materials provided for this hearingthat there is a request before the FTC for a protective umbrella foradvertisements on age 5 and below. I don't think that is the correctage. I think we ought to go above this age.Mrs. CHARREN. That is right.Mrs. SARSON. Especially in low-income families. We are speakingfrom middle-class, middle-income families. In families of lower income,it is less clear how old the children are when they can cope. I thinkage 5 is very. low.Senator COOK. That 5-year-old figure came from a study by Dr.Howard submitted to the FTC.Mrs. SARSON. That is right, they said that.Senator Cool:. We have had the problem of utilization of foodstamps, particularly in the Appalachian areas, where we have indi-cated a tremendous amount of purchases in the candy, snack food,soft drink area to a very high degree.It, is almost one of those things that defies the imagination on howyou can correct it. It is something that we have debated and discussedfor a long, long time. The purchasing of all of the candies and all ofthe soft drinks results in a very, very high sugar diet for many of thesefamilies.Mrs. SARSON. It would be very exciting if the creativity that wentinto these products went into making apples tempting to childrenit would be great. I think the educational and informational promo-tions are done on low budgets, with less creativity, so they come outlooking a little turgid in contrast to the zip and zap of these otherthings.Mrs. CHIZRREN. That is net true of these Miles spots, however. ..SUBVERT THEMSELVES IN THIS FIELD?Senator Coox. If hi the advertising business, they really believedthey could sell you anything, . ad they do, why can't they sell yousomething that is good? Why do they have to subvert themselves inthis particular field? Why, for instance, when we do produce goodproducts? All of these companies produce good products. Why don'tthey do as good a job advertising those products to the young peopleof the United States as they do with Sir Grapefellow and a BaronVon Redberry. This bothers me.MN. CHARREN. I would like to mention that when ACT says noadvertising of these children's products on children's television, wedon't mean no advertising on the rest of television. We feel if they takethese same products and sell them on adult programs, at least there is achance that it is the adult that will make the decision to buy or notto buy and the child won't see a goodly number of them.Sal -S69 0-73-3 382Senator Coox. I want you to be just as concerned with what comeson after they finish with these advertisements. Some of the thingsthat come on see to it that children can't sleep at night, and thatthey are afraid to go to bed.Many people leave lights on all night. One reason that they have toleave the lights on is because of the things children watch on television.Maybe we wouldn't have this energy crisis if them was more thought-ful TV programing.Mrs. SARSON. That is the most beautiful argument I have heardon that yet. That is gorgeous.Senator Coox..Thank you.Senator SCHWEIKER. I was very interested in your testimony whereyou quoted on assistant general advertising manager:When you sell a woman on a product. and she goes into the store and finds yourbrand isn't in stock, she will probably forget about it. But when you sell a kid onyour product, if he can't get it, he will throw himself on the floor, stamp hie feetand cry. You can't get a reaction like that out of an adult.It was only last. Sunday I was taking my children down to thedrugstore; and I went for a very specific purpose. Before we left thestore, my 3-year-old wanted a certain brand of toothpaste. I didn't,even go for toothpaste. We didn't need it The brand wasn't even inthe store at the time. The child really had a temper tantrum, so Icouldn't agree with that point more because I just saw it. last Sunday.Senator Coox. Thank goodness it was toothpaste.TV ADVERTISING IS POWERFUL TOOLSenator SCHWEIKER. Thank goodness it was the 3-year-old and notall the other four. I think this very graphically demonstrates thepoint. This is a powerful, potent tool. My 3-year-old, who knowsnothing about toothpaste except you brush your teeth with it, but byreferring to a brand name, you really have a potent person hookedthere. I think this was a very valuable point about the children. Whenyou see the point this way, you can't argue or discuss the situationwith a child of that age in any meaningful way. You just have atemper tantrum.I also like your followup point about the climate that you set, whichis very true. There is no question that, when a mother or father takes astrong \"no\" position, you build a hostile relationship with yourchildren. At some point, a parent weakens a little and figures, \"Well,you don't want a totally hostile environment,\" and you give in atsome point.I think this is a psychological fact of life, in terms of parent-childrelationship.One thing I am not quite sold on is not differentiating between kindsof advertising.Now, I have been through the Christmas buying season with mycl:ildren and the ads for Christmas toys. But are these ads really havingthe harmful effects, say, of advertising a sugar-coated cereal and nutri-tion habits. Why put everything in the same category? Why not dif-ferentiate in terms of sugar .lid nutrition and teethvery logicalthings. Why go the whole way? 383SEPARATE PROBLEMS-NUTRITION AND TOYSMrs. CHARREN. They were really separate problems involved in thetwo types of advertising. That is why we have separate petitionsat the FTC. The food advertising problem is what we have justoutlined.The toy advertising relates very much to the idea that, besides thenormal problem of selling to young children, there is a problem thatmost of the toys sold on TV are overpriced, very expensive toys com-pared to toys that are not sold over TV. Even the industrywe get,this out of \"Playthings Magazine,\" and out of \"Toys,\" the industrymagazinethe fact these are the most poorly designed toys sold tochildren. That the industry, itself, complains they come back in drovesafter Christmas and it is ruining the industry. It is not fair to enticechildren to buy, using very attractive advertising--in spite of the factthat the NAB feels they have all these new rules in this areabut it,is not fair to entice the children to buy the fashion doll that was sopopular and had so many ads before Christmas. If you bought whatwas shown in a 60-second commercial--which I did buy, going throughdiscount houses in the Boston area until I finally collected everythingin the commercialit was in no box that I expected. It cost $32.64for the toys in one 60-second commercial. That is a tremendous biteout of a lot of families' toy budget.That type of thing, the prim is not fair. Also what this $32 boughtwas nothing like the toys the 60-second commercial would indicate.Mrs. SARSON. There is another pointwhich is the basic issue wehave become concerned withwhich is: Is it morally ethical to sell to:3-year-olds. The idea of pitt;ng the research establishment and agencyand everything cgainst tliAldren, to persuade the 3-year-old to buya product is really unbelievable.Given the systetc. of broadcasting as we have it, surely there shouldbe some area where we agree where perhaps we think it is net right tosell to children.If we feel it isn't right to sell to them, then we really shouldn't beselling anything to them on their own programs. If they see commer-cials at other times of day, we feel the parent has to cope with thattype of thing. But, we feel on a program which is labeled \"This pro-gram is for children,\" \"Captain Kangaroo\"as many of the lateafternoon cartoon programs arethose should be considered sacredground in that they know young children are watching and the ad-vertisers shouldn't have access to them the way they do now.MOCKUPS USED-NOT PRODUCTION MODEM.Senator Coox. Let me add one thing. I try, at least in my own mind,to be quite a free enterprise individual, and I think that I have a verysound basis for it. But to add to your comment about toys on televi-sion, many toy manufacturers absolutely cheat the public. They willuse their mockup model that may have cost $10,000 to build and thatis the one they use on television to advertise. That is the (Me they use that walks across the stage or that is the one they use that works as aderrick or something else. When you buy the one that is made out ofplastic, with string, ..:id it takes four batteries, it is a different matter.It doesn't work the dame, it doesn't do the same things, it certainlydoesn't last as long, by the wt.y.4 384I think this is a very deceptive type f,t advertising. The ads that areshown on television use very sophisticated models that they havetaken to the toy show and they spent a lot of money to build. They arenot built out o: the things that they will tool up and make 25,000 ofthem every day, put them in a box, and ship them all over the UnitedStates. There is a big difference.I think that the manufacturer ougH to know that we know thispractice is going on. It is kind of ridiculous that he thinks this is theway he will market his product.Mrs. CHARREN. What is interesting is the way the ads are designed.They are designed so that the children in the commercial are a littlebit older because they find that those are the children that the youngchildren pay attention to. There is no effort made to let anybody knowthat this really isn't right for that 5-year-old, whereas, it, might befine for a 10-year-old. So the ad is designed to appeal to the largestsegments of that 2- to 11-year-old audience because that helps thesales.There is no effort made to let the child for whom the thing is notright know that it is not right. In fact, it is just the reverse.It is to entice the child, who wants to be older and therefore, if olderkids play with this toy, you will want it, too.They wouldn't show a lot of ads with 3-year-olds or 5-year-oldplaying with it because the 7-year-olds would never want. the toys.Mrs. SARSON. We have a letter from a parent on how she bought atrain set for her 4-year-old daughter; that is, it looked on the ad to bethat. It turned out to be a complicated set of trains that the woman'sengineer husband couldn't put together.We have a survival kit that we have distributed to parents verysuccessfully and which we will reprint.On your comment about mockups, one of our favorites is the onethat says that batteries are not included, but it says it in print whichthe kids under 8 or 7 probably can't read.Senator SCHWEIKER. I can understand your group opposing allchildren's advertising. The only point I want to make is that I thinksome of the more serious and detrimental advertising campaigns, interms of q. child's physical health and well-being should be singled out.For example, yesterday Dr. Mayer testified ' to something I foundinteresting. He referred to some research or suspicion and scientificthinking tying the overabundant use of sugar in our society to diabetes.I was shocked to find out that one out of five persons either havediabetes or will have the inherited characteristics of diabetes. Now,this, in itself, is an alarming statistic. Diabetes is the second leadingcause of blindness in the United States, and it will soon be first.HOOKING OUR CHILDRENDISASTROUS EFFECTSIf there is a relationship between sugar and this growing impact ofdiabetes in our societythis is one of the stu'lies that suggests itthen we may very well be hooking our children c a very serious health binge that will, as you say, disastrously affe 'm for the rest of their lives, because diabetes affects the heart, ,neys, and almost every organ of our bodies.I See part NE3, pp. 237-261 385So my only point here is that if relationships like this are trueandright now it is scientific conjecturethen it seems to me that this is atop priority health matter or matter of physical and healthful longevityof life that I think would have a higher priority as opposed to toys.Mrs. CHARREN. Senator, we agree with you Pild that is why wecame today to testify when you asked us. That s why we are filingthis afternoonactually with the FTCan additional filing to ourfood petition. This will be the second food petition we have presentedto the Commission because we did additional research and found theadditional sugar problems related to the diet and health of children.That is why we took these eight products and specifically singled themout for complaintshoping that if it is too complicated for theFederal Trade Commission to act immediately on a trade regulationrule, they can rule on these specific ads and then, through the ruleson these ads, will rule on more specific ads. In that way we can possiblyeliminate the sugar advertising to children.SUGAR Now MAJOR FOOD INGREDIENTSenator SCHWEIKER. I think singling them out the way, you have isvery important. I think it is a fact that we should really take intoaccount nowin view of this new medical theory that is unfoldingabout the impact of these things. Also we should recognize that sugarused to be a supplementa seasoningand new it has become,unfortunately, a staple product, a major ingredient. As a result, weconsume, I think, twice the average amount of sugar in the world. Itmay well account for some of the facts that Americans, diseasewise,are not too well offcompared to some of the other countries aroundthe world.I am not saying that is always true. I am only offering the conjecturethat there is obviously some reascn we are in this situation. This isone thing that may lead to it.Mrs. SARSON. In informing the public of this information, that wouldbe very helpful.Recently when we began doing research into this, we had two peopleinvestigating the types of foods thing advertised to children. We wereamazed that almost all of them have high-sugar content. Generally,the public is not aware of this. At the end of the ad, it doesn't say thatthis product has so much sugar and may be detrimental to your teeth,or something like that. It may be difficult for the parent to explainthat this may do this or that to you, and to have to continue to say\"no\" is very difficult.Mrs. CHA.RREN. And all this advertising is really ;- a sense likegetting the child hooked on the need to have sugar in your mouth.If you eat enough sugared foodI see this in children, in my own tobe exactyou want it to taste like that, so you have more sugaredfood that tastes like that.Senator SCRWEIKER. Bringing us up to the next point, you referredto the learning process in terms of eating.I wonder if you could cite any specific study, or elaborate furtheron the conditioned response part of the eating habit that obviouslywould be a very key factor? Mrs. SARSON. We would have to go and look things up, but the most interesting response came from my own child's schoolwherethe school nurse and my son's class sent home a note that the children were not to bring any more snacks in the school. Because the snacksthey were bringing in were all sugar foods, the school felt they were not healthy. From now on the school would provide peanuts as an experi- ment to see what would happen when they don't eat the sugared foods.For the past 3 months, because of this, they have stopped all sugaredsnacks coming to the school; and they have given the children peanuts.The nurse was disturbed beyond measure with the type of foods thatwere brought inthey were all television-advertised foods.I am following.througli with her to see what else they will do in theschool, to see what happens.This is one immediate and very positive reaction to the type oftelevision advertising that has been going on for children.Mrs. CHARREN. Also because they are snacks, it is the kind of foodyou keep eating; it is different from the type of food you would servefor dinner.Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you.Senator COOK. Thank you very much.I think our next two witnesses are Robert Choate and TracyWesten.INDUSTRY'S DECISION ...WILL NOT ENHANCE REPUTATIONMay I say for the record, while Mr. Choate and Mr. Westen comeup, that this Senator is very disappointed to read in this morning'spaper that the representatives from industry have seen fit not to wantto appear before this hearing. For their representatives who may behere, let me just say that it is disappointing to me. I think that it isnow a matter of selling one's products to us as well as they sell it to3- and 4-year oltiBut more impotent than that, the thing that bothers me is that Iam afraid that many substantially fine, reputable organizationsthroughout the United Statesby reason of this type of advertising,and by reason of being sold on what their marketing departments andadvertising agencies are sellingare suffering from this. I think thisis unfortunate.I find it unbelievable that they would not want to come before thiscommittee and that they would not want to state their case.I have a feeling that rather than product creativity, that it ismarketing creativity, and it is advertising creativity, that is bringingmany of these products onto the market. I am not quite sure that thereputations of these companies, in the long run, will be enhanced by it.STATEMENT OF ROBERT B. CHOATE, JR., CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL ONCHILDREN, MEDIA AND MERCHANDISING, WASHINGTON, D.C.Mr. CHOATE. I am Robert Choate, chairman of the Council onChildren, Media and Merchandising.I would like to read from the transcript, which we will have in yourhands within 5 minutes. We had to take care of some emergencysituations that arose in splicing together a film with another that isnot compatible. Over the last 5 years, I have diplomatically, factually, and per-sistently tried to draw the attention of the Grocery Manufacturersof America to their public responsibilities as they market newer andnewer types of puffed, twisted, and scented products.I have pointed out that they have unusual responsibilities when itcomes to children.Of the 40 cereals that I criticized in 1970, 36 have now been soreformulated as to, in effect, be a different quality product. This mustbe interpreted that someone in the GMA listens.But in three regards, the members of the GMA have been par-ticularly immovable:1. They are not interested in protecting or improving theprotein worth of grain products, as far as I can see;2. They are not interested in educational advertising; and:3. They are absolutely convinced that, for the prepuberty set,sugar appeal is the counterpart of sex appeal.Since 1969, I have repeatedly beseeched sponsors, advertisingagencies and their trade organizations to correct their advertising offood products to children.My contacts with food manufacturers have been endless. I have alsoappeared with some regularity before broadcaster groups. It. mayinterest you to know that I believe I am the only consumer advocatewho has appeared before the National Association of BroadcastersCode Authority in the 12 years of its existence.SUGGEST CODE FOR ADVERTISING EDIBLESOn May 26, 1971, I suggested a code for advertising ediblesa codewhich the NAB Code Authority ultimately chose to ignore. Yet, theyacknowledge the wisdom of having a toy-advertising code.I point this out to you to show the extent of the effort we have madeto persuade the private sector of our economy to practice self-regu-lation, self-moderation, and self-policing. I don't know what moreone can do.We have been forced to spend substantial amounts of time trying topersuade the Federal Government to influence those who will notinfluence themselves on food matters.Senator Cook, I would speak to the fact right now that having triedthe private route through the GMA, and the NAB. we then have goneto the Federal Trade Commission to see. what assistance that agencycan give us. The Federal Trade Commission does have in developmentright now guidelines for the advertising of edibk. products.I think this is r. healthier way for them to act than to act after thefact, when somebody has violated some ethic in the selling of foods.I hope the new chairman, when he comes up to you at your invitation,will reemphasize the desirability of having the FTC come out withsonie guidelines for the ethical advertising of foods, particularly tochildren.During the years after World War II, our food supply was dramat-ically changed in form, texture, and in \"mouth feel,\" as well as in nutri-tional content. Sugar came into the recipes for almost everything,including drinks, both frozen and c\"nned; vegetables and fruits, bothfrozen and canned; catsup, sausages, and even corned beef hash. 388The cereal industry started to produce a line of breakfast condimentswith sugar contents ranging from 40 to 48 percent. Dr. Mayer saysover 50 percent. I wonder if they are adequately analyzed?The nutrition-related professionals remained silent and apatheticin the 1950's and 1960's. Since most of the good jobs were held in thefood industry and most of the grant research money came from the foodindustry, it apparently was in the best self-interest of the food tech-nicians to hear no evil, see no evil, and think no evil about the manu-facturers of \"Tastey-Wastey Flakes.\"NuLitionists, dieticians, home economists, and dental professionalsmust have known that the food supply was changing away from any-thing that could be properly described as the four \"food groups.\"Very few professional voices could be heard questioning the use ofcoloring agents, additives, imitation products, or sugaras these cameto be more and more popular ingredients in food.With Dr. Jean Mayer's leadership in 1969, and the leadership of afew other nutritionists since that time, the silence of the food tech-nicians has turned from a peep to a whisper.I should state that during this period the 800 I repeat-800-oddpublic relations people in the Department of Agriculture rivaled tele-vision as being the loudest voice in food advice, but few words wereuttered on the implications of heavy sugar consumption.MASSIVE BARRAGE OF SUGAF ADVERTISINGSenator Cook, you will remember when I testified February 27before the Senate Commerce Committee, I pointed out that the com-mercial message addressed to children has zoomed in frequency inrecent years. Today, a moderate television watching child sees 25,000commercials a year. Between 5,090 zo 10,000 of these commercials arefor edible products. A child spends over 1,000 hours a year watchingtelevisionmore time, in fact, than he spends before his elementaryschool teacher. A moderate television watching child sees 220 minutesof pure commercials each week over television-220 minutes. Theimpact of this massive propaganda has gone unstudied by academia,foundation, and Government alike, and to a degree, by journalistsI testified on the secret research behind children's advertising.I would like to enter into the record a copy of an advertisement sentby the publisher of the Reader's Digest to, I believe, every Congress-man and Senator on Capitol Hill. The letter by the publisher of theReader's Digest said:Unfortunately, the comment on sugar has created an explosion of headlines inan atmosphere where a reasonable presentation of all aspects of the issue is itnpos-sible. As a result, the consumer, bombarded with a mass of conflicting information,becomes confused and skeptical. One of those criticized has chosen to use its ad-vertising space to tell the consumer of .the place sugar has in our everyday diet.They believe their message is a meaningful, objective judgment on this vital healthand nutrition issue.The publisher of the Reader's Digest invites the Congressmenand Senators to read the advertisement of the Sugar Association. Wequery the purpose of a major publisher in writing such a letter.I would like to enter that in the record, if I may.Senator Coox. Without objection, it will be entered.'See Appendix, p. 421. 389Mr. CHOATE. We have pointed out this massive barrage of sugaradvertising to the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal TradeCommission, and the Federal Communications Commission.Each of these agencies has taken note and done very little. Yes;we finally persuaded the Federal Trade Commission to establish guidelines for food advertising, since neither the NAB or the GMAwould do it.Yes;,we have apparently persuaded the Food and Drug Administra-tion to hold a seminar on sugar in our food supply.Yes; we have participated in the FCC hearings on children's tele-vision and have pointed out the en masse advertising responsibilitiesthat reside with the FCC while individual ad deceits remain theresponsibility of the Federal Trade Commission.Still, we cannot be proud of our accomplishments. Yesterday youheard some of the reasons why the food companies would not appear.Let me comment on those reactions by the food industry.These hearings, as I recall, were called to permit the food industryto show how they are educating children in matters of health andnutrition.(IONSIDEHATION OF STUDIES ON DENTAL HEALTHWhen the companies heard that dental health was to be considered,they seem to have backed out. Maybe it is well they should, forover an 8-year period, General Foods, Kellogg, and others have beenfinancing studies to halt the epidemic of cavities that they themselveshave been bringing to the young population's mouths.The control groups for these studies at Ann Arbor, Midi., and Elk-hart, lnd., have demonstrated the high cariogenic rates of theseproducts.I think it is time to stop the hypocrisy. A firm such as GeneralMills spends a few dollars irinting a booklet for mothers entitled\"Meal Planning for Young Children.\" Here is what it says:Watch the teeth. Use sparingly foods high in sugar. They take away the appe-tite for more basic foods, provide only calories and quick energy and encouragetooth decay. No coaxing is necessary to get children to eat candy, cookies, cake,or drink carbonated hew rages. Teaching a preference for other types of foodsmust begin early ib the high-chair stage. Offer sweets only at the end of the meal.So advises General Mills in their booklet to mothers.This same General Mills, on the other hand, spends millions inadvertising to children and here is what one of their ads says:Mirror, mirror on the wall, whose cereal is the superswcetest of them all? Isit my Count Choeula? My supersweet cereal, chocolate sweet is for monsterchocolate flavor.I think it is time that we got past the nickel and clime moralitythat is shown by the General Mills pamphlet to mothers and startedto look at the tidal wave of beseechments to children to demandsweetness in every meal.I think it is time we asked for a public service announcement tocorrect the misinformation that is going out in commercials today.I think it is tune we require sponsors to prepare really good com-mercials with an educational message.Now, I would like to show you this morning some messages thathave been prepared around the United States, showing what imagina-tive people are doing and thinking toward nutrition education.01S69 0-73----4 These are not perfect messages. Some of them have been preparedfor as little as $500 a minute, compared to maybe $25,000 or $35,000 aminute for a good commercial done for prime time.But I would like to show you these messages and I will talk aboutthem as we go. In the interest of time, we want to go through in ahurry, run it on through, and I will talk over them, if I can.MASS MEDIA EXPERIMENTATIONFood selling to children over the air is still a national disgrace. Forthis reason, we decided to go into the business of communicating tochildren directly. We sought out those in the United States who wereknowledgeable about food matters and were willing to involve them-selves in a mass media experiment.We found to our delight that some organizations were preparingnutrition-related messages for television aimed at the child and adultalike; these could have a beneficial effect on a child's attitude towardfood.I would like to show you some of the early versions of these. Onewas financed by a group in Albuquerque, using 0E0 funds. Anotherone was a commercial spot done by DuPont to stress their soybeanresearch. Also \"Cal Calcium\" by the U S. Department of Agriculture.[Film presentation.]This is an early one done by the Department of Agriculture.These films had reasonably straightforward messages. They maynot have had great excitement in their style, but they would cer-tainly help a person who had little knowledge of his food supply.They were less dull than the usual Department of Agriculture homeeconomist message.In 1971, we noticed that a very few food firms were starting to payattention to nutritional quality.[Film presentation: \"Nutrients\"Albuquerque; \"Soy Bean\"DuPont.]This is a DuPont commercial which addresses the soybean geneti-cally. In a minute you will see it approaching the wheat seed and, ineffect, DuPont is saying that it can do for the wheat seed what it hasdone for the soy seed.I include that one to show what can be done with cartoon work inthe selling of information about foods.[Film presentation: \"Orange Juice\"Sealed Sweet.]The fresh orange juice producers seem to take the lead talking aboutnutrients in orange juice.[Film presentation: \"Alpo Chopped Beef \" ALPO.] Dog food manufacturers started to talk about the nutrients in theirproducts.[Film presentation: \"School Lunch\"Albuquerque Nutrition Im-provement program.]The then rapidly building national effort to feed better foods to theless privileged brought about an Albuquerque effort with the Lieuten-ant Governor of New Mexico participating in a public serviceanouncement in behalf of food stamps.Senator McGovern, we are showing some examples from aroundthe United States of 30- and 60-second spots that have been preparedfor television. Are we ready to roll?If we are, let's go on with a few more.These were prepared by foundations, universities and other organi-zations.tFilnt presentations.]Some of the private groups are starting to use new methods. Alittle bit of humor goes a long way in this area.That is a commercial that was filmed and is even on the air thismorning on television. Apparently, in that one, we are willing to sellnutrition to our pets but not to our people.This is a film that appeared through IIEW financing; it was devel-oped to be shown on the Captain Kangaroo program. This was pre-pared by the Robert Souther land Associates in Los Angeles, under acontract with HEW.As consumers noticed industry's preoccupation with sugar, sugarwarning messages started to come forth.AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION WARNS ABOUT SUCROSEIt is noteworthy that the American Dental Association was awareof the issue, but its messages were subtle and mild.The ADA had passed a warning resolution relating to sugar andsucrose in the 1950's and early 1960's, but had done little to changethe vigor of their posture since that date.I am delighted to notice that Dr. Nizel, an obvious leader in thefield of dental research, has now started to change the ADA's laggardposition in this regard.[14'ilin presentation: \"Sugar Warning\"San Francisco KPIX TV.]These were done by San Francisco students. These are being shownon the air in the San Francisco area. Group \\V Broadcasting has beenvery cooperative in messages such as this across the country.[Film presentation: \"Sugar/snack W arning\"Yell owb all Work-shop.]Yellowball was financed by Group W; it is a private Massachusettsorganization. This is their commercial.[Film presentation: \"Little Jack Horner\"American Dental Asso-ciation.]This was prepared by the American Dental Association; it is one oftheir shorts that refer to the sugar problem.The American Dental Association has not been in the forefront ofdrawing children's attention to the effect of sugar on their teeth. Thisis what we could find in their library.I think now we get to the three public service announcements thatwere prepared by my office for children's program time.NEGATIVE ADVERTISING DIRECTED AT CHILDRENAs we looked at the food messages of others, we decided that whatwas needed for children was verve, humor, and perhaps a little ribaldprovocation.Noticing that some children had voted the anticigarette commercialsof 1966 and 1967 as being the most memorable ads, we recognized thevalue of negative thinking when it comes to talking about the goodsand the bads in your food supply. 392I persuaded a New York foundation to sponsor some right-to-the-point messages to be aired to children on the subject of snacks andsugar in their food supply.I have been well educated by my dentist; also by Dr. Nizel, Dr.Joseph Mueller, and by others on the role that sugar can play in dental deterioration.I have visited with the dentists in Elkhart, Ind., who for at least8 years have been conducting research on possible drugs to be addedto the food supply of childrenhopefully to negate the heavy sugarconcentrations that food manufacturers like to put in their products.EPIDEMIC OF DENTAL DISEASEI remember well Dr. Nizel pointing out to me that there is an epi-demic of dental disease in this country. He told me a few years agothat of every 100 inductees into the Army, there were 600 cavities tobe filled and 106 teeth to be pulled.We took all these inputs into consideration as we planned todevelop two 30-second and one 60-second public service announcementfor commercial television to be shown on children's watching time.After many false starts and detours, we finally came up with thefollowing messages.[Film \"SugarFamilyOn Second Thought\" 30 seconds.]\"On Second Thought\" is sponsored by the Society for NutritionEducation, Consumer Federation of America, National Council ofNegro Women, and the Council on Children, Media and Merchandising.These messages have now been sent out to approximately 70 broad-casters in the United States. Perhaps a dozen have agreed to runthem; perhaps two dozen have refused to run them.\"APATHY...PREOCCUPATION WITH INCOME\"The overwhelming answer from the broadcasters to these publicservice messages is the answer we have noted in regard to nutritionin 1967-71. Apathy, silence, and preoccupation with income:When one considers this. arrogant disregard of a child's rights;When one considers the sophistication of the preparation ofconventional advertisements to children;When one considers the 220 minutes of pure advertising that,a moderate television-watching child is exposed to each week;When one considers the unchildlike products advertised tochildren; thenThe accusation of an unfair business practice, or an unfairbroadcast practice becomes pertinent and to the point.Either the airwaves must balance their messages to a child on aproduct-by-product basis or the airwaves must admit messages whichstimulate prudent consumer knowledge in the young mind which in-dustry so avidly woos today.I have tried to show you what has been developed around theUnited States by those who are, in general, tired of waiting forindustry to correct the message aimed at kids over TV.These messages are having a very mixed reception by the broad-casting industry. Tracy Weston, on my right, will speak on why they are havingproblems, why we are having difficulties getting them on the air.When you realize a moderate television-watching child sees 220minutes of pure advertising per week, and that a third er half of themare on food products, I think the modest message that you have seenpresented here is only a start of bringing balance to children'sadvertising.The last two films I would like to show I found 3 weeks ago. Theywere developed by a remarkable 63-year-old nutritionist in Missouri.They are probably the best examples of consumer-nutrition infor-mation that I have seen in the United States. They were prepared ona shoestring put up by the Department of Agriculture. This lady isnow distributing them in the Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa area and Ihope, in her retirement, she goes on and publishes better materials.(Film presentations.]Mrs. Lorene Wilson is a member of the extension service of theUniversity of Missouri. Mrs. Wilson is about to retire as a consumerspecialist.She has written the scripts, prepared the food, and acted the partsin some sequences. She is now distributing her films to stations withina 200-mile radius of Columbia, Mo. I think her materials are first rateand show what can be done.But remember, Senators, before much further effort is expended inthis direction, we need to create the opportunity among the broad-casters of the Nation for these materials to reach the air.Thank you.Senator MCGOVERN. Mr. Weston?STATEMENT OF TRACY A. WESTEN, DIRECTOR, STERNCOMMUNITY LAW FIRM, WASHINGTON, D.C.Mr. WESTEN. I am Tracy Weston, director of the Stern Communitylaw firm in Washington hero, which is a nonprofit public interest lawfirm.For the past several years, I have been working with public interestorganizations in their attempt to broadcast health, safety, andnutritional messages over radio and television; although we have beenconcerned with problems of deceptive messages en the air.I would like .to share some of my experiences with you. Many ofthese efforts have mot with frustration, censorship, and neglect by thebroadcast media. Based on my experience in negotiating with broad-cast stations and in litigation before the Fedora] CommunicationsCommission, and in the courts, I have reached a tentative but depress-ing conclusion:\"Assuming that educational groups created nutritional messages ofsuch importance that they might potentially change the eating andliving habits of millions of Americans, they probably could not getthem on the air or keep them there.\"PUBLIC NOT INFORMEDAlthough television and radio are among the most effective mediafor communicating health and safety information to the public, con-sumer groups with health and safety messages have often found the 394doors of entry slammed shut in their faces. Their messages are not broadcast; their information is not communicated; and the public isnot informed.There are, of course, exceptions. Some public health and safety mes- sages do appear on television. But too often they are bland and unin-formative. 'Poo often they are shown in early morning or late eveninghours, soon only by early rising farmers or late sleeping insomniacs.The general point, therefore, is still valid: many important nutri-tional messages n.wer roach the television viewingI believe the lack of nutritional communication and information isone of the critical problems facing this committze. We can assume thatmost people want to be healthy, and that much information to helpthem is already available. The essential problem is communicatingthat known information to the American public.From experiences in distributing messages to the broadcast media,we have learned four basic things.First, we have learned that nutritional problems are almost alwaysinformational or communications problems. A mother in Appalachiacan watch television 10 hours a day, for example, and still not learnthat feeding her child a protein-deficient diet of potatoes, cereal, andstarch may stunt its mental growth.A teenage girl may spend 10 hours a day plugged into a transistorradio, yet never learn that a sugar and starch-laden diet of cokes,candy, french fries, potato chips, ice cream and pie may rot her teeth,increase her weight, distort her intake of vital nutrients, and subjecther in later life to the risks of heart, kidney and blood-sugar diseases.In each of these cases, the nutritional problems are not medical,scientific or factual. They are communicational.It is what people don't know that can hurt them, starve them, or undernourish them. Nutritional problems cannot be solved, therefore,unless accurate information iseffectively communicated to the American public.Second, we have learned that effective communication cannotexist without access to the broadcast media.The polls tell us that over 60 percent of the American public con-sider television their principal source of news and information.Nutritional groups can churn out reports, write newspaper articles,and hold press conferences to their hearts' content, but the averagetelevision set--according to the latest surveysis turned on approxi-mately 7 hours a day. Given the time people spend watching televi-sion, working, eating, and sleepin, very little time is left for reading. In fact, the people most in need .4 nutritional informationchildrenand the poorare least likely to read, and most likely to spend longhours watching television. If these people are to be educated nutri-tionally, then they must be reached through television.The third lesson is the importance of the \"commercial\" format.The 30- or 60-second commercial is perhaps the most powerful andsophisticated edijcational tool ever devised.ONE 60-SECOND COMMERCIAL EQUALS TEACHER'S CAREERFew teachers spend as much time or thought in their entire careersas do Madison Avenue agencies, artists,writers, photographers, actors, and directors in producing one 60-second commercial. It is 395perhaps for this reason that companies like Coca-Cola, for examplethe Nation's 14th largest advertiserspent over $71 million on adver-tising in 1971 alone, mo:;t, of it for radio and television commercials,and most of that for soft drinks containing chemicals, sugar, andcarbonated water.This incredible suns, incidentally, could pay 9,000 teachers a salaryof almost $8,000 a year teaching grammar school children basicnutritional inform. ion.Consumer groups have learned, therefore, that advertising tech-niques can be used as bask educational tools, to educate and inform,as well as sell and promote.PUBLIC INTEREST VERSUS COMMERCIAL INTERESTSAlthough television stations are licensed to operate in the \"publicinterest,\" their underlying motivationperhaps not unnaturallyis to operate in the \"commercial interest.\"Television, fundamentally, is a business.Although in 1928 the Federal Radio Commission warned that thebenefit \"derived by advertisers [from broadcasting] must be incidentaland entirely secondary to the interest of the public,\" it publiclyadmitted failure 37 years later when it concluded: \"Network televisionbecame largely a shderule advertising medium principally motivatedby a commerical concept.\"Because television is a commercially supported medium, it tends tocensor, exclude or ignore ideas, arguments or information that mightmake it less attractive to advertisers and sponsors.For many years, Procter & Gamble, television's largest advertiser$190 million in 1971 alonemade this quite explicit in the \"ed-itorial policy\" it circulated to its television producers.It warned: \"There will be no material that may give offense, either directly or byinference, to a commercial organization of any sort.\"One NBC programing vice president has been brutally frank: \"Wehave always gone on the theory that the man who pays the bills hasa right to some voice in shaping the product.\"For television, there is little doubt who pays many of its the manufacturers of cereals, snack foods, candies, chewing gum, cakes,pastries, and soft drinks.In 1971, for example, the 23 leading food, candy, gum, and softdrink advertisers spent over $700 million on television advertisingalone.'Arrayed against this advertising \"megatonnage,\" the efforts ofnutr' .onists to broadcast truthful information about many heavilyadvertised products seem insignificant indeed.There are three ways to get nutritional messages on television, andnone of them really have been successful:1. Through programing produced by the television industry:2. Through nutritional advertisements or spots produced byadvertisers; or,3. Through Public Service Advertisements (PSA) distributedby groups interested in nutrition and broadcast on a \"paid\" ora \"free\" basis.General Foods. General Mills, Kraftco, Nabisco, Ralston Purina, Kellogg. Campbell Soup, Norton Si-mon Co., McDonald's. Nestle. Quaker Oats, Carnation, CPC International, Pillsbury, Standard Brands.IL J. IIemz, Beatnce Foods, Borden, Wrigley, Mars. Coca-Cola, Peps1-Cota, Seven-Up. None of these methods are likely to succeed, however, whenever the underlying message is construed as countering, undermining, opposing or refuting heavily advertised products.The television industry, for examples, is unlikely to produce pro- graming to argue the health hazards of sugar, the absence of nutritionin soft drinks, the tooth decay produced by chewing gums, candies and presugared cereals, the high cholesterol in meats and dairyproducts, or the nutritional bankruptcy of junky \"snack\" foods. One breakfast cereal sponsor reportedly deleted the line, \"Sheeats too much,\" from a television drama because it felt nobody couldever eat too much. In each case the television producer would fearthe loss of powerful sponsors for its programsor even the loss of entire accounts.'NO PROFIT IN PRODUCING NUTRITIONAL MESSAGESThe advertising industry is also unlikely to produce and distribute,at its own expense, many important nutritional messages. For one thing, it may not be profitable. As the president of the AmericanTobacco Co. remarked several years ago: \"I don't have the right to spend the stockholders' money just to entertain the public.\"More importantly, the messages may undermine the sponsor's own product.What chewing gum or candy manufacturer would urge children to avoid their products for fear of tooth decay?What cereal manufacturer would warn that its product contained487 percent sugar?What soft drink manufacturer would advise viewers to drink plainwater instead of its concoction of chemicals and sugar?Indeed, what food manufactures would even urge viewers to eat. less. To avoid excessive amounts of carbohydrates; sugars, and fats,to cut down on cholesterol- producing foods; to avoid snack foods;and to buy fresh instead of canned vegetables and foods?The third method of informing the publicdistributing publicservice advertisements from consumer groupshas encounteredsimilar obstacles. Although television stations often make time avail-able for free public service announcements, for example, \"Smokeythe Bear,\" they have consistently refused to offer this time forannouncements that might counter or detract from a commercialsponsor's message.And although television stations sell up to 25 percent of their airtime for commercials, they have refused to sell this time for alleged\"counter-commercial\" messages.One auto safety example drawn from our experience will illustratethe point. In late 1971, General Motors admitted that a potentially deadly engine-mount defect existed in almost seven million 1965-69 Chevro:ets, a defect which could cause the car suddenly to accelerateout of control without power brakes or steering. General Motorsrecalled the cars, but Chevrolet officials admitted that well overThe Coca-Cola Co. reportedly obtained additions and deletions in an NBC documentary on migrant workers which showed abysmal health and labor conditions on the company's Florida ranches.See F.

TIME FOR W A ItNI NGSThecenter then asked the local station to sell them the thne, atstandardcommerciall rates, to broadcast the same warning announce-ment. Again the station refused.The result? Although the networks and stations had made millionsof dollars advertising the safety and quality of 1965-69 Chevrolets,they refused to give, or even sell, 30 seconds of airtime for an announce-ment that might have saved the lives of those Chevrolet owners whorelied on the Chevy ads. The reason, I submit. was that they fearedthe announcement might displease Chevron .t, a major television sponsor.'At, the moment, public interest groups wishing to produce and dis-tribute their own nutritional messages have no other recourse.The Supreme Court is now considering whether the first amendmentrequires broadcast stations to sell time to any group, regardless oftheir message. But even if the answer is yes, few consumer groups willbe able to afford the $40,000 to $80,000 rate for 1 commercial minuteon network evening time.The only alternative is free public service time, but it is often barredto public interest groups by entrenched television advertisers.Although our firm has filed test case litigation to establish a limitedright for consumers to air free public service messages, a find legalsolution is no doubt several years away.CONCLUSIONI wouldconclude, then, with several observations and recom-mendations:1. Nutrition must be viewed in part us a communications prob-lem.2. Information on health and nutrition can be distributed mosteffectively through the broadcast media, and this often requiresthe use of a commercial-type format.3. Given the commercial pressures that operate on the broad-cast industry, many important nutritional ;messages are cur-reedy censored by, or withheld from, the American public.That, unfortunately, is a dismal conclusion, but it is based on myown experience.The local station.

I woul Imake three suggestions:1. Broadcast stations should be required to sell commercialtime to any purchaser able to pay the going rate, regardless ofthe content of his message.2. Either Congress or the FCC should specify a minimumamount of time that each licensee must devote to free publicservice announcements prodm:ii. by others, and they mustrequire licensees to accept these announcements on a fair and even-handed basis, without discrimination against allegedly\"counter-commercial\" messages.3. Licensees should be required to inform the FCC at renewaltime how much al,- time they have devoted to matters of publichealth and safety.The Commission should be empowered to revoke the license ofany station that recklessly disregards its obligation to communicateimportant health and safety information to the public. PREPARED STATEMENT OF TRACY A. WESTENNUTRITION AND THE MASS MEDIA: A STUDY IN FRUSTRATION, CENSORSHIPAND NEGLECTMr. Chairman, for the past several years I have been working with publicinterest organizations in their attempt to broadcast health, safety, and nutritionalmessages over radio and television. Many of these efforts have met with frustra-tion, censorship, and neglect by the broadcast mcdia. Based on my experience innegotiating with broadcast stations and in litigation before the Federal Com-munications Commission and in the courts, I have reached a tentative but de-pressing conclusion:Assuming that educational groups created nutritional messages ofsuch importance that they might potentially change the eating andliving habits of millions of Americans, they probably could not get themon the air or keep them there.Although television and radio are among the most effective media for communi-cating health and safety information to the public, consumer groups with healthand safety messages have often found the doors of entry slammed shut their faces. Their messages are not broac' ast; their information is not communicated;and the public is not informed.There are, of course, exceptions to this generalization. Some public health andsafety messages do appear on television. But too often they are bland and unin-formative. Too often they are shown in early morning or late evening hours,seen only by early-rising farmers or late-sleeping insomniacs. The general point,therefore, is still valid: Many important nutritional messages never reach thetelevision viewing public.I believe the lack of nutritional communication and information is one of thecritical problems facing this committee. We can assume that !Host people want tobe healthy, and that much information to help then, is already available. Theessential problem is communicating that known information to the Americanpublic. Our experiences in distributing messages to the broadcast media, howeverfrustrating, have given us some insights into these problems, and I would liketo share four of them with you.First, we have learned that nutritional problems are almo t olways informa-tional or communications problems. A mother in Appalachia can watch television10 hour- a day, for example, and still not learn that feeding her child a protein-deficient diet of potatoes, cereal, and starch may stunt its mental growth. Ateenage girl may spend 10 hours a day plugged into a transistor radio, yot neverlearn that a sugar and starch-laden diet of cokes, candy, french fries, potatochips, ice cream, and pie may rot her teeth, increase her weight, distort he! intake 399of vital nutrients, and subject her in later life to the risks of heart, kidney, andblood-sugar diseases. In each of these cases, the nutritional problems are notmedinal, scientific or factual. They are communicational. It is what people don'tknow that can hurt, starve, or undernourish them. Nutritional problems cannotbe solved, thereforchunless accurate information is effectively communicated tothe American public.Second, we have learned that effective communication cannot exist withoutaccess to the broadcast media. The polls tell us that over 60 percent of the Ameri-can public considers television its principal source of news and information.Nutritional groups can churn out reports, write newspaper .ticks, and hold press conferences to their hearts' content. But the average American will never seethem. That average Americanaccording to the latest surveysis spendingapproximately 7 hours a day watching television. Given time spent working,eating, and sleeping, very little time is left for reading. In fact, the people most inneed of nutritional informationchildren and the poorare least likely to readand most likely to watch television. If they are to be educated nutritionally, thenthey must be reached through television.The third lesson is the importance of the \"commercial\" short format. The30- or 60-second commercial is perhaps the most sophisticated and powerfuleducational tool ever devised. Few teachers spend as much time or thought intheir entire careers as do Madison Avenue agencies, artists, writers, photographers,actors, and directors in producing one 60-second commercial. It is for this reasonthat companies like Coca - Cola, for examplethe Nation's 14th largest ad- vertiserspent over $71 million on advertising in 1971most of it for radio andtelevision commercials, and mo,.t of that for soft drinks containing chemicals,sugar, and carbonated water. (This incredible sum, inciderrally, could pay 9,000teachers a salary of almost $8,000 a year teaching grammar school children basicnutritional information.) Consumer and nutrition groups, therefore, arc beginningto learn, along with the producers of \",Sesame Street,\" that advertising techniquescan be used as basic educational tools, to educate and inform, as well as sell andpromote. Their first attempts to distribute educational messages to the massmedia. however, have generated their fourth and perhaps most sianificant lesson.Although television stations are licensed to operate in the \"public interest,\"their underlying motivationperhaps not unnaturallyis to operate in the\"commercial interest.\" Television, fundamentally, is a business. It is run bybusinessmen; it sells its advertising time for businessmen; it pays its I, ofits tobusinessmen. Television's basic product is not programing, but the audience itsells to its advertisersat a \"cost per thousand.\" As FCC Commissioner NicholasJohnson has observed:The most widely prevalent myth about the television business is thatit has to do with programing. It does not. Its product is not programing;its product is you. You are not the consumer; the advertiser is the con-sumer. The advertiser is buying audience, audience to watch his com-mercial; he buys that audience from the broadcaster (network or localstation); you are sold to him like cattleat a \"cost per thousand.\" Youare the product. No one buys the program. The program is the attention-getting device, the flypaper, the flashing neon, the carnival barker, themedicine show, the topless dancer. Once you begin to perceive thetelevision business in this light it is easier to understand the reasonswhy television programing has been such a social disaster in our country.Although in 1928 the Federal Radio Commission warned that the benefit\"derived by advertisers [from broadcasting) must be incidental and entirelysecondary to the interest, of the public\" (2 F.R.C. Ann. Rpt. 168 [1928)), it publiclyadmitted failure 37 years later when it concluded:[Title policies and practices of network managers \" tended to sub-stitute purely commercial considerations based on circulation and\"cost per thousand\" for considerations of overall service * . In other words, network television became largely a \"slide rule\" advertisingmedium principally motivated by a commercial concept. (FCC second in-terim report, \"Television Network Program Procurement,\" Pt. II, atp. 231 [1968)).Because television is a commercially supported medium, it tends to censor,exclude or ignore ideas, arguments or information that might make it less at- 74. tractive to advertisers and sponsors. As one advertising vice president explainedto the Federal Communications Commission:alf you have a client who sells bulk soap to laundries, you don't put ona show which shows a laundry carefully tearing buttons off shirtsthelaundries don't like it; if you are selling boxed shortening to bakers,you don't put on a show which shows nefarious bakers who poisonbreadbakers don't like that. Similarly, if you have an automobileclient, you scarcely put on a show in which the oil is shown to be ofhorrible quality so that machinery grinds to a halt halfway across theAtlantic * \". I have known all three to happen in my own agency.(Quoted in H. Mehling, \"The Great Time-Killer,\" 58 [19621.)For many years, Proctor & Gamble, television's largest advertiser ($190 millionin 1971 alone), made this quite explicit in the \"Editorial Policy\" it circulated toits television producers. It warned:There will be no material that may give offense, either directly or byinference, to $ *a commercial organization of any sort *. For ob- vious reasons, it is essential that no statements be made on any of ourshows which could be construed as being unfavorable to any specialgroup of the company's customers or which would favor one type ofcustomer over another. (Quoted in H. Meh ling, \"The Great Time-Killer,\" 62 [1962].)One NBC programing vice president has been brutally frank:[WJe have always gone on the theory that the man who pays the billshas a right to some voice in shaping the product. (H. Mehling, supra, atp. 64.)For television, there is little doubt who pays many of its billsthe manufac-turers of cereals, snack foods, candies, chewing gum, cakes, pastries, and softarinks. In 1971, for example, the 23 leading food, candy, gu and soft drinkadvertisers i spent. over $700 million on television advertising alone. Arrayedagainst this advertising \"megatonnage,\" the efforts of nutritionists to broa feasttruthful information about many heavily advertised products seem insignificantindeed.There are three ways nutritional messages can reach television: (a) throughprograming produced by the television industry; (b) through nutritional adver-tisements or \"spots\" produced by advertisers; or (c) through \"public serviceadvertisements\" distributed by groups interested in nutrition and broadcaston a \"paid\" or a \"free\" basis. None of these methods arc likely to succeed, however, whenever the underlying message is construed as countering, undermining,opposing, or refuting heavily advertised products.The television industry, for example, is unlikely to produce programing toargue the health hazards of sugar, the absence of nutrition in soft drinks, the,tooth decay produced by chewing gums, candies and presugarcd cereals, thehigh cholesterol in meats and dairy products, or the nutritional bankruptcy ofjunky \"snack\" foods.(One breakfast cereal sponsor reportedly deleted the line, \"She eats too much,\"from a television drama because it felt nobody could ever eat too much.) In eachcase the television producer would fear the loss of powerful sponsors forits programsor even the loss of entire accounts?The advertising industry is also unlikely to produce and distribute, at its ownexpense, many important nutritional mes.sages. For one thing, it way not beprofitable. As the president of the American Tobact.o Co. remarked several yearsago:Taking 100 percent as the total radio value, we give 90 percent tocommercials, to what's said about the product, and we give 10 percentto the showI don't have the right to spend and r.sisehm.. See F. Feretti,\"Coea.Cola Denies Link to Farm Ills,\" NW York Times, July 6, In), k. Walters \"Nile Altersoissmientary,\"Washington Evening Star, July IT, P170, p. A-7. CoaColst subsequently canceled itsentire smillimilliondollar advertising NBC. Fee \"Coke Goes ;letter With C118,\" arsely,Jan. 20, Ion. p. 27. Any network would be reluctant to risk 11w ifisorasure, iamb lessthe loss, of such anenormous food account. 401money just to entertain the public. (Quoted in H. Meh ling, supra, atp. 183.)More importantly, the messages may undermine the sponsor's own product.What chewing gum or candy manufacturer would urge children to avoid theirproducts for fear of tooth decay? 3 What cereal manufacturer would warn thatits product contained 48 percent sugar? What soft drink manufacturer wouldadvise viewers to drink plain water instead of its concoction of chemicals andsugar? Indeed, what food manufacturer would even urge viewers to cat less; toavoid excessive amounts of carbohydrates, sugars and fats, to cut down on choles-terol-producing foods; to avoid \"snack\" foods, :Ind to buy fresh of cannedvegetables third methoddistributing \"public service advertisements\" from con-sumer groupsencounters similar obstacles. Although television stations oftenmake time available for free \"public service Europe,\" et cetera) they haveconsistently refused to offer this time for announcements that might \"counter\"or detract from a commercial sponsor's message. And although television stationssell up to 25 percent of their air time for commercials (16 minutes an hour in sonicchildren's programing), they have refused to sell this time for allegedly \"counter-commercial\" messages.One auto safety example will illustrate the point. In late 1971, General Motorsadmitted that a potentially deadly engine-mount defect existed in almost 7 million1965-69 Chevrolets, a defect which could cause the car suddenly to accelerate outof control without power brakes or steering. General Moors recalled the cars, butChevrolet officials admitted that well over 2 unrepaired and potentially lethal cars would remain oa the highways. The nonprofit Center for Auto Safetytherefore produced, at its own expense, a \"public service announcement\" urgingChevrolet owners to bring their cars in for repairs, and asked the three televisionnetworks and at least one local station to broadcast it free of charge. Each of themrefused. The Center then asked the local station to sell them the time, at standardcommercial rates, to broadcast the same warning announcement. Again the stationrefused. The result? Although the networks and stations had made million,: ofdollars advertising the safety and quality of 1965-69 Chevrolets, they refused togive, or even sell, 30 seco ids of air time for an announcement that might havesaved the lives of those Chevrolet owners who relied oa the Chevy ads. Thereason, either implicitly or explicitly, was the displeasure the announcement mightcause Chevrolet!At the moment, public interest groups wishing to produce and distribute theirown nutritional messages have no other recourse. The Supreme Court is nowconsidering whether the first amendment requires broadcast stations to sell timeto any group, regardless of their message. But even if the answer is \"yes,\" fewco isumer groups will be able to afford the $40,000 to $80,000 rate for I commercialminute on network evening time.Free \"public service\" time is also available from most stations, but this timeis generally barred to massages opposed by entrenched television advertisers. Andalthough our firm has filed test case litigation to establish a limited right forconsumers to air free public service messages, a final legal solution is no doubtseveral years away.I would conclude, then, with several observations and recommendations. First,nutrition must be viewed in part as a communications problem. Second, informa-tion on health and nutrition can be distributed most effectively through thebroadcast media and this often requires the use of a \"commercial-type\" format.Third, given the commercial pressures that operate on the broadcast industry,many important nutritional message: are currently censored by, or withheld from,the broadcast media.In my opinion, remedial legislation isclearly required. I would make three suggestions. First, broadcast stations should be required to sell commercial timeto any purcha.ser able to pay the going rate, regardless of the content of his Ines-sagas Second, either Congress or the FCC should specify a mininnun amount of3 Colman McCarthy has reported that Anwrans stwitti candy than \"Oh Sttanr!\" Washington Post (\"Potomac rnagarine\").

I would be happy to answer any questions the committeemight have.Senator McGovErtx. Thank you very much.Mr. Choate, as you know, the broadcasting industry is under muchpressure these days dealing with all sorts of problems.They have, as you pointed out, taken some positive steps regardingthe advertising of toys, and in other areas. Is their lack of responsi-bility to your petition and the efforts of others on the advertising offoods the result of a lack of concern or is it, in your opinion, that theyjust haven't focused on that problem as yet?NOT A MEANINGFUL ISSUEMr. CHOATE. I think they have not felt the need to react. I talkedwith Stockton Helffrich, director of Code Authority, National Asso-ciation of Broadcasters, after I testified on cereals, and he said thebroadcasters said they didn't think it was a meaningful issue.As I said, 36 of the 40 cereals had been changed, so at least themanufacturers thought it was a meaningful issue.I think the advertising agencies are way behind the exhibitors inexhibiting social responsibility, and the broadcasters are even furtherbehind the agencies.I think it is time the sponsors who, after all, control the flow ofgreenbacks to ad agencies and broadcasters, started to pound intotheir heads sonic realization that if the advertising of ediblespar-ticularly to childrenisn't cleaned up, that they are going to faceregulation, and since it won't be self-regulation, it will be executivebranch or congressional regulation. So far they have gotten awaywith it.Senator McGovErtN. Do you have any recommendation at thispoint for congressional action, or do you think we should wait for s.1while?DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR ETHICAL ADVERTISING OF FOODMr. CHOATE. I could think nothing you could do more construc-tively, sir, than to call the new chairman of the Federal Trade Com-mission and ask him to reiterate what Mi! s Kirkpatrick said when heannounced that the FTC would develop guidelines for ethical adver-tising of foods. If that policy will come forth from the FTC, thenthose who advertise foods will know in advance where they risk fall-ing into the FTC clutches; then I would think we would see moreethical advertisements of food.Certainly, the petition of ACT should be made a part of that.Certainly the advertising of foods today is the advertising of cavities.Senator McGovEits. fon probably heard Dr. Mayer say yesterday that the ability of producers of basic wholesome commodities suchas vegetables and fruits, and some of the things we saw on your filmhereis very difficult for people selling products of that kind to com-pete in the advertising market with the corporations that are adver-tising snack foods of various kinds because they don't have the budget, of course.How can that situation be balanced? What, can be done to try togive greater advertising strength to these wholesome products?Mr. CHOATE. Richard Manhoff, head of an advertising agency inNew fork City, a man very much interested in nutrition, has calledfor the setting aside of 20 percent of broadcast time for public servicetype messages and programs. I think it is time that the Congress tooka look at the commercialism of the airwaves now and started to askfor some moderation and some shari'ig of public information overthose same airwaves.I do think that the producers of potatoes and peanuts and cherriesand apples do have a point. They are very fragmented.There are no IBMs or General Motors in that portion of the foodindustry. They do have very powerful trade organizations. I do thinkthat the broadcaster really has to accept the responsibility.He may not have invented the misinformation that is currentlycarried to children, but he is certainly at the confluence point wherea variety of self-serving messages end up on the air and thus misleadchildren in nutritional wisdom.Ithink the broadcaster has to grant public service time for ineffect airing of the benefits of the fruits and vegetables, so they cancome into a parity position with some of the more prepared andcoaxed and teat od foods that today are ad vei tised so heavily.Mr. WESTEN. Could I add one thing to that question?Senator MCGOVERN. Certainly.FREE TV TIME FOR CONSUMER GROUPSWESTEN. In order to reach millions of American homes ontelevision it may cost $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 merely to buy aminute of time.If consumer groups have important messages that have to be putup, these figures are out of their reach. It means some free time mustbe made available, and it must be made available on a nondiscrimina-tory basis. It can't be made available only if you don't have anythingcontroversial to say.Second, iffree time is available,television production costs a lot of money. Most consumer groups don't have the money even toproduce good television programing.What can he (lone about that?Well, to use an example, most States are imposing a gasoline tax inorder to pay for their highways. To use that analogy, we could taxadvertising to pay for the use of the airwaves. That tax revenuecould be used to fund messagescounterbalancing messages on nutri-tional and other public interest issues.Senator MCGOVERN. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Wester',and Mr. Choate.I wish we had more timeBob? 404Mr. CHOATE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to invite the committeeto note in its written transcript the testimony that I gave last Tuesdaybefore the Senate Commerce Committee, the subcommittee headedby Senator Moss, at a hearing in New York.It is so relevant to today's and yesterday's subject matter that Iwould hope people looking at this record would look back at what wassaid there and vice versa. I would hope there would be sonic cross-referencing.Senator MCGOVERN. In view of the fact we are running out of time,we would say we would check that testimony, but if we may, thecommittee would like to submit possible additional questions to you,Mr. Choate, and you, Mr. Westen, so we can enlarge on these matters.I regret we are running out of time. It would be interesting tobroach this interrogation further.I want to take advantage of this situation, Mr. Choate, to expressmy continuing appreciation for the long years and persistent effortyou have made in this whole nutritional field.I think it is quite possible this committee never would have beenborn had it not been for your efforts several years ago, and we arevery grateful that you are keeping up your efforts.Mr. CHOATE. Thank you, sir.Senator McGovEhri. Our thanks also to you, Mr. Westen, forappearing today.We have one additional panel of witnesses: Mr. George Orr, Mr.Johnson, and Mr. Semple.

ORR, JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT;ACCOMPANIED BY DANIEL R. JOHNSON, ASSOCIATE COUNSEL:AND BRUCE SEMPLE, M.D., VICE PRESIDENT, MEDICAL AFFAIRS,CONSUMER PRODUCTS GROUP, MILES LABORATORIES, INC.Senator McGovEuri. Gentlemen, we apologize for keeping youso late into the lunch hour but maybe you can hit the highlightsof your statement and we will appreciate it and be glad to see thefilm that you have. We will make sure your entire statement is partof the hearing record in any event.Mr. ORR. I am George W. Orr, executive vice president of MilesLaboratories.I am pleased to appear before this connittee, to read the statemen tof our president, Dr. Walter Ames Compton, who was unfortunatelyunable to appear due to a long standing and urgent commitment,outside the United States.I am accompanied by Dr. Bruce Semple, chief medical officer of ourNutrition and Hygiene Division, and Mr. Daniel Johnson, associatecounsel of Miles.We are appreciative of this opportunity to present to this com-mittee our views regarding the need for improved nutritional knowledgeby the American people, and certain nutrition education activitieswhich we have undertaken in order to help meet this need. Thisstatement will outline our past interest and efforts in this regard, andwill describe the current status of a program of activities we havedeveloped toward this end. 405In this regard, we will present to you some films we have developedas one effort in the particular area of nutritional education for children,part of a long-term commitment covering many aspects of nutritioneducation, which we view as an especially important objective inbringing about improvement in nutritional knowledge and the nutri-tion of the American people.There are clear indications of increasing recognition that the nutri-tional status of many Americans is considerably less than optimum,and that betterment of nutritional status, based in part on greaterpublic awareness of the components of good nutrition, can be achievedthrough combined efforts of industry and Government. Statementsof nutritional experts and others concerned about good nutritionappearing in the media, symposia, and in hearings such as thoseconducted by this committee evidence this to be the case. Suchconcern is a healthy first step in bringing about improvements innutrition. The considerable efforts of this committee in bringing intofocus the fact of nutritional need in this country merit specialcommendation.Representatives of Miles Laboratories have had the privilege ofappealing before this committee on two previous occasions. In theseearlier appearances in February and December of 1971, informationwas presented regarding the nutritional status of the Americanpopulation, the need for hnproved nutrition education, and thedevelopment and availability of products designed to improve specificaspects of nutrition, particularly with respect to the economicallydisadvantaged.MALNUTRITION PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETYThat there is a problem of malnutrition in our society there shouldbe no doubt; a problem of serious consequences to our Nationmalnutrition of both deficiency and abundance. It has shocked ninnyto learn that nutrition deficiencyboth hick of food and lack ofspecific nutrients--exists in this country. Yet, the National NutritionSurvey, and the findings of this committee, among others, 'vivodocumented the existence of this problem. In the past, there has beea complacent feeling about nutrition in this country, based on o.emisconceptionthatthe so-called\"average\" American diet will automatically take, care of all nutritional problems. With more free-dom of food choice than in any other country, Americans as a wholepoorly understand, and much less conform to, the rules of goodnutrition; taste rather than nutritive value becomes the predominantfactor in food selection.DEFICIENCIES OF VITAMINS AND MINERALSVitamin and mineral deficiencies are an excellent example of thisphenomenon. As we have testified previously before this committee,there is widespread incidence of dietary deficiency of one or morevitamins and iron, both among the financially underprivileged andthoseho possess more adequate resources. Obtaining from tablefoods adequate amounts of vitamins requires careful and intelligentselection and consumption of foods. Even for those with sufficient.resources to obtain food without economic restraint, until all are91 -861) 0-73-6 406educated as to the necessity for proper selection and consumption ofa varied dietand are willing to select, their food in accordance withsuch knowledgethese problems will continue to exist. Thus, knowl-edge of basic nutrition facts must be improved. This should be re- garded as especially important in the case of children, for whom an understanding of basic nutrition will foster better dietary patterns inlater life.Similar considerations apply to the other end of the spectrum ofmalnutritionthe malnutrition of abundance. This is a problem of overconsumptiontoo many calorieswhich leads to obesity.We, along with the British, lead the world in sugar consumptionmore than 100 pounds on the average per person each year. On a dryweight basis, this becomes about one-sixth of our nutrient, intake one-sixth which is thus totally lacking in vitamins and minerals. Alsoimportant is the problem of overconsumption of fats. Fats have more than twice the calories of carbohydrates so the fact that they representmore than 40 percent of the caloric value of our diets is a most signifi-cant factor in weight control. Moreover, as you are aware, there isnow strong evidence that saturated fats and cholesterol are implicatedi in the early development of arteriosclerosis which is involved in stroke and coronary disease. This, then, heroines yet another reasonfor the importance of better understanding of good nutrition; theneed to consume a proper balance. and amount of all nutrients: vita-mins, minerals, proteins, carboh3 dillies and fats.This subject has been covered. well by an analysis in a speech byDr. Walter A. Compton and reported in the Jan.-Feb. issue of Annaiof Clinical Laboratory Science; Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 06-77which 1 will be pleased to submit for the record.'PIONEERED IN DEVELOPING DIETARY SUPPLEMENTSMiles has a long standing association and ,erest in good nutrition, having been involved for many years in the evelopment of products designed to help alleviate such nutritional problems. We have been apioneer in developing dietary supplements of vitamins and iron; ourinvolvement with these products dates back to the early 1940's.More recently we have become deeply involved in the developmentand refinement of a variety of protein sources to supplement animalprotein. This has a twofold benefit by increasin!, the quantity ofavailable protein and, perhaps most significantly. doing so withoutbringing into the diet :-ignificant amounts of saturated fat and choles-terol as is the case with animal protein.We should, therefore, like to consider with you today in more detaila vital prerequisite to good nutrition; this is knowledge of the com-ponents of good nutrition and with it the willingness to select nutrientsources accordingly. Underlying much of the problem of malnutritionis ignorance. Therefore, improvement in the nutritional knowledge ofthe American public has for some time been a major commitment Indobjective of Miles.'I See Appendix. Part N E4A.= As Miles previously testified before this eonittnttee on Feb. 24. 1971. sponsorod a massive literature review and analysis at studies on nutritional status sinning U.S population groups reported in sewatiliejournals from 1950 through 196It This review, \"Review of Studies of Vitamin and Mineral N ntntion ut theUnited States (1950-65)\", by Thomas R.

In addition, Miles has for several years been a principal sponsor of the chair in human nutrition at tt.e Johns Ilopkins University school of health, presentlyoccupied by George C. Graham 407The interest of this committee in advertising of food products tochildren is certainly appropriate. Miles has been concerned with thenutrition of our children for many years and until last year wasinvolved in advertising on children's programing of chewable vitaminsupplements for children.WITHDREW TV VITAMIN ADS TO CHILDRENIn our promotion of these supplements, advertising ph ''d anportant role in making the vitamin supplements accepta. ! the child, once the parent had made the decision to purchase such aproduct. We became convinced last Juno, however, that continuedadvertising of our children's vitamin supplements on children's tele-vision was no longer appropriate. This determination related particu-larly to the programing but also to the number and nature of thecinnercials being aired on children's programs. Rather than riskutalermining public confidence in these valuable nutrition products,Miles withdrew its advertising from children's programing, and redi-rected its efforts to parents.For the past year we have been striving to make a contribution inthe area of children's televisionnot, however, as atcommercial sponsor, but as at contributor of material on nutrition education foruse in children's programing.We should like to show for the committee, films which reflect afirst effort in this area. Those films were prepared and produced byVivian Auerbach and Associates, Inc., of Now York, an organizationwith experience in creating instructional materials for children. Wehave adopted the strategy of using people with skills in communicatingto children in preparing these messages and have actively consultedwith other interested and knowledgeable persons to whom we areindebted. We shall continue these activities, for we are convincedthat we will be able to improve these messages in our future efforts.The films are a series of 60-second and 3%-minute presentations,including animated vignettes and live action. They have been devel-oped as public service announcements. They are entertaining as wellas informative, and are non-commercial in that they carry no productidentification.They deal with a variety of subjects such as:1. Food as the fuel for human energy.2. Vitamin B1.3. A biochemist named Casimir Funk, who coined the word\"vitamine\" to describe certain micronutrients.4. Nutrients-- , hat they are and what they do.5. Vitamin C and its importance in the prevention of scurvy.In the interest of conserving the committee's time, we have selectedtwo of the longer combined live-action/aninutted versions, and threeof the shorter animated segments.Now if we could have the film, please.[Film presentation.]The three 60-second animated messages are also integrated into3%-minute combined live-action/animated segments in the fashionillustrated by the first two films. A choice of materials is thus availablefor television airing as time permits. Miles is now in the process ofAls \"cr ... 40smaking these films available at no charge to individual televisionstations across the country.RECEPTION OF FILMS BY PUBLIC-ENCOUB WINGA problem in the development of these educational films is that thereis no convenient measure of their success. There are no sale, figures to plot in relation to these films as there is no product identified withthem.It is difficult to devise reliable evaluation techniques for this type ofmaterial when dealing with young children. To (late, a numher of people, adults, professional educators, other knowledgeable individuals.and children in several schools have seen these films on an experimentalbasis, and their reception has been encouraging. However, as we develop our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the materials andprobably of greater importancebegin to learn how they are received by the, viewer in the home, our ability to communicate meaningfulnutrition information will increase.The evalual ion of these films will also be important in determiningthe nature and scope of other Miles' nutrition education activities.Classroom use of similar materials would be one obvious example of a situation where the application of these techniques would be useful.In fact, we presently have under study classroom adaptation of thesematerials.We believe it makes good business sense to communicate basicnutrition information to children and adults. A child who is knowledge-able and interested today in good nutrition will in adulthood be more likely to practice it. While the materials presented today are withoutproduct advertising, we believe that advertising, too, is an effectivevehicle with which to convey nutritional information. Accordingly, itis our intentionand development is underwayto improve theinformational content of our advertising copy, which is directed solelyto parents, presenting the need for and value of dietary supplementsof vitamins and iron both for adults and children.The ultimate beneficiary of nutrition education, in whatever form,is the American public if, as a result, dietary habits and nutritionalstatus are improved.We appreciate this opportunity to inform the committee of Miles'interest, and activities in the area of nutrition education, and thank you for inviting us to appear.Senator McGovEnx. Mr. Orr, I want to commend you on behalf ofthe committeeyou and your associates at Miles Laboratoriesforthe leadership and imagination you have taken in this field of nutritioneducation.I think this is the exact kind of responsible leadership that the com- mittee ha.; been hopeful that other companies would take. We are mostgrateful for this report and also for your willingness to appear beforethe committee.I am wondering in view of the lateness of the hour if you would bewilling to agree to an arrangement, whereby the committee wouldsend you further questions in writing about anything we have about,your presentation today or other aspects of the program, and beforethe hearing record is closed, we will give you ample opportunity toreply in writing to those questions. 409Mr. Onn. Thank you, Senator, I would be delighted to do thatI would like to comment on what I found to be a rather surprisingearlier statement as to difficulty of having educational material used.We have not found this to be so. All we have done is offer this materialto TV stations around the country, and we have had 78 requests forit, and in quite a short, period of tune. So they see to be accepting it.Senator McCoy Etvi,Ithink thatis very encouraging. Many thanks for your appearah,e here today. Our apologies for the Intenessof the time.Mr. Onn.

STATTMICITAtTENDIXAMEDICAL S.01001..Boston, CRILDRES's TELYsISIONI believe that :all advertising directed to young children is \"deceptive.\" and -misleading\". to use the language of the Federal Trade Commission Act. becatke children normally distort reality in accordance with their own immature view of the world. This view is quite different front the adult perceidion of realit; changes rapidly as the child matures. Thus. the same advertisement is hit erimeteddifferently by children and adults. To children. normally impnisive. advertise. molts for appealing things demand immediate gratification. An advertisement to a child has the quality of an order, not a suggestion. The child lacks the abilityto set. priorities, to determine rel.tive knportance, and to reject souk, directives as inappropriate. It is no wonder that children are unable to make a mental cor- reel ion for the distortion of a piece of merelatmlise as presented on television. particularly when itis dramatically portrayed with booming voices or no-bouneers, excited child participants. mid rousing musical backgrounds. The childresponds as much to the setting as to the object advertised. unlike the adult. andk unable to separate the Mo. Thus. the real toy is very often found by the childto be disamminting. Small children aetually believe that cereals and vitaminsas often advertised lead to superior if not superhuman strength. They are unableto assess durability or sturdiness of construction from the actual appearance letalone the favorable Image presented on TX. The child cannot judge the monetaryvalue of advertised merchandise, an intrinsic and crucial part of the adult'sevaluation and consideration. They cannot ask \"is it worth the !mice?\"It is my understanding that the Federal Trade ('mumisdon Act and subsequentamendments assume that the respondents of advertising are adults. able to testleant) as adults. The emergenec of significant advertising directed fimardschildren requires new gnideline. Because of the nature of children.

Thus it is ez.vedingly important that children front as early age be taught sound nutritional practices. Televisionprograms far children cut be an important instrument in such education.At present the advertising on television programs for children stresses theopposite of good nutritional practice. Present advertising is heavily orientedtowards candies, snack foods, and other non - essential foods and there is littleor no counter-balanced advertising about sound foods which should be part ofa healthy diet.We therefore urge that you take appropriate action on the petit!ln submittedby Action for CZtildrensSzratNrgtahMedical Director. advertisement shall be vermin.

McGrathintroduced itin House of Commons April 7, 1971, and is still pushing for itsadoption.9 \"Advertisers, in my opinion, are foolishly ignoring the growing concern allacross the country and, as a consequence, are inviting government action by wayof regulation and/or legislation by refusing to reform the advertising in a veryfundamental way,\" says McGrath in a commentary written for the OttawaCitizen. He's encouraged that John Burghart, v.p. and creative d'rector of Young& Rubicon', world's third-largest ad agency, has castigated his own industry \"forthe content and approach of their advertisements directed at children.\"After his bill was introduced. says McGrath, the Canadian Assn. of Broad-casters drew 1,p a Code of Conduct governing kid-aimed blurbs, but it was vol-untary and, after a year's operation (it was put into effect Jan. 1. '72 McGrathfinds it \"has proved ineffectual, underlining the need for government action.\"He notes the Quebec government now has a billnot yet passed eitherto ban all ads that \"incite children to buy or invite them to incite others to buya product.\" He points out, though, that only the federal government can legislatenationally, so such a Quebec law, even if passed, would not affect network blurbs.KIDVID BOMBARDMENT\"Children lack the experience and judgment necessary to deal with advertis-ing,\" opines McGrath. \"And yet we allow our children to be bombarded withseductive and high-pressured sales methods, produced with subtle advertisingtechniques which create false images and illusions that can do irreparable damageto their concept of a real world.\"Many parents, including myself, find it objectionable and unfair to see theirmum inundated with extremely compelling odvertisements that are aimedindirect y at the parentthe real consumerby way of the child.\" He quotesthe Saturday Review's Robert L.

Yet every day we permit our childrento be exposed to the barrage of faddish gimmicks, tinsel toys and the fantasyland of children's television advertisements. I firmly believe our children shouldnot be conditioned to program their desires ou the basis of whichever televisioncommercial happens to be the most seductive at a given time.\" APPENDIX E[The Louisville CourierJournal, Oct. 21, 1972]PAYING FOR QUALITY IN CHILDREN'S TVA contradiction inherent in trying to produce quality programs for children on commercial television has so far defeated network efforts to satisfy discriminat-ing parents. Quality costs money but the readiest sources of money are the cereal, toy and other advertisers whose products many parents find just asobjectionable n8 a steady diet of cartoon drivel.Not that the networks have tried very hard to come up with anything thatcould stand comparison with the excellent programs aired on the ',oldie channels,Even though the influence of \"Sesame Street\"now in its fourth season hasupgraded some of the regular fare fed to children over the commercial networks.these commercial programs started from such an abysmally low level that even 414a vast improvement in quality still leaves them far short of what they could be.Parents have become more articulate and more demanding. too. in recentyears, particularly through such groups as Aeti llll for Children's Television.which has just been holding its third ammal symposium on the subject. But theFederal Communications Commis:that, which has been feeling much of the Imes-sure from ACT, is taking so long making up its mind what to do that it seemsalmost to be aiding and abetting the networks in their resistance to any change.Just the other day the FCC held yet another set of hearings, only to concludeonce again that it still doesn't know enough to make any firm decisions.What must be making a lot of people uncomfortable is that the parents arenow zeroing in on the second object of their complaintthe advertisements thatcontinually interrupt children's programs. These ads presently are allowed tooccupy 12 minutes of every hour during these shows, thought that will he cut to81A starting in January.The primary objection, however, is not the quantity of this advertising but itscontentthe messages being beamed at young children who are especiallysusceptible to the power of suggestion. It takes a very strong-minded parent toresist day after day a child's parroted requests for another sugar-coated cerealor another over-sophisticated teen-age doll (battery not included). Even someof those adults who argue tlmt finding out that one can't have all the goodiesadvertised on TV is an excellent education for 'a child will agree that theremust be better ways of teaching self-discipline.The counter to proposals that children's advertising be eliminated altogetheis always economic, since the three major networks gross nearly three- quartersof a billion dollars from these commercials. They argue. with the backing of areport commissioned by the FCC and published last summer. that if this lucrativesource of revenue were cut off the networks might have to drop all children'sshows.Yet, as ACT spokesmen argued when the FCC report came out. its studystarted from the premise that present methods of fivancing commercial tele-vision for children are the only possibility. Alternative wayssuch as imageadvertising rather than the selling of a particular product, or underwriting bylarge corporations such as happens with some public TV programs apparentlyare being exp:Dred in a second FCC study. not yet finished.It may be that the FCC is stalling until this report is ready. But both it andthe networks can be sure that the issue is one that won't be filibustered to death.The networks won't be allowed much longer to have it both waysturning outtrashy fare for children while raking in millions of dollars in advertising rev-enues from these same programs. APPENDIX F[The New York Times. Dec. 3. 10721ISN'T IT TIME WE PUT THE CHILDREN FIRST?By Joan Ganz Cooney 1When we consider alternative nethods of financin.: children's television. it isimportant to keep in mind where the money is coming from now. We and ourchildren are supplying it.All the toys, dolls, candy bars and packages of breakfast food that we or ourchildren purchase, supply the money that buys the advertising that pays forchildren's TV on commercial stations or networks. You pay for \"Sesame Street\"and \"The Electric Company\" in part through your tax dollars, and you pay for\"Cartoon Corner\" when you buy products advertised on TV.Direct costs aside, the indirect mitts for a commercial program are incalculablebut enormous. They range from our children's bad teeth to a warped valuesystem and the possible psychic damage that is done to hundreds of thousands ofour youngsters who are urged to buy and to own what their parents cannotpossibly afford to get them.It seems to me, then, that we must simplify the 'mile. The first thing we mustdecide is whether or not we are going to put the interest of our children first. If1 Joan Gans Cooney Is president of the Children's Television Workshop. producer of\"Sesame Street\" and \"The Electric Company.\" She gave this address at a recent YaleUniversity symposium sponsored by Action for Children's Television. 415we answer that question with a resounding yes. then everything else. imitatingthe question of alternative methods of finaneing. will fall into place.We, as a tidal society. put the interest of our children first, then we are led to the ineseapalth conelusion that it k terribly wrong to be pitching products- -ewer high-quality. worthwhile !flotillasat the y g.

The hardsell to children should be stopped.If. in this fantastically wealthy country of lairs. this means less commercial TV programing for our children. then so be it.

Maybe fewer but better pro-:moms would be a blessing. Maybe the roof wouldn't cave in if all the localcmumercial TV stathms out there felt they no longer could afford to broadcastmostly identical late-afternoon reruns, of dubious quality, aimed at children.But 1 do mit believe that the issue will divide this way. The men who lead our major corporatitak and who run our television stat and networks are. on the whole. .decent people. Their problem is that they are so caught up in themoney - making gamut' that they can no longer see the forest for the trees.

And then there are st l men and women who are just so venal they cannot think straight on any issue.But our job your job is to rapture the nMidle ground of corporate Americaand win them to the position that the hard-sell of products to children is wrong.1 believe this can be done.Many enlightened corporations are already well aware of the power of institu-tional advertising that brings- important programs to the public without anyor at least with a minimal sales pitch. All across America even small corpora-its are plating up the money for \"Sesame Street\" and \"Electric Company\"chewing at other than regular hours. At the lugit ll ing and at the end of eachsegment they are given credit for this mlerwritins. To my kLowledge. none ofthe leadership of these comp.aties has gotten into any trouble with their stock-holders. nor do any of them feel they are wasting their money.The networks and local stations st also make flair rontr,bution. perhaps by special rates for the institutional advertiser and by the re :al of children's !rogramo... from the profit center of broadvasting.The re.questimi is : Can up afford not to begin?

The youngest group of all, \"the earlythrees,\" was putting together individual serving cups of a cereal-based snackmixture.Tiny fingers added raisins and peanuts, one by one, to a mixture of unsweet-ened, fortified oat and wheat dry cereals. Some of those ingredients were sampledalong the way, too.The open house activities were the culmination of a 12-week course conductedat the center by Elaine Rose Ruderman to encourage the teachers to get thechildren cooking, enjoying new flavors and thinking about nutritious foods.Mrs. Ruderman is with the Cooperative Extension of Cornell University here.She gave training sessions each week on a different cooking theme for teachersfrom each of the six classrooms at the center.The following day the teachers had the children perform the same techniques.make the same snacks or dishes, learn why the food was good and then taste itto see that they even liked it, too.Many of the 90 children bring a candy bar, which is the only food they haveuntil lunch. Regulations require that the children be served a balanced and nutritionally-adequate noon meal. but it is difficult to get some of them to eat it,according to the center's administrative director, Norma Sepulveda.About 60 per cent of the children are Puerto Rican, many of them raised onethnic dishes, and many of the lunch foods are unfamiliar to them. The directorrecalled one Chinese boy who would eat only when rice was on the menu.The children are introduced to new foods and the meaning of such words asstir, slice, spread and smell. \"Every child can succeed in this,\" Garnetta Chain,the educational director, said. \"They eat their mistakes, too.\"During the sessions the children have made peanut butter and butter fromcream and found what fun it can be to cut raw vegetables into shapes. They wereused as dippers and to make open sandwich faces.A group of -PA year olds worked together the day of the open house preparingtheir own lunch.

KIDVID REIWI. LIONBy Margaret EntlishCommercial children's television is Perfectly ghastly, as anyone who has a child and a TV ,et knows. Every Saturday morning from S a.tit to1 p.m., the netttrk, theycall It), of of sock() fast cub- and dynamiteaction sequences that little kid, arc supposed to just love.A conole of years ago, the net wtirk, ea% ed in to adult criticism and cut down onthe cartoon violence. As one vice president in charge of children', pnwgra ttttt ling(Kidvid VP) put it, \"We don't show Mighty Mouse raping and pillaging any-more.\" But mayhem still prevails in the form of adventure and chase cartoons.Monsters and villains still abound, often in the form of racial stenotypes thatwouldn't be tolerated on adult programs.As if the shows weren't bad enough, 16 commercial minutes are allowed duringeach Kidvid Incur, as opposed to ten for prime time. That means that more than25 percent of your kid's Saturday morning tube time' is spent watching Non-menials. For about nine months out of the year, cereal is the biggest item, mostof It the sugarcoated variety, the least nutritious of the maker's line. In the fall,4.\" 4.4418the cereal ads give way to toy commercials in order to crank the kids up for theChristmas bonanza. This is where the real money is. In fact, the networks sellyour child's attention at a higher per-minute rate during the pre-Christmasseason. So:ne local stations that don't even carry children's programs during therest of the year rent a bunch of cartoons for fall just to cash in on the toy trade.What do all these hour:3 of commercials do to kids? Their job, for one thing.Kids believe commercials. Any vitamin that's good enough for Fred Flintstoneis good enough for them. They want the stuff they see advertised, and they nag,cry and carry on until they get it. But what happens then? The dancing dolldoesn't move all by herself its the ad suggested. GI Joe bombs out on the livingroom rug, and the kids turn cynical.Despite the cynicism, however, the young retain the deepest concept expressedin every commercial airedthe notion that you will be a happier, better, moredesirable person if you acquire, apply or ingest some product. No personal prob-lem need be endured for long. No need to be lonely. Barbic Doll will keep youcompany. No need to be little. Vitamin-enriched bread will build you up. Ourminds and bodies are nothing but machines that something off the shelf can repair.Is it any wonder that the first TV generation is also the first in which thousandsof middle-class kids have sought to obliterate their problems by turning to drugs(products)?By 1968, three ladies in Newton Centre, Mass., were mad enough to do some-thing about the TV sell game. Over their kids' shrill chorus of deninndg for TVtoys, Evelyn Sarson, Peggy Charren and Judy Chalfen sat down and actuallywatched the kiddy shows, and there was damned little on the tube they wantedtheir kids to see. Most programs, they felt, were no more than attention-gettersfor the hard sell. Some seemed to be pure sell. No one could tell when the RomperRoom lady stopped teaching the kids a game and began shilling for the RomperRoom line of toys, without which, incidentally, the games couldn't be played.The ladies, calling themselves ketion for Children's Television (ACT), wentafter the Romper Room folks and as -cured the producers of exploiting their kids.Business is business, replied the Rem-):>.r Room gang, and told the mothers to shutit off if they didn't like it. ACT took their advice.Realizing that they would have b. go in er the heads of the Kids id producers,ACT went to the FCC with a petal( n for three new rules for children's television,calling for no commercials on kids' shows, no mentioning of products by brandname on kids' shows and, finally, 14 hours a week of commercial-free children'sprogramming as part of each station's public-service requirement.To everyone's amazement, the FCC agreed to consider the proposals and in-vited the public to submit comments. \"The public,\" naturally, meant the broad-casters, since the FCC has no real way of soliciting opinions from you and me.ACT decided to help them out.ACT had been brought into the limelight by the FCC's response to its petition.With each new press notice, the ladies from Newton Centre struck more livenerves in Kidvid-plagued homes. Letters and donations arrived from all over.The ACT ladies wrote back with instruct:ons on how to file a fernial commentwith the FCC. 13y July, 1971, the Commission had heard from over 60,000 people.The networks and advertisers poor-mouthed, sidestepped and -meated. Not thatthey expected the rules to be adopted, but they saw the move as a sign of moreaggressive attitudes by the traditionally easygoing Commission.Prodded by ACT and the FCC, and pulled by Sesame &reef.- ratings (yeah,Sesame Send) the Kidvid VP's started kicking around a new concept that mightjust get them off the hookEdvid. By upgrading kids' .howl, they could arguethat commercials wele a necessary evil to be endured for the sake of culture.Suddenly it was Responsibilityland, and the Kidvid VP's were tripping all over eachother in their search for meaningful, sensitive, creative, educational children'sprop ams.Next season, each network is highlighting a new Edvid showTake a GiantStep, NBC, Curiosity Shop, ABC, and You Arc There, CBS.

Afterail, as one network official said, \"A kid comes home from a hard week at school,and he doesn't want any more education. Ile wants to relax and be entertained.\"So three hours of Saturday morning Edvid will be surrounded b'y 12 hours of thesame old relaxing, entertaining Kidvid mayhem. But a start. Furthermore, the networks promise a softening of hard-sell ads and fewer kid-show ehara^' I. 419(live or cartoon) shilling for cereals, vitamins and toys. It sounds promising, butthe industry is ki iii for its promise. If Edvid doesn't sell, it's back to Dastardlyand Manley.In the meantime, ACT %%ill be keeping up the pressure with the aid of a $164,000foundation grant. We can help, the ACT ladies say, by refusing to buy any toywe use advertised on TV and letting the manufacturers know it. (This isn't ashard on the kids as It sounds. There are lots of good unadvertised toy, around,and they're cheaper.) Also, we (tan teach our kids to be selective viewers. Witha little encouragement, they can develop a taste for good shows and lemn to rejectworthless ones. We might even try setting an example by refusing to watch adultjunk. Finally, we too can nag the FCC and the networks. The ACT ladies alonecan't go on fighting for our kids forever. CHILDREN'S HOURBy Joseph MorgensternFor a couple of decades, criticism of children's TV centered on violence. All thoseshihotings and beatings were tabulated and quite rightly declared excessive. Untilrecently, though, critics and scholars were blind to one of the most potent instru-ment:: of violence the medium turns on children, the TV ounmerciad. Not a %%ord,in academie studies, about the violence c(Onmercials may do to a child's capacitfor trust Not a %% ord in Congressional hearings of the iolence they may do to a child', intellectual development. Now we're beginning to get some research on t hatsubject too, and the early results are fascinating. While they confirm our orstsuspicions of what commercials do to kids, the data also debunk our most %%idelyheld notions of how kids react to a message from the sponsor.The most dismaying, though not necessarily the most surprising, discovery of astudy just completed at the Ilarvard Business Selv.,.1 convents kid,' faith in whatthey're told by Saturday-morning TV advertising. As early as second grade, chil-dren indicate \"concrete distrust of commercials, often based on experience withadvertised product.\" By fourth grade they have \"distrust for specific commercialsand 'tricky' elem( nts of commercials \" By sixth grade they show \"global distrust\"of all e(munercials except piddle set-% ice an1)(ninceinents.CYNICISM\"MoppPl:. Found Cynical,\" reads the headline of a marketing newspaper'sstory on the research, which was supported by the National Inst Mite of 'MentalHealth and the Marketing Science Institute. That may not be quite accurate. Achild', mistrust may not yet be hardened into cynicism. What's noire, this partof the research was based on a very small statistical sample, a fact that is stressedby Scutt Ward, the I larvard Business `dine( professor %% ho directed t he study. \"Ifthese preliminary result, hold up in further interviews, as they seem to he doing,\"Ward says, \"then there really is a trend toward cynicism somewhere around thesecond to t he fourth grade. Still, %%e need a much broader sample, and we needmore money to achieve it.\"Another part of the study does have a liniader sample, lumever, and its etmeln-,ion. should put an end to the indinhir fiction that kids like the commereials evenmore than t he programs. \"All children exhibit a drop in attention when a commer-cial is shown,\" the study says (italic \"compared to prior attention to pro- graming, and attention continues to decrease during later commercials in aseries.' This drop was most tinmonneed for older children, those bet ween I I and12, but it existed for all eluldren in the study. Disinterest and mistrust simplyincrease with age until \"a picture emerges of older children Jaded to commercialexposures, paying less attention to them, and making fewer comments aboutthemespecially positive comment..\" What's to be made of this? Should we bepleased with our progeny for developing such an early mistrust of !nicks ttcrs andturning them off so ellieiently? Ti the emit nay, I think we should Inc appalled t hatthey're being lied to, incessantly and systematically, by t he most infinential teivherm their lives. RAGuanOn the surface, a reform movement seems to be sweeping children's 'I'V. 'FileFCC is looking into program content, and commercial policy. l'he FTC ha, put astop to a few of t he most flagrantly deceptive toy ad.. A $1 million study of violence in children's programs will be released this fall by the U.S. Surgeon General's office. The networks are pursuing their own violence studies, and better children's shows are promised for next season. Some stations already have increased their children's schedules and reduced the number of commercials within them. A fe%% broadcasters are also experimenting with clustered commercials that appear be- fore or after each local program rather than within it.In TV, though, reform usually means a slight mending of incredibly ragged ways. The new children's programs may be an improvement over the present ones, but there'll be so few of them, and so many reruns, that Variety has alreadydubbed it \"the shortest TV season in the world.\" The F IC can't possibly keep up with sponsors' indifference to truth and disregard for children's mental or physical health (there's a big push on now for a breakfast food with chocolate and inarr.h-mallows in it). And the networks are perfectly willing to go along with t hose solemn studies of violence, so long as they divert public interest from the far more crucial issue of commercials. Children's programs represented about $75 million in net- work revenues last year, according to Broadcasting magazine. That's almost halfas much as the networks took in from cigarette advertising before that gold minewas closed down.No one could have predicted a few years ago that cigarette advertising wouldbe eliminated from TV. Yet it was, and now its equally urgent to eliminate alladvertising from children's programs, as an influential citizens' group called Action For Children's Television has been urging the FCC to do. Eliminate it, not reduce it or cluster it. (The clustering fad is doomed at the outset: advertisersare bound to catch up with the significance of the Harvard findings that kids piteven less attention to commercials at the end of a cluster than those at the begin-ning.) No compromise can be reached between TV that tries to sell things to kids and TV that doesn't. Either we respect a child's vulnerability or we don't.RonoTsThis assumes, of course, that we want our kids to grow into something more than wily purchasers who've learned from bitter experience that life is one big eon, that everything ties into everything else out of mutual greed, not mutualneed. Commercials do teach children certain \"consumer skills\" in a crude, in- efficient way. The Harvard study 'rroborates this. But the study also suggests that American kids are far less tempted than we've thought by glowing picturesof goods and services. They seem to be resisting the role of acquisitive robots.If they must learn consumer skills, let them learn in an intelligent, efficient NS ay from child-oriented programs. For the rest, let them be free to pick up all the informa- tion and delight they can find without fear of booby traps. The proper number of commercials per children's hour is none. FROM ROBERT B.

We have become accustomed tothink of the malnutrition of nutrient defi-ciency and starvation as problems uniqueto the economically and technologically de-prived countries of the world, where themalisons of overpopulation, famine, disease,ignorance and apathy have been acceptedmore or less stoically as the heritage ofman.

Yet, the Citizens Board of InquiryReport' and the report of findings of theNational Nutrition Survey berme the SenateSelect Committee on Nutrition and HumanNeeds= have documented beyond questionthe broad scope of the problem in varioussectors of the U.S. Malnutrition, because itcan have so many manifestations,is insidious and in its more extreme forms infilets harm not only on the individual hut,where widespread, can do damage to themoral and economic fiber of the nation.When one considers that, at two years ofage, the growing child has achieved fiftypercent of his physical stature and muchmore than that of his neurological and cere- 423 bra! equipment, the tirgewy of an earlybeginning of good nutritioa is.pparent.A defective structure laid down at this timeas a result of undermarition will ha mostserious and even irreparable consequences.Recently, Krumdick has cited malnutri-tion as a major factor in the developmentof our urban slums.' As a consequence ofmechanization of agriculture, the consolida-tion and disappearance of family farms, theemphasis on cash crops and single speciescultivation, nutrition has suffered amongonr rural populations. In turn, there hasbeen a mass migration from rural areas tothe cities in the quest for \"better\" livingconditians. Over thepast twenty years,from one-half to tweIlion people percar have moved from the farm to the city,taxing the living space, schooling and ancil-laryfacilitiesof the urban connnunitiesoften beyond capacity. As Knimdiek states\"No other single factor affects the shim in-habitant as adversely as malnutrition. In theadult, it lowers his working capacity andmakes him more susceptible to disease andless capable of tolerating the physical en-vironmental insults or physiologic demandsof pregnancy or lactation. The children whosurvive face the tragic fate of being lessendowed because they either suffered ir-ieparablc brain damage early in life or losttheir opportunity for receiving an educa-tion due to frequent illness or because ofhaving spenttheir school yearsin thelethargy of the undernourished. Because itaffects the health and productivity of theinhabitants. a poor diet constitutes a keyfactor in the perpetuation of shuns. Onlywhen a reasonably good level of nutritionhas been attained can the slum dweller con-cern himself with the secondary matters ofimproving his surroundings. \"'The effects of undernutr:tion on the in-fant and the young child can be devastat-ing. In its severer forms it can lead todeath. Overt undenaitrition can prodneephysical and mental impairment, markingthe individual life. In its more covert form,we find the child with shortened attentionspan and reduced learning capacity. eventhough there be no detectable mental im-pairment. The nutritional stateof themother is an important factor in maternalillness, fetal deaths, reduced survival ratioin premature infants, neonatal deaths andin infant morbidity.Traditionally, dime has been a com-placent feeling about nutrition in this coun-try, based on the misconception that theso-ealled \"average\" American diet will auto-matically take care of all htritional prob-lems. Until recently, this misconception hasbeen perpetuated in many of onr medicalschools and gosernmentiq agencies. For ex-ample, the Food and Drug Administration.- a few year% ago, proposed a regatationwhich would lequire this statemen'. on thelabels of xitaminmineral snpplements:\"Vitamins and minerals are supplied inabundant amounts by the foods we eatExcept for persons with special medicalneeds, thereis no scientific basisforrecominending ioutme use of dietarysupplements.\"This is based upon the false piemise of an\"average American diet\" arrived at by di-viding foodstuffs consumed by population.Such \"average\" diet does not exist. is notpractical, nor xi/mildit be acceptable. Iam reminded of the man who drowned ina river whose average depth was three feet.With more freedom of food choice than inany other country, Americans, as a whole,poorly understand. and much less conformto, the rules of good ,s aition; taste orcaprice, rather than nutritive value, havebecome the predominant factors in foodselection.While final estimates of the incidence ofhunger and malnutrition are still wanting,she preliminary findings of the recent Na-tional Nutrition Survey' under the direction 424 of Dr. Arnold Schaefer leave no doubt asto the magnitude of the problem. While theSurvey deliberately concentrated on areasof lowest income, it also involved familiesin the middle income groups Clinical, bio-chemical and dietary factors were involvedin the assessment of nutritional status. Bio-chemical studies arc concerned with themeasure of tissue concentrations and uri-oary excretion of nutrients which may notbe sufficiently low as to have producedclinically overt disease. Tit,: nutrients ofwhich I speak include vitamins and min-erals which are intimately involved in themyriad of enzyme modulated biochemicalprocesseswhich continuallytakeplacewithin us. Low biochemical findings in theabsence clinically overt disease are in-dicative of an \"at risk\" state of healthi.e.continuing failure to &An proper diets.Under such conditions the introduction ofstress (e.g., infection or trauma) may leadto overt disease.Dr. Schaefer's study, to date, has shownthat in one state as many as five pc:centof children under six years of age had clin-ical signs associated with previous VitaminD deficiency; that is to say they at one timehad rickets. Almost five percent cf the chil-dren studied show winged scapula, pot bellyor bothsigns of protein-calorie malnutri-tion. Five percent of subjects have goiterevidence of iodine deficiency. According tothe World Health Organization criteria, thislevel indicates thatgoiter, a disease wethought we had eliminated thiity years ago,is endemic in our population.One-fourth of the children under six yearsof age have hemoglobin levels in the umacceptable range. Unacceptable levels ofVitamin A were found in fifty percent ofthe same age group. Vitamin C levels wereless than acceptable in ten percent of thosesurveyed.Fifteen percent of the children in theundernourished population studied at thepovertylevelareretardedinphysicalgtowth, their mean height per age being fiveto fifteen percent less than that observed inwell nourished populations. There was ahigh prevalence of low birth weightlessthan five poundsranging up to a\u00bb inci-dence oftwentypercent among poorgroups Other studies by the U. S. Depart-ment of Agriculture comparing householdfood consumption data in 1965 as arainst1955 indicated that the nutritive v due ofdiets has been declining rather tb m im-proving over the last ten years. ,lespitethe rise in medium incomes over this periodof time.'During the hearing begun in 1968 bythe Food and Drug Administration on\"Foods for Special Dietary Uses,\" a largeamount of survey information was collectedregarding the nutritional status of variouspopulation groups. In connection with thishearing, we commissioned Arthur D. Little,Inc., to conduct a literature search andanalysisof studiesofnutritionalstatusamong United States population gronps re-ported in the medical literature from 1950to 1968. The reviewers also sought to iden-tifythosesex,age and socio-economicgroupsamong whichvitamins /mineralsmalnutrition was found to exist. This re-view' revealed that from 31 percent to 57percent of all individuals examined haveconsumed diets which were not sufficient tofnrnish the recommended amount of themicronutrients considered, which includeVitaminA,thiamine,riboflavin,niacin,Vitamin C, calcium and iron.At a recent appearance before SenatorMcCovern's Select Committee on Nutritionand Human Needs ,6 I noted the importanceoffurnishingadequa:clow-costmulti-vitamin supplementation to the disadvan-taged, such as the three million Americanswho are still receiving their food throughthe Department of Apiculture's Commod-ity Distribution Program and the 8.2 mil-lionchildren now participating intheSchoc: Lunch Program, who receive one 425 gpd, well-bal.nmeal on the days theyarc :It school, but whose parents may welllack the knowledge or financial ability or,sadly. the initiative to provide them withcomparable meals at home.Forourdisadvantaged,andindeedeqnally appropriate for all our population.the availability of a rationally formulated,low-cost vitamin supplenurnt provides themost efficient and economical way of delivering these mieronutrients at least untilsuch time as we have reached that idealstate where all our population has sufficientresources to purchase table foods withouteconomic restraint; where all are educatedas to the necessity for proper selection,preparation and consumption of a varieddiet ands perhaps most difficult, where theyare willing to do so!As aspecific illustration, consider theSchool Lunch Program. The basis of thisProgram, the Type A lunch, is designed toprovide about one-third of the day's nutri-tion and includes about one-third of therecommended daily allowances of the es-sential vitamins and minerals. The childrenreceiving these lunches are in school atmost five days a week through nine monthsof the year, thus, the School Lunch Programsupplies only about onesixth of their totalnutritional needs. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the food in the Type Alunch will reach the table with the vitaminand mineral content still intact, or that thechildren will eat all of the food in the lunchonce it is on their plates. It seems obviousthat tiny LunchProgram. as itis now con -stituted,cannot alone insure adequate vita-min and mineral intake by the children par-ticipating in it.A vitamin-mineral supplement to theType A lunch, in place of concern for ran-dom and more expensive vitamin reinforce -mnent of the various food staples, couldeasily and cheaply be supplied and couldguarantee delivery to the children of notjust one-third but rather all of the essentialsr micromstrientsin the sceommended dailyainomits. Thus, if the rest of their diet slip-plied adequate protein and calories. wecould he a great deal surer than we arenow that these children: are adequatelynourished.By using the supplements to assure micro-nutrient intake, the schoollunch meal plan-nerswould gain economic fiesibility suchthat more than 95 percent of their hard-pressed budgets could be mate availablefor such expensive dietary content as high-quality protein, so important to growingchildren.NIaluntrition of .UnoulaneeLet us look now at the other end of thespectrum of malnutrition the malnutritionof abundance. Generally.overm ranuptionis a problem of too many calories whichleads to obesity about which you haveheard so much and which affects almostforty percent of our population. We leadthe world in sugar consumptionmore thanone hundred pounds ',n the average foreach person per year. Ott a dry weightbasis, this becomes about one-sixth of ournutrient intakea sixth which isthustotally lacking in vitamins and minerals!lint probably and generally much more im-portant is the problem of overconsumptionof saturated fats. First of all. fats have morethan twice the calories of carbohydrates,so the fact that they iepresent moue thanforty percent of the caloric value of ourdiets is a most significant factor in weightcontrol. Moreover, saturated fats -Id choles-terol have been strongly implicated in the-rematurc development of atheroscleroticvascular disease and particularly coronaryheartdisease. Accordingto the ExecutiveBoard of the World Health Organimtiont,\"Coronary heart disease has reached enor-mous proportions. striking more and moreat younger subjects. It will result in coiningyears in the greatest epidemic mankind has faced unless we are able to reversethe trend by concentrated research into its-ause and prevention.\"The corrosion of the inner surfaces of themedium. and large-sized arteries of thebody by the accumulation of various fattymaterials, such as cholesterol, phospholipidand triglycerides, forms plaques obstruct-ing blood flow to vital tissues. While athero-sclerosisis one of the expected conse-quences of advanced age, its prematureoccurrence in persons under 65 years ofage is increasing at an alarming rate andis the major cause of death in this country.The National Health Survey of 1960-62estimated that 3.1 million American adultsaged 5 to 79 had definite coronary heartdisease and an additional 2.4 million hadsuspect coronary heart disease, togetherrepresenting about five percent of this agepopulation. It was further estimated thatpremature coronary heart disease, occurringin Americans under age 65, affects almost1 8 million persons. while an additional 1.6million have suspect coronary heart disease.'One cannot help but reflect upon theseemingly remarkable increase in incidenceof coronary heart disease in the post 50years.In1918 when the electrocardio-graphic changes of myocardial infarctionwere first described, it was regarded as souncommon that \"most medical students andhouse officers never heard of the diseaseduring the period of their clinical train.tug. \"' Even consideration theadvances in pro-fessional acumen in its diagnosis in sub-sequent years, the demonstration of increas-ing incidence in subsequent decades hasbeen regarded by most as a real phc.nomenon and not a mere \"statistical mirageproduced by increased knowledge and moreaccurate diagnosis of coronary thrombosisand changing fads in medical nomencla-ture.\"'The facts arc, according to the Report ofthe Intersociety Commission for Heart Dis-ease Resources,' that each approvimately one million persons in the U. S.sufferter a myocardial infarction or suddery heart disease death. There31300 deaths due this causealvadditional 200,000 succumbtoof major arterial vessels inraer pof the body. Approximately165,000 of the coronary deaths occur in per.sons under age 65, men outnumberingwomen in ratio of 3 to 1. We are told thata male citizen of the U. S. has about onechance in five of developing clinical two.nary heart disease before age 60, principallyin the form of myocardial infarction. Mostappalling is the fact that about 25 percentof those who esperience a first prematureheart attack die %yid& three hours of theonset of symptoms, all too often prior tohospitalization and before medical care canbe obtained.The United States has the dubious dis-tinction of ranking second on' to Finlandand Scotland in coronary heart diseasedeaths, with a rate of 354 such deaths per100,000 populatIn contrast, the coronary heart discas, mortality rate in Franceis 74 per 100,000 and 1 per 100,000 inJapan, while that for England and Walesis 254.'The precise etiology of atheroscleroticvascular disease remains to be defined and.of course, is multifactorial, involving genet:and multiple environmental factors. But,over the past twenty-five years, numerousrisk factors contributing to coronary heartdisease have been identified, such as habit-ual diet high in saturated fat, cholesteroland calories; elevated levels thepast le months, the Intersociety Commis-sion for Heart Disease Resources, a groupof biomedical scientists representing thirtyof the nation's medical and sciNnific socisties, has issued a report on the urgency of 427 the problem.' The Commission concludedthat the three major risk factors associatedwith coronary heart disease are diet, ciga-rette smoking and hypertension. Of these,our habitual diet, characteristically ladenwith cholesterol and saturated fats, andoverabundant in calories, dcly lb of majorconcern. As recently the AmericanHealth Foundation's Committee on Foodand Nutrition,' data' from the U. S. De-partment of Agriculture indicate that in thepast half century the American diet hasundergone significant evolutionary changeswith increased consumption of meat, poul-try, dairy products and refined sugars anda concomitant decreased use of cereals,potatoes and other starchy foods. It is of particular interest to note that even re-cently there has been a significant increasein the proportion of calories derived fromfat from about 30 percent in 1\" 30 to about43 percent in 1970.Because of the urgency and magnitudeof the coronary heart disease problem tonational health, the Commission \"recom-mends that a strategy of pnmary preven-tion of premature atherosclerotic diseasesbe adopted as long -term national policyfor the United States and to implement thisstrategy that adequate resources of moneyand manpower he committed to accom- plish: (1) changes in diet to pievent orcontrol hyperlipidemia. obesity, hyperten-sion and diabetes, (2) elimination of smoking, an-1 (3) pharmacologie con-trol of elevated blood pessure.\" The Com-mission recognized that we cannot wait thenecessary ten years it would require forthe results of long-term trials to prove theefficacy of various interventions, particu-lary diet modification, on the rates of pre-mature atherosclerotic di3tases in the U. S.and has recommended that \"safe and rea-sonable\" changes be made immediately toachieve a low-saturated fat, low cholesteroldiet for the American population.The Cor nission hasfurtherrecom-mended that the food industry be encour-aged by the medical profession, the govern-ment and the general public to make majorrevisions in food processing to reduce fatand cholesterol content by: (1) producingstrains of animals that convert higher pro-portions of feed to protein rather than fat,(2) use of cows that produce large amountsof high-protein, low-fat milk, and (3) thefurther development of high-quality pro-tein products of vegetable origin.'As a member of the food industry, andthrough its Worthington Foods Division,Miles is heavily involved in the rather newtechnology of textured vegetable proteinsas :neat analogs and meat extenders. Withthe growing food demands of an increasingpopulation and the shrinkage of farm landarea as a result of urhanizaticn, there willbe growing need to devote farm land andlabor to their most efficient use. Signifi-cantly, from an economic standpoint theconversion of vegetable protein into texturedproteins foods suitable for consumption isfar more efficient than conversion into ani-mal piotcin. A grazed acre of land eau pro-duce 58 pounds of animal protein, but ifthe same acre is planted to soy beans foruse in textured protein food, it will yield508 pounds of vegetable protein.'\u00b0 By vir-tue of a rapidly developing technology, pro-tein from various vegetable sources may beefficiently employed to make high protein.microntitrient-fortified, fabricated foods lowor free from cholesterol which simulatebeef, swine and fowl meats as well as cer-tain scafoods in flavor, texture and physicalappearance, affording high nutritional valueand economic advantage to the consumer. I am of the firm conviction that there canevolve from such developing technologyeffective and economic solutions to the direproblems of protein scarcity among themore grossly disadvantaged peoples of theworld and the development of major newprotein sour -es for us all.

Melody*Chapter VIITOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY IN CHILDREN'STELEVISIONI. PUBLIC INTEREST AND PRIVATE INTERESTSThe foregoing analysis has pointed up how the differences in primary objectivesbetween the economic criteria of profit, and the social criteria of children's needsand desires ha created a fundamental conflict of priorities across the entire struc-ture of the broadcast industry, its institutions and tneir operations. As \"publictrustees,\" broadcasters are charged with performing in the public interest. Accord-ing to regulatory law, the public interest takes precedence over the broadcaster'sprivate economic interests. \" It is the eight of viewers and listeners, not the right ofbroadcasters, which is paramount.\"Although this principle is clear in theory, in application the broadcaster mustmake a continuing series of trade-offs between hK own private economic interestsand the public's interests, as he interprets those interests. It can hardly be sur-prising that he almost universally inverts the order of prio ..:ties between privateand public interests. Indeed, that is why the FCC was created. Supposedly un-encumbered by the constraints of a vested personal financial interest, the Com-mission is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the socially beneficialtrade-offs between the public and private interests are made.Until the present time, in the area of children's television the trade-offs betweenthe public interest and private financial interests have been left to the industry.The analysis of earlier chapters has shown that within the industry, the funda-mental decision makers for these crucial trade-offs have not been the broadcaststations, which are under direct regulation by the FCC, but the broadcast net-works which do not have the same public interest responsibilities imposed on themthat are imposed on the stations. Thus, in the areas of decision making thebroadcast stations are not masters of their own fate. The real center of power formanagerial discretion lies with the networksinstitutions that do not have theformal obligations of public trusteeship. Trade-offs between public and privateinterests by broadcast stations in children's television become ancillary to thosemade by the networks.The record of performance in children's television by the networks indicatesthat they have not treated children's television as a unique public interest re-sponsibility that would require them to deviate from their profit maximizingbehavior. This is so even though the networks have substantial monopoly powerover both programming and broadcast station relations, power which in otherindustries occasions close government scrutiny via the antitrust law and/ordirect regulation. Similarly, the great majority of broadcast strttions, althoughseverely constrained in their options by the overshadowing presence of networkpolicies and practices, have not recognized children's television as a particularpublic interest responsibility that would require deviation from their profitobjectives.In contrast, the ACT petition to the FCC reque-ts a complete reversal of decisionpriorities, establishing the criterion of the needs and interests of children as thecontrolling purpose of children's television. The petition claims that the economicinterests of the broadcast industry diverge substantially from the interest of the*Associate Professor of Communication Economics, University of Pennsylvania. Phila-delphia. Pa.(429) VV. child viewer and concludes that the latter can never be served appropriately as long as children's television is being supplied in response to an athertiser supported market. The FCC must now consider the scope of its regulatory discretion indetermining an appropriate public policy response on the issue.II. THE ISSUE OF CHILDREN'S TELF:visioNThere arc two quite distinct aspects of the children's television issue. The firstaddresses the problem of potential harm to the child from such things as aggressiveadvertising techniques directed at the child and violent children's programs Thesecond aspect addresses the positive side of the issue by questioning tne respon-sibilities fur developing constructive children's programming in accordance withonly their needs and interests. But even this distinction does not fully clarify thespecific dimensions of the children's television issue before the FCC.The issue of protection from harm is not that children should be insulated fromexposure to any and all advertisaig on television. Clearly, children ahvays haveand always will be exposed -to advertising. The issue is whether children should beprotected from being isolated as a specialized audience for the specific purpose ofapplying pinpoint and tailor-made advertising directed to their particular children's vulnerabilities. The point to be conside is not whether children should be permitted to observe and grow up in the telt,. .ion advertising game as played by adults. Rather, the question is, should children be protected from being singledout an the most vulnerable and aleable target for direct attack by televisionadvertisers?Similarly, it should be clear that the focus of concern is upon children and notthe advertisers of children's products. The protection of children from directadvertising would require advertisers on children's programs to modify theiradvertising programs. It would not deny them the opportunity to advertise else-where, as do many producers of ehildren's poducts.On the programming aspect of children's television, the issue is not simply thatthere be some planned pogranuning based solely on the needs and interests ofchildren. We have already gone around comn..!reial television to obtain some such services on public television. The point for consideration is whether the specialpublic responsibilities of the comercial_broadeasters and their enormous com- mand over the viewing audiences of the nation warrants the development andimplementation of a program of children's television designed to meet the needsand interests of children.The special treatment of children has been clearly recognized in the law sincetime immemorial, and recently, by the television network-3 and the advertisingindustry. In a press release describing its Fall 1972 season offering for children,CBS stated: \"Children. They are our most precious resource. When they are entertained creatively and instructed with great care and imagination, all ofsociety benefits.'' The A,sociation of National Advertisers, in formulating guide-lines for commercials on television aimed at children, said it recognized thatchildren are a special group of viewers and that television plays an importantrole in their development. The guidelines, adopted by the ANA July 6, 1972, are based on principles the advertisers' organization considers mandatory in com-municating with children.The pronouncements, of course, follow on the heels of the FCC Notice ofInquiry and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which stated, on this point: ... there arc high public interest considerations involve d in theuse of television ...in relation to a large and important segmentof the audience, the Nation's children. The importance of thisportion of the audience, and the character of material reaching it,are particularly great because its ideas and concepts are largely notyet crystallized and are therefore open to suggestion, and alsobecause its members do not vet have the experience and Judgmentalways to distinguish the real from the fanciful.*Recognizing that children require special public interest consideration, I becomes apparent that children need protection from being singled out as a market and specifically manipulated in pinpoint fashion for the financial benefitof advertisers and broadcasters. Most of the claimed abuses of children's pro- gramming and advertising have arisen precisely because the industry has becomeincreasingly efficient at specialization in children's programming and advertising.The segmentation of the child audience was created to permit a more directFederal Communications Commission, \"Notice ofInquiry and NoticeofProposedRule- making \" Docket No.19142,Jai..29. 1971. 431exploitation of the vulnerability of children. Thus, one cannot view the creationof new approaehes to children's programming such as age-specifie programming, asnecessarily beneficial to children. If classifications arc based upon considerationsof profit and market exploitation as they usually are, one can almost certainlyexpect :theses to appear. In fact, the segregation of children's markets for adver-tiser exp' 'Ration may be much worse than having no children's programmingclassifice on at all.The Itsitive side of the coin recognizes that there is a responsibility for creatingelan ittttions Of children's programming on the basis of the needs and interest ofehillrI. That such classifications should be used on the eommercial broadcastsyste. as opposed to the public system recognizes that public broadcasting hasnotilly met the special needs of children It recognizes that the commercial cyst al has much broader exposure to the public at large and vast numbers ofchi' .ren will be watching commercial broadcasting anyway. Most of the Nationhaaccess to the counnercial broadcast system and is well used to viewing thee.nnercial channels, while only limited numbers of the population have accessthe public broadcast system. Moreover, the commercial broadcaster hast.efinite public service responsibilities which he cannot ignore nor leave for publicbroathasting to assume.The is4ne of children's television, then, conies down to: (I) ensuring that childrenare not singled out on the basis of advertising market criteria for pinpoint adver-tiser exploitation. and (2) ensuring that children are singled out for specialprogramming on the basis of their own needs and interests. This, in turn, raisesthe crucial question: can the3c objectives really be met within the framework of anadvertiser-based commercial broadcast system?IIIAFORECAST UNDER EXISTING ARRANGEMENTSAlthough children's television is currently an issue of high visibility on thepublic agenda, one is naturally led to question both the permanence of the problemand the dm-ability of the active public that is taking interest. Now that theissues have been exposed, can we expect some elf-correction within the next fewyears? Can we expect industry to realize that it must modify its private financialinterest NOineWhat to reflect the public's interest by placing childn n's televisionhigher up on its public interest order or priorities?The nature of market developmei within the broadcasting industry indicate that the trend toward specialization in children's programming, as wellas other demographically Jet ermined specialized classifications, will not only continue but also will become much more sophisticated. Indeed, this is the waythe market system is supposed to work. As the total market grows, it becomeseconomieal and profitable to begin creating specialized market classifications thatcan he tailored more closely to the requirements of each classification of eustmners.Children's audiences represent such a classification which enables particular kindsof advertises to get direct aceess to those audiences without having to go throughthe filter of a larger mass audience.Television broadcasting is now just entering a phase of market developmeitthatwill lead to substantially increased marko. specialization. In children'sprogramming, this means the programs and adv isenicnts win be more effective in exploiting the vulnerabilities of children in pinpoint fashion. Consequently,inure complaints against its harmful effects can be expected. The greater thedegree of market and submarket specialization in children's television, the greaterthe exploitation of children, and the more serious the public concerns will tendto be. If the public interest is identified with the prevention of pinpoint advertiserexploitation of children, then the eontinned pursuit of specillization of cli'ldren'smarkets will lie directly emit rary to the public interest under the existing industrystructure and regulation. Content diversifieat ion ind age specificity, each impor-tant to ehildren's interest groups, will be created, bat the purpose v;11 be to permitmarket exploitation. The children's classifications will be based upon the ad% er-tiser's interests rather than the child's.Moreover, the ,conomic realities of this trend make it unlikely that it will beeasily modified by good intentions or self-regulation. The specialization era inchildren's television is just beginning and already ha, had an enormous payoff.The latest and most sophisticated information gathering and analytical techniquesare already being employed for the purpose of identifying new, potentially profit-able market segmentations. There is substantial evidence that continued marketsegmentation has a great future in children's. television. .o 432The substantial profitability from specialization in children's television virtuallyguarantees that the broadcast industry will follow this h. As time passes, the financial sacrifice that would accompany any decision t.., forego the specializationalternative will continue to increase, thus making it virtually inevitablz that thebroadcasters wil pursue this path of development.If the FCC elects to take no action on the children's television issues before itnow, it appears inevitable that the presently operative economic forces in theindustry will work to make the problems more serious, and bring on the day whenthey must he addressed. Yet, as time passes, it is :ikely that the profitability ofchildren's shows will continue to increase, considerations of short term financialconsequences will become more important, and the difficulties of coming to gripswith the problem will become even greater. Hence, the time and circumstances formaking public policy on children's television would seem to be better now that,they will be in the future.IV. THE RANGE OF POLICY OPTIONSIn approaching public policy on the children's television issues, the FCC couldlimit its attention to the protection of children from abusive advertising andprogramming practices, or it could address the entire question, including the needfor programming responsive to the needs and interests of children. Thus, the FCCcould take a narrow view of its public interest responsibilities and simply addressthe issue of \"potential harm\" from advertising to children. Or it could address theissue of the public interest responsibility for affirmative standards for positiveand constructive programming directed solely to the needs and interests of chil-dren. These issues, in turn, could be addressed in one of three basic ways: (1)encouragement of self-regulation within the industry; (2) FCC imposed regula-tions within the existing industry structure ; or (3) FCC policy directed to re-solving the issues outside the existing industrial strta...ture.Extension of the self-regulation approach would simply amount to exhortationto the industry that it do better. Self-regulation is supposed to exist already over abroad range of industry policies and practices. But all evidence indicates that itonly works, if at all, for very shot periods of time when no significant financialinterests are at stake. The National Association of Broadcasters (N AB) is supposedto be a focal point of self - regulatory power within the industry, but it functionsvery poorly in this respect, providing no compulsory membership, no member-ship accountability, and no effectivt :;anetions. Moreover, with the substantialfinancial and profit interests in children's programming, self-regulation in chil-dren's televi.,on would be doomed to failure before it began. An FCC decision toplace hopes for improvement on self-regulation srould result in no appreciable change in existipractices or priorities. Perhaps a one season well publicizedflurry of activity would mark the zenith of the public policy issue before practicesreverted to the trend.Alternatively, the Commission might choose to impose standards designed onlyo protect the child audience from the undesirable aspects of children's program-ming and advertising. However, these rules would constrain bioadeasters fromfully exploiting their profit potential. Such rules would be running directly counterto the economic interest of the firm, and therefore subject to frequent violation.Moreover, it is doubtful whether the Fr \" could effectively pollee such standards.In similar fashion, any FCC atten.,,.. to take affirmative action to enforcestandards requiring a positive p:ogram of children's television directed to thechild's interests would run directly cc, miter to the economic interests of thebroadcasters It would also raise important problems of FCC monitoring andpolicing. The commercial economic incentives would remain; the broadcasters andnetwork,: would be fully aware of all financial opportunities that were being deniedthem; and the basic determinants of programming decisions would still be marketconsiderations.Finally, the Commission might remove children's television from the existingeconomic structure any the economic incentives of the industry b3 disallowingall advertising directed to selling products to children, i.e., all advertising exceptfor institntional ads. This could prevent harm to child television audiences, but itmay also prevent a sizable portion of children's television from being shown atall for lack of financial support. In like manner, a positive program for improve-inen t of children's television would run into the same obstacle of devising a systemof financial support to replace direct advertising rel. enues. V. REMoVING 1'EI LVISION FitOlt THE COMMLItcl U. MARKETThe external financ.4g option is the only alternative open to the Commissionw here it would not have to attempt t get the broadcasters to eompronue,or redirect their pm, ate pursuit of profit through sales of commercial advertising.Many analsts of the problem have eon chided that it mould he the mot de,irablealternative were it not for the itectunpan3 Mg financing problems w Well couldmean a loss of existing levels of children's programming.'!'bete are two fundamental concerns about extenial financing. The fir,t is whatthe tin:mend mipact on the broadcasting indu,try would be [loin the loss utrevenue', and the second is from where the sources of funds for program financingmight come. In ins recent stud3, economist Alan Pearce looked briefly into these questions, concluding that within the existing structure of the industry, therevenue losses from children's programs would be substantial and that institu-tional advertising and underwrit mg seemed to provide no ready supply of financialresources to assume the costs of supplying children's programs..FIN iNEI U INIFACT ON THE EXISTING 11110 inc 1ST STItUrTUItEThe financial impact of any major change on the existing broadcast industrydepends largely on the tone period over which that change would take place.When viewed in terms of instantuneous changes, consequences may be enormous.When viewed over a time horizon of planned change, the consequences are notonly much less severe but also frequently what initially was feared as detrimentalto a firm may ultimately turn out to be beneficial. A considerable part of the fearof the consequences of change stem from the relative uncertainty of eh: ,4enit eomparison with ti'- relative stability of existing arrangements.It must, be emphasized that the Pearce model simply performed static revenuecalculations where the only chat.,,c was the quantity of revenue lost from theremoval of advertising from existing network children's television. Moreover, themodel assumed that the change to external financing would take place instantane-ously, thereby magnifying the consequence of the change upon net work profit-ability. Pearce recognized that if demand elasticity ,the response of advertisers to reduced supplies of advertising minute., and possibly higher advertising rates,was taken into consideration, the revenue consequences would have been muchless severe.Adverse profit consequences would he minimized even further if all potentialcost savings relating to promotion and sales were considered. Approxi:oately 30per cent of broadcast expenditures are for promotion and sales commissions. Mostof these costs would disappear if children's television were taken out of the com-nercial market. Moreover, the networks have a unique capabilit to adjust theirto changes in revenue in order to maintain desired profit margins.' And whenomic consequences of the passage of thin are considered in the analysis,yea...ear revenue growth and the opportunities for market adjustment becomefactors easing the revenue, cost and profit impacts of change. Experience wouldindieate that the profit consequences of lemoving 'advertising from children'steIe ,sion could lie substentially mitigated by market adjustments.However, what is most important is that the acceptable level of financial im- act can be used as a bencliznark for determining the necessary time period overwhich the change in financing methods can be p:ntsed in.This is shown in the following illustration.I See, eg, Powers. It. and Onneubeba, \"Is TV Columbia .Journalimn Review, may/June. 10. Reven434 PHASING IN STRUCTURAL CHANGE B'M' 0,123456Years In the above illustration, point A represents total broadcast revenues for year\"0\", the year before a shift to external financing would take place. The curve A-Asrepresents the anticipated trend in revenues under existing institutional arrange-ments for supplying children's television. The NI-Ms curve represents the mini-mum revenue level that the FCC decides that the industry or individual firmsmust maintain to continue to operate ;it any predetermined level of financialhealth. If ar instantaneous adjustment is made for the change to external financ-lig, revenues would decline to doint \"B\", which is below the \" M\" curve. On theIntsiN the instantaneous comparison it would appear that the change to externalfinancirrg,would be unfeasible and therefore an unacceptable alternative decision.However, if the change is implemented gradually over a period of several years,the annual impact in any one year is only a small fraction of its impact upon in-stantaneous adjustment. Thus, with a five year phase-in period actual revenuesmight become curve It-Its on illustration, substantially above the minimum ac-ceptable revenues. Whether a phase-in period of I've years, three years, or eightyears is adopted is Immaterial to the basic issue. What is crucial about thisanalysis is that the number of years can be varied in accordance with particularcircumstances. Moreover, the phasing period can be contracted or extended on thebasis of experience in the early phases. And it could be applied at t ne level of theindustry or of the individual firm. It would be possible for example to apply differ-ent phase-inperiods fordifferentfirmsoperating under different market eireamstanees.Applying this type of analysis, the decision maker is seldom faced with the con-straining alternative that the change to external financing cannot be accomplishedbecause of economic reasons. If the decision mater. conclude that adverbsing tochildren should not be permitted on commercial television. they can adjust theeconomic consequences to the affected firms over time by means of a phasedstrategy of itnplementation.It must be recognized, of course, that the economic consequences of a change inthe economic structure of children's television will affect more firms and industriesthan the broadcast networks and stations. Advertisers, agents, syndicatorsand producers would be affected also. But here again, the process of adjustmentto the new financing arrangements can reflect a sufficient time period for transi-tion. Clearly, these entities do not have financial interests as great t he net works and stations; for virtually all firms the financial impact can be expected to be rel-atively modest, especially when it is recognized that most Vrnis have acceptablealternatives.Although one could al tempt to estimate the financial impact on each segrentof the industry, the limitations of existing data arid the infinite set of no.sibleassumptions that would be used would tend to make the precision of such forecastsa focal pAnt for debates on the children's television issuo when they should notbe. There will always be differences in the assessment of the economic impact upondifferent affected institutions. When it is recognized that the FCC can bothdevelop a phased strategy for Implementing change, and monitor actual changesand modify the rate of implementation of change as time passes, precise forecastsof consequences become irrelevant to the fundamental children's television issues. 435Economic impact is a factor to be considered in the design of a program for policyimplementation. It is not a factor that constrains the policy options available tothe Commission.4B. ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCINGRemoving advertising from children's programming addresses the issue of pro-tecting children from the harm of pinpoint advertising directed to children.However, an affirmative policy of developing a minimum quantity and quality ofeluldren's programming directed to meet the needs and interests of childrenrequires cons, It:ration of the problem of alternative sources of financing. Thepotential alternative sources of financing must come from such sources as insti-tutional advertising, underwritirg or government. Here, too, forecasting the re-sponse of these institutions to the fituoicial requirements of children's televisionis uncertain at best. The people directly involved who would have responsibilityfor influencing such decisions are hesitant to attempt to predict their reaction tothe changed financial environment in ch:ldren's television.Whether external financing can be obtained for children's programming willremain a highly uncertain matter until it is attempted. Institutional advertisingis a widespread practice by United States corporations, but only a small proportionof their advertising budgets are devoted to it at present. In children's television,Health Tex Inc, is the outstanding institutional advertiser, spending $1 millionper year. Although the amounts of institutional advertising are gradually in-creasing over time, itis impossible to forecast the potential response < f institu-tional advertising to children's television opportunities under a changed N:temof financing. Potential institutional advertisers point out that they may well beinterested but their interest will depend upon the particular circumstances, theprogram, the prestige and other incentives that surround their support of qualitychildren's programming.Underwriting support for ehildren's programs is in much the same position asinstitutional advertising. Although the amounts of program underwriting havebeen increasing in recent years, there is no reason to expect underwnters to assumerespomr for children's progri mining. TImever, it N reasonable to assume thatunderwriters would part napate in the financing of children's television to a signif-icant degree. The extent of their participation, however, is likely to be determinedlargely by the circumstances surrounding the new children's television operations.Ifitwas prestigious and high quality, underwriter support could be fairlysubstantial.The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) andother federal, state and local government agencies spend substantial amounts ofresources on children's educational films annually. To the extent that childienprograms under the new arrangement can satisfy the needs of these variousagencies, as they should if they are directed to the need, of children, additionalfinancing sources could be uncovered. But he e too, one cannot forecast theirpotential participation with any degree of e tainty because so much dependsupon the nature of the children's tele .:sion programming that evolves under thenew arrangements. It is clear, howevei, that the potential for attracting financingfrom institutions, underwriters, government and other source- is there if the newprogram structure is established properly and inordinate demands for funds are notrequired immediately. The practical problem is whetlwr the funding potential canbe tested without making an irrevocable decision to alter the struetnre of children'stelevision.By adopting the phasing procedure outlined above for providing the requirednear term financial pioteetion for broadcasters, a step plan can be devised to testthe teasibilitv of phasing out, advertiser financing of children's shows and phasingin sources of external financing Although the phasing structure would be basedupon a long rain plan through complete conversion to external sources, the programcould be established, at least initially, as an experimental one. The FCC couldmonitor developments at least through the initial stages to see if suffici it( fundingwas forthcoming from external sources. If it was not, the Commission could slowdown the rate of change to the new structure with a minimum of inconvenience forall parties Moreover, the Commission is always free to review its policy at anytime.This experimental approach has a unique advantage in that it gives those whohave been requesting alternative sources of financing an opportunity to come upwith the resources. In the event that they do, the structure of children's televisioncan be changed so as to respond directly to the interest of children. In the eventthat they cannot obtain sufficient financing from external sources, alternativeattempts to remedy the existing problems in children's television could be pursued. 436VI. A PLAN FOR CONVERSION TO ALTERN VrIVE FINANCINGThe development of a plan for converion to alternatixe financing arrangementsfor children' television must eonsider many interrelated factor, The annual rateof invest ment in children', programming depend, upon the quantity of children',programs desired and the time period over which a library of quality children'sprograms i. to be accumulated. The greater the quantity of new program,, and theshorter the tune period over %%hieh they can be accumulated, the greater i theannual rate of investment required. Although one can set objeetke, for fundraking to achieve a given program inventory level, the in% entor of ehildren.,programs will grow at the rate that funding k attracted.However, it is important to recognize that there is an existing inventory ofquality children's programs. We are not starting from scratch. Moreover, as %%0have previously noted, children's television in particular does not become out-dated easily and the audience is continuously changing as children grow older.Thus, the same characteristics that make children's television economical underexisting economic conditions can make it economical under a system of alternativefinancing. For example, age specific programming would be valuable for periodicreruns indefinitely. The fundamental difference would be that the programs andtheir many reruns would be programs designed for the needs and interests ofchildren rather than advertisers.An initial step in the implementation of an affirmative program for developing\"quality\" children's television would he an assessment, of existing programmaterials and the classification of an inventory of acceptable 'migrants. Such anassessment is required not only as part of a program for establishing qualitychildren's television, but also as part of a program to protect children from the\"harmful\" characteristic, e.g., violence, of bad progrannning. As earlier chapterspoint out, some of what, is generally acknowledged to be the worst kind of pro-gramming is shown as children's television simply because its rerun costs are verycheap. As funding is attracted for the production of new children's programs, theestablkhed inventory of \"quality\" programs would be increased.Programming eosts during the first several years under the new arrangementswould he difficult to estimate because at least some development cots aoeiatedwith the change in production arrangements would be involved. And even thoughthe cost per showing may ultimately be lower than existing program costs, thefinancial resources for production are needed at the front end of the programcycle. A. a point of reference, we know that existing ctuninercial children's pmo-grams cost on the order of $123,000 per hour for program runs of about, 20 half-hour Individual segments. Children's Television Workshop produced 7'he JmI OneCompany at a cost, including all background research and preparation, of ap-proximately $8 million for its first 100 half-hour shows, or $100,000 per hour.Sesame Sim( 1 costs approximately $3 millam for 1(1(1 one hour shows, or about $31,000 per hour.If we use a liberal figure of $125,000 per hour as the upper extreme of whatwould be necessary for production in the first few years for program run, ofabout 30 hours per year, the mumual prograat costs would run about, $3.5- $4.0million per hour of weekly children's television. However, if CTW's SesameSire( I example is used as a inore probable guide to costs, annual production costswould run only about $1 million per hour of weekly children's television. Thu,it seems cleat that a program of alternative financing for children's televisionproduction could be established with a few million dollars to begin the first stepin a phased programthe substitution of one hour of existing commercial lul-dien's programming with new non-commercial children's programming directedto the needs and interests of children. As more funds become available and addi-tional programs are created, nu re ho irs can be substituted until t he desired leveland kinds of children's programming arc achieved. Once this state of maturityof program development is reached, fin:ming equirements will diminish some-what as new programming needs are limited to the continuing replenishment analreinvigorating of an existing level of satisfactory programs.In the supp4y of children's television, there are other costs in addition in pro-gramming that mkt be incurred These ate essentially network coordinatiou,telsignal transmission and broadcast station cost,. (70ordination of net-work distribution of non-commercial television is a function that could be verycostly if it had to be e,pecially performed for a few hours of child,-en's program-ming. And it can readily be performed by the networks, as it Is today, at minimum costs in their established system already devoted to continuous networking. Inlike manner, the cows of transmitting the television signal to broadcast stationswould bu minuniz,a1 if the signals were delivered as part of the network's coil- tinning broadea,ting operations. tots, performance of these functions couldprovide a contribution of the networks to the supply of children', prognonmingunder the new arrangements. The contribution Of the broadcast ,tation, wouldbe the air time over which the 'mignon,: were broadcast.Both broadcast station and networks should 1w permitted or encouraged tocontribute to the financing of programming In fact, since ehildren's televisionwould no longer be a part of their public service responsibilities, financial contri-butions by stations might be encouraged or required as part of their pubbe ,ervicere,pon,abilities by the FCC. However. programming deekions inu.t not be madeby ,tation,, network, or sponsoring financial eontnbutor,. An onport ant part inimplementing ,uch a plan would be the development of a structure of ,epan.tedeckionmaking entitle, to make programming decisions that refleet deliberationof the needs and interests of children under the new structure.A, a point of reference plan, a planning horizon of five to seven years couldbe adopted for the phasing out of advertising to children. Nece,,ary lead timesof six months to a year to establish a program under the new arrangement:would be necessary. A four to eight step procedure for transition would permitgradual and controllable change. In the first ,tep, one or two hours a week ofehildren's programming without advertising could be introduced; Perhap, onehour of programming by each network for a national audience, and one hour ofprogramming by local stations, drawing the programming from both new pro-gramming and the existing inventory of acceptable children':, programming. Ex-patkion of children's programming under the new arrangements could proceed aseircum,tanees permit---primarily the rate of thumping of new programs.

CoNcLusioNThe purpose or4his chapter has been to develop a framework for addressingthe issue of children's television. The issue has been narrowed to the imrposesfor which children arc elassified as special. They need protection from pinpointadvertker exploitation. They require special programmo- -1.,rected to their needsand interests.Under exktiug institutional arrangements for the s of commercial chil-dren's television, the presently operative economic fol., in the industry willtend to make the problems of children's television worse. From the range of policyoptions available to the Federal 0(anniunhations Commissom, the externallinancing option has the greatest probability or success. A phased plan along thelines of the point of reference plan described above appears readily manageableand feasible. The details of an actual plan for implementation are, of course,subject to dehaie and modification, What is most important, however,thatthe plan be a complete one designed to meet whatever objective, of children'sprogra\u00bbnag that are specified by the FCC as :t matter of polio. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ORAL HEARINCS ONCHILDREN'S ?resident of Action for Children's Television, and withtoe is Evelyn Sarson,ACT's Executive Director. We are here today representingmany people who aren.issing from these Oral Arguments, people who have triedto make their voices heard at the FCC, who have tried to express their concernsabout what television is doing to their own children, and whohave urged theFCC to act in this small and specific area. These people are the viewers, thepublic, the mother at home with three children who turns on the television atlive o'clock in the afternoon to find her local station is running horror cartoonsinterrupted by children's commercials. Itis the teacher in the classroom whohas to deal with the qaestions and fears of pre-schoolers who have seen stereo-types, monsters and murderin the.,,prognaus they watch.And it is theconscientious parents who select a children's TV special for their children towatchonly b. find it on at 8 or even later in the evening and (a+iitn: long pastthe Add ren's bedtime.

We have,however, two additionai indications of the incredible public concern over thisissue of major importance in the lives of children growing up in America today.The first is that many national organizations concerned with children haveasked to participate in these hearings. The American Academy of Pediatrics andthe National Conference ofChristians and Jews have submitted statements. TheAmerican Oroup Psychotherapy Association, an organization of 2600 mentalhealth professionals, sent the following letter from Jay IV. Fidler, M.D., President,to the FCC on December13, 1972:Gt:NerbintRN: The American Group Psychotherapy Associatio-iis composed of 2(100 licensed psychiatrists, psychologists, psychi-atric social workers and other mental health professionals.As agroup, we are interestedin adoption of the followingrules andguidelines to govern all television programs for children:1.

Commercial TV rates the mighty dollarmuch higher than this nation's children.A quote from a Washington, D.C. mother:The sad thing is that the FCC has been so unresponsive for so longto complaints about children's programming . .. Onehas thefeeling that it is a Commission composed of commercial television'nterests and not for the public.A'.4 both parents of a 4- and an 8-year-old said in their response:The problem with this quiz is that only concerned parents willanswer it and their children arc the ones you have to worry leastabout.Television critics have written of the outrage of children's television; thousandsof parents have voiced their concern; and major organizations with membershipsin the multintillions have demanded change. And what has been the response ofthe broadcasters?Well, the National Association of Broadcasters has met to consider the problemand has brought forth, with considerable fanfare, their solutions: the maximumnumber of commercial minutes on children's television programs from 7 a.m. to2 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday has been cut from Ili minutes to 12 minutes, asof January 5, 1973. Even as a first step (and there is no indication that the NABconsiders this cut a first step) this change is minimal. Where is the protection of thechild on Monday through Friday? Why, when the NAB sets up Saturday andSunday morning as \"prime time\" for children, do they permit two and a halfminutes mote per hour of commercials than they allow for adult mime time?What a strange way for the NAB to solve the problem of over-commercialism onchildren's television: Their new rules seem to help the clutter-conse;ous advertisermore than the child.The NAB has also ruled that hosts on children's programs shall not sell. This iscommendable ... indeed itis part of the Rule Making we are emc.idering heretoday. But who will make sure that Code stations adhere to this rule? And willthe 40% of TV stations which do not belong to the Code also stop host-selling onchildren's programs?It should also be pointed out that misleading advertising to children hurts low-income families far more than others. In a pilot study by Daniel YankeloviehIncorporated on \"Mothers' Attitudes Toward Children's Television Programsand Commercials,\" a group of mothers in Denver, Colorado, discussing this prob->m, agreed that the toy manufacturers make Christmas time unbearable forthem. One mother stated that commercials: \"...give children a purchasingpower they shouldn't have.Many times they make the parents feel guilty . . .*\"In a letter recently sent to the Commission in reference to this docket, Repre-sentative Patsy Mink of Hawaii clearly expresses the concerns of those who careabout children.Tb' first rulethe most important. It states, \"There shall be nosponsorship and no commercials on children's programs.\" To me,this is It fundamental moral issue and should be decided not on eco-nomics but on principles of social responsibility.Our entire broadcast license system is based on the fact that thesewho utilize the limited facilities of broadcast communication owe itresponsibility to the general public. There is no more important asegment of the public than children, insofar as the impactforbetter. or worseof broadcasting, particularly where television ii ml otlo full denture.

We must therefore bedoubly cautious in our regulations governing this aspect of licenseeperformance.Despite efforts by advertisers to avoid adverse effects, proposedRule Number 1 should be adopted. The basic principle of attempt-ing to sell commercial products by influencing young children iswrong in concept. No matter hoW cleverly or skillfully presented,vertisements are intended for a purpose that is incompatible withthe needs of children at an early stage in their development.And what is being aired on children's TV programs this year? Some innovativeshows arc on. ABC is airing a once-a-month after-school special in the afternoon,CBS has been running children'S news specials and NBC originated a daily half-hour pre-school program which-will now be aired on weekends only. Some localprograinS provide diversitY, andlithit or-cluster commercials. But theie arc theexceptions. ACT has monitored the network season and asked its contacts aroundthe country to watch as well. Disap-pointment-at the lb* calibre of the program=ming and anger at the incredible barrage-of selling has been the general response.Writing, in Variety, _Bill Greeley described the heartless, charmless, tasteless and artless.\" RonPowers of the Chicago Sun Times described the new network schedule as \"a giantstep backwards.\" And many independent and UHF stations are still running theviolent super-hero cartoons removed from network TV because of the publicoutcry. In a full color ad in last month's \"Broadcasting\" magazine, WarnerBros. Television advertises:SUPERMAN/BATMAN/AQUAMAN IN ANIMATIONOn the CBS Television Network, over a period of four seasons,69 episodes of super-hero _anifilation dominated their time periodswith impressive rating. These exciting episodes include THE NEWADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN (34 half-hours), AQUAMAN(18 half-hours) and THE NEW ADVENTURES OF BATMAN(17 half,hours).2Warner Brothers does not seem to believe that self-regulation will change much.The National Association for Letter Broadcasting, which publishes an annual \"Guide to TV Viewing\" for i...rents, described \"Superman cartoons\" irresponsible fare for the world's youngsters.Threadbare plots, unsuitable values. Children deserve better. First aired on CBS.\"The Association of National Advertisers, which will be speaking here tomorrow,has adopted Children's Television Advertising Guidelines. As an indication ofjtist how seriously the ANA meant these guidelines to be taken, they neglectedto put in any mechanism for enforcement. There are no penalties for any kind ofinfractions, nor are any checking or monitoring procedures suggested to ensurethat advertisers adhere to the guidelines.Many broadcasters have said to us that while they agree that it may be un-desirable to sell to children, without commercials they would be unable to airany children's programs. ACT commissioned 1)r. William Melody to examinealternative methods of funding children's television programs on commercialtelevision. In conjunction with the release of his study, \"Children's Television:Eco lllll Wes and Public Policy,\" Dr. Melody stated last week that children'stelevision programs on commercial television could be aired with no commercialsin livz to seven years, without financial hardships for broadcasters. According toDr. Melody's study, while last spring's study by Dr. Allan Pearce of the FCCconcluded that ACT's proposal to eliminate children's conunercials would resultin it serious financial loss to i.il three nttworks, the Pearce study did not considerchanges in the existing broadcast structure for children's programming.Dr. Melody states that:\"When it is recognized that institutional change does not haveto take place instantaneou sly with cataclysmic ecoromic consequences,it become; clear that policy makers can phaie in the new policy atwhatever rate they find most compatible with tee public interest.Thus, whatever economic constraints exist, they become factorsthat modify the speed of change and not factors that preclude thefeasibility of change.\"2 \"Broadcasting\" Dec. 4, 1972. Dr. Melody's study points out that during the early years of television, nearlyhalf of the combined network offerings for Children were presented without com-mercials. In 1949, for example, 42% of children's programs were aired withoutadvertising sponsorship. Today, program decisions are IT scie on the basis of whichprograms will attract the largest share of the audience available during specific-hours. According to Dr. Melody, children's television is broadcast not when it ismost convenient for children or when the largest children's audience would beattracted, but rather when children's television provides the greatest commercialadvantage over alternative programs at that time.ACT, as you well know, has propoSed that.children's television be regarded asa public service area; to be shown without commercials. Many commercial stationsdo not agree with this philosophy: Yet, in:the -peSt three years, an increasingnumber of commercial stations have been airing five -hours. _a week of five hours a week of qualiq': children's-programming-sithout com-htercials. These are the stations that-luive managed to persuade the Children'sTelevision Workshop to let them air the pre-School-program \"SeSame Street\"daily on a commercial station in an are% where there is no public television station.The Children's Television Workshop ; s a Strict contact for the program which ensures: (1) no commercials or sPoitbo. :hip- Within or adjacent to the program;only noncommercial announcements are permitted; (2) underwriting credits cantic only` a simple statement without descriptive comments. Underwriting is per-mitted by CTW and a station may use a phrase such es \"Sesame Street wasbrought to you this morning as a public service by Sinith'S Store.\"In a conversation with a representative of WBR7-TV, a commereill station inBaton Rouge, Louisiana, the following became ceident. The station sirs SesameStreet from 9 to 10 a.m. Monday through -Frida)=7 52 Weeks a year, without anycommercials. The air time is contributed-by the station. The station pays about850.00 a program plus $10.00 mailinglee. Since November 23, 1970, WBRZ hasbeen airing the program, which is getting good ratings. WFMJ-TV in Youngstown,Ohio, has been airing Sesame Street, Monday through Friday, since November,1970, when the program first went on the air. It is aired 52 weeks a year, from9:30 to 10:30 a.m. and since the station is a UHF; their rates are lower than thoseof the Baton Rouge station, totaling some $12,000 a year. The station estimatesthe cost of the air time donated to the program is about $250.00 an hour of ClassC time or $1,250.00 a week. The station receives no contribution towards thecost of the program from any underwriter and the ratings show a substantialaudienceof-young children.Oise stipulation of the CTW contract, with stations is that if a public TVstation opens in an area, \"Sesame Street\" is automatically transferred to thepublic TV station.In many rises, stations do not run any other children's programming and do nothave funds or facilities for developing children's programs. One program managersaid: \"It's difficult for a local station to invest large_sums of money in children'sprogrammingcertainly it costs us less to buy \"Sesame Street\" from CTW thanto produce an hour a day of our own children's programs. I feel it's best for themoney for children's TV to go to one central place where the program can be pro-duced with the right kind of research and the top quality people making it sothat you know it's going to be a good product. We just don't have those kind offacilities locally.\"Dr. Melody's study and the experience of Children's Television Workshopwith commercial stations have proved that what ACT is asking ;or is possible.It is possible for a commercial TV station to run children's programming without,commercials.It is possible to attract a sizeable audience for quality children's programs.It is possible to phase in a new policy for children's television at a rate com-patible with the public interest and the bmadeaster's interest.--And.it is possible to change children's television from an area of ntajor concernin this country to a creative force in the lives of children.The responsibility for regulatory action rests With you, Chairman Dean Burch,Mr. Benjamin Hooks, Mr. Nicholas Johnson, Mr. Robert Lee, Mr. H. Rex Lee.Mrs. Charlotte Reid, and Mr. Richard Wiley. NEWSPAPER ARTICLES [Miami (Florida) Herald, Sept. 15, 19721NEW STEPBACKWARDSBy Ron fot children has taken a giant stepbackward this year. And the backsliding occurred just a season after things hadstarted to look so promising.In 1971, spurred by the activism of Action for Childten's Television, the suc-cess of Public -TV's Sesame Street, increased pressure from the critics and byominous rumblings from the Federal Conimunioations Commission itself, the threenetworks significantly upgraaed the quality of children's programs.Knowledge.--oriented shows, featuring real people, began to replace the cheap-slick formula chase cartoons. ABC's Curiosity Shop. NBC's Take a Giant Stepand Mr. Wizard, CBS' You are There and In The News all of the contributedto heightened value for small viewers on Saturday mornings. The ruthle.ness ofhard-sell cereal and toy commercials was checked, and everyone glowed.But television's inipulges fot voluntary public - spiritedness last about as long asa child's attention span.Ratings=Which the networks swore did not influence their commitment to thenew, experimental showsapparently have brought us all back to earth.The new children's season is business as usual at the crowd - catching cash register.Five of the six new NBC programs are cartoons. (A sixth animated show,Underdog, returns to the air after several years' absence, and NBC has changedthe title of the live Take a Giant Step to Talking With a Giant.)All five of CBS's new offerings are cartoons though one of them, Fat Albertand the Cosby Kids (11:30 a.m.), features appearances by Bill Cosby, whoemphasizes a learning point in the show; All four of ABC's new shows are animated.Undeniably, the violence level is far below what it was a couple of seasons agoin the new cartoons, and many of them make passing attempts to distributeshorthand enlightenment. NBC's Sealab 2020, for instance, will tell vour kid howlong it will take him to decompress after a deep-sea dive, and ABC's Kid Powerdeals with prejudice in ethnic neighborhoodi.But basically- the new shows are slick entertainment wrapped around flashytoy and cereal ads, and are a poor substitute for just about anything a young childmight elect to do on his own.There is one new kids' show, however, that stands below all this. For sheeraudacity in dragging the stylized avarice and frenzied greed of adult game 'howinto the realm of children, it deserves a special pedestal in the dustbin of themedium's most shameless enterprises.It is called Runaround, it is on at 10:30 on NBC, and you probably should watchit once just to sec how far television is willing to indulge its own fascination withmaterialism.The host is Paul Winchell, the ventriloquist, and the contestants and liveaudience are all children. At the start of the program the nine contestants come,charging out to their places as their names are called, brandishing both fists overtheir heads like a Lilliputian horde of hopped-up pillagers.The familiar gameshow organ reaches a crescendo in the background, andWinchell, twitching his black mustache gleefully, bleats: \"Are you all ready toplay Runaround?\" Yaaaatumutah,\" oozes, \"because we have somegreat prizes for everyone.\"The idea is that Winchell asks a question that has three possibt7, answers. At asignal, the nine kids go racing across the floor to stand in front of a number thatcorresponds to their choice for the correct answer.But the road to consumer- success isn't that easy, as the young recruits soonfind out: to enjoy most fully the fruits of greediness, one must learn to use du-plicity and deceit against one's rivals.So the contestants arc told that they may at first stand in front of a WRONGnumber, to confuse their adversaries, until Winchell clicks his little clicker. Then(443) 444the nine must scramble for what A-hey consider the right number: the slow onesare punished by banishment to a \"Penalty Box,\" which also serves as incarcera-tion for those who give incorrect answers.NBC says the show is \"informative,\" but I saw one kid win an Eleetrophonicstereo and a bicycle simply because he ventured a wild guess on a \"tie-breaker\"question (\"How much is fourscore and seven?\") and happened to come closer(\"20?\") than his opponent (\"11?\").Runaround is the logical extension of the fantasy-gratifying toy commercial.It dcesn't belong on the air. (The New York Times, Oct. 22, 1972)BATTLE OF THE BREAKFAST TABLESTAKES BUJ, SO CEREAL PRODUCERS POUR IT ONBy Philip H. DoughertyAny mother With one or More of the ginune group at home can attest to the powerof di y-cereal advertising. But it's getting harder to understand jtist what the kidsare yelling \"gimme\" for.How can a member of the Corn Flakes generation be expected to understanddemands for such things as Freakies, Baron Von Redberry and Sir Grapefellow.Froot. Chocula and (\"the monstrouslydelicious cereals\")?Where do youngsters learn about such things? Well, on a recent Saturdaymorning, an estimated 25 million kids were watching network television. Andnetwork television is where the four major cereal manufacturers put some $45-million worth of advertising last year.What did all those children see and hear? They saw a lot of crazy cartooncharacters, for one thing, and they heard a lot about crunchiness (apparently avital ingredient for ecreals) and they also heard many references to \"eight essentialvitamins.\"`\"So crispy, you almost have to cat them with your fingers in your cars,\" is themessage for Ralston Purina's Chex cereals.\"Tastes like a bowl of noisy fruit,\" says the .pot for Pebbles, made by GeneralFoods' Post frootful snootful,\" promises the commercial for Kellogg's Froot Loops.Kids also learn of orange, pink and purple breakfast delights, of some that tastelike peanut butter and of some that are sprinkled with marshmallows. And,perhaps more important to them, the kids learn that a box of Pebbles might con-tain a Toy Pelican Powered Flintnioboat. And they discover, for 75 cents and a\"purchase seal\" from General Mills' Trix, they can get a Wham-0 27 color pencil.Almost sounds like a fairy talebut it adds up to $800-million in annual sales ofready-to-cat cereal. A fairy tale should have sonic trolls, and there are trollsaplenty:Those at the Federal Trade Commission who have charged the bigfour cereal makers with monopolistic practices.Those of Action on Children's Television who would like to eliminateadvertising aimed at children.Those who want to use TV to educate tots on the nature of advertisingand nutrition.And those who are making the \"instant breakfast\" and pop-out-of-the-toaster goodies that are cutting into the cereal market.The cereals with the strange names, bright colors and flavors are of the pre-sweetened variety. This is not the biggest category of ready -to -cat cereal, butcertainly it is the fastest growing and now accounts for 30 percent of the market.Accordiing to John C. Maxwell Jr., an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co., the onlyone of the big four manufacturersKellogg, General Mills, General Foods andQuaker Oatsthat gained in dollar volume last year was General Mills, whichhas created the wackiest names for its new brands. Kellogg showed a gain in unitssold.People in the cereal industry say that premiums are being used as persuadersmore than ever before. They also say that more than one manufacturer would liketo get out of this rat race but can't because of competitive pressure.\"When you have two or three brands on the shelf that are all equal, then whatis going to pull one off the shelf? Premiums. That's what is going to charge upthe kid.\" 445He noted that price competition is rarely used for cereals because money is noobject to juvenile consumers. (Why should it be? It isn't theirs.)The nation devours more than one billion pounds of ready-to-eat cereals ayear. One industry source says 70 percent of this is gobbled up by people under20 years old. A more sophisticated source breaks it down to 38 percent by theunder-13 set and 31 percent each by the 144o-44 and 45-and-over groups.Cereals are pre-sold with advertising and are given a push on the crowdedsupermarket shelves by colorful packaging (front and back.) But premiums havebecome a primary ingredient in the marketing mix.Although the fortified brands are expected to be a growth area for cereal manu-facturers, the biggest expangion last year was in the pre-sweetened category.Why has the pre-sweetened segment groWn? Maybe Mrs. Peggy Charren, presi-dent of Boston -based Action on Children's Televigion, hasthe answer.\"Children's television has changed the design of products,\" she said the otherday.Before television, new cereal productS tended to flop on their faces. But since1950 about I50-new brands have been introduced.Saturday morning TV time is cheap compared with prithe time. It is the dif-ference between $4,000 for 30 seconds and $30400. So a cereal maker can launcha new, crunchy, pre-sweetened brand with about $2-million for-advertising plusS1- million for premiums.Curiously, what seems to have given the whole business a boost is the July,1970, blast by Robert B. Choate, a former Nixon Administration consultant onhunger. His charge that most cereals had little nutritional value made headlinescoast to coast.He ranked 60 brands in descending order of nutritional value. Kellogg's CornFlakes, Rice Krispies and Sugar Frosted Flakes (which h2 ranked 38th, :39th and58th) were last year's first, third and fourth best sellers, in terms of units. Gen-eral Mills' Cheerios (which he put in 25th place) sold second best.The only explanation Mr. Maxwell had to offer was: \"It's the same as tobacco.Tell them it's not good for them and they'll buy it. People love to sin.\"Mr. Choate said recently that sales did drop during the first six, months afterhis disclosure. Ile noted that, of the 40 brands that got the worst marks, 36 havestopped up their nutritional content.He, by the way, is not out to eliminate advertising on ehildren's shows. But hewould like to see public-service spots educating children as to just whatadvertising is.Although Mrs. Charren says ACT has found little improvement in the new TV-season, a glance at some of the new commercials indicates that advertisers aremoving in a,direction that may please some of the critics.hi a recent speech Mrs. Virginia 11. Knauer, special assistant to the Presidentfor consumer affairs, complained: \"In the crunchy, crackly, yummy, chewy,colorful foods paraded before children's eyes, where are the meat and potatoes,the fruits and vegetables, the eggs and milk that should be the staples of theirdiet? Sweetness becomes a cardinal virtue in food productsa virtue totally outof proportion to sugar's place in the diet.\"More than one of the new commercials sholt-the-ndvertised cereal along withbacon and eggs, orange juice and toast. Or they inclu e voice-over lines like \"goodbreakfast featuring Post Super Sugar Crisp.\"Mrs. Knauer is not alone in attacking sweets-stressineadvertising. The FTCissued similar criticism last January when it accused the big four of running anillegal monopoly (created in part by their tremendous advertising buagets) thatforced consumers to pay \"artificially inflated prices.\"Not so, said Yale Brazen, a University of Chicago business economist, and one-time consultant to the cereal industry. Instead of damning the cereal makers;he said, the FTC should be praising them because their TV advertising has madedry cereal a year-round favorite, smoothing out consumption patterns and loweringCosts.[Parade, Sunday, Mar. 4, 1973]WHAT YOU THINK OF CHILDREN'S TVBy Herbert Kupferberg\"My child loves TV,\" writes the mother of a 4-yearold in Lewiston, Idaho.\"It is his friend. It is sad for his friend to betray him and show him thingsthat make him afraid to sleep at night.\" 446Her comment typifies the overwhelming concern about children's televisionfelt by U.S. parents, as expressed in a vast outpouring of responses to n quizjointly sponsored by \"Parade\" and Action for Children's Television (ACT),which appeared in this mcgazine's December 3 issue.More than 25,000 replies have been received to the questionnaire at ACTheadquarters at 46 Austin St. Newtonville, Mass., and at this writing they arestill arriving at thee rate of 20-40 daily. They come from every State of the Unionand Canada. Many of them are accompanied by long letters from concernedmothersand sonie fathers, as wellcomplaining about a broad spectrum Ofchildren's TV practices ranging from excessive violence to incessant commercials.The quiz responses have been computerized and analyzed by a team of ElstonUniversity experts under the direction of Dr. F. Earle Barcus, profes'sor ofcommunication research.Comments I)r. Barcus: \"There are a lot of concerned parents out there whocared enough to send this quiz in. There, was a great response from upper-middle-class mothers, as well as from other groups. This is a concern that seemsto affect all income levels and fill parts of the country.\"One of the quiz's ,most startling discoveries is the extent:to-whieli the PublicBroadcasting Service'S noncommercial children'S TV programs have captured anationwide young audienee. PBS programs are normally not included in theNielsen and other TV ratings: But parents answering the question \"Which pro-grams does your child watch offer- _ing, \"Zoom,\" ulaced .No. 11. Many of the commercial programs most frequentlynamed were not children's programs at all, but regular adult or' family-typeofferings. A list of the top 20 programs appears at the end of this article.21 HOURS A WEEKAmong other findings are:The average child watches television 3 hours each weekday, 3.5 hours onSaturday, and 2.3 hours Sundaya total of around 21 hours a' week.Parents are overwhelmingly opposed to the current frequency of commercialson children's TV programs. Nearly 40 percent voted for a policy of no commer-ials, 23 percent for fewer commercials, 25 percent for commercials only at thebeginning and end of a progrrtn, and 7 percent for various combinations of theforegoing. Only 4 percent favored \"no change in the present system\" and 1 per-cent did -bat answer the question. \"This was one of the biggest surprises,\" com-ments Dr. Bawls. \"I-expected ^ lot more people to support the present system.\"By far the most frequent complaint voiced by parents was about violence, with32 percent objecting to its frequency. Nearly 10 percent complained about thecontent of cartoon programs, and many parents protested the prevalence of\"monsters\" on their screens. -My son wakes up at night talking about monsterslie's seen on 'IV.\" writes the mother of a 2%-year-old in Detroit. \"Is cruelty,murder. mayhem, sadism the best the networks can do?\" asks another woman inYakima, Wash.Despite these and other objections. most ,parents give a high rating to theprograms their children see most often, with 40 percent describing them as\"excellent,\" 41 percent \"good.\" 14 percent \"fair\" and 3 percent \"poor.\" Dr. Barcusexplains this seeming paradox by pointing out that most parents answering thisquestion were alluding to one or more Public Broadcasting Service programs.\"1:' we took away the PBS programs and one or two others, the results would be'we rwhelmingly negative.\" he says.As another result of the PBS shows, 71 percent of the respondents think TVhas a good iniluencevon their children, and 41 percent had (the total of more than100 percent is accounted for by responses indicating both good and bad). Askedwhether there were enough programs in their area specifically designed forchildren, 35 percent answered \"yes\" and 61 percent \"no,\" with the rest undecidedor not answering.The quiz attracted the attention not only of parents, gut of teachers, clergy-men, civic leaders, college students, teen-agers, and children themselves. Manyin their comments voiced regret that greater use wasn't being made of TV'spotential. \"The programs are fairly II-armless but don't do much to stimulatethe mind,\" wrote an Illinois mother of five. \"TV is a marvelous vehicle for in-strution but has heen wasted on inanities,\" says a mother of two in New York.On the other side, a North Dakotan with three youngsters comments that herchildren \"are much more informed on good things that we never even knew existed 447when we were children.\" Says a South Carolina mother, one of the few who votedfor no change in the present system of commercials. -TV keeps my childrenentertained, and I know their whereabouts.\"COOKIE MONSTER AS MODELA few parents voiced complaints about \"Sesame Street,\" on the grounds thatit Was aimed primarily at urban ghetto children rather than the general middlee:ass, and that its use of slang was questionable. \"My child eats like the CookieMonster, and this upsets me,\" wrote the Pennsylvania mother of a 3-year-old,alluding to one of \"Sesame Street's\" most popular puppet characters.Teachers in a number of junior high and elementary schools, who assignedthe Parade-ACT quiz as a class assignment, found pupils' replies surprisinglyparallel to those sent_in by adults. \"There's too much_ violence on TV-my younger brother keeps hitting me,\" reports an 11-year-o1d in the Republican School inCalifornia, Pa. ''There tire more commercials than programs,\" adds a 9-year-oldclassmate.\"I care about the children I babysit for,\" comments a girl at the.St. Cristopher-School in Midlothian, Ill. \"Programs with violence aren't good for little kids 5to 11 because they don't need that kind of education.\" Children at the schoolnamed \"Sesame Street\" as their by'a wide margin.\"CLEAR SEENIn making his evahmtion of the results, Dr. I3areus acknowledges that thepeople most likely to answer the quiz are the ones most concerned with children'sTV. Nevertheless. lie says he was impressed with the \"intensity, articulateness,and shove all-the great numbers and geographic spread\" of the response.Officials of ACT, which will later publish a detailed report of Dr. Barcus'findings, react similarly.'We always knew there was concern,\" comments ACT's president, Peggy_Char-ren. \"rut the degree of that concern as divulged by the Parade quiz, surprisedus.Adds ACTS executive director, Evelyn Sarson : \"We think the results constitutea clear mandate to change what is now going on in children's television.\"THE TOP 20A total of 6,961 different programs were listed in answer to the question \"Whichprograms does your child watch most often (list up to five) ?\" Following are the20 most frequently named, with the percentage of respondents listing them.Program Percentage 1, Sesame Street 62.4 2.

Before taking testimony from today's witnesses, I would like to make a brief opening stateinent_I recently saw an editorialon the issue that this committee is nowexPloring--\"Television Advertising to Children\"which said, just as well as possible, what we arA trying to accomplish with these hear-inks. Let ins quote for &moment from this editorill which appeared in Advertising Age:Television is a powerful communications tool. More importantly, perhaps: Television te. The challenge of TV is not found in seeking new ways to keep messages away from our children, but in striving to improve both programs and commercials. ...There is a lot of room for improvement in kiddie show commercials. Hard sell spots aren't ameliorated by mod, stroboscopic techui pres, or catchy jingles, or blatant puffery, or appeals to juvenile hedonism. Not to mention repetition. Too many commercials beamed at children still set up_ false hopes and, ulti- nudely, undermine confidence in advertising. They feed those who consider advertising a bad word, a negative value, and kids are not exempt from this. If the toy or game doesn't live up to TV-inspired expectations, who is the loser? The youngster's loss is matched, perhaps, by what the advertising community loses. What other business can beat itself out of its future so quickly, so effec- tively, as advertising? Conversely, what other business has the opportunity to secure its future by making Itself welcome on children's TV? We urge advertisers and agencies to learn from \"Sesame Street\" and \"Elec- tric Company.\" Try harder to produce informative and entertaining commer- cials, not just spots that sell. Inform the youngsters. Upgrade their lives: don't merely sell to them. Do this. and you will enable your young audience to grow into more productive. more effective persons. And as the children grow and enter the adult world, they become better citizens, better consumers.(449) 450I believe that all of us heretodayrepresentatives of the peopleand representatives of American food industry --do have the samebasic goals in mind. All of us are intemted, I hope, in making a con-tribution to the health and well-being of our Nation's children. I espe-cially appreciate the decisions of the Kellogg Co. and General Millsto testify today. For years the names of these companies have stoodfor a genuine concern for improved nutrition in America. They arecompanies to whom we all look for constructive leadership in protect-ing and improving the diets of our childrenindeed, for all of us. Iknow that their testimony will help the Congress in its effort to Aab-lish &sound national nutrition policy.Nu-Tarnow EnteATiow.3ROAD AND ImrotrrawTIt is becoming increasingly clear to me, as the chairman of thiscommittee, that the scope of this nutrition education issue includingthe question of television advertisingis quite broad and as importantas any health issuefacing.our people today. It is not an issue that thiscommittee can investigate in these few days of beatings. Therefore,we are rescheduling ourhearings to permit a fuller discussion.In the weeks to come we hope to remvite the companies and adver-tising atrencies who have not yet. had nu opportunity- to appear, aswell as other members of the food industrythe sugar industry, con-fectionary-industry, the soft drink industry. And, additionally, rep-resent!ttives of the producers of long-time traditional staple foods,such as vegetables, dairy products, and the like. Finally, we will re-schedule the representatives of the broadcasting. industry and theGovernment agencies involved in regulating nutrition advertising.I expect by the end of this investigation we will have a completeand thorough view of the scope and quality of nutrition-advernsingbeing directed at the American people, anti the degree to which thatadvertising is helpful or harmful to their health.Our leadoff witness today is the executive vice president. of theKellogg Co., Mr. William E.

Mr. Chairman. may I join you in welcoming Mr. La-Mothe and his associates at. Kellogg. I did not come this morning justbecause Kellogg was going to be here, I intended to come anyway.However, I have a hunch I would hire been required to change mypia& frhen learning Kellogg would be here if I had not alreakin-fended to do so.I am delighted that time Kellogg Co. has responded toyour invita-tion. Michigan is thought of solely in terms of the automobile. Actu-ally, the products that the Kellogg Co.along with the Post Co.may suggest that Michiganproduces much more than heavy industry.I know that, as with the automobile, dry breakfast foods have hadtheir critics. Many times, in both areas, the criticism has been valid. 45lBut it is my impressionand T hope you will share it with me at theend of the hearing, Mr. Chairmanthat the Kellogg Co. has been thefirst. or if not the first, no one has taken a more positive poSition, normade a more affirmative effort to respond to the problems that you havesurfaced in these hearings.Senator McGovEnx. I share your view, Senator.STATEMENT OF WILLIAM E. LaMOTHE, EXECUTIVE VICEPRESIDENT, KELLOGG CO., BATTLE CREEK, MICRLAMoTnE. Thank you very much, Senator Hart, and thank you,Mr. Chairman. We are here today because we share your committee'sgoal to improve the state of nutrition in our country. More spe8ificall v.we are here to outline what we have done and what we are doing tocontribute toward this goal.To help me cover this ground I've asked Dr. Gary E. CostleyKel-loga's director of nutrition, OP my right here, to provided you withnutritional information regarding our products.Also with us is Howard M. List, senior vice president\\of adver-tising. on my left. Howard will cover specific adveitising afid corpo-rate communication efforts. He will also report on our most recenteffort referred to as our \"Good Breakfast Program.\"Now, before I call on these gentlemen I want to point, out that theorigin of both our company and industry sprang from the desire, todevelop more nutritious foods.Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and his brother Will, the founders ofKellogg Co., developed ready-to-eat cereals as unique conveniencefoods in the late 1800's. The products from the very start were designedto be eaten with milk as substitutes for the heavy fat-ladened break-fasts of the late. 19th and early 20th centuries. Today over 1.2 billionpounds of ready-to-eat cereals are consumed every year. Consumeracceptance of these, economical new convenience products, that weintroduced in 1908, was immediate and has continued unabated.Nutrition has only recently become an acclaimed concern of Amer-icans, but it. has been the driving force behind our company since itsfounding. During the 1920's and 1930's the emphasis was on workingwith alr types of grainscorn. rice, wheat, bran, and oats. In 1971,responding to a national dietary need, ready-to-eat cereals were re-stored to whole -grain levels of selected nutrients.Mr. Kellogg had a keen interest in finding ways to improve. the nu-tritional contribution of ready-to-eat cereals and became extremelyinterested in the soybean on his trips to China. This interest. iresultedin an entirely new approach to breakfast foods; the combining of in-gredients rather than just flaking, puffing, or shredding a single, grainfood. In 1945. Corn Soyaa mixture of corn and soyawas introducednationally. It had about twice the level of protein of most ready-to-eat cereals, plus significant vitamins and minerals.I'd like to just. pass this package up to the committee. It was printedin 1945 and even though it is almost. 30 years ago, we have =the backpanel which says, \"Always eat a good breakfast.\" So, we were pro-moting it quite a good time ago.Corn Soya. was marketed for about, 15 ,,,ears before declining salesforced its withdrawal from the market. However. the technologicalbreakthrough that resulted in Corn Soy n paved the way for the devel- opment of Special K, a very palatable high protein cereal with a widerange of vitamin and mineral fortification. And in 1966, Product 19was introduced, providing significantly increased levels of vitamin andmineral fortification.Since then, the newer knowledge of nutritional needs and deficien-cies in our countryas obtained from surveys and studies of recentyearshave underlined the need for a good breakfast for people of allages. In 1969, the White House Conference on Foods, Nutrition, andHealtiLfocused national attention on our country's changing nutritionproblems. Kellogg recognized the need to continue, with a greater effortthan ever, to increase the essential- nutrienCeimtent of our cerealsand to broaden further our nutrition education programs.Today, continual advancements in the technology of vitamin andmineral application and long-term stability have pen. tted the forti-fication of all of our retail ready-to-eat cereals with eight essentialvitamins at about one-third of the daily requirement, plus the addi-tion of iron at significant levels. - Although our company's activities in improving the nutrition of ourproducts and the public's understanding of the need fora good break-fast began years ago, we recognized the necessity for some significantnew activities that might contribute to a better-understanding of theneed for good nutrition. We believe that good nutrition practicesshould start early in life and we have long placed emphasis on the im--portance of a nutritionally adequate breakfast for children, many ofwhom go without a good wake-up meal.Breakfast is, in many respects, a unique meal that poses specialnutritional problems involving the whole family, particularly children.__Clearly, ready-to-eat cereals fill a need. Findings of a recent surveyshow that 47 million Americans sit down every day to a breakfast thatincludes a serving of ready-to-eat cereal and milk.Breakfast is oitr business and we believe that this is the area inwhich we can do the most good in terms of nutrition education. KelloggCo. believes it is important not only to provide a wide choice of cerealsin tasty forms and flavors appealing to persons of all ages, but alsoto carry its product messages directly to all of the various age cate-gories in the markets it serves. For years our company has placedgreat emphasis on creating honest and tasteful advertising with mes-sages that convey the inherent food value of its products in a way thatis informative and interesting.Our company is very conscious of the fact that social responsibilitiesgo hand-in-hand with business responsibilities. The steps that we aretaking to contribute to the improvement of the understanding of theneed for breakfast and a complete and adequate breakfast reflect thisconsciousness.Communicating nutrition information is a complex problem. Theinformational needs of a homemaker are considerably different thanthose of a hospital dietitian. We provide specific information dis-cussing nutrition needs of the family. Various foods and their contri-bution to the total diet, are discussed in 'a manner_ mothers can easilyunderstand. The importance of breakfast to good health and the con-tribution made by various foods at breakfast assist in understandingnutrition.For 50 years, Kellogg's Department of Home Economics Serviceshas developed and provided programs of informational and educa-t tional services. Breakfast teaching aids covering all foods ordinarily served at breakfast have been provided by Kellogg free of charge to elementary school teachers since 1949. Through participation in these breakfast games, more than 27 million children have learned about the importance of breakfast.Over 6 million pieces of specially prepared material are distributed annually by the company to thousands of educators and other pro- fessionals. Nutrition and health education materials are provided in the form of charts, posters, booklets, games, and kits. And all are pro- vided free of charge.Kellogg's Nutritive Values Chart contains detailed information about our products. Much of this same information is printed on each cereal package, providing considerable information in an easy-to- understand form.We distribute over 1 billion packages each year. And, what more perfect educational vehicle could there be than cereal boxes sitting on millions of breakfast tables? Recognizing this, for over 30 years we have included messages about good nutrition on our cereal pack- ages. Our goal is to assist potential users of our products in choosing the correct foods essential to health and well-being. We believe the advertising of food products and the potential edu- cational impact of such advertising is directly related to the true nutritional values of the products being advertised. Because of this relationship, we believe it is crucial that accurate information regard- ing the nutritional aspects of Kellogg products be included in any discussion of our efforts in nutrition advertising or nutrition education. Therefore, I):. Gary Costley. director of nutrition of Kellogg Co., will provide testimony regarding nutrient, utilization and the nutri- tional characteristics of Kellogg's breakfast. cereals. Dr. Costley received his Ph. D. in nutrition from Oregon State University.STATEMENT OF DR. GARY E. COSTLEY, DIRECTOR OF IIUTRITION,KELLOGG CO.Dr. Cosi% Er. Thankyou, Bill.I look forward to presenting to this committee specific facts regard- ing the nutrient content and use of Kellogg's ready -to -eat. cereals. I stress the word fizetg because numerous statements have been made inrecent years concerning ready-to-eat cereals, many of which are untrue.Before providing the nutrient, content of our products, 'I will give specific data relative to general carbohydrate metabolism, breakfast- eating patterns in the United States, and how ready-to-eat cereals are utilized.Carbohydrates are found in virtually all foods in the forms of sugar, starch, and cellulose. Thesugars. often referred to as simple carbo-hydrates, include the monosaccharides and disaccharide and are pres- ent. in such foods as jams, jellies, syrups, milk. fruits. and others. The starches, or complex carbohydrates. are traditionally found in such foods as cereals, potatoes, flour, and other vegetables.As reported by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Acad- emy of Sciences, the body has a specific need for carbohydrates as a source of energy for the brain and for certain other specialized pur- 454poses.1 After these specialrequirements have been satisfied, carbo-hydrates and fat appear tobe they eihibit precise for carbohydrate to in individuals accustomedto normal diets, atleast 100 grams ofcarbohydrate per day appearto be needed to avoid ketosis, excessiveprotein breakdown and other undesirable metabolic-responses.-The blood sugarglucoselevel is maintained at a relatively- con-stant rate but declines to afasting level when no foodis consumed fora period of from10 to 12 hours.3Therefore,,the forcarbohydrates is morepronounced in the earlymorning hours thanother times during the day.Either simple or complexcarbohydrateswill satisfy this earlymorning need.I have included thisinformation because much that one reads sug-gests that carbohydrates,particularly simple sugars, do not contributeto good nutrition.Such unqualified statementsaremot consistent withthe knowledge thatcarbohydrates supply the major portion of thedaily energy requirement ofthe normal individual:'In 1968, the MarketResearch Corp. of America 5conducted thirdhousehold tostudy the eating habits in theUnited States.The breakfast patternswhich emerged from this study are truly re-vealing. Approximately 10 percent of the American population doesnot eat breakfast and anadditional 4 percent has only coffee. Thus, atotal of 14 percent of ourpopulation consumes no nutrients at break-fast. Further, recent studiesshow that one in fivechildren goes toschool without a nutritionally_ adequate breakfast and fully 6 percentof all children go to schoolwith no breakfast at all .6These facts aredistressing since the physiological need for breakfast is acute.Breakfast is the mostimportant meal of the day,especially foryoung growingchildren. This fact was established more than 20 yearsago by a series ofcontrolled metabolic studiesconducted at the Uni-versity of Iowa and has been well documented in thescientific litera-ture. In fact, theimportance of breakfast to good nutrition has beenso well establishedthat it is unnecessary todwell upon it further exceptto say that it continues toaffect our efforts in highlighting the criticalimportance of a nutritionallysound breakfast.This point is emphasizedbecause when one considers the specificnutritional aspects of a food, he must be cognizant of the rolethatfood fulfills in the diet ifhis considerations are to benutritionallyvalid.The menu data reported earlier further show that ready-to-eat cerealand milk servings are a part of 25 percent of all breakfastsconsumedin this country. Of even greater importance is the fact that more than40 percent of the breakfastsconsumed by children under 13 years ofage containready-to-eat cereals as a component.: These data continueto us ourtremendous responsibility toprovide highquality, nutritionally sound products.I National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, 1969.

This chart gives the nutrie...;content of Kellogg's leading product, Corn Flakes, expressed as apercentage of the recommended dietary allowances for the adult maleand indicate that Corn Flakes are an excellent source of several essen-tial nutrients : vitamin A, 26 percent; vitamin D, 33 percent ; vitaminC, 16 percent; niacin, 18 percent, and so on, but are a relatively poorsource of minerals, calcium,phosphorus, and magnesium.Data collected by the National Family Opinion organization provethat 94 percent of all readyrtoeat cereals are consumed in combinationwith milk 1 and-as a result of-this let me show you the nutrient contentof this same serving expressed with 4 ounces of milk.',Cereal Consumption Study, 1972.

The combination has 8.8 perc?nt of the proteinrequirement; 30 percent of the vitamin A; 43.7 percent of the vitt: ininD, and so on. It should be specifically noted the way in which cerealandmilk compliment one another nutritionally because each suppliesa good source of certain nutrients. Together they balance one anothdr.This can best be seen by looking at a specific examplevitamin C,for example. Cereal is a good s.ource of vitamin C, whereas, milk is avery poor source. The same is true of niacin. Cereal products providean excellent amount of niacin and milk very little. If you go down intocalcium and phosphorus, there is very little calcium in cereal but themilk provides abundiiiit amounts.It is interesting, I think that the recently completed 10-State sur-vey 1 pointed out specific deficiences in the American population ofthese cereal nutrients. For example, vitamin A was highlighted asbeing one of the most often deficient nutrients. Cereals are an excellentsource of vitamin A. The same thing is true of vitamin C which isfound to be deficient, and iron. Cereals are a good source of iron.Another nutrientwhich cereals are not a good sourcethe surveyfound to be deficient is calcium which the milk provides in abundantamount. So the point being the cereal and milk served the way it isactually consumed contributes very heavily to those nutrients that the10-State survey showed to be deficient. To show this another way, letme show you a distribution of the milk serving and cereal. If you takethe content that was on the previous chart and divide it into a 100-percent basis. In other words, 100 percent of all the iron in that servingis derived from the cereal, 90 percent of vitamin C derived from thecereal, the total of 99 percent_ofthe calcium conies from the milk, 91percent of the phosphorus comes from the milk and these data show orprove actually that ready-to-eat cereals and milk servings complementone another nutritionally and are an excellent combination together.When discussing cereals, ready-to-eat cereals, the statementbinevi-tably arises that cereals which are sweetened by the manufacturer aregrossly inferior to cereals which are not. The fact is that is not true.Let me show you a chart that makes a direct comparison between twoproducts, corn flakes and sutra r frosted flakes.The gray lines represent the nutrient content, again expressed as itpercent of a daily requirement for an adult male, and the black linesare for sugar frosted flakes, a comparable product with the excep-tion one is presweetened while the other is not. I think it should bespecifically noted the vitamin A content is identical ; vitamin D con-tent is the same, C, niacin, B1,13_, Bo, Bi., and iron. There is a slightlylower level of protein in the sugar frosted flakes compared to thecorn flakes. Same is true for phosphorus and magnesium but evencasual inspection of these data suggests that these difference are totallyinsignificant.TemState Nutrition Survey. 1968-70. U.S. Department of Health. Education, andWelfare. DREW Publication No. (HS31) 724134. EMEIDEMEgi Typical Nutrient Percentages of Recommended Daily and Kellogg's Sugar Thiamin* (14) Ritof Vitamin of presweetened cereals generally comes from people who either have not seen these data or don't understand their signifi- cance. This basic information is printed on the side panel of everyKellogg cereal package. As a result, I am continually puzzled at state- ments m the popular press and elsewhere which are totally inconsistentwith the nutritional facts of these presweetened products.Let me turn from the protein, vitamin, and mineral content of pre- sweetened cereals to dental caries, a subject which received consider- able discussion last week before this committee.' You were told that Kellogg Co. has supported extensive studies on dental health, and indeed we have. We have allocated many hundreds of thousands of dollars for dental health research during the past decade.Earlier testimony before this committee suggested that the additionof phosphates to the diets of rats was effective in preventing dental caries. We conducted similar experiments several years ago in coop-eration with the National Institutes of Health. Our studies, like those reported to you earlier, indicated that phosphates were effective in preventing dental caries in laboratory animals fed breakfast cereals.As a result of this, we supported a 3-year clinical study which was conducted by Dr. Robert L. Glass, Forsyth Dental Center in Boston? This study involved approximately 1,000 children: The results of thisresearch clearly demonstrated that the addition of phosphates to cereal,which may be effective in laboratory animals, had no effect on the development of dental caries in children.During this study, these 7- to 11-year-old children received 14 differ-ent Kellogg's breakfast cereals, 4 of which were presweetened, freeand upon request during a 2-year period, and thus their consumptionwas much higher than the national average. Complete dental examina-tions were made upon initiation of the program and annually there- after. The results show no correlation between the new dental caries observed and the total amount of cereal consumed or the amount of presweetened cereal consumed. This study is now in preparation for publication.Now, I'd like to deviate from my text and go over the facts of that study again because I believe them to he critical based on sonic of the testimony that was given last week. This study was conducted by an exceptionally fine scientist at the Forsyth Dental Center in Boston.And it involved 1,000 children. They received ready-to-eat cereals at random as much as they wanted over a 2-year period. Their consump- tion was considerably higher than average, and there was no correla- tion between the total amount of cereal consumed or the amount of presweetened cereal consumed, and dental caries.In another clinical study conducted under the direction of Dr. Sid-ney B. Finn, of the Institute of Dental Research at the University ofAlabama,' dental caries incidence was compared in children consuming presweetened cereals versus those consuming regular cereals withadded phosphates; no differences were found between children con- suming the regular cereal with added phosphates and those consumingpresweetened cereals.I See NE 3, hearing of Mar. 5. 1073. pp. 275-305.sGlas.s.

First, there has not.,I repeat not, been an increase in per capita sugar consumption in theUnited States over the past 40 years.1 This fact is often blurred be-cause people report large increases in industrial use of sugar. What isnot reported is the fact that in-the-home use of sugar has declinedat the same rate that industrial use has increased. This is not unex-pected When one looks at the shift in eating patterns from homeprepared to preprocessed foods that has occurred during this timeperiodSucrose, or common table sugar, is synthesized by nature, man sim-ply extracts the substance from plants. Many natural foods containsugar as a component. An interesting fact is that fresh citrus fruits,no doubt one of nature's most popular and nourishing foods, containhigh levels of sugar. Fresh orange juice contains approximately 10 per-cent simple sugar of which half is sucrose, the same compound so oftenmaligned when added to processed foods.I am not saying citrus fruits are bad because they contain sugarto the contrary they are exceptionally nutritious foods. Further, I amnot conveying the idea that sugar itself is an excellent food, becauseit is not. It contains calories but no vitamins, minerals, or protein.However, it is nutritional nonsense to evaluate a food on the basisof its sugar content alone. One must look at a food in its entirety, notat its isolated segments.If one were to take literally the charge that TV advertising is pre-conditioning children to consume larger quantities of sugar, it is rea-sonable to expect that as TV advertising of foods has increased, acorresponding increase in per capita sugar consumption would benoted. This has not occurred. Food advertisements have been on TVfor a period of about 20 years, yet during this time period, sugarconsumption has been static as reported by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture. These facts are in direct disagreement with the allega-tions made recently before this committee. .- Let us now move to the subject of nutrition education. As a profes-sional nutritionist, I am very concerned about the poor eating habitsand the extremely meager understanding of nutrition within theAmerican population.. The food industry can provide nutrition information not only aboutits products, but a balanced diet as well. Various means of communica-tion can be utilized to dis.seminate this information.Mr. Howard List, senior vice president, advertising., will now pro-vide some specific examples of what we are doing in the area of nutri-tion education utilizing various means of communication.Thank you.STATEMENT OP HOWARD N.

U.S. Department ofAgriculture. presented at the Intelnational Conference on Sugars in Nutrition. VanderbiltUniversity. Tennessee. 403that I was struck by the wisdom in the editorial, sir, that you rend this morning. I was handeda copy of your opening remarks just before Iarrived and refer to the comment you made:What other business can heat itself out of its future so mticklY. so effectively. asadverrishg? Conversely. what other business has the opportunity to secure its future by making itself welcome on children's TV?That certainly is the challenge and responsibility and that is the spirit in which we approachour testimony.Based on our experience through the years, we hold the view that to be truly resuitful, consumer comnun on better nutrition must be approached in both a total and cous!ffetely coordinated manner, to all age groups. We believe this can be.,,trbe accomplished primarily through a better utilization of all channels of communication. Nutri- tion education is both a vital and a never-ending job where media advertising has an important role. but of which it is only a ptirt, Adver- tising can be a very effective vehicle for creating an interest in nutri- tion, because it reaches large numbers of people of all age groups and can present. nutritional information in an interesting manner.The task of total communication involves three principal categories; (1) Nutritional Information: (2) Nutritional Education: and (3) Nutritional Motivation. Kellogg Co. has been active in all of these areas for many years, and in view of obvious needs we have increasedour efforts in all three categories.Better nutrition must. be approached in terms of the total diet. not just a food group or a single kind of food. It must be developed in a manner that is meaningful to changing life-styles and the individ-ual... to individuals of all ages, including children. These consid-erations are especially relevant to breakfast ... which has become most. individual meal of the day.As Dr. Costley mentioned earlier, the breakfast skipping habits of children are a serious concern. Many of them go without a good wake-up meal. Therefore eve are placing more emphasis in ourAM- Sising to children on the importance of a nutritionally adequate break- fast. Research done at a leading university provides scientific evidence that those-who eat. a good breakfast tern more alert, exhibit faster reac- tions and less fatigue, and thus better capacity for learning than lifeak- fast skippers.The faster pace of modern living ... more mothers working out- side the home... many things to do in the morning with little timeto do them... family members arising and leaving at differenttimes... finicky morning appetites, and other demands have madebreakfast. in most homes avery individual affair. Further, there is aneed for nutritious, easy-to-prepare foods, and these facts help to explain the widespread acceptance and use of ready-to-eat cereals by persons of all ages.Kellogg Co. recognizes that advertisers to children have a responsi- bility to' present their products in a very realistic and forthright. way. For this reason, we take special precautions in preparing such advertising.All of our commercials to children are in strict compliance with the Provisions for Children Code of tare National Association of Broad- casters, the code boards of all of the networks, the newly developedcodes of Advertising to Children by the Association of National Ad- vertisers, in whichwe were a participant, and the voluntary self- 464regulation of advertising via the National Advertising Review Boardand the Council of Better Business Bureaus. In addition, our owncorporate procedure on approvals requires that all advertising andpromotion of any kind be submitted to our nutrition scientists and ourlegal authorities for a thorough examination and approval before it isreleased for airing or publication.Kellogg Co. has demonstrated social responsiveness through its ad-vertising to all groups. Nutrition surveys, scientists, and dietitiansaffirm that breakfast is a most important but frequently neglected meal.Through the years, by providing more information on products andusage, and in describing the benefits of our products in terms of con-venience, taste, and nutrition, we are encouraging Americans to eat agood breakfast. When improvement. otbreakfast, eating habits resultsfrom advertising, it can only be considered a benefit.We misistently try to get our product nutritional messages and thebetter breakfast. story told as a part of *coordinated nutrition informa-tion effort. First, on all of our packages, as you saw earlier. Then, withthe consumer services and nutrition materials of our Department ofHome Economics. And, of course, in our media advertisingprint,television, radio. et <xtera.I believe this latter effort in nutrition education can best be demon-strated by showing the committee some of our print advertisementsand television commercials. Here nre some examples of advertisementsfrom our Nutrition Information Print Campaign. This is an importantpart of the continuing consumer effort that we schedule annually, en-couraging complete breakfasts and better nutrition.And now, if we may have the lights, I would like to show you sonicof these advertisements. k 465This one featuring Rice Krispies, shows the importance of breakingthe fast with a good morning meal and shows the nutritional valueS'ofthe cereal and the cereal with the 4-ounce serving of milk. which arecontained in the nutrient facts box at the bottom of the advertisement. -T o o.breakfastKoloicei his ittifaiebelieved that it and ; toe 466Here is 'cal of a series which shows nutritionalfacts about Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

We call this new effort the \"GoodBreakfast Campaign.\" It will run on national television aimed pri-marily at children. This effort is a silrnificant a(ldition,we feel, to our nutritional education program. The goal of this campaign is to educate children to the needfor breakfast, a complete breakfast.In our two 60-second Good Breakfast messages, we present a variety of good tasting, appetizingbreakfast foods. We've6VC21 put in a good word for thii bacon andegg people, and other foods commonly servedfor breakfast.As you will notice in theseannouncements, a cereal breakfast was not focused on, although itwas included in the message because itbelongs there. fre will continue to promote the fruit, cereal and milk combination, because theywere made to go together. Through theyears we have featured this combination in both our print and broad- cast advertising. We have had many joint promotions with the banana growers, the peach and blueberry growers, and have featured other fresh fruits such as raspberries, strawberries, et cetera, usa topping for the cereal and milk serving.In our Good Breakfast Campaign messages, the only mention of Kellogg is the closing credit line which, as you may know, is the legal requirement for any television paid announcement. Kellogg's is buying television time to support these messages on national television. We want to make sure they get aired and are seen by children of all age groups.Now, here is the broadcast plan :These Good Breakfastmessages will be scheduled on all threetelevision networks, CBS, NBC, and ABC.They will be scheduledevery week for the balance of the year.They will appear at leastonce on every Saturday morning net-work children's show during the year.To reach preschool children during the week they will also be scheduled on such programsas \"Captain Kangaroo.\"And on daytimeprograms to reach parents ... such as the \"Today Show,\" becausewe want parents to know what we are saying to the youngsters.These messages will reach virtually every child in this country at least once and most of theyoungsters will see them several times.Now, we'd like to showyou those two announcements. The first. oneup has just been completed and is being shown here for the first time. It is age specific, andwas developed to interest preschool and youngchildren. Therefore, themessage is very fundamental, simple, anddirect... \"Eat a good breakfast and a variety of foods.\"The second announcement has been produced to reach older children and their parents. As mentioned, it will be broadcast not onlyon chil- dren's programs but alsoon some all-family and daytime programs as well.May we now ask your indulgence to turn off the lights so we can see these messages?

We sincerely appreciate the opportunity that your Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs has made available to us to present some facts on our products andour continuing effort in nutrition education.Senator Mc:Gm-F.)(ti. Well, thank von very much, Mr. LaMothe, Mr. List, and Dr. Costley. I want to. apt al, commend the Kellogg Co., on a very impressive effort in this nutritional educational field. There are some questions that I'd like to direct to you.Last week the committee heard a number of witnesses, as you know, who expressed criticism of the kind of advertising being directed at children today and especially what they described as the onslaughtof heavily sugared foods. One of those witnesses was Dr. Jean`Mayer,a renowned nutritionist, former White House adviser and incidentally,a member of the panel that last year awarded a prize to Kellogg forIrintadvertising of nutrition. Dr. Mayer is no wildeyed reformer sothink what he has to say in these areas is all the more impressive.I'd just like to read a cor-fle of the statements he made and ask youto comment or any of you three gentlemen. He said first of all, and I'mquoting:I would like to make a very strong point in my belief that good breakfast cerealsare an extremely useful food and at a time when cardiovascular disease is ournumber one health problem, the consumption of good breakfast cereal with asmall amount of milk is an excellent way for people to get a good breakfast andreduce their intake of fat. Unfortunately, what is being propounded to childrenare extremely heavily-coated cereals with a great deal of sugar, many of whichmothers assure me are consumed without milk and which cannot even if theyare enriched with a few vitamins, be considered as good foods. In fact I havesome very serious questions whether some products which have more than 50percent sugar should be called cereals. I think they might more properly be culledcandy .1I wonder if you gentlemen would comment on that. I don't knowwhether we have some of these samples here. There is one of yourproducts that is called Fruit Loops, which does appear to look andtaste like crady but. in any event, I'd be interested in your commentson Dr. Mayer'S conclusions.RTE CEREALS To BE EATEN Wrni MILKMr. LAMomE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I guess I could make somecomments. I'm just thinking perhaps Dr. Costley, too, would like tocomment.I think some important points that Dr. Costley made in his testi-mony this morning should be filtered through Dr. Mayer's commentsand the most important point is that in this country cereal is consumedwith milk; 94 percent of the cereal consumed in this country is takenwith 4 ounces or about 4 ounces of milk, so we are talking about theserving of ready-to-eat cereal. If I could go back for a minute to theearly days of cereal, I'm not sure how Mr. Kellogg or others thoughtit would be consumed but it was traditionally consumed with milkand some sweetening. Most recent surveys taken in 1968, I think, byRoper, again confirmed that over 90 percent of the people aid sweeten-ing to nonpresweetened foods. The development of the presweetenedsegment of the industry seemed to be a very logical extension becausepeople prefer their cereals sweeteneiThe industry gradually found techniques to sweeten the products inthe factory and the method of applying the sweetening gave a textureimprovement, or at least a munber of people felt that texture improve-ment was there, and the presweetened part of the industry grew.Now, it is true that the presweetened cereals are sugar coated but wehave also run tests with hundreds and hundreds of children becausewe wanted to know ourselves, do they add sugar on top of a presweet-ened cereal ? We found they don't. We have run tests with children tosee how much sugar they add to regular cereal and in the combinationSee NE 3. bearing of Mar. 3, 1973. pp. 239-261. 481of presweetened cereals as consumed and regular cereals as consumed, the difference in sugar intake is virtually nil.I really don't feel that it's fair to point out that a presweetened cereal, because it does have the sugar, could fall into a candy category because its end consumption is just like the other cereals; with milk, when consumed.I'll ask Dr. Costley to'comment further if I haven't fully answered that question.Senator McGrovEnx. In that connection: Dr. Costley, you showed us a breakdown on the charts of the nutrients in Corn Flakes and Special K and some of the others. Is it not a fact, though, that on these heavily sugared products like the Fruit Loop product, that you add a some- what nutritional value or rather reduced value?Dr. Cosrtz.v. No, Senator, it's not. The data I showed you on Frosted Flakes, Sugar Frosted Flakes, and Corn Flakes is very typical of all of our presweetened cereals. As a matter of fact, Fruit Loops has a higher level of minerals than Sugar Frosted Flakes does. It has that because corn is not as gooda source of minerals as oats and one of thebase products of Fruit Loops is oats. These data that you see on that chart are very typical of all of our presweetened cereals. Senator McGovratx. Even these that appear to look and taste like candy have approximately the same nutritional value? Would that be true of the protein value, too ? DILUTER PROTEIN RT ADDING $IIGARDr. COSTLEY. No. the protein is slightly lower, and the obvious reason for that is sugar doesn't have any protein so as you add sugar you dilute protein, but the point being that a traditional ready-to-eat cereal is not a good source of protein in the total diet unless it is consumed with milk.The difference is that the protein content of corn Flakes is :Lit per- cent of the daily requirements; that's without milk. Sugar Frosted Flakes is 2.9.. What. you are talking about is a difference of 1 percent of the daily requirement and, again, there is the dilution of the min-erals; calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, but the calcium, phos- phorus and magnesium, the non - presweetened cereals are not a significant source of those nut rients anyway. Senator McGovnix. As I recall Dr. Mayer's testimony,' one of the points he madeeither in his prepared statement or in the question and answersis that a lot of youngsters have the habit of grabbing a handful of these sweetened cereals like these Sugar Loops or the General Mills product herd called \"Grapefellow\" and they eat them as snacks without milk.While the overall figure thatyou get of the high percentage of cereals consumed, is true, I'msure, isn't it fair to say that there is a practice among young children to r..e these highly sweetened cereals as a kind of snack, between meals, where they grab a handful and eat it as they would candy?I See NE 3. hearing on Fruit Loops. Actually, FruitLoops has the highest nonmiIk usage of any of our products and it isapproximately 18 percent. One year it was 19 percent, but the pointbeing that even Fruit Loops SO percent are consumed with milkI would point out, too, that our data shows that when they are con-sumed as snacks they arc not consumed at. breakfast. Its a snack, andI would suggest that. Fruit Loops as a snack are much better thanpotato chips or a sweet roll. These products as a snack, when Ton wantto utilize them that way, they are a very poor source of protein but anexcellent source of vitamins, so that Cie snack value of Fruit Loops isnot worthless. I would say, too, that. I'm a little puzzled at Dr. Mayer'sstatement that presweetened cereals cannot. be considered good foodbecause if you say that Corn Flakes are good food and you look at thedata on that chart. on Corn Flakes and Sugar Frosted Flakes andthey are virtually the same. I don't understand why the Sugar FrostedFlakes are not considered good food.I think I take exception to that. They are good food.Senator McGovutx. itthere does seem to be some conflict in thetestimony, 1)r. Costley, on this matter of sugar consumption in theUnited Atates. Dr. Nizel of Tufts University School of Dental Medi-cine told the committee, a few days ago, and I quote:As an indication of how rapidly sugar consumption is increasing in the IhdtedStates, in 1903 industrial food processors used million tons or 8 billion immixof sugar, whereas. in 1D07, 5.8 million tons or approximately 12 billion poundswere used, un increase of XI percent in 4 years.'Now, in your statement, you make the assertion : \"First. there has not.I repent not. been an increase in F r consumption in the United States over the past 40 years.\" There seems to be--Dr. Cosmic. Per capita.Senator McGovux. Pardon ?Dr. Comm-. The difference is that, when you report data the w:.yDr. Nizel is, he is reporting industrial use of sugar. OK. First ofall, there is a big shift occurring in the United States on where peopleare getting their sugar. There is a large increase in industrial usebecause there is a large decrease in in-home use. People don't. bake asmuch as they used to; they buy bread. People don't. make their ownice cream: they buy ice cream. They don't make their own pies; theybuy pies. That accounts for part, of it..Ile other difference is the per capita, because you notice that Dr.Nizel did not relate that data to per capita consumption.Senator McGovr.aw. No; he is talking about an overall increase of33 percent in the industry.DIMMEST SOURCES ...DIFFERENT ANSWERSDr. COSTLEY. Well, the data actually is footnoted there and in apublication by the Department of Agriculture. When you look at thisdata on sugar usage in the United States, you go to different sources:von get slightly different answers. but there has not been a per capitaincrease. In 1950I believe Otis number conies right out of USDAreports in 1950the per cal ,1! a consumption of sugar in the United2 See NE 3. hearing of Mar. 5. 1973. F. 280. 483States was nearly 100 pounds, 9\" 7. in 1973, it is 102. You know, these data come directly from Gm mein figures on per capita consump- tion of sucrose.1 don't believe that Dr. Nizel's statement was on a per capita basis. Seiwtor McGovEnN. You are quite correct. lie is talking about the overall increase.I did want to direct a question at you, Mr. List. I'm sure that cry- body in this room and people all across the country applau.. this \"Good Breakfast Campaign\" that Kellogg has undertaken recently. It seems to me it is an extremely commendable and public-spirited effort on the part of the company ; but one of the things some of the health professionals told us is that there is so much countemdvertising of products that are damaging to the he,:lth of children, pushed so hard, that it is very difficult for constructive programs of this kinil to get across. I think that if Dr. Mayer were here he would say the con- centration on heavily sugared foods and snacks, and items of that sort, has the effect of almost canceling out the beneficial effects of a pro- gram such as yours.Do you have any impressionor comment on that problem?Mr. Lts.r. Yes, sir. I would like to point out our good-breakfast program encompasses both regular and presweetened cereals. Maybewe didn't do a very good job here on the sample product commercialsbecause we had a variety on principally presweetened cereals as we wanted you to see how we present these items.However, we advertise Rice Krispies, Corn Flakes, and our other regular cereals as a part of breakfast just as we do with the presweet- ened cereals, so we do feel in responding to the needs of children as we define themthat is, theone out of five that go on to school withoutan adequate breakfast and the 6 percent that skip breakfast and we do have an opportunity to make a positive contribution in our messages.Senator MeGovEnx. Did you say that on these products like Special K and Product 19, you also push those on the Saturday morn- ing programs and children's shows?Mr. LIST. I'Ve have run many times, sir, the commercial we showed you and the committee for Special K on Saturday morning. Theseproducts have an older age profile in terms Jf usage but we feel there are qualities here _that are certainly fine for the whole family as you saw m our print advertis'ng and our commercial, so we have run the Special K commercial yousaw for almost 2 years now on Saturdaymornings, not with great frequency but with enough frequency so as to present that product's values to youngsters directly, which is the goal,oal frankly, of our new approach.We want to be specific to the age groups of youngsters because we know that is necessary, to be meaningful, to put into our messages something regarding the importance of breakfast, and the role of milk and breakfast cerealas part of a complete breakfast. We try to showour products in context of a complete, an1 good breakfast. So we hope we can communicate these values, sir, de 'rte some of the things that have been said to thecontrary.Senator MeGovEnx. Senator Schweiker: 4484 CONTROVERSYEXCESSIVE. SUGAR DESTROYS NUTRIENTSSenator SCIIWEIKER. One point on sugar is that some researchersshowagain there is a lot of controversy, but we are beginning to learna lotthat sugar in excess ultimately destroys some of your nutrients.When you put up a chart on sugar-coathd cerealand this applies toany company, it is not strictly your company because Ai are havinga dialog on some honest differences about nutritionhowever, whenyou show that a sugar-coated cereal of any kind has the same relativenutrient going in, that may be well and good. But high concentrationsof sugar destroy the vitamins and some of the essential nutrients andminerals. So, in essence, you are also putting in the ingredient whichdestroys the very nutrient you are adding:I am sure you won't agree with that, but there are some scientificstudies which indicate that., and this !s one of our concerns about sugar.Dr. COS LEY. The data there is for the finished foods, and those areanalyzed amounts. Those are not the amounts that we put in. It is theamounts that we findactually after on-the-shelf stability. Theyare put on the shelf and tested to see they meet our nutritionalrequirements.You are right. There is some information that sugar may relate tothe biological availability of nutrients, but that data are very sketchyat this point. It has certainly not been confirmed, and these data re-port what is in the food, not what we put in the food. The best pro-cedures that are available today are utilized to analyze for nutrientsin these products.Senator SCIIWEIKER. The third point. I want to make, I am makingin terms of the industry. I am not making it in terms of your companybecause we are glad to have you here to talk about it.just recently chaired a hearing on diabetes' and rather shockingfacts came out of the testimony. By 1980, one out of every five Amer-icans will either have diabetes or inherit the characteristic of diabeteswhich, perhaps, they can pass on to their children or grandchildren.Furthermore, diabetes is the second leading cause of blindness in theUnited States. In 10 years it will be the first.Dr. Mayer pointed out in his testimony that there are some studiesbeing shown that there is a direct link between the amount of sugarwe consume and the body's ability to combat diabetes. Of course, thisis new research, but with the number of Americans who are, and willbe, effected by diabetesone out of every fiveand with sugar beingrelated, in terms of volume consumed, to diabetes, I think it raisessome very serious questions about how much sugar we, as a country,should be promoting, and whether we shouldn't have labels on foodcommodities stating the sugar content.Again, you might like to comment. You may not agree, but theseare questions we have to raise.Dr. COSTLEY. One of the things is our difference on whether or notsugar consumption per capita is actually increasing. I would behappyand I do not have that report from the Department of Agri-culture with meto submit. to you the per capita sucrose intake in theUnited States. I believe it started in 1950. It reports from 1950 through1973. If you like, we would be happy to submit that. I think what isI Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. Subcommittee on Health. hearing of Feb. 26.1073 485really germane is whether or not sugar consumption or sucrose con-sumption is really increasing.I *mild say there has been a decrease in calorie consumption in thelast 10 years in the United States, and as a result of that there is ahigher percentage of the total American diet. derived from sugar.This decrease in calories has not been very dramatic and does notaccount for the large increases of sugar that people are reporting. I donot think the data on sugar consumption substantiates some of thestatements.Senator SCIIWEIKER. Are you talking about recent sugar consump-tion ? I realize there is a difference of facts. Are you talking aboutrecent sugar consumption not increasing? You are not arguing that wehave not increased the sugar intake tremendously since 1900, are you?1.1mix.vm INCREASE IN SUGAR CONSUMPTION SINCE 1870Dr. COSTLEY. There has been a marked increase in the sugar con-sumption from 1860 or 1870. The sugar consumption has increased.SenatorWe are together on that..Dr. COSTLEY. Part of my testimony was related to television adver-tising because of the idea that television advertising is preconditioningpeople to consume more sugar. I have some serious reservations thatthe sugar consumption data support that allegation.Senator SCHWEIKFIL The point I am making and it is not too rele-vant to the TV advertisingis that there does not swim to be muchdisagreement. that the sugar consumption has &robe. up 40 percentsince 1949.4. disease like diabetes has gone up tremendously since 1949. It isnow a fact of American life, and again I do not knob what. these re-search studies are going to finally conclude, but it can only point tosuspicion. However I think them is some concern about the per capitasugar consumper-..: -r a long period of time. I wouldn't really differwith what. youbaying over a relatively short period of time exceptthat consumption of flour and starches is definitely going down. Fur-thermore, it. is not only in relation to the percentages, but also a rela-tionship in terms of the composite picture.I think Dr. Mayer pointed out that for the first time we are con-suming more sugar than bread and other starches. This statistic may well be significant too, but again it is a debatable question.Thatis all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.Senator McGovEis. Thank you very much, gentlemen.We would like to call Miss Mercedes Bates, vice president anddirector of the Betty Crocker Kitchens of General Mills.Senator Humeintrx. I am very happy to see you here today.STATEMENT OF MERCEDES BATES, VICE PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR OFBETTY CROCKER KITCHENS, GENERAL MILLS, MINNEAPOLIS,MINN.Miss li.vrys. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I amdelighted to have an opportunity to be here today in answer to theinvitation of your chairman to testify about our nutritional educationpolicy. 486First, I want to stress to you that I am a home economist, not anutritionist. As an employee of a big company with many specialists,I consider myself to be a generalista generalist because the BettyCrocker Department has as its charge the assistance of consumers inthe homemaking area, and nutrition education has been one of ourresponsibilities for many years.My, own interest in nutrition education goes back to the days of'World War II when I taught Red Cross nutrition classes in all kindsof unlikely locations. I think my most exotic spot was an Abbey Rentsambulance station.Nutrition has changed greatly in the years since I was in school. Itis a relatively new science and each year brings new discoveries ofgreat and far - reaching Our nutrition services depart-I,ment is coniposed of professionals in this area who interpret thisresearch to us. But for general education purposes, we believe thatnutrition education should stress the need for balanced meals. Knowl-edge of vitamins and minerals and trace elements is of little use unlessthis information can be translated into actual food intake. So, in gen-eral, our nutrition education efforts have concentrated on assisting thehomemaker to plan daily menus which will nurtnre her family ade-quately because the selection of foods is broad and made according tothe basic four food groups.I've read with great interest the stories in the press about this dis-tinguished committee's interest in sugar consumption. Sugar. a carbo-hydrate, represents just one category of food. and sweetened foodsmust be viewed in light of their relationships to other foods eaten. Weknow, for example, that Iess than 3 percent of a child's daily sugarintake comes from presweetened cereals. Many other products are alsosweet and therefore appealing. Desserts such as cakes. frostings, icecream, and cookies are looked upon as reward foods, or fun foods, ifyou will. Too much of a good thing may be bad. For instance, excessiveintakes of protein, fat. cholesterol, salt and a number of other nutrientscan be detrimental to the health of some.According to the then executive director of the nutrition foundation.it was established over 10 years ago \"how nrgent the need is for thepublic as well as scientists to understand the concept that all nutrientsare only safe or nsefid to thebody within a limited qnantitative range...they are all harinfid if consumed in excessive quantities, andharmlessjust as salt. or pepper would bewhen consumed in suffi-ciently small quantities.It is important to remember that sugar makes things taste good andtherefore makes sources of nutrition palatable. In a statewide nntri-tion survey conducted in 19(U) among 80.000 *Massachusetts publicschool children. 13 percent came to school on survey day having hadnothing to eat and only 5 percent ate a good breakfast that morning.Sixty percent of all breakfasts are nutritionally inadequate, so we be-lieve that fortified, presweetened cereals do have a role in providingnutrition.To keep this subject in perspective, I hope you will remember thatless than 2 percent of all supermarket sales are represented by GeneralMills products.It, is the story of nbalanced nntritioiswhich we think is most im-portant and this s the area in which we !rive concentrated. T want, to 1.. 487stress to you that we are not newcomers to the field of nutrition educa-tion. Our interest has been keen for many years.General Mills was in the forefront of the movement to enrich flour,one of the first basic moves to improve general nutrition. This bookletproduced in the early 1940's by the Wheat Flour Institute, of whichwe are a founding- member, was distributed to schools along with anutrition study kit. General Mills' leadership in the development offlour enrichment is universally recognized. Flour enrichment becamenational policy during World War II. Sonic experts have termed thedevelopment of the enrichment program the outstanding nutritionalcontribution of the century.In 1942, at the request of the War Food Administration, BettyCrocker, then an 18-year veteran of her \"Cooking School of the Air,\"broadcast a special program called, \"Your Nation's Rations It helpedhomemakers make the most of rationed foods. The radio time was donated by the National Broadcasting Co. and Government officialsappeared with -Betty Crocker. Almost 7 million copies of a Betty Crocker wartime booklet, \"Your Share,\" were distributed at this time.Other Betty Crocker wartime publications followed, for one of which General Mills won national recognition by the American Red Cross for outstanding service in the national interest.In the 1940's. as part of a General Mills nutrition education develop- ment program, General Mills produced this film \"And So They Learn.\"It recorded teacher workshop techniques for teaching food values to elementary school children.This was followed in 1948 by \"The School That Learned To Eat,\" a documentary film showing how one school mobilized communityresources to improve health and nutrition. This was chosen for the1948 international Film Festival held at Edinburgh, Scotland, and was seen in schools and on television by an estimated 2 million people.In 1952. a third motion picture was produced by General Mills entitled \"Food as Children See it.\" In all. this was seen by almost a million through private showings and over 4.5 million on television. It told the basic story of thilrition for children and the introduction of good food habits to yomig-, children. It was also used widely in medical and nursing schools where such teaching aids were in great demand.Altogether, this nutritionprogram of teacher workshops, publica-tions. and films reached a conservatively estimated 25 million students. 488 Following this program, nutrition guides and charts like these havebeen distributed through our public relations department to schoolsand to individuals.in 1963, our nutrition services department, headed by Dr. IvyCelender, was established at General Mills. Her primary responsi-bility at first was the distribution of nutrition information to otherprofessionals, dietitians, doctors, and nurses. Over the years, herdepartment has grown to a staff of eight. Staff members have attended37 medical and dietetic conventions and prepared and distributed atotal of 1.5 million messages to the health professions and consumers.This is General Mills policy statement on nutrition and point No. 6reads, \"We will convey nutritional information about our productsaccurately and in good taste, and will work toward bettering nutri-tion education over all.\" This represents an assortment of booklets prepared by nutrition services and the Betty Crocker Department for general distributionon such subjects as meal planning for the golden years ...for young children . .. for the pregnant woman. They have been widelydistributed. \"Pickles and Strawberry Ice Cream\" was an advertised booklet in the Betty Crocker Spokesman column. 490These are general information sheets prepared by nutrition servicesto answer special requests by mail. They include sources of iron,vitamins A. and C, and a listing of the basic four in both English andSpanish.In addition, booklets have been prepared for those with specialdietary problems. Golden Good Cooking is low cholesterol cooking,and the other three are on meal planning for diabetics, planning fat-controlled meals, and meal planning for blood lipid reduction. riR';1 Meal Namingtot!; BloodReduttfan The products and the nutrition education represented by these book-lets may never be found on a supermarket shelf.

Andthis nutritional ink melon chart covers those products in our foodservice division which are distributed through institutional channels.In 1961, General Mills was the first to introduce a cereal fortifiedwith eight essential vitamins. During the past 10 years, more than 100million Total packages have devoted the hack and the side panels tothe subject of health or nutrition. 492This is a current Total package. It shows graphically the ingredientsof a nutritionally sound breakfast. There is also an otter for six newlyproduced nutrition booklets available through the mail. We believe ineducating the consumer who can best use that educationthe patient.After all, few young children have control over menu planning in theirhomes. It is the mother who performs this function, and so it is mostoften to the mother that we direct our nutrition message. To make ameaningful statement on a subject like nutrition require more wordsthan a 30-second television commercial permits. That is why at Gen-eral Mills, we believe strongly in the cereal packageAmerica's secondnewspaperas the carrier of our messages. At the breakfast table andon the cupboard shelf, the package gets repeated exposure. And so, weaddress our nutrition message primarily to parents, and we tell it pri-marily in print.

Over the years, we have distributed some 425 millionmessages. You may add to this additional messages distributed by suchtrade associations as the Cereal institute, of General Mills hasbeen a charter member and to which we subscribe annually.Television commercials can also tell the story of good nutrition. Hereare three of our adult-oriented cereal commercials for Buc*Wheats,Protein-Phis,and Total. All of them stress the importance of a good 503breakfast and the part that cereals play 1II the planning of a goodbreakfast.[Reel of commercials.]1 hope you will be interested in this next film portion. It is not acommercial.

At the present time, these shows are being offeredin 33 markets. Many educational subjects have been featured, and thisone is on food.[Reel of Tennessee Tuxedo.]The chairman of the board of General Mills, James P. McFarland,has stated the policy of the company in these words : \"General Millsfood products will be wholesome, will follow appropriate nutritionalguidelines, and will be consistent with the needs and desires of theconsumer.\"Just as we seek to fill nutritional needs as they become apparent,the company also seeks to provide honest nutritional information aboutits products and to help people improve their dietary habits. We be-lieve that profits measure and reward effective and efficient perform-ance in meeting consumer wants and needs. Profits enable us to meetour obligation to shareholders and to implement the growth of thecorporation. Thorugh them. we also gain the means to discharge ourbroader responsibilities to society in programs such as I have illustratedhere today.Thank you.HEAVILY SUGARED RTE CEREALS . ..GOOD NUTRITION ?Senator McGovEitx. Thank you very much, Miss Bates. I think weall know that General Mills, through the Betty Crocker program, hasstood for good nutrition over the years. and the presentation of thesematerials that you showed here today, is most impressive.These hearings concentrate considerably on heavily sugared food,breakfast foods, and natural foods. We have had testimony from dis-tinguished dental experts about the problem that children, turning tofood of this kind, have.What is your opinion of some of your own company's cereal prod-ucts.' Sir Grapefel low looks and smells like candy. Do you really con-sider that a good nutritional product for children and a good nutri-tiooal educational approach ?Misz, Rms. Senator McGovern, the breakfast, that a child does noteat does him no good whatsoever. We do know that children eat break-fasts that appeal to their tastes, and these products do provide a goodnutritious breakfast when they are eaten with milk. Y01/ have alreadyquoted the figure that 94 percent of cereals are eaten with milk, and webelieve our own findings verify that figure.To our knowledge there is no published evidence I available that,indicates that presweetened cereals or cereals in treneral cause dentalcaries, which is one of the thrusts of our investigation. This is notsurprising as sugar consumption from cereals is only a small portion ofsugar intake. Presweetened cereals account, for less than 2 percent ofI See NE 3. Dr. Siren's testimony, pp 2S3-_'SS. 504total sugar consumed in the United States, and less than 3 percentof total sugar consumed by children.Senator McGovEnx. I was wonderingas I watched your advertis-ing here I noticed you stated on the cerealsTotal and Buc*Wheat,and I forget the other oneI personally find them very appealingcereals, and I consume large quantities of those cereals. Why do youdirect the advertising of those more nutritional cereals to adults?Couldn't you sell that hi skillful advertising to children ? Is it reallynecessary to emphasize the sweetness in order to sell to children'?I have the feeling that what goes onyour television ads on the heav-ily sweetened cereals aimed at the childrenis a fight between themother and the child when you get to the supermarkets, as to what isgoing to come off the shelves.If Total and Bue*Wheats and some of these other products are moredesirable, why couldn't the advertising budget their television timeso that these products are advertised on the children's programs?Miss Rots. We believe these presweetened cereals are good nutri-tious foods. They do appeal to children's tastes, but you must realize.that children watch other television programs besides the so-calledSaturday morning shows, and they see other television commercials aswell.The message that we have on the presweetened cereals is always setin the context of a good breakfast. We are not recommending the useof cereals and milk alone. We are recommending it in the context ofa good breakfast, and we believe that these cereals encourage childrento eat a good breakfast.A PARADOX IN REALISMSenator MCGOVERN. Miss Bates, in some of the printed materialI am referring to one book entitled \"Meal Planning For Young Chil-dren.\" Mr. Choate, who was before the committee, quoted from thehook as put out by General Mills. I think it is an excellent book, andthis is one of the things that booklet warns against:Watch the teeth. Use sparingly foods high in sugar. They take away the op-petitite for more basic food, provide only quick energy and enconrage toothdecay. No coaxing is needed to get children to eat candy, cookies, cake, ortake carbonated beverages. Teaching a preference for other types of food mnstbegin in the highchair age. Offer sweets only at the end of the meal.That is a caution in one of your General Mills products.\"The same company,\" Mr. Choate says, \"spends millions of dollarsin advertising to children\" and he quotes one of your ads that is aimedto children on television : \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, whose cerealis the super - sweetest of their' all ? Is it my Count Chocula, my super-sweet cereal ? Chocsweet is for chocolate flavor.\"Don't those two picture& seem to be in conflict?Miss BATES. The booklet you referred to is an excellent one, andhe hits taken one paragraph out of context. Absolutely everythingthatAs said in that book is accurate. I think it is a correct statement.Sctuator MoGoyEnN. I think it probably is, but the advertising ontelevision encourages the children to use the supersweetest cereal ofthem all. How does that square with the booklet? That is the point.Miss ThvrEs. That squares with getting the children to eat breakfast. 505The number of children who eat cerealswill eat presweetenedcerealsare much lower than you would probably think.Let me tell you: 54 percent of all children at no presweetened cereal at all anytime during the week, and this is a survey, incidentally, of the Marketing Research Corp., data that was referred to earlierby representatives of the Kellogg Co. Then cumulatively 73 percent eat cereal no more than once per week; 84 percent eat cereal no more than twice a week. There is no indication of large or unnecessarily large amounts of these cereals eaten at times other than at breakfastwith milk. With fruit, with toast, it becomes the basis of a good nutri- tious breakfast, and it does persuade children to eat that nutritiousbreakfast, and we think this is most important.Senator McGovEus. I want. to emphasize, Miss Bates, when we are interrogating you on these matters it is not in any way intended to underestimate the value of what the company is doing. I am sure there are very valuable nutritional gains that have been made becauseof the efforts of General Mills and other companies to encourage chil- dren and all of us to have breakfast at all.I think a cereal breakfast can be a very nutritious breakfast, butwhat the committee is trying to get at is some of the practicesit does seem some improvement could be made whereby we could use the techniques of modern advertising to get children to move into nutritional habits that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.You get youngsters dependent on a highly sugared diet, and you have a campaign for people over 30 encouraging them to pass up these sweet foods.I think the advertising budget could be handled more wisely in achieving nutritional standards.Miss BATES. Don't forget that our cerealsthe sweet ones you are referring toare fortified with vitamins, and with iron, and as such they do contribute substantially to the diet of those who eat them.The other sweets that were referred to in that boy 'tend to be the snack sweets which do not have fortification. and ai. of this must be looked at in reference to the foods eaten throughout the day.A sweet cereal eaten at breakfast gives energy and satisfies andstarts the child toward a good active day. This might not be true abouta snack eaten just before dinner which may discourage the appetite.STATEMENT OF SENATOR HUMPHREYSenator HUMPHREY. The more intelligent, the more educated they are, the worse they eat breakfast. I watch the staff around CapitolHill. I come early in the morning. We have college graduates, peoplethat are supposed to be professionals, and they go downstairs and pick up a rollthat you wouldn't feed to a dogand get a cup of coffee, andthat is their breakfast.T scold them, I scold my own staff this way. I say \"Why don't you have a good breakfast ?\" I get up and I have bacon and eggs, cereal, bananas, milk, and I feel a lot better than most people at work because of it.I have had people say to me. \"How can you take the campaign ?\" say \"Nell, I eat breakfast.\" I don't believe in all this business of com-ing up in the office having a cup of coffee arid a roll. 506What is really bothering me. is that I don't think the advertisinggoes to the right people. You get a college degree, and you generallyeat worse for breakfast.The people who eat a good breakfast are out, in the country. Whatthey do is. they get up in the morning, and they have a big breakfast.I am not being prejudiced in favor of farmers, but I watch thepeople in the offices that are so-called professionals, highly educatedpeople who deliberately abuse their bodies, starting out the day with-out having a proper meal. Everything you say about the early morningmeal is true In terms of getting off to a good start.. From there on wecan argue whether or not we ought to be following this or that diet.I am concerned about the excess sugar in breakfast foods as SenatorMcGovern has indicated, and I really believe the companies ought tolook at it very carefully and do something about your advertising aswell as about the overuse of it. I think there is going to be more andmore evidence coining in that. there has been excessive use of sweetcereals. That is my judgment.Most of the Senators on this committee are not grandfathers, but Iam a grandfather, and I have six grandchildren. One of the biggestproblems I havewhich I would like to have you solveis how tokeep on hand all these breakfast foods that they want.. When they cometo our house in the summer. my wife, who has brought, up a good fam-ily and has this good system, says \"You take care of the grandchildrenfor breakfast.\" Well. grandmother feeds them something that theyought to get, but they like Kaboom. I don't know anything aboutKaboom, but my granddaughters won't eat anything else but Kaboont. It is hard on grandfathers. You have got them sold on Kaboom.[Laughter.]T thought. I would add just one thing. Everything I have seen hereis directed toward the middle-class, well-educated Americans. It istrue that some of the worst practicers of nutrition are among the bettereducated people. I don't really believe two or three martinis beforedinner helps your nutrition, and I am not disapproving of it, but Ijust. don't. think it helps you. I think it hurts your teeth a damn sightmore than sugar. [Laughter.] By the way, it adds more weight, alot more weight.I really believe there is a difference between the aiult, advertisingand children advertising. I think your point is well taken. When youare over 30, protein is terribly important in terms of weight, but asa child protein is terribly important in terms of basic structure, phys-ical health, mental abilities. We know a great deal about protein andthe learning ability of children, the lbealth of the brain, so to speak.I would think somewhere along the line in advertising the messageought to get through. How do we educate, how do we DEC the televisionto get to the children in the ghetto? How do we use the television toget to the undereducated with a real message and the mother who hasno education ? There are 12 million illiterates in this country that canneither read nor write, in this great America, they are not going tobe able to read that fine advertisement.CORPORATIONS MUST SELL EDUCATIONI am interested that the corporations take on the job of real nutri-tional education as well as personal hygiene. All these talks to the 507affluent, well, they are going to eat the wrong foods anyway. A goodlynumber of them are, and some of them are going to right themselvesbecause they have learned.What abOut this great group of people that do not readand if theycould read maybe do not readI am not being critical, it is just afact of life. What about these young mothers, or mothers any agethat really do not read recipes? I have held hearings in certain seg-ments of Congress and I am finding out they just don't read therecipes. They have no background that gives them any indication whatvitamins and a balanced diet are about. How does a commercial com-pany sell the product, but also sell an idea? That is what I am inter-ested in, and that is why I want to be on this committee. I think thecorporations of this country have got to use the television foreducation.We know what \"Sesame Street\" can do for children. It is incrediblewhat the program has done for children. Yet we persist in this countryto not using the message of health and nutrition on the same basis. Dowe have to rely on public broadcasting, or are we goin., to have thecompanies the great corporations take this on as a part of their eco-nomic and social responsibility? I would like to know what you aredoing in that area.Miss Bans. General Mills has sponsored a number of educationalprograms for children on the network such as \"Take a Giant Step\" and\"Mr. Wizard.\" You have seen a clip from \"Tennessee Tuxedo\" whichhas been on the air about 10 years now. We have also included someother prize-winning program which I am afraid might or might notinterest the group that you are talking about. That includes \"RobinsonCrnsoe,\" \"Trbasure Island,\" and others. The 30-second commercialthat we use makes it extremely difficult to do more than establish itname and show a food in the context in which it should be eaten ratherthan as a lesson, per se. It is hard to do more than establish the namein 30 seconds. That is why we use the back of the box.However, we have used it for some other things that I did not men-tion to you. I think most of you are aware of \"Katy's Coloring Book,\"the Government - produced program on drug education, and we havehad that on millions of packages. We are now at the point where weare thinking of producing this coloring book, which is also a Govern-ment hook, both in Spanish and English. It is a coloring book directedtoward good food, what food you should eat every day. We think thismight be a promotion of a simple game. That may be a way to spreadthat information.Senator HUMPHREY. We found in the disposal of surplus commodi-ties great waste because of the lack of knowledge on the part of re-cipients as to how to reuse them.What I ant trying to say is this: You are a very well educatedwoman, and members of the committee have had the privilege of col-lege education or at least a broq experience in some public or privatelife, but we have millions of-people in this country that are really thevictims of the lack of education. What I am interested in is at thecorporation level. I know you have to make a profit, and I want you to,but how about. getting a message they can get from the electronicmedia? The print media will never get it to them. They will never readit. There is a big market out there too. You know that. 508I think it would be a good idea to stay at home on Saturday morn-ings sometime and watch the cartoons. I like \"Underdog.\" George[McGovern], you and I also like it. [Laughter.]What is the other one, \"Roving Runner \"? Anyway, those commer-cials in between are tremendous. They do sell these cereals. There is nodoubt about that. I am sure that is why when you go to a supermarketin low-income areas and watch what they are picking up, they arepicking up large amounts of the sugar 'ereals.I just want myaboutfriends in corporate industry to really startto educate peopleut good nutrition through the electronic media,and I think it can be done. I think you can educate people how to takecare of their home, how to take care of their health, through the elec-tronic media. I have been checking on it a little bit.I watched television last night, and there was not a program irt towatch. The same old pattern of shooting down cowboysSundaynight, I might adda commercial for so-called entertainment.CORPORATE POOLING OF TV NUTRITIONAL EDUCATIONI believe it is imperative that we use the corporation structure +o getour messages on betterneighborhood, better health, better nutrition,and not to depend on it as something to be done by 0E0 or sonic ofthe Government programs. Anything you can do on that as a com-pany I think will be very helpful. I would hope that somebody wouldtake the lead amongst the corporations in pooling a percentage of yourTV ads for this kind of nutrition education rather than Kellogg doingsomething on their own, and General Mills doing something, and Gen-eral Foods doing something else. I would hope that they would havean electronic type of program, a percentage of which would go into anone,omme,cial type of education. We call it advertising, but it is reallyeducation. I know you do a lot of it, and I appreciate it, but I thinkthere is so much that can be done over and beyond 30 seconds. Youreally can't do very much in 30 seconds except say \"Hello\". I thinkone of the curses today in the whole business of information is tryingto tell people in 30 seconds how to take care of their bodies, how totake care of their homes, and all of that for one reason; namely, youget money out of it in the advertising rates. I don't believe that is theWay you can save this country's health; not one bit. I think somethingought Za be done beyond that.Miss BATES. We are certainly willing always to review our adver-tising policies, and T think you might be interested to know that Dr.Hayden of the Cereal Institute is here today. The Cereal Institute isthe association through which our cereal companies distribute ma-terials to schools, generically, and perhaps this could be somethinghis organisation could consider.Senator HUMPHREY. T think it would be interesting to find out howmuch is used in schools. I don't mean to underestimate the importanceof print : the boxes, the magazines. I think it is important, but we areliving in an electronic age whether we like it or not, and youngsterstoday get most of their information, outside of their practical experi-ence at home or on the street or in school, outside of that, from the elec-tronic media. That is why these packages sell so well, as I said awhileago, particularly in the low-income areas. Thank goodness you dofortify them. That is right. 509I think you made a goodease about the sweetened cereal and thenutritional value. Again, I take the broader approach. on are a home economist specialist, and that goes beyond the food. Quite obviously the total environment affects the health of the child, and we have had some very good lessons in the breakfast program that Senator Mc-Govern is very familiar with. what it. has meant in learning. idiot. it has meant in school attendance. and health.We also have a correlation be' tween good nutrition and avoidance of drugs. I think it is time we start to get. more medical evidence on this. It is true that. a good nutritional breakfast and lunch makes children less prone to drugs; the cost of the breakfast. or Inneh is incredibly cheap. I would like to have more evidence on that from our specialists. Senator McGovEux. Thankvon, Senator Humphrey.Senator Senwrausu.

I pure an affect ion for sugar.Notwithstandhr that, 1 think I should add something on a sober- ing note which I thinkour committee would he derelict if we did IhOt atleast. make cognizance of it for the record. I have have an article from the Medical World News of February 12. 1971. The article's title asks the question \"Sugar: Dangerous to the Heart?\" with a sabeftption.. and some researeh now points to an intriguing link with athero-sclerosis.\" I would like to cite one paragraph from it and include the article in the record.'Dr. viola. hum 51.1 1. and Pk. 1).. prote4sor of autrithmiliel,ties as I fleatlip. from coronary Se.

Let Inc join in commending Miss Bates on her testimony. I surely appreciate the work that is being done. I will just encourage this great company to take the initiative in attempting to pool the segments of the advertising budget through the food eompanies for general nutritional education.

For you in the advertising industry ... and for those of tp: closely associated with it, and dependentupon it.. those once sunny skies are lemming threatening. A strange wind is rising, and it's not a good wind. We alu al. ,nim mornings and go to work with a -14)se of apprehension and uncertainty Andmorningswe may ...for let's faceit...advertising, as NW kII,M today, is in danger.It is being attacked on all fronts by professional constimeri,ts, theorist, of the now economy, 7 and by many here in Washingto\" ...both in Congles and in the regulatory bod:Make no mistake.

I hasten to add an imputant caution here.(5111 Let's not teak: the mistake of looking upon our opposition as one homogeneoushand of fanatical do-gooders and wide-eyed theorist-. We must amongthose opposition are ninny right-thinkin peoplemen and women ofgood willwho ha. e sincere and thoughtful tpiestior about advertising. And,let us also admit, questions can be asked.But the point remains: there has emerged, or rather there has exploded in thiscountrya deep mistrust of advertising . ..and we need to do something.aboutNow, I mn not going to attempt to lay before goothe Advertising Industryaplan thatwill suddenly and miraculously bring Understanding and Light to ouradversaries ...and an end to their differences with us. I'm sure you didn'thope for that today. The subject of Advertising, vast enough on the surface. isprofound in its implications. And I have no magic potion.Neither do I have a counter \"Counter-Advertising\" Program to submit.And I certainly won't join those well-intentioned laymen who say ..\"Youare Advertising Men. You'r articulate. You're persuasive. You are good atadvertising for others. Now do some for yourself.'While this may be a practical approach, I believe the bee and most practicaltaetics for you in the Ad:ertising Industry are single and individual. Not collective.You ..company-by-company. Not you ..like an army.'!'o support this thesis, I'm going to tell you abort the philosophy of one com-p:MyKellogg's ..what it is thinking about, what we have done . ..and are trying to do . .to meet our advertising responsibilities in today'elintate.I'm going to speak briefly about our products. and our advertising policies.and I'm going to relate these policies to the action- we are taking Imlay in responseto this new consumer environment. I hope in the process that I can stimulatevt,,,r thinking . .and give yon an idea or two for your own company, your(bents or tho-e with whom you work.Let me begin by saying tlat the coasumer movement encouraging betternutrition is not. new to Kellogg's Our Company Inez always weicometrt his move-ment. In fact, we were among its early pioneers.Sett' yea:, ago, our founder, \\V. K.

The accept anee our products have earned with theronsumer, is going to weather t he storm.For example, you might be int el e-tt (41 to krona, that in -tide of I he of breakfa.t, (tete:ifs.

I feel it demonstrates this philosophy of hottest and truthfulproduct advertising.As you know, we manufacture and package individual set vines of our products and assemble a popular selection of them in Kellogg's assorted packs such as Variety. On a per-scrriv basis these packs of individuals are naturally more expensive than the standard package sizes, because it's much more expensive to package them this way. And since our customers are paying more for this con- venience and variety, we want them to know the facts about it. Let's take a look at this commercial...FILMKELLOGG'S ASSORTED PACK Co:nut:new.We're in the second year of featuring this T.V. commercial. Has it caused as- sorted pack sales to plummet downward? Did the consumer resent the facts she gained from this commercial? Absolutely not. Apparently ecnsumers respect and appreciate a sincere and honest advertising approach. Now let's talk for a moment about advertising to children.The viewpoint that all advertising to children is bad and should be \"outlawed\"k based on some strange assumptions.It assumes that parents have no influence, no control and no value as models for their children.It assumes that to want things as a child is not normal and is bad.It assumes that child, en can he \"seduced.' into wrong values by advertising, and that this can be done itt spite of the other influences in a child's life: family. friends, church. school, resoling, and ju.et plain experience and innate human values.It would deny to children the experiences that help them prepare for the day when they're on their own with decisions to make, livings to earn, money to budget, values to establish and independent lives to live. end finally, it ignores the grim realities of the market place. To contend that .1:te need only make some extravagant promise to a child in order to make him a slave to one's product can only seem ludicrous to anyone who has experienced t he futility of trying to justify advertising support of prodnets that. do not enjoy consumer aceet.t:ance.Much like adult... children ha..e very specific want, and preference, when it ...ones to cereal nroduct and we at Nelngg s feel justified in advertising our many different rrodnet, to children.But itnot enough to feel justified in our right to advert ke to children or in ..st ability to execute that advertising.it's(sbvioms to 11.: that companies. like mtr-. min.t consider t a .special privi- lge that lin continuing re-polvibilities. Children are special people and deserve ecial t re:dose:it.

Theyfeel that people need to become aware of their diets, and to become informed of.and to believe in, the fundamentals of good nutrition.Breakfast, almost all nutritionists still agree, is a very important meal in the day.especially for children. A child's performance in the late rooming hours is markedlyimproved if he has had a nutritionally sound breakfast. Yet studies show thatabout one child of five, leaves home in the morning without an adequate breakfast,and that six percent of all children go off to school with no breakfast at all.Since our business is breakfast; we feel this is the area where we should con-tribute ... and canbest contribute ...to the nutritional education andwell-being of the nation.Here briefly are some of the things-that we have done . ..and are doing ...to bring about a better understanding of nutrition as it relates to breakfast.For years we have been stressing the need for a nutritionally balanced break-fastand not just cereal but (Treat as a part. of a complete breakfast. Today everyone of our television commercials, t 'tether directed toward adults or children.shows our products as part of a nutritionally complete breakfastjuice, toast and:Tread, milk and cereal.You may have seen a Sugar Frosted Flakes' commercial last fall, where Tonythe Tiger ran for Pwsident on \"The Better Breakfast Platform.\" This commercialtressed the importance of a complete breakfast and spelled out what a betterbreakfast might be.I'd like to show you hoifThis was done:Film Com M Eitel Air\"VOTE FOR TON YSome have charged that Tony the Tiger is being used to mislead. After viewingthe commercial I believe you will agree the message is positive.In addition to this television activity, we annually schedule a print campaiettthat talks about. better nutrition at breakfast, and again presents our productsm min -the context of a nutritionally complete breakfast. We don't. need to talkabout nutrition at that length, of course, but we're doing it.We, distribute several hundred million packages a year, and what more perfecteducational vehicles could there he than the millions of cereal boxes sitting rightthereon millions of breakfast tables? :4o, we include on our packages, a message onthe importance of %,:aing a nutritionally complete breakfast.For fifty years we have been distributing nutritional information to the schools.This information does not cover breakfast only; it. covers the whole subject ofbalanced diets a;d good nutrition. We employ full time home economists anddietitia,s to handle this, as part of our program.In a few weeks, vac will add something new to our nutritional education efforts... somethingthat we believe, is unique to the food and advertising Industrie-.It's a pleasure to announce here for the first time, an extension of these educationalefforts. A new program which -e consider will make a significant con\u00b0 ilmtion tobetter nutrition. This effort ma be \"The Otuod Breakfast Campaign\" ..a tele-vision campaign aimed primarily at Madre!' with the goal of educating kids onthe need for breakfast.Initially. we are producing two skty-seeond trws.ago. that show fin a war hatkids can understand and relate to) why it's important to eat a good breakfast.And we will show in this message that there ale variety of good tasting, ap-petizing breakfast foods to choose from. We will no 'ocus on a cereal breakfast,although we certainly will anti are proud toinclude cereal in this message, be-cause it belongs there. One of these message. is designed to tell young childrenaboot the importance of eating a good breakfast, The second tune is specifiralk de-signed for schoolage children and their le(dhers.In addition to absorbing the production cost. of Hasse announcements, we areg' dug to take media dollars normally assigned to brand advertising. and purchasepositions ont derision. While this advertising is public service in nature, wewant. to make certain that these messages get aired and are seen by childrenac r,rss this nation. Yet the only mention of Kellogg's is in the closing credit 515We intend to schedule these better nutrition messages on Saturday and wevit- day children's programming. And not just onee in a while. Starting this spring. we will Schedule them:Every week, for the balance of the year,Nationally, on all three television networks,And we will see that they are seen on every Saturday morning ehil- dreu's show at least once.Further, to reach pre- school children, they will be scheduled frequcntly on weekday progratui, such as Captain Kangaroo.And finally, we will schedule the announcements ou network programs where parents can be reached, such as the \"Today Show.\"In summary, over the course of the year, the messages will reach virtually every child in this country at least once, and most of the kids will see them several ;inles.Now I'd like to stop for a moment to show you one of our Public Service mes- sages.FILM COMMERCIAL\" NO BREAKFAST DROOP\"We're very proud of this message, not just because we put it together, but be- range we think it will be effective.Now there is an important final point to be made here ... and that is this: *-.That\" television memo(' would not hay ',ten conceived of ten years ago. But there it is today. It's unique right at this moment. But it won't be unique I.mgand it better not be. We at Kellogg's hope that many other companies: will 10 something similar ... because, like it or not, you and we are all ...tiol living in a new and different climate.Whatever we individually think about it ... whether we individually think to deserve it or not . .. even though we may individually think they're burning&mu the library because one book was. bad ... even though we resent the intem- perateness and injustice of some of the attacks ou the business of Advertising .. AP are living in a new and different %vorld.And We Can't G& Home Again! Because home isn't there any more. Iu conehtsion, I say again that I hope what I lime said here today may give you an idea or two. But, more importantly, I hope it may help to form a resolution for each of you to do something. Because in the long run, we are going to be judged collectively ... as au industry . .. by what we do individually. s.,, let us resolve individually to do somethingand do it now. 4 FROM GENERAL MILLS, INC Prat te.vrioxs AVAILABLE FROM GEYFRAL MILLSThe following publications were submitted for the committee files ; they aleavailable from General Mills, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.:1.

McFarland*Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen: I m\u00bb happy to have this opportunity toaddress so many people who are clearly among the most important in the foodindustry. One need think only of the myriad of ways in which Nod teehnology hascontributed to the welfare of the world to feel deep gratitude toward your pro -fession and those who work in it.At the soune time, I inn a bit hesitant in offering my topic, \"A ManufacturerLooks at Fluid Safety,\" to an audience such as this. You, after all, are the men andwomen with the knowledge, experience and, I am sure, the dedication and concernto determine in great measure the wholesomeness and safety of the food thisNation eats.As a manufacturer, nevertheless, I cam start by empha-dzing that I cant thefood of this nation to be safe. I am sore that wish is shared by every other re-sponsible food manufacturer in America today. There is good reason this is soFirst, food manufacturers are members of society. They eat food. Their familieseat food. Like all of u:, they have a great penonal stake in anything that goes ontheir tables. As responsible members of their communities, they also recognizetheir obligation to malo sure that products reach consumers in the hest of condi-tion with no question of their tithes, or quality. It would seem strange indeed togive personal and worporate tune to solving economic and social problems of thenation, a\" many food manufacturers do, and then distribute the basic products oftheir btrines,es in at unsafe form.Second, food man tfacturers are busine.smen. They depend upon repeat 'ale,,selling their products over and over again to the same 1)(4 )1)1V. Doubt aleatt thesafety of their products would rapidly become a one-way ticket to fainue. As anumber of manufacturers have commented over the year, \"Customers are hardto emit/. by. We can't afford to pop-on them.\"Advancing costs have spotlighted this phase of a manufacturer's self interesttoday even more than in the past. The average cost of introducing a new producton the national market is in the heighborinual of $1 million. On the average, onlyone new product out of nine in the Nod inditsty succeeds in capturing a prohtalde and lasting \"hare of the cwasunter market. 'Ishis means a total investment of S9million or so--to use arbitrary figuresfor each succe,sful introduction. If, afterhemming established, a tun% product is found to be unsafe for any remom, theimmediate monetary 10\" is staggering, not to mention the cost of a damagedreputation.Finally, with the rare exception, found in any area of human life, food manu-facturer seek to be law-abiding citizen. For -elf-protection and the proliTtionof theirthey must insist that their food 'godliet, meet legal requite-ment-4:M mied go well beyond.I am -.lire I don't need to tell your that the safety of the nation's food supply ha,been outstandingly good in a society of growing complexity. We feedand feedbetter than any other nation in the worlda population that has expanded tomore than 209 taillkin people, with very, very few pr Admits identlfied as of foodorigin.Nh NIc Fin land Is chairman and cluetexecutive officer ()is teneral Mills, Inc; 521Nothing, of course, is perfect in this imperfect world. This means we can never relax our efforts to provide a largely urbanized America with food that is in-creasingly safe, nutritious, appetizing, convenient to prepare and reasonable in price. Such contributions to public health as the enrichment of flour and breadand, more recently, the vitamin and mineral enrichment of other foods must be a starting place rather than a conclusion. We must harness advancing technologyto increase the flow of food to a growing population in an increasingly complexsociety, guard against the hiss of nutrients in production, storage and transporta- tion and do all of this without sacrifice of safety.Obviously, you, as food technologists, have a gargantuan task that is growing greater. As I was thinking about my remarks today, for example, it occurred tome that food safety though always important, was much simpler in years pastthan it is todaymaini-liecause we then knew less. Not long ago as history ismeasured, quality contrcl consisted largely of establishing standards for raw materials, strict enforcement of hygiene and sanitation in the processing plantand assnrance of protective packaging to carry finished products from plant to consumer m ith minimum loss of flavor, nutrition, wholesomeness and aestheticappeal. Inspections were largely visual or mechanical, consisting pretty much of seeking out foreign objects in raw or semi-finished materials.Now, refined analytical tools and techniques make it possible to isolate and identify components in food to as little as one part in a billion. Such technicaltriumphs make all of us as modern food manufacturers, even more dependent than in the past tn technologists such as those in this room. More than ever before, we must be partnersalong with farmers, ranchers, wholesalers, retailers andothers, in keeping America the best fed nation in the worldand each yew generation better fed than any that have gone before.Wise, careful use of chemicals has made and is making our food more nutritious, more appealing, economical and easier to use. It has also facilitated the massprocessing and bountiful production that have contributed to so much of our nation's standard of living. Developing chemicals which do the job with safety and rejecting chemicals which present risks is an important current challenge to you as food technologists. Here, you, with Uncle of us responsible as manufacturers,must continually weigh what has come to be called the \"benefit-risk- ratio. As Ihave indicated, some chemical additives have beenand others may befound to create risk, previously unsuspected. Yet it is clearly necessary in our society to keep chemical additives working for us in bringing nutritious and satisfying foodto the American people. Again, this puss an awesome responsibility in the hands ofthe technologist.Personally, I believe there are three basic rules concerning food additives that should be observed without deviation.First,no chemical additive should be used in any product for human con-sumption that is not safe within the closest limits modern and advancing foodtechnology can establish.Second,no additive should be used that is not necessary.Third,the human race must be fed. Tl. s third rule implies that we go ahead with the knowledge we have at any given date if the known benefits sufficientlyover-shadow the known risks. There is, as I indicated, always the benefit-riskratio.Let's go back a moment to the first rule: Only safe additives should be used.As you are all aware, this is easier to talk about than to accomplish. Who knowswhat additives on the GRAS list today may be.rudely removed tomorrow? Wiseand conscientious food manufacturers spend millions of dollars each year on research concerning the wholesomeness of their products. That, however, is a drop in the bucket with regard to the need. If each manufacturer attempted to test exhaus- tively every ingredient he uses in his products, the technical effort would be pro- hibitive because of the duplication.The field of food safety, then, is an area in which government, univdrsities,private research organizations and foou manufacturers can and must work to- gether, viinbining their resources to make an otherwise impossible job possible.This is net a new idea, but it is becoming a more practiced idea. General Mills, forinstance, c. now one of a group of food manufacturers who are cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration in a pilot study of food additives now on the GRAS list. In addition, our company has joined other leading food manufacturersin sponsoring in-depth studies on sulfites, nitrates, phosphates and antioxidants, now being conducted by the Food Research Institute of the University of Wis-consin. These additives, as you know, have already gone through extensive safetyanalysis and have been used in foods for many years. If, however, new information 522shows any legitimate objections to Oka. use, General Mills will take appropriateaction, as I am sure, will others,Another example of the cooperative idea in action is the newly est:11)1;411miNational Institute for Toxilogical Studies, one function of which will he to affordleadership in expanding knowledge of food additives and to draw essential in-formation from all fields. This is an expansion of government activities winch, Ibelieve, we food manufacturers should support and applaud. It promises valu-able, needed help in this all-important field.Ultimately of course, each individual company still must rely on its staff oftechnologists to tell it what not to do as weal as 'Ma to do in using chemical addi-tives. \"Nay-sayers\" are as important as \" Yea iyers,\" sonuaimes more so.Organization, or structure, is important in achiev ng the objectivity that cor-porate technologists need, and you may be in bre. ted in General Mills' organi-zation for quality control which, we believe, is . anti %tat unusual in industry andis highly beneficial to our long-range efforts to s .our customers.First, at the top of our pyi amid, we have a vice president for Quality Control,Nutritional Policy and Food Safety; reporting directly to hint is a director ofProduct Safety, specifically charged to assure the safety and healthfulness of allGeneral Mills food products and the effectiveness of quality control systems forproduct safety.Equally basic is our reporting setup from the field. Traditionally, plant finalitycontrol technologists report to the plant manager, who reports to the divisionmanager. Only in exceptional eases do issues raised by the plant quality control specialist reach the highest management levels, There is often just too muchhuman temptation for plant and t: vision managers to mak decisions that favorincreased productivity and lower cost, the factors upon which their personalefficiency is likely to be judged. In General Mills' present system, the qualitycontrol technologist at the plant level reports to a quality control manager at thedivision level, who reports to the vice president I mentioned previously. Thisvice president, in turn, reports to the president of the company. Although closelycoordinated with operations, this line of responsibility is distinctly separate frontthe.n.Even beyond the president now stands a recently formed Public ResponsibilityCommittee of our board of directors, which ecncerns itself with all mattersaffecting our responsibility to our customers, the communities in which we operateand the nation. What is exceptional about this system is its ability to keep mat tersof quality, nutrition and safety in the hands of professionals from plant to presi-dent, without interference front production or sales people along the way. kebelieve this puts emphasis where it belongs. The quality and safety of what wemake and sell is even more important than manufacturing economics or salesvolume.As we move into the future, there arc some specific additional needs, particularlyrelated to nutrition, with which the manufacturer, in my opinion, needs specialhelp from food technologists. First, industry needs to develop sophisticatedquality control monitoring and control systems to prevent excessive overages ofvitamins and minerals when fortifying products to meet nutrient labeling declara-tions. Too much of a good thing can be dangerous.Second, industry leadership, with the support of technologists, is needed toprevent a nutritional horsepower race between manufacturers, especially in theuse of nutrients with any potential toxicity.Third, food manufacturers need to be careful that their products don't reinforce,or contribute to, food fadism. Balanced, nutritive and healthful diets must bekept as the focus for healthful eating.Fourth, the food industry should be constantly alert to possible \"sins of omis-sion\" as well as \"sins of commission\" on their pact. Nutritional weaknesses orsafety hazards in a product, in the light of its intended use, should be continuallysearched out and corrected through product reformulation Certainly, labelingand advertising should not claim for a product ingredients aat it does not havenor benefits which it cannot confer.Fifth, the food industry and consumers would both benefit greatly from amethod of indicating protein quality not dependent upon lengthy, expensiveanimal tests which are virtually impossible to um.e in quality control. This is anarea in which members of Ir`T, as scientists, might be able to make agreat contribution.Finally, as a manufacturer viewing food safety, I should like to call upon youas food technologists to play a leading role in public educationin giving perspec-tive to the real problems and the false alarms relating to the food our nation eats. 523Much of the convent expressed eoneerning chemical additives in foods, as well ris about herbicides, pesticides, hormones and other chemicals used to boost agrield- r %:%I.l haptrai(tietion. has been helpful. The more interest the American public hasfor what it pays not only protects the individual consenter but provides a market in which superior perfoormers are more dearly recognized. In contrast, the pitiless publicity in the mass media which often necompanies any clonextssioutal investigation, FDA or USDA ruling can erene misimpressbins in the minds of the technically untrained laymen that, at host, cause unpleasant and unnecessary concern and that at :most can cripple the process of meeting the nation's needs for food.In addition. there are alwae- those self-seeking searenumgers who profit from blowing up scraps of fact lino avafanhes of fear and consternation. Wheoever new knowledge becomes available, it should, of course, be used, but it slteuld not be presented to the public inways that stimulate fear or panic, as it often seems to he.feeding of 209 million peoelc in this country, plus countless millions overseas, 15 too big anti too vital a task to be handicapped except where careful seueltifie judgment shows clear necessity. People 41VMM also know exactly what the indiscriminate banning of ehemieals from food and in agricultural produetion would cost themin both chollars and sa:isfaetion. It has lawn estimated that just one effect of such drastic action would be an immediate drop in American farm and ranch psoduction of 30 to 90 percent and complete loss of the year- around availability of many of the coovenience foods which have become a part of our nation's life. Rectifying any shortcomings there may be in our present foodproduction and conservation systems is a job for surgeon's scalpel, not the butcher's axe. The public should know this, and food technologists. beeause of your basic knowledge and your day-to-day contact with advancing science, are in key poseions tocontribute importantlyto the educationalprocess. I wish that I could give youa blueprint for exercising leadership in this field. Ican only urge you to write and speak forcefully at every opportunity, to correct errors as you observe them and possibly, through the Institute of Food Tech- nologists, to launch a vigorous, formal educational program. In this latter con- nection, there may he opportunity for work with other organizations. I understand that the American institute of Nutrition is seeking to organize the American Society of Clinical Nutrition, the American Dietetic Association and the Institute of Food Technologists in a united effort to deal with nutritional emblems as they arise and to help form a national nutritionIf I have accomplished nothing else today, I hope I have underscored the Importance that .von, as food technologists, have in assuring our people of food that is both safe and ample. In summary, a quotation front a book entitled, \"Food and Societ.\" by the English writer, Dr. Magnus Pyke, be appro- priate. (It seems:\" says Dr. \"there is no escape from danger. The eon- seientious food scientist in his search for nutritional excellence is confounded by the diverse facts of human behavior, by custom, tradition, feeling and religion, by the motives other than health which drive men to choose what they like, by the availability of foods from the hind and availabilityor lack of itof meeey. And now, ou the other hand, in his endeavors to avoid harm from poisonous substanees, tile rational man is again faced with problems. The first is that he (toes not possess sufficient knowledge of the t Imposition of the foods he eats. The second problem is what the Americans are calling the \"benefit -risk ratio.\" Among the benefits are the contribution of pesticides toward the production of a food supply of superior quality and sufficient quantity, the protection and pres- ervation not only of food supplies but of the fiber, wood, textiles, the control of disease vectors, and the improvement of residential and recreational environ- ments. The progress of science can be defined as the mutinous minimization of doubt. The enlightened food scientist must, therefore, appreciate the opposing influences which lie has to try to understand as he endeavors to make wise decisions.\"As a food manufacturer looks at food safety, he sees great challenges but also great {mantises of a better. healthier, happier world through improved nutrition and improved food safety for all. For leadership in this quest, ladies and gentle- men, we must look first and foremost to you. ITEM 2-SUBMITTED BY 0 rHAN WITNESSES FROM SENATOR SCIM.-AKER 41ectleat work, Sews.

It coats our pills, it sweetens our coffee. Everybodylikes sugar, perhaps because sweetness is the first taste an infant senses.But sugar is a relative newcomer to our diet, and sonic scientists arc concernedabout its safety. Certainly we do not consume 2 lb per person per week of anyother dietary additive.or have we been taking that much sucrose for long:Sugar has been important in our diet for less than a hundred years.Sarkara in Sanskrit, sugar seems to have originated in India or Southeast.Asia. Though beloved by the Persians. it remained unknown to the Creeks andto the West for centuries. It was introduced to southern Spain by the Moors andto other parts of Europe by the Crusaders.For centuries, it was a..ailable only from apotheearies..vho sold it by the ounce,as caviar is sold today. For the rich man or the court sugar was 0 preciousluxury for use on great occasions: Even Elizabet ha..times,all of Englandconsumed only about $8 tons a year. To the man itt the street, sugar was practicallyunknown. For sweetening he relied on scarce supplies of bee's honey. which ischemically not sucrose, but mostly fructose and glucose. These sugars can beabsorbed into the blood without change, whereas table sugar-isucrosetaustfirst be digested into glucose and fructose.In this country, sugar helped start the Revolution when colonists objectedto taxes on it and the tea it sweetened. After the Revolution, sugar played aprofitable part in the triangular trade whereby New Englanders bought slavesin Africa and so:2 them in the Caribbean to work the sugar plantations. boughtmolasses (a hypro Met of sugar refining) there and took it hack to New Englandwhere it was distiited into rum. which was then shipped to Africa to buy slaves.Widespread cultivation of sugarcane in Latin America, the discovery of processesfor refining sucrose from beets in 19111-century Europe, and improved transporta-tion all made it possible for Western man to cultivate his sweet tooth, and fewbut dentists and dieters have objected.Dr. John Yudkin does. lie thinks sugar is an important cause of heart disease.And a surprising number of people think he has a point .Dr. Yuflkin, both M.D. and Ph.D., is professor of nutrition and dietetics atQueen Elizabeth College of the University of London. From his quieton Campden Hill in Kensington, the biochemist-physician has raised a storm bystressing that deaths from coronary heart disease, which have gone up dramati-cally in the past .50 years, are more closely related to increasing sugar consump-tion than to any other dietary change. From the 4 lb a year he ate :11 1750, thestatistical Englishman increased his consumption to about 25 lb in the 1859..Today it's about 120 lb a year, or 2.3 lb a week.Individual sugar intake can range from as little as 20 gm a day to as much as400 gm, 01 nearly a pound. The average in Dr. Yudkin's studies is about 140 gma day, or 980 gm (just over 2 lb) a week, but his method of recording intake tendsto underestimate by about 15%.I See e. 509. (525) \"There k Tin enormous variation in sugar intake with class, m its sex; 4and with age,\" Dr. Vudkin points out. \"For a given age, men eat more sugar thitinvomen.e find the sugar intake is maximal at the age of about IS or 20. and then it goesslim ly down throughout life.

However, the figure may me:1 b nigher than 99 lbs. because nianv methods of recording dietary intake tend to chrestimate. The bepartment of Agriculture, which compiled a comprehensi \\ e study of typical American diets among allclasses, ages, and areas in 1965 by questioning liousewk es about their families'eating habits, says sugar consumption may be underestimated since fhe house-wives My omit, or not know about, the snacks MIIS11111K1 by their husbands andchildren while away from bow.

Furthermore, some food manidaeturers now add sugar to food productssuch as soups, vegetable juices, and salad dressings, Much arc not consideredwhen total sugar consumption is estimated.According to tin ee researchers at the State University of Iowa Drs. 'Mohamed AAntar,largaret A. ()bison, and Robert E. Ibidgesaverage American sugarconsumption may be as high as 200 gm per person per day, or an almost iper:dible170 lb per year.But, even in these quantities, is there any reason to believe sugar may beharmful, apart from its contributions to tooth decay and obesity? Epidemiologicaland historical studies by Di. Yudkin ;:ad other infarction. Dr. Yudkin's hypothesis,and that of most other resemehers in thi. area, is that high sugar ciakinnptionleads to atherosclerosis, perhaps through an impairmn' of gincoses.toleranee.Diagnosing atherosclerosis during life heir g a fairly uneertam business, studies aremade of mortality from atherosclerosis heart disease and sometimes of morbidityas indicated by angina pectoris and peripheral arterial disease.Rates of infarction have increased greatly in the rich countriesof theJest in the past 40 or 50 years, and this increase correlates more'closelyto the increase in sugar consumption than to the increase in fat, consumption,according to Dr. Yudkin. Some researchers dispute him on this point, savingthat the relationship to saturated -fat intake is slightly better, but that the bestdietary correlation is to intake of satc.rated fats and sugars. (When nondietaryfactors are tallied, the best correlation of all is to radio and TV sets, and the nextbest is to automobile registrations. As Dr. Yadkin points out, this is not as sta-tistically crazy as it sounds, since ownership of radio and TV sets and can is ameasure of physical inactivity.)As a comary grows richer, the average diet increases in total calorieg and alsoin the amount of fats and sugars it contains. Compared with the poorest conntries,the diets of the richest ones arc 50% higher in calories. Fat intake is four or fivetimes higher in the rich countries, but theme is not so great a difference in carbo-hydrate intake. However, there is a considerable difference in sugar intake. Richnations eat less of the complex carin,hydrates from bread, cereals, potatoes, andstarch, and more of the simple carbol,,drates from sugar. Sugar intake, gram forgram, is almost identical with fat intake, according to Dr. Yudkin's figures,In the U.S. the average diet is 40% to 50% fat, about 40 carbohydrate, and 10(i) to 15% protein. In the diet-heart study of Framingham, Mass., (MWN,Sept. 11, '70), where fat intake is lower than the U.S. average, about,40% ofthe calories Caine from fat, and about 70% of the fat was of animal originAccord-ing to Dr. Yadkin, consumption of fat in the U.S. has increased by about 12.5%since 1900, and the proportion of saturated fat has actually gone down 'lightly.In the same period, sugar consumption has doubled. And, of course, thert has beena very great increase in deaths from myocardial infarction. r- Elsewhere in the world, researchers have studied populations experiencing greatchanges in their diets, hoping to find sonic dietary factors to explain increasingrates of heart disease. Dr. A. M. Cohen and his colleagues at the WothschildHadassah University 1 f ospital in hrusithi\u00bb looked at Yemenite immigrants, who 527had a significiitly greater incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and raked plasmacholesterol and beta-lipoproteins after they had lived 1. rsrael for 25 years ormore than did recently arrived Yemenites.To Dr. Cohen, this presented an opportunity to compare the effects of the dietof the Yemenite Jews as eaten in Yemen and in Israel. First he questioned severalhundred Yemenites about their food habits when they lived in Yemen, and found\"two striking differences ... mentioned by all ofthem. First, the main source of fat in Yemen had been mutton fat, beef fat, and Samne (butter pre-erved byevaporation of itwater content). Second, the quantity of sugar used in Yemenhad been negligible \"'Working with a Yemenite-born, Israeli-trained dietitian, he studied in detail20 Yemenite families in Israel less than ten years. The housewives were ques-tioned on the family eating habits and the amomits served. These recollectionswere checked by measuring the ettoaeity of the kitchen pots brought from Yemen,so that aecurate estimates of servings could be made. Filially, all the food infor-mation ff a- checked with the husband, who in Yemen had done all the foodshopping.Another group of 20 Yemenite families who had lived in Israel for more than 25years was studied, with the dietitian visiting daily for a week, measuring qua\u00bbtitiesserve d, checking daily menus, and noting the amounts in provisions and cookeddishes um the kitchen. Among the points noted were the amounts of animal fats, ofmargarine, of oil (which in Israel meant the mono or poly-unsaturated soya,sesame, and olive oils), of total carbohydrates, of sucrose, and of mono- anddisaecharides floor flint, vegetables, milk, honey, and sucrose.Comparing the diets eaten in Yemen and in Israel, Dr. Cohen found a slightinerea,e in calories (and in average body weight) in the 25-year residents and nochange in total protein. It was a different story with fats and sugar. \"In Yemen,the fats were mainly or solely of animal origin; vegetable oil was rarely used. Theamount of fat from animal sources eonsmed in Yemen was similar to the amountof animal fat plus margarine consumed by old settled Yemenites in Israel. IT'Israel, there is a -mall increa,,e in oil consumption and consequently in total fat,\"but the oil was, of course, vegetable oil, and the fat changes did not, in Dr. Cohen'sview, explain why kchemie heart disease and diabetes are relatively rare in newYemenite immigrants. The diet in Yemen was neither a starvation nor a semi-star% :idit one and could not, account for the low cholesterol and low beta-lipo-protein le% els in the miefyvonier group.That left sucrose.

The epidemiologieal and statistical -.tinny, may indeed point the way, as theyhave done in the areas of smoking and (quiet% and or contraceptives and throm- bosis. but clinical studies would make the point more strongly-. At the moment,this is an area of hot international dispute and conflicting opinions. Severalyears ago Dr. Yudkin and an associate, dietitian Janet Roddy, began investi-gating the diets of patients with recent proved myocardial infarction. Had theybeen eating mom e sugar than controls? How much mote? For how long?They compared the diets of patients who had suffered a first. myocardial in-farction in the past three weeks and who said they had not changed their dietsin the pre% ious five years with patients suffering tram peripheral arterial disease(an indicator of atherosclerosis) and with normals. They found that the twogroups with arterial disease had double the sugar intake of the controls, andDr.udkin expressed himself as predicting that persons taking more than 110'nn of sugar a day were five Hines as likely to develop a myocardial infarction ashe taking less than 60 grn.A considerable flap ensued, centering on the validity of the dietary questionnairemethod, the idea that sugar was treated by the body in the same way as any ,,,hercarbohydrate, and the, fact that some other workers did not find patients withmyocardial infarction to have a significantly higher sugar intake. Follow-up7 studies by Dr. Yadkin and MN. Roddy showed that the questionnaire methodwas as reliable as the food-dairy method, and other investigators confirmed tins.They also found that people's sugar intake was usually regular: People tend totake the same number Of spoons of sugar in their coffee or tea, for example, andarc similarly regular in the amount of soft drinks, pastries, and candy that theyconsume. Sugar intake is also easier to measure, and can be measured moreaccurately, than that of most other foods.The difficulty :1 substantiating higher sugar intakes in tnyoeardial infarctionpatients in othertndies often turned on a time factor. Dr. Yadkin mid N1N.Rode had interviewed their patients within three %%eeks of the first infarct:other workers often interviewed patients later. Doctors frequently ad% ise suchpatients to lose weight, and sugar is usually one of the first things to go.Dr. Yudkin emphasizes that he does not believe high sugar consumption is theonly cause of heart disease, which, he told a WN is probably multifactor'al, in-volving such risk factors as diabetes, physical inactkit y.Dr. interestin Britu, and theledical R search Council set up a working party of dis-tinguished physicians and epidemiologist to investigate a possible link Ilean-Mule, in Scandinavia, the niedical boards of Finland :Did .4%% elk!)

After dinner he has a final cup for the day. 4529In one day the sugar maven has consumed approximately 3.5 oz. of sugar, or 24.5 oz. a week, just over a pound and a half. Both medical and sugar authorities agree that visible sugar makes up about one half of a person s total dietary intake, t he rest being in candy, deserts, snacks, and soft drinks. If so, then the sugar maven is taking just over :3 lb. of sugar a week, %tell above the national average.With Dr. Lars A. Cat,on he then investigated the relationship between serum lipid, and abnormal glucose tolerance in patients with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and intermittent claudication. Half the coca had sera plasma lipid abnormality, most often an elevation of serum triglycerides, and more than half had either a borderline or a dialr,'e intravenous glucose tolerance test. Fewer than 20r;) had normal serum lipids together with a ormal intravenous gliwose tolerance. The women .hewed a similar pattern, but in neither group could the researchers find a relation-hip between abnormal glucose tolerance and high scrumtriglycerides.Another group of Sea ndi\u00bbavian corkers, led by Dr. I. Christiansen at the Blegdanishopit al and the Itigshopit al in Copenhagen, fommd that patients u it h ischemie heart deae but without clinical d''etes formed tuo groups. In those with impaired glucose tolerance there waslaved, le-s marked rise in ,ertitti insulin in response to the glucose load and a relatively high concentration of free fatty acids following glucose loading. \"These feature.,\" they reported, \"correspond closely to those seen in patients with maturity-onset diabetes.\" In the other grtnip of patients, those with a normal glucose tolerance, Dr. (lire.- Hansen found abnormally high concentration- of erunt insulin in the fasting state and bottoming injection of glucose. Such patients, he suggested, could maintain a normal glucose tolerative only by raimg the erum inutin concentration, a tote often seen in older potpie. Like the Stockholm researchers. they found no correla- tion between the eoncentratitons of serum cholesterol and '^rum Dr. Epstein, in Michigan, vets ugge.zted that high level- of serum cholesterol and of t he trigIeerides \"are both predictive, In it among different groups of peopleone type that rem c-ent- t he %%tritons degrees of hype' chole-terolentia, the other type related to carlaohydrate--en,ithe hyperglyeeridemia.\"A- to the tole of agar in raising the triglyceride level, D.ps.e.n said, \"I think there's no question that in the so-called Type IV hyprlipoproteinentia, a high carbohydrate intake, whether it's from refined or etomplex -ource,, will lake tiiglyeerideThey have trtmlde metabolizing carbohydrate, whatever it k.

Kilosays, \"and as a result would be suffering from the consequences of the so-calleddiabetic state.\" Since 1965, working with hunrms, he and his team have demon-strated that a high intake of carbohydrates increases the pre-beta-lipoproteinparticles that incorporate and carry the various blood lipids in the body.Meanwhile, back in London, Dr. Yudkin had been working with rats andthen human volunteers and finding Wu.: differences. In animals receiving a high-sucrose diet, he found an impairment of the insulin s3stin that seemed to be dueto the rapid 1111011M-1ns on blood sugar. With human volunteers fed athero-genic\" diets high in cholesterol and also in either starch or in sucro.e, he foundthat both starch and sucrose groups had high serum cholesterol levels, but thatthe group on the high cholesterol high sucrose diet had increases in serum tri-glycerides too, and a decrease in the week following the removal of sucrose fromthe diet.About one third of his volunteers seemed to be particularly sensitive to ahigh-sucrose diet, responding with greatly incrce.ed levels of triglccridcs andscrum immunoreactive insulin (especially duriu, a glucose tolerance test), andalso with a weight gain and a significant increase in platelet adhesiveness. Thisled Dr. Yudkin to suspect that some people may be much more sensitive to highsugar intake than others.lie also found that those taking sucrose excreted small ammmtsabout 00mg a dayin the urine, contradicting the belief that sucrose is always completelyhydrolyzed before absorption and raising the possibility that these small amountsmight be related to changes in cell metabolism. Other English worker:, in animalexperiments, found that rats fed sucrose or fructose had more body fat than ratsfed glucose, gained more weight, and had a higher lipid content in their abdominalfat.What may happen, many researchers suggest, is that ^ high sucrose intakecontinued over many years may lead to an impairment o, ie insolin response,perhaps a delayed but prolonged response. At the same time, high levels of circu-lating insulin (:Iso found in obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, andovert diabetes) may be damaging to arterial walls and lead to the deposition ofatherosclerotic plaques.That was roughly where matters stood until late December, when the MedicalResearch Council's distinguished \"working party\" published its report of thedietary sugar intake of men with myocardial infarction-. Carried on at threecenter. one inLondon and two in Scotland, along lines 'o but not identicalwith 1)r. Yudkin's studies, the investigations revealed that patients with myo-cardial infarctions consumed onl% slightly more sugar than control:, and thedifference was not statistically significant. They also found that a high sugar;ntake was related to smosing habits: Nonsmokers and ex-smokers took lesssugar in their tea. And the experts concluded that Dr. Yudkin's hypothesis was\"extremely slender.\"1)r. Yudkin does not agree, not at all. \"What I think they were trying to dowas simply to demonstrate that Yudkin was wrong in showing a high sucroseintake in people with coronary disease. They have convinced themselves they'vedone that: they then went a bit further by saying the whole hypothesis is non-sense. I think they were wrong on both scores. I don't believe their result, andeven if they were true, I don't think it undermines the hypothesis.

Our Food Project is con-cerned with foods and nutrition, the food industry, and governmental regulatoryagencies Last SeptemberI testified before your committee on unnecessary usesof food additive.I have followed with interest your current inquiry into the nutritional qualityof breakfast foods. I share the opinions of several witnesse, who deplored thehigh sugar content of some videly advertised and sold products.The breakfast food companies have been before other congressional committee,in recent yeas and are groping for ways to counter the enormous publicity thatcongressional hearings have brought to detrimental effects of popular and profit-able products. Several manufacturers, including General General Foods, and Quake), have issued \"nutritional policy statements,\" which enunciate thesefirms' stand, regarding the nutrithmal value of their products.

Generalwill produce its frostings and Quaker its sugary breakfast foods.Itis st\"lel. by the producers of jtin; foods that everyone will intelligently balance his or her diet. This is an attractive theory, but it is more fantasy than fact. The food manufacturers pi nd millions every year on advertising profitablenotnutrition,products and are themselves largely responsible forthe general public's Inability to ehoo,e a sensible diet. Many American, havesuccumbed to sophisticated r at ttra t advertising teehniques and haat% been gradually shifting from traditional menus to profitable, but wholesome and nutritious, products.Food industry executive, claim they are aware that americans may be con--inning poorly balanced diet,. James P. NIcFarland, Chairman and Chief Execu-tive Officer of General NIills, said on October 30, 1972, that :\"... food manufacturers need to be calefal that their productsdon't reinforce, or contribute to food faddism. 13alaneed, nutritiveand healthful inte,t be kept as the focus for healthful eating.\"But Thomas S. Thompson, Senior Vie( President of Ile..earch and Developmentat General Foods, suggested an alternative to balanced eating in June 1971:\"Now more and more we just eat fun foods to the exelu,ion of moretraditional food,and it follows that these foods must 1w nutrition-all balaneed.\"Mr. Thompson's half way measure of fortifying fun food, is clo,ely related toa principle expressed in all of the policy statements. General Milk zays it this way:\"...we tuu,t continually monitor changing food consumptionpattern, in the United States and do what \u00bbe can to fill nutritionalneeds as they becopie evident.\"'chi, is an example of the policy stater vontradictory nature. Food manufacturers admit that people eat large amount, of \"fun foods.' and theypromise to adjust nutritional standards to meet the county'.: need,.

Ni.tra ione.ts don't yet know enough to ensure that all lost nutrients will be reolaced. But the food companies' refusal to honor even theirqualified promises to fortify in light of an obvious need is a telling indication of thewont of their nutrition d policy statements.Nutrients are frequen, ly destroyed during processing; restoring the lost vitaminsand minerals is often apractical as it is desirable. Itestming nutrients to proc-essed foods is not, altys to the liking of the foodmakers. Some of the policystatentents findto excuse their companies from doing so. Generalfor example, is willing to restore nutrients \"when it is possible to do so withoutfalling below acceptable thresholds of taste, stability or appearanee.- The prodnetis trade regardless it's only that nutrients arc left out if they detract from itssensory characteristic:,.Are the people from the Big G (General Mills) doing their level best to fulfilleven their limited promise to fortify?

Pillsbury manages to return vitamin Clost on the journey nom skit toboxto all their dehydrated rtato prodo.74.. French's restoi es the vitamin toote of its potato mixes. Bei ty Croeker has chosen not to restore anyof her potatoes.No wonder that some people say that the Big G stands for the Big Gyp.The food industry is fond of extremes;, no, or too few, nutrients in a horde ofprolnets, and arttlieially supeifortifying a chosen few to an unneees-ary andpossibly harmful extent. Sonic food manufacturers arc vying with each other tosee who can pump the most vitamins into a certain type of pioduet. This -o called\"horsepower race\" is most noticeable in breakfast Quaker's and General Mills' \"Total\" and \"Kalmom\" contain 100c; of the NI DAfor six vitamins and minerals, yet people like Mr. McFarland of General Millspontificate about stuffing too many vitamins into foods:\"Industry leadership, with the support of teehnologists, is needed toprevent a nutritional horsepower race bet ween mannfiwturei:.,especially in the use of nutrients with any potentml toxicity.\"Evidently Kaboom crunches louder than Mr. McFarland speak:, and the Big Gpolicy statement explains why: ..selected products inay he fortified to higher levels thanthose suggested by such guidelines (National Research Counciland the AMA) if there is a real need or want by consumer for suchsupplements to their diet::.\"If thitre is a \"need\" it can often be more cheaply met with a vitaniin pill or,better yet, it balanced diet.

Organization for Special Projects inNtdrition.Seniorpersonnel in many area of the Company, of course, have major nutritional responsibilities. Researchand Development, Marketing, Consumer Services and Corporate Affairs all have on-going responsibilities for specific programs. Additionally:1. A senior marketing executive is charged with marketing responsibilityfor nutritional projects designed for special categories of the population;e.g., hay-Meome ethnic groups, products for sales to governments, etc.2. The equivalent of at least one full-time staff nutritionist will be involvedin contributing to nutritional programs beyond the norml scope of busi- ness, e.g., working on hunger and malnutrition problems in the U.S. andinternationally, coordinating Quaker research with the most contemporarythinking in food and nutrition in the U.S. and throughout the world.G. Internal Educaton Programs.--The Research and Development Division and the Corporate Affairs Department have responsibility for conducting nutrition and consumer education reviews for general managers, marketing managers and support personnel, formally on at least a once-a-year basis and informally at all t Imes.H.Industry, Government au.' Company glivernment antconstmiers. We consider \"consumerism,\" in fact, to have been our businesslong before the word was coined and applied in a different context. We support the development of :1 sound national nutritional policy, and where studies such as the current one by the National Academy of Sciences for the Food and DrugAdministration indicate that our own policies should be modified, we will net accordingly. We also will support and initiate legislative and regulatory actionthat loeets the legitimate needs of consumers, with a particular concern for those at low-;ncomeANufitrfioNAL CONTENT OF FOODSIn accordance with the Company's basic principles of providing products whichare high quality, useful, and of genuine value to consumers, the manufacture andnutritional fortification of &sal products is guided by a dynamic nutrition rationale.This rationale takes into aeelaint such factor:: as the changing eating patterns and thus the changing nutrient needs of the consumer, data front dietary surveys, food htws, dietary food standards and nutritional guidelines and pivermnentalappointed el aunt t tees, social and/or ethnic implications, competitive impact,ultimatecost cif nutriticm to thn consumer, the consumers' impressions of whatnutrients a food should contain and, of course, the end use cif the pnaluet by the consumer.When considering the nutritional %lk(' of foods, their eicergy content must not ite overlooked or underrated. Calcifies ar required for w( if -being and are necessary 10 support all physiological processes of the body. Individual requirements forcalories vary widely, depending upon age, stage cc growth, activi y level, amid envininmental influences, aiming other factors. Therefore, individuals must adjust their caloric intake to meet their own energy requirement.Since sunue foods will serve primarily as sources of calcifies, other food products shouldprovide inqairtant nutrients in excess of their caloric content to supplement these primarily energy foods.In conjunction with the foregoing, it is the policy of The Quaker Oats Companyto classify foods by category and produce foods that meet the wininmuu criteriafor their category:1. Vocals associated with the four major food groups:(a) Milk group (includes ice cream and cheeses);.16)Fruit and vegetable group;(r) Meat group (includes fish, dried brans, and nuts);(4)Bread and cereal groupThese foods will provide balanced i nutrition as served, taking into account the nutrients normally contributed by these food classes.2.

This is to assure that all opportunities to provideimportant and necessary nutrients, either as primary or secondary objectives,are considered. Periodic review of existing products is conducted to determinewhether changes in consumption pattern:: or the development of new technologysuggest opportunities to upgrade the nutritional characteristics 14 establishedproducts.B. LABELINGThe Corporate Nutrition Policy with respect to labeling rests on three basicpremisesconsistency, simplicity, and legality, with the ultimate objective ofproperly and ndequately informing the consumer about ingredients, size, useand nutritional eon' ent of the partienlat product.Consist( ricy.The consumer is confronted with thousands of different foodproducts in the retail supermarket. One of the methods. a manufacturer can use toprovide meaningfull and useful information to the often confused consumer 14consistency in his labeling practices. This metals consistency and uniformity inthe wording he uses as well as in the placement of that wording on the .ackage.It means practicing that consistency in n11 product lines, and it means en, ouragingother manufacturers to achieve consistency in their labeling. We have workedand will continue to work cooperati lv with other manufacturers, with the govern-ment and with consumers for uniform and menningfulSintplici1 y. Simplicity goes hand in hand with consistency. It is applicable toboth the %cords chosen to explain ingredients, suggested size of serving. use ornntritionnl content and to the appearance and size of the package. Specifically,describing the functions of certain food elements such as vitamins. minerals,protein, etc., in a wide variety of ways should be avoided when such descriptioncan lead to consumer confusion. We intend to include 'm our pLekages simplifiedstorage and handling directions and package yield instructions (where necessaryor desirable). We also will put ingredient lists on all standardized products.Lrgality.--Currently, there are several laws and regulations dealing with thekind of information a manufacturer can or must give the consumer on a packageof his product and the type of package and material he can use: the number ofthese laws and regulations is growing. some of these are general directions andsome are extremely specific. It is obviously the policy of The Quaker Oats Companyto adhere to the requirements of the law, but our commitment goes beond theletter of the law to the spirit of the law. We share the stated objectives of lawsto adequately inform the consumer. V5;$9To help achieve the goals of simplicity, consistency and legality in our packaging and labeling, we have developed the attached format (using the Life Cereal ex- ample) to present nutritional information on labels where the product makes a significant nutritional contribution to the diet and such information would he meaningful and helpful to consume',. Where appropriate and meaningful. the function of nutrients with which tl.c public is not generally familiar will be identi lied. In addition, all labels will state: \"Additional nutritional information on Quaker products is available on request.\" This informs consumers of our Millie.- mess to make further disclosures which may be helpful to an individual, bin, meaningless to the general public.It. will be the general policy of the Company that products displaying the same brand name within product categories shall contain similar nutrient profiles. It is recognized that. there may he instances where it is desirable to have a single high nutritional product in a product category (e.g., a high-vitamin pancake mix). If this is done, the label design will clearly differentiate this product from others in the line although a similar trademark will appear. The labels of products which are universally considered to be consumed in conjunction with another foodstuff, or wlare recommended to be consumed with another food, mayoffer nutrient lis_ of the content of a serving of the product with the contri-bution of the combined foods for the same nutrients when legally permissible. We recognize the need to present on labels easily readable, important informa- tion, and this legibility is directly associated with proper type size and style, and sufficient color contrast. The Director-Graphic Desii..a, the Corporate Af- fairs Department and the Law Department will provide guidance to the Flotilla Management Department as to what acceptable in so far as type size and style and color contrast are concerned.Objectivc.It has been and will continue to be our intent teacoonerate whole- heartedly with private and public groups and organizations to achieve the goal of having well-informed consumers using proper informational tools. We recognize that our labels arc one of the most significant of these tools.Format for Nutritive Statement(ExampleLife Cereal)A one -ounce serving (approximately cup) of Life the following: Weight (mePercentminurumdilly adultrequirements'Thiamine (vitamin .00061 2.0 -107.t.Percent composition.Note: Sodium would be listed under MOAR percentiles and Br and Bc would be listed under other nutrients when appropriate for other products.C. ADVERTISIN.4 AND enoatortosThe advertising of food products must be viewed not only within the context of its ability to persuade consumers to purchase, but also itability to truthfully and acemately represent the merits of the product. Advertising is an enormously powerful tool capable of motivating millions of consumers. When purchasing a product, the consumer acts in good faith, trusting the manufacturer to have accurately represented the product in its advertising. It is obvious that this environment creates the need fur a strong social conscience on the part of the advertiser.A 540The following arc gfiidelines for the treatm, .tt of nutrientsjnutritio. in theadVertising of Quaker food products:1.

However, wecaution again:St the extremes of either attempting to ntake nutrition experts outof the genetal public, or of over- simplification,particularly in labeling.

Broad nutritional understanding Will be promoted through theprevionslv-described guidelines for advertising and labeling.2. The Company will provide nutrition education information message;on its packages. These are not related to ntarketing claims for the specificproduct.3. The Company supports and will continue to support. better under-standing of nutrition in many ways beyond general advertising andpackaging. Among these are:(a) Special publications and programs for schools and women'sorganizations:(b) InfOrmation supplied to food editors;(e) Television programming that contributes to nutrition educa-tion;(d) Inclusion of specific nutrition education information, includingmenu planning, in all recipebooks and similar company publications;.s ft4.541(c) Cooperative Initrition education programs with the NutritionFotindation, the Grocery Mantifitetitrers of Atnerica, the FoodCouncil of.

GENERAL FOODS NUTRITION POLICYGeneral Foods recognizes its repon.sibility for the nutrient content of the foodproducts it produce;. The company, therefore, will:Define a scientifically sound nutrient specification for each of its prod-ucts, except where the product's contribution is known to be primarilysocial or pleasurable.Deliver to the consumer a product fully meeting this specification.Describe clearly on the package label the nutrient content of prod-ucts, except where the product's role is known to be- primarily social orpleasurable:Reflect the product's nutrient content properly in advertising and pro-motional materials where appropriate.General Foods will continue to work with _goverumental agencies and tradeassociations to See that valid standards, sound - practices, and appropriate lawsand regulations relating to nutrition are forniulatectand put into force.The Company will also Work actively With-scientific thotight leaders in -educa-tional, governmental, and_ private organizations to combat hunger and malnu-trition.

Our point of viewis that the consumer is exceptionally able to copewith advertising claims, that he or she is usually keenly aware of product differ-ences in use and that this experience is reflected in repeat purchase.Cummings Is chairman of the executive committee of Compton Advertising and chairman of theAmerican Advertising Federation.(543) it 544A cola-di:fable point was made of the existence of a group of consumers thatrepresents-high levels of product usage.

This staggering colkumption has increased by 40 per cent since 1909,- when the Department of Agriculture started keeping track of such ntimbers.And,_ perhaps even niore iinprirliint, the risein _sugar -oonsumption has acconmanied difference in the Manner,in which _ it is-eaten. Sugar experts -say that a generation ago three-quarters of an Ainerican'S sugar-consumptioncame front a box bought at the grocery; today it's one4rOarter. This means that Americans today are shaking only-half :IS Many spoonsful of sugar on their food but are eating even more Sugar, mainly as an ingredient in qua foods.\" Soft drinks, chewing giim and candy account for one-quarter of-our annual sugar binge. But in the snitch of American habits -to conVenience foods, sugar - is appearing more frequently in a Much wider variety of products besides pastriesand ice cream. Robert B. 'Choate, a WaShingtint consumer advocate Who has been warning of the dangers of sugar, told the committee that. sugar -may be found in the most unlikely foods such as canned coned beef hash and ketchup. Sugar critics contend that children are being deliberately-conditioned by tele= vision ads to develop a sweet tooth and that as they grow older they do not know what the taste of real food is without, sugar. This, according to the critics, makes food processors better able to Market, products that have been artificially sweet- ened because they pander to a falsely enlitine'ed palatability.During one four-year period in the 1960's the'amount of sugar used in processed foods increased 50 per cent. Sugar is now used in sonic luncheon meats, hot dogs and salad dressings, as well as in canned and frozen fruits and vegetables. And sugar has become increasingly identified with breakfast cereals.Dr. Jean Mayer, a nationally known nutritionist itt Harvard, has repeatedly deplored t he increasing sales and promotion of dry cereals formulated with sugar which now account fpr one-third of the S1-billion-a-year breakfast food market. lie told the committee he is especially annoyed because child' en are being bom- barded by television commercials to have their parents buy the products, some of which are more.than 50 per cent sugar.The presence of sugar in the month !needs a class of nciero-organisms called streptococci nttans. These bacteria in turn secrete substances rich in :acids thatreact with and demineralize the hard outer coating of the tooth. The woceN4 is even more insidious because this enamel coating. is not uniformly thick so that the thinner layers near the gums and in crevasses between teeththe areas hardest to cleanare the places most susceptible to decay.Dr. Mayer told the committee that the promotion of higher sager cereals, Hacks and .oft drinks also \"way be a factor in increasing t he likelihood of diabetes in genetically vulnerable subjects.\" Ilk point was that many, pevons an eating sugar unknowingly including diabetics and persons who do rot have clinicaldiabetes but would develop it by eating sugar. Excess sugar also can lead to obesity, which in tarn can pioduce heart disease.The sugar-in-everything craze has .prompted prorosals that ads for such products be banned from television programs normally viewed by children. In addition, a Boston gioup, named Action for Children's Television, filed complaints(545) 546with the Federal Trade Commission last week against seven candy, snack andcereal makers and the .CBS TeleviSion Network alleging that they are \"directingunfair and misleading advertisements to-children.\" The goup complained that children's shows are bombarding their viewersup to 40 times till hour with ads fer.sugar=rich products preSeuted in such a lightthat a child becomes indoctrinated into-believing that sugar is good.Some of- the compaities:tboycottedAriSt-,Week's Senate hearings, which openedaptly daring \"American,NutritiOnNeek,\".! saving that if.there is blame for over-sugared food it iheifild 'be shared with the-soft=drink, chewing gum and catl3makerS.
