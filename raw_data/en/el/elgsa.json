Ancient Chinese believed that the prevention of illness is more critical than any cure. A healthy lifestyle includes eating the right food. Food is also the primary source of medicine when one is sick. There is a long history of meditation in China to keep people calm and give them wisdom. In the 30 minutes of feature presentation, audiences will hear legends about ancient Chinese doctors and discuss how to integrate traditional values into their daily life for better health and positive impacts on society. Caltech alumna Wen Chen (Ph.D. '00) has been interested in ancient Chinese art and history since childhood. She cherishes her heritage by bridging eastern and western communities through public speaking. Accessing literature in a country without censorship and internet blockage is a blessing to her curation and sharing of this knowledge as her unique service to the community. Since 2012, she has given over hundreds of presentations to local organizations about Chinese culture, history, and society.
