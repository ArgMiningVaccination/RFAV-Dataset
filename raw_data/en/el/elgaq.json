Regulation 2 amends the Standard Committees (Wales) Regulations 2001. It makes provision: for local authorities to establish joint standards committees and the membership, remit and operation of such joint committees; amending existing provisions relating to the length of the term of office of members of standards committees; to clarify that a relevant authority is exempt from making the report or recommendations of an investigation available for public inspection until the proceedings are concluded; and setting out the procedure that applies where an investigation of misconduct is transferred to the standards committee of another relevant authority. Regulation 3 amends the Local Government Investigations (Functions of Monitoring Officers and Standards Committees) (Wales) Regulations 2001. It sets out: details of the procedure for appealing against the decision of a standard s committee and specifies that an appeal may only proceed if the President of the Adjudication Panel for Wales or a nominee considers that the appeal has a reasonable prospect of success; and the duties of a monitoring officer in relation to the operation and decisions of a joint committee. 2 Regulation 4 amends the Standards Committee (Grant of Dispensations) (Wales) Regulations 2001 to provide a procedure for a member's application for a dispensation to be referred to the standards committee of another authority for determination. The detailed provisions are as follows \u2014 Regulation 2 Joint Standards Committees Part III of the Local Government Act 2000 (\"the 2000 Act\") makes provision with respect to the conduct of local authority members and employees. Section 53(1) of the 2000 Act requires every relevant authority in Wales, that is, a county or county borough council, fire and rescue authority and a National Park authority but not for this purpose a community council, to establish a standards committee which is to have the functions conferred on it by or under Part III of the 2000 Act. The Local Government (Democracy) (Wales) Act 2013 (\"the 2013 Act\") amended section 53 (1) of the 2000 Act to enable two or more relevant authorities to establish a joint standards committee. Under section 53(11) of the 2000 Act, the National Assembly for Wales may by regulations make provision as to (among other things) the size, composition and proceedings of standards committees of relevant authorities in Wales including joint committees, and of any sub-committees established under section 56 of the 2000 Act. The functions of the National Assembly for Wales in this respect have since been transferred to the Welsh Ministers. Regulation 2 amends the Standard Committees (Wales) Regula tions 2001 to make provision for the appointment of community committee and independent members to a joint standards committee and also to limit the number of executive members of a joint standards committee. Further provision is made to ensure that every meeting of a joint standards committee is attended by a monitoring officer of one of the constituent relevant authorities. In addition, the constituent relevant authorities of a joint standards committee must agree which one of them will be responsible for preparing and sending their terms of reference to the Public Ombudsman for Wales. Provision is made to specify that the length of the term of office of a local authority member of a standards committee is the period to the next ordinary local elections. The previous four year limitation has been removed. 3 Publication of Misconduct Reports Section 51(1) of the 2000 Act imposes a duty upon all relevant authorities in Wales to adopt a code specifying the standards of conduct expected of their members and co-opted members. Under Section 69 of the 2000 Act the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales may investigate any alleged breach by members or co-opted members (or former members or co-opted members) of the code of conduct of a relevant authority in Wales. Where the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales ceases such an investigation before it is completed (under section 70(4) of the 2000 Act) the matter subject to the investigation may be referred to the monitoring officer of the relevant local authority. Alternativel y, where the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales determines (under section 71(2) of the 2000 Act) that it is appropriate for the matter may be referred to the monitoring officer of the relevant authority, the Ombudsman must produce a report on the outcome of the investigation and send it to the monitoring officer and the authority 's Standards Committee. Regulation 2 makes provision to exempt a standards committee or sub-committee from making a misconduct report or recommendations available for public inspec tion until proceedings under the Local Government Investigations (Functions of Monitoring Officers and Standards Committees) (Wales) Regulations 2001 are concluded.. The Regulation also sets out the events that will signify the end of the proceedings and give rise to the obligation to publish the materials as soon as reasonably practicable. Regulation 3 Section 73 of the 2000 Act enables the Welsh Ministers to make regulations specifying how matters referred to a monitoring officer and standards committee are to be dealt with. The Local Government Investigations (Functions of Monitoring Officers and Standards Committees) (Wales) Order 2001 sets out the responsibilities of the monitoring officer and the standards committee in relation an investigation, the production of a report and the outcome of an investigation. Section 69 of the 2013 Act amended the regulation - making power in the in section 73 of the 2000 Act so that the Welsh Ministers may make provision enabling a monitoring officer or a standards commit tee to refer a report or recommendations relating to a misconduct investigation to another relevant authority's standards 4 committee. Regulation 3 amends the Order to set out the procedure to be followed for such a referral. Regulation 3 also amends the Order to modify and clarify the duties of a monitoring officer of a relevant authority where that relevant authority has established a joint standards committee. In relation to the right of a member to appeal against the decision of a standards committee, Regulation 3 provides that an appeal may only proceed if the President of the Adjudication Panel for Wales or a nominee has first granted permission for the appeal to proceed. The procedure and timescales that apply to such an application are set out in detai l in the Regulation. Regulation 4 Regulation 4 amends the Standards Committee (Grant of Dispensations) (Wales) Regulations 2001 so that a monitoring officer or standards committee of a relevant authority may refer an application for dispensation to the standards committee of another relevant authority.
