Subjects were followed every six months for 3 years. The vaccine contains two genetically engineered HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein molecules, based on two HIV isolates (named MN and GNE8). VaxGen hypothesized that the level of vaccine ecacy would be higher against exposing HIVs with gp120 amino acid sequences that were relatively similar to at least one of the HIV strains represented in the vaccine.

Background. A vaccine is needed to prevent human immunodeciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Methods. A double-blind, randomized trial of a recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein subunit (rgp120) vaccine was conducted among men who have sex with men and among women at high risk for heterosexualtransmission of HIV-1. Volunteers received 7 injections of either vaccine or placebo (ratio, 2:1) over 30 months.The primary end point was HIV-1 seroconversion over 36 months. Results. A total of 5403 volunteers (5095 men and 308 women) were evaluated. The vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 acquisition: infection rates were 6.7% in 3598 vaccinees and 7.0% interval, /H1100217% to 24%). There were no signicant differences in viral loads, rates of antiretroviral-therapy initiation, or the genetic characteristics of the infecting HIV-1 strains betweentreatment arms. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed nonsignicant trends toward efcacy in preventing infectionin the highest risk np247 np914 Pp.10 multiple subgroup comparisons). Conclusions. There was no overall protective effect. The efcacy trends in subgroups may provide clues for the development of effective immunization approaches. The creation of a vaccine to combat the global HIV-1 pandemic is an international public-health priority [1,2]. Although infection leads to the development of anHIV-specic immune response, the immune system isgenerally unable to effectively control replication of thevirus or to prevent immunosuppression [3]. Nonetheless,there is evidence of a protective immune response incertain special circumstances [4-9]. There has also beenconsiderable debate with regard to whether antibody-mediated or cell-mediated responses are of primary im-portance in providing protective immunity [3, 10, 11].

Phase 1 and 2 studies in uninfectedhumans have demonstrated that rgp120 is safe and ableto generate antibody responses similar to those ob-served in the protected chimpanzees [15-17]. Two versions of an rgp120 vaccine candidate advanced to phase 3 studies in 1998-1999. The rst study was toevaluate a bivalent subtype B/B rgp120 vaccine in indi-viduals in North America and The Netherlands who wereat risk for infection via sexual exposure, whereas thesecond study was to evaluate a bivalent subtype B/Ergp120 vaccine in injection drug users in Thailand [17,18]. Here, we report the results of the rst of these studiesdesigned to evaluate whether an rgp120 vaccine can con-fer protection against HIV-1 infection.
