Contributing to teaching at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden and solving existing problems in healthcare Together with other professorships of the University of Applied Sciences Leiden, the professorship Anthroposophic Healthcare contributes to finding solutions for current problems in conventional healthcare.

This leads to developments in the direction of: - health promotion, - introducing 'stepped care' ('first least intrusive treatment methods in primary health care'), - reducing the use of medicines and - stimulating patient competence and self-management. Anthroposophic care has accumulated years of experience in finding a practical application for these concepts. The professorship Anthroposophic Healthcare also contributes to education, in particular the anthroposophic Art Therapy education. "}
