KEEP A WALLET-SIZED NOTEBOOK OF ALL MEDICATIONS YOU ARE TAKING.Know Your Meds While you are hospitalized, your doctor may prescribe medications for you. Be sure that you understand exactly what they are and why they are being prescribed. Use this checklist to help you get the information you need from your doctor: What is the name of the medicine? What is its generic name? Why am I taking this medicine? What dose will I be taking? How often, and for how long? What are the possible side effects? Can I take this medicine while taking my other medications or dietary supplements? Are there any foods, drinks or activities that I should avoid while taking this medicine? Preventing Falls Patients often fall because they are on medications that make them dizzy, they are weak and unsteady due to illness or medical procedures, or they've been sitting or lying down for too long.

Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs) can cause infections that are difficult to treat. An MDRO is a germ that has become resistant to one or more classes of antibiotics. This means that infections caused by an MDRO are harder to treat with antibiotics. MDROs are becoming more common, but there are ways to prevent these germs from spreading and ways to prevent new drug-resistant germs from emerging. T o help prevent infections: Get Vaccinated. Barabas Health employees are offered a number of vaccines to prevent illness, which keeps our staff healthy and lowers the risk of spreading infections to you. V accines also are available to you and are encouraged. Speak to your doctor or nurse should you have any questions about vaccines. Contain Germs. If you are found to carry a germ that could cause infections in other patients, visitors and staff, we will place you on certain precautions in a private room to prevent the spread of germs to others. Staff and visitors will wear protective equipment such as gowns, gloves and/or masks to prevent spreading germs to others in the hospital. Check tubes and drains. Urinary catheters, IVs and other tubes and drains are sometimes needed for your care, but they also can provide a route for germs to enter your body. While in the hospital, our staff will assess and care for them routinely to help prevent infections, and will remove when no longer needed for your care. After Prevention Comes Treatment It is not always needed to treat an infection with an antibiotic; sometimes a wound can be cleaned out and it will heal without any need for antibiotic therapy. If you have an infection that needs to be treated with antibiotics, our laboratory can use the samples taken from blood, urine, stool and wounds to assess which antibiotics are the best for treatment.Stay Safe continued Diagnosis Our lab can identify drug-resistant organisms taken from samples of blood, urine, stool and wounds. X-rays and other tests also can help us to identify infections from areas in the body where it is difficult to obtain lab samples. Tell your doctor about signs and symptoms that you have, and if you know that you carry, or have had infections from an MDRO such as Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) or Clostridium Difficile, which is referred to most times as C. Diff. Remember to ask your nurse or doctor if you have any questions about how to stay safe. www.barnabashealth.org/jcmc 201-915-2000 : 19What are Your Advance Directives? Advance Directives Y ou have the right to make decisions about your own medical treatment. These decisions become more difficult if, due to illness or a change in mental condition, you are unable to tell your doctor and loved ones what kind of healthcare treatments you want. That is why it is important for you to make your wishes known in advance. Contact a patient advocate for assistance. If you did not bring your advance di - rective with you to the hospital, please have your family or trusted friend bring it to the hospital for your record. Here is a brief description of each kind of directive: Living Will A set of instructions documenting your wishes about life-prolonging medical care. It is used if you become terminally ill, incapacitated or unable to commu - nicate or make decisions. A living will protects your rights to accept or refuse medical care and removes the burden of making decisions from your family, friends and medical professionals. Healthcare Proxy A person (agent) you appoint to make your medical decisions if you are unable to do so. Choose someone you know well and trust to carry out your wishes. Be sure to discuss this with the person before naming him or her as your agent. Remember that an agent may have to use his or her judgment in the event of a medical decision for which your wishes aren't known. A healthcare proxy is especially important if you have no close family or your most trusted friend or companion is not your next-of-kin. Bioethics Consultation Service Y ou have the right to contact our Ethics Committee on any ethical concern during your hospital stay. The Ethics Committee may help when you or your family is uncertain or confused about what course of action to take\u2014such as what should family members do when they disagree about what is best for the patient; when should life-prolonging treatments be started, continued or stopped. Y ou may contact the Ethics Committee through the patient advo - cate or palliative care nurse practitioner. There is no fee for these services. Palliative Care Program W e have a Palliative Care Program run by a board-certified geriatrician and palliative care nurse practitioner.

An advance directive is a document that allows you to direct who will make healthcare decisions for you and to state your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to decide for yourself. Your advance directive may be used to accept or refuse any procedure or treatment, including life-sustaining treatment.
