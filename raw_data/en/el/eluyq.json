This is the time frame between the first two iterations of the North American Research Conference on Complementary and Integrative Medicine (NARCCIM). The first was in Edmonton in 2006. The Sponsors, Leadership and a Salute to Multidisciplinary Diversity The conference is the anchor production of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM, or \"The Consortium\" as the representatives of the 44 member academic health centers self-refer). Researchers and faculty in integrative medicine from these medical schools were much in evidence. In addition, the organizers, led this year by Aviad (Adi) Haramati, PhD, of Georgetown University made a point at every step of the way to include other disciplines and professions. The Participating Organizations were a robust list of 26 groups, ranging from the American Association of Medical Colleges to professional, educational and industry organizations representing acupuncture and Oriental medicine (AOM), naturopathic medicine, massage therapy, chiropractic, herbal products, Yoga therapy and others. The program team, led by health services researcher Dan Cherkin, PhD, included Christine Goertz, DC, PhD, and Richard Hammerschlag, PhD, the co-chairs of the Research Working Group of the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC), a separate consortium that includes councils of colleges and schools for the licensed complementary healthcare fields. The Consortium extended a grant to ACCAHC, through which 15 students from these fields were granted scholarships to the conference. >An Exceptional Event: The North American Research Conference on Complementary and Integrative Medicine Written by John Weeks | Tuesday, 23 June \"\u0007 I\u0007was\u0007impressed\u0007by\u0007 the\u0007convergence\u0007of\u0007 a\u0007diverse\u0007group\u0007of\u0007 academic\u0007researchers,\u0007 united\u0007by\u0007a\u0007common\u0007 concern.\" 4 Pre-conference meetings were hosted by the Pediatric Complementary and Alternative Medicine Network (PedCAM) and the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research (ISCMR). Programming dedicated to New Investigators, namely students, residents, trainees, and early-career faculty was inaugurated. Events included a mentoring lunch featuring senior academics, social events, and scientific poster critiques. Approximately 150 people attended the mentoring lunch that received numerous comments about the quality of the program and the desire for more dedicated time for similar events. The drive for inclusion proved successful. The program, developed by Cherkin's team through a peer-review process, as well as the attendance at the conference itself, each manifested a deep level of integration. Many panels of speakers and featured discussions included teams from diverse backgrounds. The Consortium successfully honored its own definition of \"integrative medicine\" by \"making use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing,\" or, in this case, to create an optimal conference. To the organizers' credit, ample time in receptions and breaks was allowed for the assembled multitudes to mix it up. A Meeting Between Two Consortia One notable, even historic, pre-conference event was a meeting of members of the Steering Committee of the conference' sponsoring organization, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM) and the leadership of the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC). The 4-hour joint meeting began with introductions and short slide show presentations on each consortium's make-up and activities and continued with small group sessions exploring collaboration. A reception and dinner, hosted by CAHCIM, followed.

The study of the placebo effect and of its negative counterpart, the nocebo effect, is basically the study of the psychosocial context around the treatment and the patient, and it plays a crucial role in the therapeutic outcome in both conventional and complementary/ alternative medicine. In recent years, different types of placebo effects have been analyzed with sophisticated biological tools that have uncovered specific mechanisms at both the biochemical and cellular level. This recent research has revealed that these psychosocial-induced biochemical and cellular changes in a patient's brain and body are very similar to the biochemical changes induced by drugs. This new way of thinking may have profound implications both for clinical trials and for medical practice. Fabrizio Benedetti, MD, is Professor of Physiology and Neuroscience at the University of Turin Medical School in Italy. He was consultant for the Placebo Project at the US National Institute of Health and member of the six strong Placebo Study Group of the Mind-Brain-Behavior Initiative at Harvard University. He held positions at the University of California in Los Angeles and at the University of Texas in Dallas. His current scientific interests are the placebo effect across diseases, pain in dementia, and intraoperative neurophysiology for mapping the human brain. He is author of the book Placebo Effects: Understanding the Mechanisms in Health and Disease which is in press by Oxford University Press.Conference Coping, and Well-Being: Integrative Medicine meets Behavioral Science Wednesday, May 13, 2009, 4:15 PM - 5:00 PM Made possible through the generous funding of Mayo Clinic - Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program Medical science and behavioral science underwent dramatic, but separate, trans-formations during the 20th century. However, changes in disease patterns and advances in technology have awakened the interest of each in the other and now integrative medicine (or integrative health) provides an organic crucible for their convergence. Behavioral science is something of a mystery to many who are trained in the medical sciences. This talk will focus on stress, coping, and well-being to illustrate the process of behavioral science and its relevance to integrative models of care. Susan Folkman, PhD, is Professor of Medicine and the Osher Foundation Distinguished Professor of Integrative Medicine at the University of California (UCSF) where, since 2001, she has been Director of the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine. Dr. Folkman received her PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in 1979 where she remained until 1988 when she moved to UCSF. Her research program, which has been supported by grants from the NIH, has focused on stress and coping in the context of serious illness and bereavement. In 1997, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands, for her contributions to coping theory and research. Dr. Folkman served as a member of the NIH/NIMH National Advisory Council has chaired NIMH and NCCAM review committees, served on Institute of Medicine study groups, and was chair of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine from 2004-2007.Helene Langevin, MD Connecting the Dots in Human Physiology: Lessons from Complementary and Alternative Medicine Thursday, May 14, 2009, 8:00 AM - 8:45 AM Made possible through the generous funding of Woodwinds Health Campus Twentieth century advances in medical technology have been a major factor in the compartmentalization of medicine into sub-specialties and loss of emphasis on the \"whole patient\". Perhaps more fundamental to this phenomenon is the basic organization of human physiology into systems that tend to be studied in isolation from each other. Many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, especially those inspired by Eastern philosophies, traditionally emphasize connections (such as mind/body) that have already influenced the practice of mainstream medicine. Using her pioneering work on connective tissue as an example, Dr Langevin will discuss how CAM is increasingly inspiring the recognition of new connections across physiological systems that are influencing our understanding of human health and disease. Dr. Helene M. Langevin is a Research Associate Professor of Neurology, Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation and Director of the Program in Integrative medicine at the University of Vermont College of Medicine. For the past ten years, Dr Langevin has been an internationally recognized leader in the fields of acupuncture and connective tissue mechanotransduction. She currently is the Principal Investigator of two NIH-funded studies investigating the role of connective tissue in chronic musculoskeletal pain, acupuncture and manual therapies. She has served on several NIH Review panels and is a past Co-President of the Society for Acupuncture Research. Dr. Langevin's training includes an MD degree from McGill University, post doctoral research fellowship at the MRC Neurochemical Pharmacology Unit, Cambridge, England, residency in Internal Medicine and fellowship in Endocrinology/ Metabolism both at Johns Hopkins Hospital. \"\u0007 The\u0007extensive\u0007 ideas\u0007and\u0007innovations\u0007 were\u0007most\u0007valuable.\" 7Conference Keynote Presentations Fraser-Liggett, PhD The Role of the Human Microbiota in Health and Disease Thursday, May 14, 2009, 4:45 PM - 5:30 PM Made possible through the generous funding of The Penny George Institute for Health and Healing, Abbott Northwestern Hospital The microorganisms that live inside and on humans (known as the microbiota) are estimated to outnumber human cells by a factor of ten. Together, the genomes of these microbial symbionts (collectively defined as the microbiome) provide traits that humans did not need to evolve on their own. To understand the range of human genetic and physiological diversity, the microbiome and the factors that influence the distribution and evolution of the constituent microorganisms must be characterized. It is expected that these studies will reveal new insights into the role of host genotype, host physiological status (including the properties of the innate and adaptive immune systems), host lifestyle (including diet), and host environment (at home and/or work) in the modulation of the structure and function of the microbiota in health and disease, and new opportunities for preventive approaches to disease that specifically target the microbiota. Claire M. Fraser-Liggett, PhD is Director of the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD. Until 2007, she was President and Director of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in Rockville, MD, which has been at the forefront of the genomics revolution since a landmark publication Dr. Fraser has authored more than 200 publications, edited three books, and served on the editorial boards of nine scientific journals. Her contributions to the fields of genomics and microbiology have been acknowledged by many agencies and professional societies and her list of awards include the E.O. Lawrence Award, the highest honor bestowed on research scientists by the Department of Energy, the Promega Biotechnology Award from the American Society of Microbiology, and the Charles Thom Award from the Society for Industrial Microbiology. She received her undergraduate degree summa cum laude from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and her PhD in Pharmacology from the State University of New York The\u0007overall\u0007feeling\u0007of\u0007 Investing in Complementary and Integrative Medicine: Where the Cost Effectiveness Agenda Stands Friday, May 15, 2009, 8:00 AM - 8:45 AM Made possible through the generous funding of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota Governments, private insurers and international aid agencies face competing demands on limited resources for investing in health. The resulting resource allocation decisions evolve from a range of medical, economic, financial and political considerations. The World Bank, for example, occasionally receives governments' requests to finance investments in complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) and has, over the years, made multiple CIM investments. What are reasonable economic and financial criteria for the World Bank or national governments to use as inputs to such decisions? This talk provides an overview of some of the relevant issues. One important economic criterion is intervention cost- effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) attempt to answer the question of how much it will cost to buy more health if additional dollars are spent on a given intervention. Results are expressed as the cost per death averted or per disability-adjusted life- year (DALY) averted, and the presentation will review findings of CEAs of CIM interventions. While these are useful, it will be important in the future to undertake CEAs of packages of CIM interventions and to assess CIM as a platform for addressing a portion of population health needs. Further research is also needed on the capacity of CIM to reduce expenditures on more costly alternatives, to reduce time lost from work and to improve product satisfaction. When CEAs are extended to include this broader range of issues, the relative attractiveness of CIM is likely to improve. In this context the presentation will briefly assess how the financial mechanisms within the health sector can assure adequate levels of investment in CIM. Dean Jamison, PhD, became Professor in the Department of Global Health at the University of Washington in July 2008, where he is affiliated with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In 2006-2008 he served as the T. & G. Angelopoulos Visiting Professor of Public Health and International Development in the Harvard Kennedy School and the Harvard School of Public Health. He concurrently served as a Professor in Global Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. Before joining the UCSF and Harvard faculties, Jamison had been at University of California, Los Angeles (1988-2006) and previously at the World Bank (1976-1988). His publications are in the areas of economic theory, public health and education. Jamison recently led the Disease Control Priorities Project, for which he was senior editor of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition, and an editor of Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors, both published by Oxford University Press in 2006. Jamison studied at Stanford (A.B., Philosophy; M.S., Engineering Science) and at Harvard (Ph.D., Economics, under K.J. Arrow). In 1994 he was elected to membership in the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Jamison has served frequently on advisory groups to national and organizations. \"\u0007 Thank\u0007you\u0007for\u0007exposing\u0007 my\u0007husband,\u0007the\u0007 traditional\u0007physician,\u0007 to\u0007the\u0007evidence\u0007of\u0007the\u0007 value\u0007of\u0007integrative\u0007 medicine.\" 9Conference Keynote Presentations Wednesday May 13, 2009 Conference Schedule at a Glance 7:00am - 5:00pm Registration Desk Open (Third Floor Foyer) 6:30am - 7:15am Experiential Session 1 Tai Chi - Peter Wayne (Salon G) Experiential Session 2 Yoga - Susan Gould Fogerite (Symphony IV) 7:00am - 8:00am Continental Breakfast Buffet (Third Floor Foyer) 8:00am - 8:15am Welcome and Meeting Overview (Salons ABC) 8:15am - 9:00am Plenary Session I Keynote Speaker: Fabrizio Benedetti, MD (Salons ABC) 9:00am - 9:45am Coffee Break and Poster Presentations (Group 1) (Salon D) 9:45am - 10:45am Oral Abstract Presentations Session 1 Models of Complementary and Integrative Medicine (Salon A) Session 2 Complementary and Integrative Medicine for Back Pain (Salon B) Session 3 Relaxation/Meditation/Therapeutic Touch (Salon C) 11:00am - 12:30pm Concurrent Scientific Sessions Symposium Research on Yoga as a Therapeutic Intervention (Salon A) Symposium Changing the Culture of CAM Institutions Toward an Evidence-Based Approach -One R25 at a Time (Salon B) Symposium Research in Homeopathy - Where Do We Stand and Where Should We Go?
