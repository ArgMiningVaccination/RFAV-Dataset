Influenza virus has been cata - strophic in the history and currently large-scale disease outbreaks in southeast China, Asia, and Netherlands has attracted the attention of virology researchers and sociologists. In the two recently largest history records of 1968 and 1918, 750,000 and 40 million people respectively died of the catastrophic outbreak of some deadliest influenza virus strains [4-5]. The pandemics of the past century includes the cata - strophic H1N1 Spanish influenza of 1918, and H2N2 Asian flu of 1957 (more than million deaths globally), and the H3N2 Hong Kong flu of 1968 (-0.5 million deaths globally) [6-7]. Avian flu virus is one of these influenza viruses, and human's fear for avian flu is therefore no less than those of other deadliest viruses, such as HIV/AIDS and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). Since the re-outbreak of avian flu endemic might take place at any geographical location on Earth at any time in fu-ture and the completed effective therapeutic means have not been avail - able worldwide, therefore it is no wonder why there are growing worries among world-leading virologists, epidemiologists and political leaders who are endeavoring to handle avian flu spread seriously. Current Treatment Means All Over the World Currently, the most usable and effective way to the prevention of the avian influenza endemic is to remove the virus spreading sources culling and slaughtering the birds, chickens and ducks on large scales [2] and isolate and treat patients with vaccines, neuraminidase inhibi - tors and/or antivirals individually at the same time [8-10]. Antiviral drugs ought to be a major countermeasure to reduce the spread of virus in humans. Now common types of the antiviral drugs are as follows: 1.Virus uptake inhibitors (M2 ion Zanamivir, Peramivir; they are more useful in earlystage of disease, and resistance to this type of drug is relativelyless common, but has been reported [6,9]. Major Problems of Current Therapeutic Means Major problems of current therapeutic means are only effective to early stage of disease of these therapies and there is increasing re - ports of drug resistance [11]. There is also high mortality rate in some highly-infectious and highly\u0001-\u0001toxic virus strain outbreak and sometimes the mortality rates or infected patients can be higher than 30% [12]. Since the avian virus is sometimes highly infectious, patients who suffer may be large volume in population; one percent increase of mortality rates may cost hundreds or even thousands of lives. Thus highly effec - tive therapies are in high demands. One of them is by using traditional Chinese medicine.Treatment of Virus Infection by Traditional Chinese Medicine China has a long history of using of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the spread of large-scale cold (similar like avian flu) endemics, which probably makes China the most populated country in the world. It has been effectively used since Zhong\u0001-\u0001Jin Zhang (AD150-219) in China [12]. Traditional Chinese medicine can combat the dis - ease by strengthening, modulating and offsetting damaged organs and\"Y ang and Ying\" with a formulated herb. There are several formulatedsoups for cold (infected) fever (similarity to avian flu symptoms) ac - cording to a cheaper way andherbs are available all the times. This theory has been successively con - trolling a lot of virus-infected endemics throughout in the long historyof China. We propose that this type of treatment should also be furtherstudied and used. The most frequently used prescription in the groupof expelling exogenous wind\u0001-\u0001heat was Yin\u0001-\u0001Qiao\u0001-\u0001San. And wind-cold Jing-Fang-Bai-Du-San. Thefrequency of using Ma\u0001-\u0001Xing\u0001-\u0001Shi\u0001-\u0001Gan\u0001-\u0001Tang to remove toxic heatobstruction in the lungs was up to 100% [14-17]. This treatment options can also be used as the preventive therapy of large human population inpotential avian flu epidemic conditions. Importance of Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment of virus infection by Chinese medicine has two thousand years history. It has three advantageous (i) it targets the disease severe symptoms. It is the disease severe symptoms that lead to patients' death; (ii) the recipe of traditional Chinese medicine is of multiple compo - nents. Thus it is not easy to produce drug resistance and have combinedeffects in virus-treatment. (iii) High reputation of traditional Chinesemedicine. There are a lot of successful examples in prevent large scalevirus-disease endemic in Chinese history. It means that traditional Chi - nese medicine may be used in future epidemics. Future Direction However, traditional Chinese medicine is not familiar in Western world and it can not be practiced in those countries. We believe these conditions can be improved by further studies and communications be - tween the two cultures. There are a lot of studies to do if we think it is useful and deserved. *Corresponding author: Da Yong Lu, Associate professor, School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, China, E-mail: ludayong@sh163.net Received May 01, 2012; Accepted May 03, 2012; Published May 07, 2012 Citation: Yong Lu D, Ren Lu T,Ying Wu H (2012) Treatment of Influenza Virus Infections with Chinese Medicine.
