This is the fourth set of warning letters the FTC has announced to sellers of such products as part of its ongoing efforts to protect consumers from COVID-19 related scams. In all, the Commission has sent [similar letters to almost 100 companies and individuals](https://www.ftc.gov/coronavirus/enforcement/warning-letters). The FTC [previously sent warning letters](https://www.ftc.gov/coronavirus/warning-letters) to sellers of vitamins, herbs, colloidal silver, teas, essential oils, and other products pitched as scientifically proven coronavirus treatments or preventatives.intravenous (IV) \"therapies\" with high doses of Vitamin C, ozone therapy, and purported stem cell treatments. Several of the letters announced today target other \"treatments,\" including Chinese herbal medications, sound therapy, homeopathic treatments, and even shields claimed to boost the immune system by protecting the wearer from electromagnetic fields. However, there is currently no scientific evidence that these, or any, products or services can treat or cure coronavirus. The FTC sent the letters announced today to the companies and individuals listed below. The recipients are grouped based on the type of therapy, product, or service they pitched to supposedly prevent or treat COVID-19.

The letters advise the recipients to immediately stop making all claims that their products can treat or cure COVID-19, and to notify the Commission within 48 hours about the specific actions they have taken to address the agency's concerns. The letters also note that if the false claims do not cease, the Commission may seek a federal court injunction and an order requiring money to be refunded to consumers. Last week, the FTC announced its [first case against a marketer of such products](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/thrive-supplement-marketer-agrees-preliminary-order-barring-him), Marc Ching, doing business as Whole Leaf Organics.
