On February 18, 2011, the CTCMA -BC and the transitional Council of the CTCMPAO signed an agreement to jointly develop a Safety Program that provides materials and standards for safe practices and tools to assess practitioners' understanding of safe practices. The purposes of the Program are: To inform practitioners of traditional Chinese medi cine (TCM) the expected safety standards, procedures and processes when offering TCM services; To ensure that practitioners registered with CTCMA -BC and/or CTCMPAO engage in safe practices; and To provide a base for registered practitioners to reference, to m aintain and to upgrade in their professional development efforts. In 2018, the CTCMPANL joined the CTCM A-BC and the CTCMPAO to jointly maintain this Safety Program Handbook. 1.2 Overview of the Handbook This handbook provides an overview of the basi c safety standards, procedures and processes that CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO expect their registered members and registrants to comply in their day -to-day practice. Compliance will ensure protection to patients, the general public, members in the healt h care system, as well as the members or registrants themselves. The content of this handbook was developed over a period of eighteen months with a consultant organization working with over two dozen content experts and reviewers drawn from registrants of CTC MA-BC and practitioners in Ontario. In develop ing the content, experts researched and drew extensively from the mandatory safety course s of the CTCMA -BC and the College and Association of Alberta. A significant portion of the Herbology section was ada pted from guidelines developed by the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria, Australia , with their permission . The handbook contains four major sections: Section 2 - Infection Prevention and Control Section 3 - Risk Mana gement of TCM Practice Section 4 - Safe Procedures & Processes: Acupuncture Section 5 - Safe Procedures & Processes: Herbology TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 5 Sections 2 and 3 are relevant to all practitioners, irrespective of the scopes they practise and the treatment modalities they u se. Section 4 define s the basic procedures and processes necessary for safe practice of acupuncture and moxibustion. Section 5 defines the basic procedures and processes necessary for safe practice using traditional Chinese herbal medicines. 1.3 Demonstr ation of Understanding After reviewing the information contained in this handbook, practitioners are required to demonstrate that they understand the information and be able to apply them in their daily practice. The tools developed for assessment of pr actitioners had been p ilot tested and validated by practitioners in both provinces. However, because of differences in the governing legislation and the practice environment in British Columbia , Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario, implementation of t he assessment and the standards to be expected of individuals applying for registration with different Colleges will not be the same . Where necessary, this handbook specifies the information and the s tandards relevant to British Columbia , to Newfoundland and Labrador or to Onta rio. To obtain detailed information on the assessment requirements and expectations of CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO, please visit grateful to their Board/Council members, registrants of CTCMA -BC, volunteer practitioners in Ontario and legal counsel, for contributing ti me and effort to develop, review and validate the handbook content and the assessment tools. We are thankful to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care for funding a part of the development cost. We extend our grateful thanks to Curriculum Servi ces Canada for their guidance through each stage of the program content and assessment developme nt, the final delivery of the course content and assessment tools. The CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and the CTCMPAO would also like to extend their appreciation to the staff that supported and coordinated all stages of program development through letters, emails, phone calls, teleconferences and other logistic supports. 1.5 Intellectual Property and Copyright The CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO jointly own all intellectua l property rights and copyright of this Handbook and the Safety Program in its entirety. Any ind ividual or organization wishing to use, reproduce, translate (in any language) or distribute this handbook in whole or in part must obtain prior written permiss ion from the CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 6 Section 2: Infection Prevention and Control 2.1 I ntroduction Professional TCM practitioners practise safe and hygienic procedures in clean, well - managed clinical settings. Infection prevention and control is an essential consideration for TCM practitioners when providing patients with safe health care s ervices. Infection control is an ongoing process that focuses on minimizing the risks of spreading infections to patients, to staff, and to practitioners while performing required routines and procedures. In a clinical setting, infection prevention and c ontrol is the responsibility of all staff. However, the establishment and assignment of effective procedures and the ongoing monitoring and accountability rests with the practitioner. TCM practitioners are required to not only establish infection prevent ion and control strategies and procedures, but also regularly evaluate and update these procedures in order to continually address concerns of infectious illnes ses and of the spread of blood - borne diseases. Practitioners have an obligation to remain curr ent on infection and control procedures and to ensure that such practices are implemented in their practices and by their staff. This includes the availability of the necessary supplies and equipment, as well as the personal and staff training that is requ ired to maintain a safe and healthy office setting for both patients and employees. This document consolidates published guidelines from government agencies, regulatory bodies and professional associations. As such, this document is based on \"best practi ces\" established at the time of writing. Many recommendations have been adapted from techniques currently in use by other health care professions. Knowledge of safety issues and clinical risk management should not be limited by the scope of this course. Pa rticipants are expected to continually remain knowledgeable by referencing other sources, including their regulating provincial college ( CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO), federal and provincial government health ministries, and other regulatory agencies. Current information related to Infection Prevention and Control can be obtained from: Health Canada (http://w ww.hc -sc.gc.ca/index -eng.php ) British Columbia Ministry of Health (http://www.gov.bc.ca/health/ ) Ontario Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care (http://www.health.gov.on. ca) British Columbia Centre of Disease Control (http://www.bccdc.ca/default.htm ) Public Health Ontario (https://www.publichealthontario. ca/en/Pages/default.aspx ) Government of Newfoundland and Labrador - Department Health and Com munity Services (https://www.health.gov.nl.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/infectionpreventionand control.html ) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 7 Both general principles of infection control and universally accepted precautions and procedures are highlighted in this documen t. More detailed information about infection control specifically related to acupuncture and to herbology is further detailed in their respective sections of the course. As a TCM practitioner: know and apply the current infection control guidelines to you r practice; train others under your supervision; ensure the ongoing quality of your infection control practices; monitor changes to infection control practices and make adj ustments to your practice as needed; refer or report patients with suspected infect ious diseases to the appropriate health care professional or facility. Please Note : Many of the infection control processes and procedures that are included in this docume nt have been derived from regulations and legislation. There will be specific direc tion on what practitioners should or should not do under described conditions. This document also includes some suggestions and tools that are descriptions of best practices that are intended to minimize the risks related to the spread of infection to patients and practitioners. These suggested best practices are to inform the practitioner's professional judgment and can be applied appropriately and thoughtfully within the co ntext of a diverse range of health care settings. In the event of a serious infec tious outbreak, some practices identified in this course may be supplemented or replaced by directives from your provincial Ministry of Health, by your college, or by other provincial or national regulatory bodies. 2.2 Overview of Infection Control Under standing and practising effective infection prevention and control procedures is an important safety consideration for patients, for staff and for your personal safety. Unde rstanding how diseases are transmitted is the first step for practitioners in estab lishing and maintaining procedures that can break or interrupt the chain of infectious transmission. Infection control requires attention to interactions with patients and s taff, with instruments and equipment, and to the practice environment. Infections can occur with or without direct skin penetration. Sharps (e.g., acupuncture needles, dermal needles) are intended to penetrate the skin thereby becoming easily and regul arly contaminated by blood or body fluids. The contaminated sharp can infect the pr actitioner through inadvertent penetration caused by unsafe disposal or handling of the sharps. Infections may be the result of the use of contaminated equipment or utensi ls coming in contact with open cuts or contaminated hands inadvertently touching mu cous membranes at the eye, nose, or mouth. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 8 As well, potential sources of infection are found through normal contact with the environment including treatment tables, work s urfaces, door knobs, and waiting room furniture. The name to such objects is fomite s (objects that have become contaminated with microorganisms and serve as a vehicle of transmission for infection). 2.2.1 Chain of Infection The infection process can be mo delled as a chain of infection. The chain links the infecti ous agent to the vulnerable host through a sequence of connections that allow for the infectious agent to be transmitted. For infection to occur, each link must be present a nd connected in a sequential order. Understanding the links and how they may be bro ken provides practitioners with the knowledge that reduces the risk to themselves and to their patients. Infectious Agent : A pathogenic micro -organism causing the infection or disease. The four types of infectious agents that cause most infectious diseas e are viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. There are many other kinds of infectious agents such as prions (which can cause mad -cow disease) and viroids (which can cause H epatitis D). Viruses: (e.g., HIV, chicken pox, influenza, hepatitis) are the smalle st micro -organism and are made up of the genetic material known as DNA or RNA, which the virus uses to replicate. Viruses require a living host cell to reproduce. Bacteria: (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis, streptococci) are living organisms that are more com plex than viruses. Bacteria have the genetic blueprint to reproduce themselves, whereas viruses must invade other cells to reproduce. Bacteria are normally not more than one single cell but can reproduce very rapidly. Fungi: are single or multi -celled pla nt-like organisms that can cause a wide variety of fungal infections (e.g., ringworm). Fungi usually appear on the skin, but can infect deeper in the body. Parasites: are or ganisms that live on or in a host and gets its food from or at the expense of its h ost (e.g., lice). Knowing which type of infectious agent is present informs the practitioner of the types of disinfectants, antiseptics, and antimicrobials that are best to use, the severity of the disease it is capable of causing, and the mode of transmi ssion. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 9 The possibility of a micro -organism causing infection is influenced by the organism's virulence (ability to grow), invasiveness (ability to enter), and pathogenicit y (ability to cause disease). Reservoir: The reservoir is where the organism lives and grows between outbreaks. This can be food, water source, feces, in the environment, or in a living organism. Portal of Exit: Portal of exit identifies how the infecti ous agent is able to leave the reservoir (e.g., blood, mucus, secretions, and open w ounds). Transmission: Transmission identifies how the agent is able to move from one host to another host (e.g., human -to-human through blood contact, respiratory droplets or other secretions, on the hands of a health care worker, through the air in an un filtered ventilation system, attached to a living organism like a mosquito). Knowing how the infection is transmitted is essential for deciding the infection control measur es that will be the most effective. In a TCM practice setting, the four main transm ission routes that are important to understand are direct contact, indirect contact, droplet, and airborne. Direct Contact Transmission This is the physical transfer of t he infected organisms by the direct physical contact between an infected person and a vulnerable person. Gastrointestinal infections can be transmitted by contact. Indirect Contact Transmission This is contact through an intermediary such as contaminated equipment or work surfaces. Some organisms are capable of surviving on surfaces for lengthy periods of time. For example, Hepatitis B can remain infectious on equipment for a week or more. In an office setting, inanimate objects such as magazines, toys, do or knobs, computer keyboards, and waiting room surfaces are often overlooked as sour ces of infection. Droplet This is contact due to contaminated splatter or through sneezing or talking when an infected person and a vulnerable person are in close proximi ty. Infected droplets can often be transferred through contact with the eyes or mout h. Droplets normally are large enough that they remain airborne for only short periods of time and can be controlled with protective equipment such as masks. Influenza, mum ps, colds, pertussis, rubella, and SARS are examples of infections that can be trans mitted through droplets. Airborne Residue from evaporated droplets or infected dust particles can remain suspended in the air for extended periods of time. Airborne micro -organisms can remain suspended for long time periods and can be widely distributed by air currents. Environmental controls such as ventilation systems are often helpful. Diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, and chickenpox are capable of airborne transm issions. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 10 There are other modes of transmission that are not directly relevant to th e infection control procedures for a TCM practitioner. For example, vector -borne transmission can occur through a bite of vectors such as mosquitoes, rats and dogs, or thro ugh contact with the infected surfaces of vectors such as flies. As well vehicle tra nsmission relates to micro -organisms transmitted to multiple hosts through contaminated sources such as water supply, food products, and medications. Portal of Entry: This describes how the agent enters the vulnerable host (e.g., insect bite, inhaling, br eak in the skin, mouth when eating). The portal of entry (nose, mouth, skin) informs the practitioner on the personal protective equipment that may be required. Vulnerable Host: The vulnerable host is the person infected by the agent. The most vulnerable are often the very young and the very old, or those who have their immune systems suppressed. Because of the occupational exposure of health care workers, TCM practitioners and staff have increased opportunities to be exposed to infectious diseases. 2.2.2 Contamination and Cross -contamination Infectious organisms can be spread throughout a clinic by contamination or by cross - contamination. Contamination is the spread of i nfectious micro -organisms to an object (such as an acupuncture needle or herb storag e container). Cross -contamination is the indirect spread of infection from one person to another person via unclean instruments or improper sterilization processes. Contamination and cross -contamination put both the patient and the practitioner at risk and can be caused by practices such as the following: Clean equipment or instruments are placed on unclean surfaces. Sterile equipment or instruments are placed on non -sterile surfaces. Practitioner hygiene is not sufficient. Contaminated instruments and tools are not disposed of promptly and appropriately (used instruments and equipment can be contaminated even without clear visible signs of blood or secretions). Linens ar e not cleaned thoroughly. Surfaces and facilities are not satisfactorily and regular ly cleaned (viruses can survive on damp, warm work surfaces for just a few hours, e.g., HIV, or for weeks or longer, e.g., Hepatitis A can survive for months). 2.2.3 Infect ions Infectious micro -organisms in human blood (blood borne pathogens) can cause dis ease in humans. Use of sharps can expose TCM practitioners to blood borne pathogens. Sharps include objects such as needles, broken glass, and razor blades. The safe handli ng and disposal of sharps is discussed in more detail in Section 4 of this document. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 11 It is beyond the scope or intent of this course to provide a comprehensive explanation of all pathological conditions. For the purposes of this course, the following dise ases and conditions are highlighted for special attention for TCM practitioners. Hepatitis A, B, C Hepatitis is a general term for the medical condition defined by swelling and inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis viruses cause most incidences but hepati tis can also be caused by other means including liver damage from toxins (e.g., al cohol, poisons) and overdoses of medications (acetaminophen). Many carriers of hepatitis are asymptomatic (show no symptoms) but are still infectious. This requires that sa fe practices be applied to all patients, and not just patients displaying specific symptoms (see Routine Practices below). Hepatitis B is an irritation and swelling of the liver caused by infection with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). The swelling of the li ver is due to the reaction of the body's immune system to the infection. Hepatitis B can cause acute illness but can become chronic (lifelong). There is no cure for Hepatitis B but there are means to control the infection. Vaccination is an effective means to prevent HBV infection. Health care workers who regularly come in contact with blood and other body fluids are particularly at risk and should be immunized against Hepatitis B. The use of the clean needle technique (see section 4) greatly reduces the ri sks of infection. (Read Hepatitis B Fact Sheet , Health Canada) http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/hcai -iamss/bbp -pts/hepatitis/hep_b -eng.php Hepatitis C is a viral disease that l eads to swelling of the liver and is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepati tis C has an acute and chronic form. There are some treatments, but there is no vaccine. Health care workers who regularly come in contact with blood have an elevated risk. T he use of the clean needle technique (see section 4) greatly reduces the risks of infection. (Read Hepatitis C Fact Sheet , Health Canada) http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/hcai -iamss/bbp -pts/hepatitis/hep_c -eng.php Hepatitis A is more frequently evidenced in locations with poor sanitation. Eating food and drinking water that is contaminated by fecal matter containing Hepatitis A is common source of Hepatitis A virus (HAV). Hepati tis A is less severe tha n Hepatitis B or C. Hepatitis A infected blood presents a smaller risk to practitioners. Like Hepatitis B, there is a vaccine that can be administered for Hepatitis A. Unlike Hepatitis B, there is no unique risk for healthcare worke rs that would specifically recommend the Hepatitis A vaccine. An effective means of prevention against HAV infection is regular hand washing. (Read Hepatitis A Fact Sheet , Health Canada) https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health -safety/diseases/hepatitis -a The Immunization Action Coalition summarizes and compares Hepatitis A, B, and C. This summary should be examined by practitioners. The document is available online at the following site. http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4075abc.pdf TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 12 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) HIV impacts the immune system and can result in progressive illnesses and increased vulnerability to infections. HIV is spread through direct blood -to-blood contact and through direct contact with certain body fluids, including blood. Health care workers who regularly come in contact w ith blood and other body fluids should take appropriate precautions. HI V can lead to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is a collection of diseases that a person can contract when their immune system is weakened. HIV can be diagnosed with a blood test. AIDS is diagnosed through a combination of indicators, incl uding a confirmed HIV infection, and further evidence of certain infections. In a TCM practice, strict adherence to the routine practices outlined in this document provides effective m easures to minimize risks for patients and practitioners. Read informat ion from Health Canada on -health/services/diseases/hiv -aids/health - professionals -hiv-aids.html Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is contagious bacterial infection that mainly involves the lungs. Tubercu losis can be transmitted by breathing in droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person. It is not highly contagious. People with tuberculosis are most likely to spread the bacteria to people that they have prolonged or regular contact. (As required , read Health Canada for add itional information) http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/tbpc -latb/index -eng.php Influenza Influenza or the flu affects primarily the respiratory tract and is caused by t he influenza virus. Influenz a is spread through droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, through the air in enclosed spaces, through direct contact with contaminated hands, and indirect contact with contaminated objects (e.g., door knobs). Influenza often has seasonal strains. The el derly or weak are at greater risk of worsening complications. (Health Canada has additional information on the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector ) http://www.phac -aspc.gc. ca/cpip -pclcpi/pdf -eng.php Pneumonia Pneumonia is a respiratory condition caused by an infection of the lungs. Pneumonia may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. In adults, bacterial infection is the most common cause (e .g., bacteria from the sinus es or mouth may spread to the lungs). In infants and children, viruses can commonly cause pneumonia. Skin Infections Skin infections can range in cause (bacterial, fungal), visibility (from small spot to covering large portio ns of the body) and in serio usness (from harmless to life threatening). The most common types of bacterial skin infections are caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Bacteria can invade through broken skin causing a range of discomfort and ulcerations . The nature of TCM practice requires practitioners to be vigilant of skin disorders on themselves and on their patients. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 13 As health care professionals, TCM practitioners have an obligation to report communicable/ reportable diseases. If during the course of treatment, practitioners become aware of a communicable/ reportable disease, they must take the necessary steps to report as required by provincial legislation. The links below provide further information about reportable diseases. British Columbia 2.3 Routine Practices Health Canada uses the terminology \" Routine Practices \" to identify the foundational level of infection control to be used in a healthcare setting, and identifies procedures that apply at all times and with all patients . In the United States, the Centres fo r Disease Control (CDC) may use the equivalent term \" Standard Precautions \". Routine practices are based on the assumption that all patients are potentia lly sources of infection, even if a person shows no symptoms or illness. As well, all blood, body fluids (except tears and sweat), secretions, excretions, non -intact skin, undiagnosed rashes, and areas such as eye, nose, and mouth are potentially infectiou s. Routine practices control the transmission of infectious microorganisms in healthcare settings from patient -to-practitioner, patient -to-patient and practitioner -to-patient. Routine practices for TCM practitioners include: 1. Conducting Risk Assessment 2. Hand Hygiene 3. Use of Personal Protective Equipment 4. Safe Handling and Disposal of Sharps 2.3.1 Conducting Risk Assessment A risk assessment approach to infection control requires the practitioner to analyze and assess how risks can be minimized before each int eraction with patients, and as an overall strategy for clinical safety. A patient risk assessment sh ould be performed before each interaction with a patient. The required interventions required to prevent the transmission of infection will vary, and will be dependent on the: likelihood of exposure to blood, secretions, and body fluids; health of the pati ent; characteristics of the patient, such as level of anxiety; clinical environment and resources available; immune status of the practitioner. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 14 High er risk procedures may require the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, while interaction s that do not involve physical contact may require less precautions. The chart below provides examples of infection control strategies that vary by your patient risk assessment. These strategies are for the protection of the practitioner, the patient, an d the staff. Situation Infection Control Strategy Routine patient interview with no physical contact Hand washing Respiratory etiquette* (cover mouth a nd nose when coughing, wash hands) Physical contact with patient and either you or the patient has an open wound Hand washing Use of medical gloves, proper disposal, followed by hand washing Contact with patient may involve body fluids or splattering (dr oplets) Hand washing Professional judgment related to use of medical gloves, mask, eye protection, gow ns Proper disposal of protective equipment, followed by hand washing Physical contact with patient with respiratory concerns or symptoms Hand washing Respiratory etiquette (cover mouth and nose when coughing, wash hands) Professional judgment related to u se of medical gloves, mask (on you and/or patient), eye protection Physical contact with patient with a fever and respiratory concerns or symptoms Hand w ashing Respiratory etiquette (cover mouth and nose when coughing, wash hands) Professional judgment re lated to use of medical gloves, mask (on you and/or patient), eye protection Health alert observation, as appropriate * Respiratory Etiquette The follo wing measures to contain respiratory secretions are recommended for all individuals with signs and sym ptoms of a respiratory infection. Cover the nose/mouth when coughing or sneezing. Use tissues to contain respiratory secretions and dispose of them in t he nearest waste receptacle after use. Perform hand hygiene (e.g., hand washing with non -antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol -based hand rub, or antiseptic hand wash) after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials. The following posters by the Region of Peel Public Health and Toronto Public Health can be useful in a TCM practice setting. Course December 2012 Page 15 The Centre s for Disease Control (CDC) has a number of pamphlets and flyers that m ay be useful in your health care setting. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/resphygiene.htm http://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/protect/cdc_cough_nologo .pdf http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/covercough.htm 2.3.2 Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene is the most important infection control measure. Hand washing should be done: before and after patient conta ct or acupuncture treatment; before and after preparing, handl ing, or dispensing herbs or herbal remedies; when hands are contaminated during the treatment; immediately after inadvertent exposure to blood or body fluids; when hands are visibly soiled; after contact with environmental surfaces or equipment; after remo ving gloves; before preparing, handling, serving or eating food; after handling money or other items that may be contaminated; after answering the phone or using the computer or other electronic devices and returning to a patient; after personal body funct ions. Hand Washing Procedure Remove any hand or wrist jewellery and avoid use of artificial (acrylic) nails. Follow these 6 steps when hand washing. 1. Wet your hands in warm running water . 2. Apply sufficient liquid soap to achieve lather. (Bar soap is disc ouraged and should not be used.) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 16 3. Wash all surfaces of your hands including backs of hands, fingertips, between fingers, wrists, base of thumbs, and around and under finger nails. Scrubbing shoul d last approximately 15 seconds. 4. Rinse well and leave water ru nning. 5. Dry thoroughly with a disposable paper towel or electric hand dryer. 6. Turn off the water with the towel, and not with your bare hands. Automatic taps are an effective option. Toronto Pub lic Health has very useful posters that can be used to educate staff and patients regarding hand washing and hand sanitizing. The complete poster on hand washing can be obtained at: http://www.toronto.ca/health/cdc/resources/pdf/ha ndwashing_poster.pdf Alcohol -based hand rubs If hands do not have visible soiling, then the use of an alcohol -based hand rub is an effective addition to (but not a substitute for) hand washing . When using hand rub, apply the product to dry hands and rub hands together, covering all surfaces, for at least 30 seconds. Hands should be allowed to dry thoroughly. Do NOT use paper towels.

TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 17 Ontario Mi nistry of Health and Long -term Care https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/eRepository/2010 - 12%20BP%20Hand%20Hygiene.pdf British Columbia Centre of Disease Control http://www.bccdc.ca/health -info/preventing -infection/hand -hygiene Centre s for Disease Control and http://www.cdc.gov/h andhygiene/ World Health Organization http://www.who.int/gpsc/en/ http://www.who.int/ gpsc/5may/How_To_HandRub_Poster.pdf http://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/How_To_HandWash_Poster.pdf Practitioners can visit the site \" Clean Hands, Good Health \" for an informative video tutori al on hand washing. https://www.cdc.gov/ handwashing/videos.html Hand Care Frequent hand washing requires practitioners to gently dry hands to avoid chapping which can cause the skin to break open, providing an entry portal for bacteria. Hand lotion can assist in maintaining soft skin in order to reduce chapping. Lotion should be available to all staff. Fingernails should be kept short and clean. The use of artificial nails or the wearing of hand or wrist jewellery is strongly discouraged because they can harbo ur bacteria. Hand washing facili ties Because hand hygiene is central to effective infectious control, hand washing facilities in the clinic should be clearly accessible and kept fully equipped and sanitary. every sink should have soap dispensers and disposable towels alcohol -based rubs s hould be clearly evident and be easy to access and use to reduce contamination, hand washing sinks should not be used for other purposes If a treatment room does not contain a sink, alcohol -based rubs should be re adily accessible. Remember, alcohol -based rubs are not a substitute for hand washing. Antiseptic Agents Antiseptics are antimicrobial substances that can be used as skin preps for patients. Using an antiseptic such as isopropyl alcohol (70%) provides effe ctive skin cleansing prior to invasive pro cedures. Use disposable swabs or forceps with disposable cotton ball with isopropyl (70%) to clean skin. 2.3.3 Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Practitioners may need to use personal protective equipment to protect themselves from potential infe ctions. PPE's can also protect the patient by preventing the practitioner from becoming the agent of transmission of infectious organism from patient -to-patient. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 18 Medical Gloves Practitioners should use clean, sin gle-use gloves when the following contacts are anticipated: contact with blood and body fluids contact with mucous membranes, pus, secretions, undiagnosed rashes or non - intact skin the practitioner has non -intact skin on her or his hands Non -sterile exam ination gloves (latex, vinyl, or nitrile) must meet the requirements of Health Canada. Vinyl gloves tend to be less durable, and some patients report sensitivities and allergic reactions to latex gloves. Gloves must be discarded after each procedure (see a dditional sections on Waste Disposal ). Practitioners should assess the possibility of blood contact during each treatment and consider the use of medical gloves as appropriate. The use of medical gloves may not be essential during a routine acupuncture treatment due to the absence of significant bleeding. See Section 4 Safe Procedures and Practices: Acupuncture for additional considerations related to the clean needle technique. Medical gloves are strongly recommended if \"bleeding\" is performed for the purpose of treatment or if the patient has o pen wounds or lesions. Medical gloves are highly recommended for palpation or needling in the mouth or genital area. Note: Medical gloves provide an additional level of protection to the practitioner and to the pa tient. The use of medical gloves is NOT a replacement for thorough hand hygiene. Protective Clothing Gowns and aprons should be worn by practitioners and staff when there is risk of soiling or splatter. If soiled, gowns should be replaced after a patient treatment. Plastic aprons provide addition al protection for some procedures (e.g., bleeding). The lab coat is not protective equipment and does not replace an apron or gown when required. The white lab coat might seem clean, but could be harbouring infecti ous bacteria. When dealing or disposing soiled linens, the practitioner and staff must use appropriate protective equipment (e.g., non -medical utility rubber gloves) to transport or dispose of soiled linens, gowns or aprons. Masks Masks can provide addit ional protection for the practitioner or t he patient to transmission by droplets or splatter. Masks are effective in minimizing the risks and the spread of droplet -borne organisms (e.g., coughs and sneezing), but are less effective for airborne infections. 2.3.4 Safe Handling and Disposal of Sha rps (Note: see further details in Section 4: Safe Procedures and Processes: Acupuncture ) Used needles and sharps are classified as non -anatomical, biohazardous waste, and as such, must be treated with extreme care in order to protect patients and staff fr om injury as a result of contact from sharp objects. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 19 The practitioner is responsible for ensuring that acupuncture needles and other sharps are disposed of safely. The person using the sharp must dispose of the s harp himself or herself. Single -use sharp s are opened in front of the patient and disposed of immediately after use in a puncture -resistant, rigid container that cannot be punctured by sharps under normal conditions. It is recommended that the container have a handle for safe transport and a lid that fits tightly. As well, the container should allow the practitioner to open it with one hand for ease of disposal. The container should be identified with the biohazard label and placed out of reach of childr en. Containers should not be filled to mo re than three -quarters capacity. Containers must not be treated as \"general waste\" and must be disposed of in compliance with approved local and provincial procedures. 2.4 Additional Precautions The previous sect ion focused on some of the routine practic es that apply at all times and with all patients. Additional precautions (or transmission -based precautions ) may need to be used in conjunction with routine practices when such practices are deemed not to be suffi cient to control transmission. Additional precautions focus on the further measures that may need to be employed based on the mode of transmission contact, droplet, or airborne. They include the physical separation of individuals who are known or are suspected of being infected or colonized by p athogens, and the use of protective barriers to limit or prevent transmission by contact, droplet or airb orne transmission. 2.4.1 Patient Management Some patients may arrive at a clinic with communicable diseases that will require additional precautions t o keep you, your staff, and other patients safe. Because of the very nature of the work of TCM practiti oners, people who are ill will be seeking your advice and the waiting room of the clinic may be an environment that hosts infectious diseases. It is t he responsibility of the practitioner to protect all patients who have come to her or him for health care through vigilant patient management and a clean clinical environment. Additional Precautions for Infectious Patients Try to arrange the waiting roo m to maximize the separation of possibly infectious patients from other patients (2 metres or more if pos sible). Post signs that patients with respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms should clearly identify this to the practitioner or to staff. Post signs encouraging respiratory etiquette (covering nose and mouth). Offer masks to patients, provide tissues, w aste containers, and hand sanitizers. Droplet Transmission Precautions Triage the patient from the waiting room as quickly as possible. Use a mask and wear medical gloves while working within 2 metres of the patient, and offer a mask and hand sanitizer to the patient. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 20 At the end of the treatment, wipe all horizontal surfaces and utilized instruments with low -level disinfectant. Contact Transmission Pre cautions Triage the patient from the waiting room as quickly as possible. Wear medical gloves and gown, a s appropriate. Offer patient hand sanitizer. At the end of the treatment, wipe all horizontal surfaces and identified instruments with low -level disinf ectant. Airborne Transmission Precautions Triage the patient from the waiting room as quickly as possibl e. Try to see these patients at the end of the day or during low volume times. Use a high -efficiency mask (e.g., N95 particulate respirator). chickenpox (varicella) or measles (rubeola), the treating practitioner should be immune. Provide a mask for the patient to use throughout the treatment; offer hand sanitizer. Notify staff of the need for extra care or to use masks if not i mmune. Open a window if possible, or allow time for ventilation to exchange air (ideally, the patient is at the end of the day). TCM practitioners must ensure that infection prevention and control procedures (including routine practices and additional pre cautions) are evident in their practice and applied by staff. These brochures and posters by the Region of Peel Public Health can be useful in a TCM practice setting. https://www.peelregion.ca/health/discon/pdfs/routine -practices.pdf tml 2.5 Clean Environment, Clean Equipment 2.5.1 Environment Cleaning General Housekeeping All housekeeping surfaces need routine or periodic cleaning with a solution of diluted detergents. Establish a clean ing schedule to ensure all surfaces are kept clean , and educate your cleaning staff to ensure they understand the importance of their work in a health care setting. High traffic or high touch surfaces should be identified for more frequent cleaning (e.g., door knobs, handles) possibly using a low -level di sinfectant, where appropriate. Non -clinical surfaces that are low -risk of contamination should be cleaned first then disinfected using a low -level disinfectant such as: quaternary ammonium compounds chlorin e bleach solution (e.g., 1:500, 1 part chlorine an d 499 parts water) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 21 3% hydrogen peroxide phenols (sometimes called phenolics) These products come as liquids or as disinfectant wipes. Staff should use household utility gloves for disinfecting. Note : Ther e is a difference between alcohol -based wipes and detergent -based wipes when cleaning. Alcohol wipes do not clean and their use is limited to routine environmental decontamination. Detergent wipes clean but do not disinfect. Detergent wipes are suitable fo r environmental cleaning, but are not suitable fo r blood and body fluid spillages. Floor mops should be cleaned and dried after use, and fresh cleaning solutions should be used each day to prevent creating reservoirs for infectious organisms. Carpets are not recommended for high traffic areas. Carpets a re more difficult to clean and disinfect to the standard required in a health care setting. Clinical Contact Surfaces Clinical contact surfaces that may be contaminated by spray, splatter, or touch should be cleaned and disinfected after each patient visi t. Surfaces should be cleaned (using utility gloves) with a low -level disinfectant. In some instances, an intermediate level disinfectant (e.g., 1:10 household bleach mixed daily or 70 -90% isopropyl alcohol) may be necessary. To facilitate clinical cleanin g, treatment areas should be uncluttered and well organized. Spot Cleaning of Blood Spills Wear household utility gloves. Blot or wipe up as much as possible using disposable towels. Dispose of the paper to wels in a plastic lined and covered container (se e additional information on waste disposal). Clean the spill area with a detergent disinfectant. Dry with disposable towels. Use an intermediate -level, hospital -grade disinfectant on the area and follow the manufacturer's directions. An alternative is a 1: 10 dilution of household bleach and leave for at least 10 minutes before drying with a disposable towel. Laundering Sheets, Towels or Other Linens Practitioners may use linens (washed on -site or handled by a linen service) or disposable paper sheets to co ver patient treatment areas. All bed linens, used towels, or disposable paper sheets must be changed between patients. Linens (e.g., sheets, towels, gowns, pillow cases) can be laundered with hot water (70\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C) and soap if there is no visible soili ng (bleach can be added as required by soiling). Linen that is soiled with blood should be handled, transported and laundered with additional care. Place linen in appropriate impermeable bags and use protec tive non - medical utility gloves when handling. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 22 2.5.2 Cleaning, Disinfecting and Sterilizing Practitioners are expected to understand the differences among and important features of what is meant by cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing in the context of their TCM practice. Cleaning is the removal of visible soil from objects and surfaces and normally is accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is vital before high -level disinfection and sterilization because i norganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments constrain the effectiveness of these processes. Sterilization describes a process that destroys or eliminates all forms of microbial life and is carried out in health -care faciliti es by physical or chemical methods. Steam under pressure, dry heat, and liquid chemicals are sterilizing agents often used in health care facilities. Disinfection describes a process used on inanimate objects that kills or destroys many or all infectious microorganisms, except bacterial spores. In healt h care settings, objects are usually disinfected using liquid chemicals. Sterilants are a unique class of disinfectants. Unlike sterilization, disinfection does not kill spores. A few disinfectants will ki ll spores with prolonged exposure times (3 -12 hours); these are called chemical sterilants . These same chemicals used for shorter exposure periods can act as high -level disinfectants. Decontamination removes infectious microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle or discard. Germicide is an agent that can kill pathogenic organisms or \"germs\". The term germicide includes both antiseptics and disinfectants . Antiseptics are germicides that can be applied to skin and tissue; while disinfectants are anti -microbial substances that can be applied only to inanimate objects. Fungicide , bactericide , and sporicide are examples of terms that indicate by their prefix the type of microorganism that can be destroyed through application. For example, a fung icide is an agent that kills fungus. 2.5.3 Clean ing Instruments and Equipment Cleaning of equipment and reusable patient care items and instruments is an essential step for preventing transmission of infected micro -organisms to patients and to practitione rs. Practitioners can reference a useful Fact S heet from Toronto Public Health titled, Personal Service Settings: Cleaning Instruments . Useful information on Cleaning Instruments and Equipment can also be found on Government o f Newfoundland and Labrador - Depar tment of Health and Community Services . TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 23 Toronto Public Health, January 2009. Instruments MUST be properly cleaned, rinsed and dried before disinfection and sterilization. Cleaning can be considered the most important step since it is required to remove any organic debris that wil l compromise the process of disinfection or sterilization. The following chart is adapted from \"Infection Prevention and Control Best Practices for Personal Services Setting\", Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, Ontario, Janu ary 2009. Steps to Clean I nstruments Cleaning Process Reason and Comments 1. Soak items that cannot be immediately cleaned in a container of clean warm water (with or without detergent) in a clean sink or in a labelled \"dirty instruments\" container. Soaking instruments prevents blood and other organic matter from drying on the item. Do not soak dirty items in hot water or in a disinfectant before cleaning, as this can cause organic matter (dirt) to stick to the surface of the object. 2. Put on thick rubber utility gloves (non -medical gloves). Thick rubber utility gloves suitable for cleaning have a wider bib at the wrist to help prevent water from entering the inside of the glove. 3. Take instruments apart and rinse in a sink filled with lukewarm water. Hot water may cause or ganic matter (dirt) to stick to objects. 4. Prepare cleaning sink by adding warm water and detergent . To reduce the risk of injury, ensure that sharp objects are visible by using low suds detergent according to directions. 5. Clean instrument surfaces by using friction (washing and scrubbing motions). Use a brush to clean any crevices or seams in instruments Scrub below the water surface to prevent splashing into the eyes or onto clothing. An ultrasonic cleaner may be used for cleaning. When using this de vice, the lid should be closed to prevent aerosolization. 6. Inspect instruments to ensure removal of all visible organic matter. Organic matter prevents disinfection from occurring. 7. Drain dirty water. Rinse cleaned instrume nts under running water. Rinsing removes residual detergent and soil that may impair the function of the instrument or interfere with the action of disinfectants 8. Either air dry or dry with a disposable towel. If wet items are not dried a film may be le ft on the surface which may contain pathogens. 9. Store cleaned instruments in a covered container (can be towel or clean storage area) until disinfected or sterilized, as required. Uncovered, clean instruments may become contaminated by dust or moisture . 10. Clean and disinfect t he sink. Sinks become contaminated during use, therefore, cleaning and disinfection is required to reduce microorganisms prior to reuse. 11. Remove rubber utility gloves and wash, rinse and, hang to dry. Cleaned rubber utility gloves may be used again as long as the rubber is not torn or punctured. 12. Perform hand hygiene . Hand hygiene should be performed after removing gloves. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 24 Additional Best Practices: Cleaning Staff must be protected when cleaning instruments. Supply requi red personal protective equi pment. Begin the cleaning process as soon as possible after use so that organic material does not dry and harden. If staff are used to clean equipment, it is best to assign tasks to a single person who should receive ongoing tra ining related to new instrum ents or equipment. Follow manufacturer's recommendations and keep important procedures near the reprocessing area for reference and reminder. The use of automated cleaning equipment can be more efficient, effective and safe for staff by reducing risks of e xposure to blood or body fluids. Large debris should be removed before using ultrasonic cleaners. Ultrasonic cleaners do not sterilize or disinfect. 2.5.4 Sterilizing, Disinfecting Specific patient care items must be cleaned and then disinfected or sterili zed after each use. Instruments are categorized based on whether they contact sterile tissue, mucous membranes, or intact skin. Medical instruments are categorized as either critical, semi - critical, or non -critical. The catego rization is used to determin e the reprocessing requirements. Categorization of Medical Instruments Category Definition Reprocessing (minimum requirement ) Critical Item enters sterile tissue including bloodstream (arteries and veins). cleaning, followed by sterilization Semi -critical item contacts intact mucous membranes or non - intact skin (but ordinarily does not penetrate) the exception being needling followed by cupping in which exposure to blood borne pathogens require sterilization of cupping device s. e.g., cupping devices, ac upuncturescope. cleaning, followed by high -level disinfection* (some items may require only intermediate level disinfection) Non -critical item contacts intact skin (but not mucous membranes) or does not directly contact the pa tient these items are rarel y contaminated e.g., Tuina devices, electrical clips and rubber or silicone electrical pads. cleaning, plus low level disinfection * Sterilization is preferred for semi -critical items, but especially for items that cannot tol erate sterilization, high - level disinfection can be used TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 25 Some of the factors that reduce the effectiveness of disinfection and sterilization include: insufficient cleaning as an initial step to remove matter nature and level of contamination incorrect di lution of disinfectant water t hat is used is too hard inadequate exposure time to the germicide physical nature of the object (e.g., small crevices, flexible hinges) incorrect temperature and pH of the disinfection process reduced effectiveness because use d passed expiry date reactions to rubber or plastic Disinfection Disinfection is a process used on inanimate objects to eliminate many or all pathogenic micro -organisms, except bacterial spore s. Disinfectants are all registered in Canada and should come with a DIN number. This means that the manufacturer has to stand behind the claims about which micro - organisms it is effective against and the described safe use of the product. You should request the material safety data sheet (MSDS) which provides infor mation about the product and t he worker safety procedures. There are three levels of disinfection: high - level, intermediate -level, and low -level. Disinfection Chart The following chart is adapted from, \"Infection Prevention and Control Best Practices for Personal Services Setting,\" Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, Ontario, January 2009. This chart is NOT inclusive of all approved high -, intermediate -, and low -level disinfectants but is only to provide guidance to practitioners. High -Level Disinfect ion High -level disinfectants w ill kill all bacteria and viruses but will not kill large numbers of bacterial spores. These disinfectants may be used for critical items that cannot withstand heat sterilization. Chemical (examples) Application Exposure Tim e (approximate) Notes 2% glut eraldehyde* (not recommended for personal service settings) semi -critical devices 45 minutes (follow manufacturer's instructions) Toxic, irritating to skin, and limited shelf life Use in well ventilated room NEVER use as a sp ray Not recommended for perso nal service settings 6% hydrogen peroxide (not the 3% hydrogen peroxide found in stores) semi -critical devices 45 minutes (follow manufacturer's instructions) Can be corrosive to metals such as brass, copper, silver Ortho -phthalaldehyde (OPA) 0.55% semi -critical devices > 10 minutes (follow manufacturer's instructions) Less occupational risk No mixing and fast acting Stains proteins and limited shelf life 1:50 chlorine bleach solution (using 5.25% chlorine bleach) semi -critical devices > 20 minutes Inexp ensive, but can corrode and destroy adhesives * can be used as a sterilant with increased exposure time (>10 hours) and carefully following manufacturer's instructions . TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 26 Intermediate -Level Disinfection Intermediate -level disi nfectants will kill most bacter ia, most fungi, and most viruses but does not kill large numbers of bacterial spores such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Chemical (examples) Application Exposure Time (approximate) Notes 70 - 90% isopropyl alcohol semi -critical ,devices environmental sur faces 10 minutes allow to dry fast acting can damage rubber 1:50 chlorine bleach solution (using 5.25% chlorine bleach) semi -critical devices, environmental surfaces 10 minutes inexpensive, but can corrode and destroy adhesives Low -Level Disinfection Low-level disinfectants will kill some bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV) but it is not effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, or spores . Chemical (examples) Application Exposure Time (approximate) Notes Quaternary ammonium compounds 3% hydrogen peroxide 1:500 chlorine bleach solution Phenolics non-critical devices daily cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces follow manufacturer's instructions Do not use for disinfec ting instruments Low risk of i rritation to the user May corrode or oxidize some metals For environmental surfaces only Sterilization Sterilization, when done correctly, destroys all forms of microbial organism (bacteria, viruses, spores, and fungi) i ncluding the most resistant for ms such as bacterial spores. All items that are invasive or pierce the skin MUST be sterilized. Single -use, pre - sterilized, acupuncture needles must be used prior to the expiry date and should not be reused or desterilized. Any sterile instruments that are accidently touched or contaminated, either before or during treatment, should be replaced by another sterile instrument. All items that are reprocessed for sterilization must be pre -cleaned and appropriately packaged and stored after sterilization. There are two main types of sterilization: steam (autoclave) and dry heat. Steam Autoclave Steam sterilization is a practical, economical, and effective means of sterilization and is the most frequently used form used by TCM practitioners. The time requir ed for sterilization will be dependent on whether the instrument is wrapped or unwrapped. For example, packaged items at 121 C may require a TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 27 sterilization time of 30 minutes. Others may suggest 133 C for 15 minutes. Unpacka ged instruments regularly requi re less time. Unwrapped instruments should be used immediately to avoid contamination. Some autoclaves may not have a drying cycle, but packages must be dry before being removed to reduce chance of contamination. Always fol low manufacturer's guidelines a nd instructions when using the autoclave. Dry Heat Sterilizers It is recommended that dry heat sterilizers be used for items that cannot be sterilized by steam. It can be effective for use with glass and may be more effectiv e for instruments that cannot b e disassembled. Dry heat sterilizers require longer exposure time and higher temperatures (limiting available options for packaging). Sterilization CANNOT be done by domestic ovens, microwave ovens, boiling water, alcohol, ultraviolet sterilizer, or pres sure cookers. Monitoring Sterilization Chemically treated bags or tape that alters colour are useful to confirm that items have been processed and have been exposed to the required combination of time, temperature, and stea m. These indicators do NOT prov ide evidence that sterilization has taken place. Only biological indicators (or spore tests) can confirm sterilization. Spore strips or vials should be placed in the centre of the load during a regular sterilizing cycle. For steam sterilization, Bacillus s tearothermophilus should be used, and for dry heat, Bacillus subtilis should be used. Tests should be conducted each month (more frequently for heavy use) and sent to a laboratory to test for spore kill. Your clinic should h ave a back -up plan for steriliz ation in case test results are positive and the sterilizer needs to be repaired or replaced. All items for sterilization must be pre -cleaned. The effectiveness of sterilization is influenced by time, temperature, pressure (i n autoclave), and full contact with the item that is being sterilized. The following chart is adapted from , \"Infection Prevention and Control Best Practices for Personal Services Setting,\" Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, Ontario, January 2009. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 28 Steps to Sterilizing Instruments Steps Notes 1 Clean instruments. (See chart: Steps to Clean Instruments) Instruments that are not clean cannot be sterilized. 2 Perform hand hygiene and apply gloves. Hands should be as clean as possible to prevent contami nation of clean instruments/equ ipment. 3 Clean instruments must be placed in the appropriate sterilization package and sealed. Sealed packaged items will maintain sterility after sterilization has been achieved until opened for use. If packaging becomes wet or damaged, sterility canno t be ensured. Instruments in damaged packages must be re -sterilized or discarded. Ensure packaging is appropriate for type of sterilizer used. 4 Temperature sensitive chemical indicators must be used with each package. Tem perature sensitive chemical ind icators provide an immediate visual check to ensure package has been processed. Note: The colour change demonstrated by a chemical indicator does not ensure that the processed items have been sterilized. Only an appropriate b iological indicator can confirm that the sterilization cycle has been successful. 5 Load the sterilizer evenly and avoid overloading the chamber. Follow manufacturer's directions for loading the chamber. Overloading the sterilizer will prevent effective s terilization; allow space betwe en the packages. 6 Start the sterilization process. Sterilizing time, temperature, pressure and cycles may vary depending on the type of sterilizer used. Follow manufacturer's instructions at all times. With dry heat and autoclave sterilization, time does not start until the appropriate temperature has been reached. 7 After the sterilization cycle has been completed, remove instruments when dry. Ensure items are dry before removing from the unit. Sterilized instruments may b ecome contaminated when wet packaging is handled. 8 Store sterilized items in a clean, dry, place that is protected from dust, dirt, and moisture. Sterile items must be stored off the floor. Handling increases the chances of punctures of sterilized bags. Sterilized items must be store d separately from dirty equipment/instruments. Check the following: the seal is intact package is free of tears, dust, dampness chemical indicators have changed to appropriate colour 9 Record information about each steriliz ation cycle in the log book. Monitor each load, recording temperature, pressure, cycle length, etc. Mark the date that the product was sterilized.

Risks should be expressed in terms of the office -specific environment. The trai ning should be continually monitored and updated to reflect changes in policies, procedures, staff changes, and equipment. Included in this training is an understanding of the responsibilities of working in a health care facility, and the requirements to m anage their personal health and actions that impact the health and safety of patients. As a TCM practitioner and employer, you are expected to implement reasonable measures to minimize the risk of your staff acquiring or spreading infection. To this end, training for staff should include an understanding of: their exposure risks as health care providers; infection control and prevention strategies that are relevant and specific to their tasks and responsibilities; management of personal illness and injury to reduce exposure to others. Practitioners have an ethical obligation to remain current on infection and control procedures and to ensure that such practices are implemented in their practices and by their staff. It is expected that TCM practitioners wi ll have written policies and procedures for infecti on control that are made available to staff and are appropriate and relevant to the practices and duties of staff. 2.6.2 Immunization Immunization is critical for the prevention and control of infections. Health care workers have increased exposure to com municable diseases and should consider vaccinations that provide immunity to preventable illness. All staff members are strongly encouraged to know their immunization status and to keep their chosen immu nizations up -to-date. Staff members who are not i mmunized are at increased risk of acquiring infection or suffering severe symptoms from acquiring infectious diseases from patients. Immuno - compromised staff may also be more likely to transmit some viruse s to staff and patients over longer periods of time . Care should be taken when assigning certain tasks to staff with compromised immunity. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 30 Hepatitis B and tetanus are the most important vaccine -preventable diseases for all TCM practitioners and staff to c arefully consider. It is strongly recommended that all TCM practitioners and staff who may have exposure to blood, blood products, body fluids, or sharps be immunized against hepatitis B and tetanus. It is recommended that all TCM practitioners and sta ff consider being immunized against flu, measles, m umps, diphtheria, and polio. It is also recommended that practitioners have an annual physical that includes testing for TB, hepatitis, and HIV. Pre-employment screening can assist staff and practitioners in identifying conditions that may put individuals at risk. Practitioners and staff can reference provincial health care websites to get detailed information of the immunization recommendations and schedules. The following booklet \"Immunization: Your Best Protection\" from the Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care (Ontario) provides detailed information on vaccinations. http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/23007/293747.pd f The following site provides detailed information on the immunization schedule for British Columbia. http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/immunization.stm The following site provides detailed informatio n on the immunization schedule for Newfoundland and Labrador . http://www.health.gov.nl.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/immunizations.html The following site provides detail ed information on the immunization schedule for Ontario. http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/immunization/static/immunization_t ool.html Diseases with Available Vaccines All practitioners and staff members should have an informed understanding of infectious diseases and available vaccines. The following information is adapted from, \" Immunization: Your Best Protect ion,\" Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, Ontario. DIPHTHERIA is a very serious bacterial infection. It can cause breathing problems, heart failure, nerve damage, and death in about 10% of cases. HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE B (HIB ) is a bacterium that ca n infect any part of the body. It can cause middle ear infections, breathing problems, damage to joints, pneumonia (lung infection), inflammation of the brain leading to brain damage and death. This vaccine is recommended for children less than 5 years of age. HEPATITIS B is a v irus that can cause serious liver problems that can be fatal, such as liver failure and liver cancer. HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) is a very common virus transmitted through sexual activity. HPV has been found to cause cervical can cer, some other rare canc ers and TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 31 genital warts. (About 75 per cent of adults will have at least one HPV infection in their lifetime.) INFLUENZA is a viral infection that causes cough, high fever, chills, headache and muscle pain. It can cause pneumonia ( infection of the lungs), middle ear infections, heart failure and death. The danger of this infection varies from year -to-year depending on the strain and can be mild to life threatening. MEASLES causes rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eye s. It can cause middle ea r infection, pneumonia (lung infection), inflammation of the brain, hearing loss, brain damage, and death. MENINGOCCAL DISEASE -GROUP C is a very serious bacterial infection and a common cause of meningitis (infection of the linin g of the brain and spinal cord) and meningococcemia (severe infection of the blood) that can cause severe complications and death. MUMPS causes fever, headache, painful swelling of the glands in the mouth and neck, earache, and can cause inflammation of the brain. It can cause t emporary or permanent deafness and swelling of the ovaries in women and testes in men, possibly leading to sterility. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes severe coughing spells for weeks or months. It can also cause pneumonia (lung infection), middle ear i nfection, convulsions (seizures), inflammation of the brain, and death. The risk of complications is greatest in children younger than one year of age. PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE is a bacterial infection that can cause serious illnesse s such as pneumonia, bloo d infection, and meningitis. POLIO can cause paralysis (loss of control over muscles in the body) inflammation of the brain and death. People get polio from drinking water or eating food with the polio virus in it. It is no longe r common in Canada becaus e of high immunization rates, but cases do occur elsewhere in the world and polio may be acquired when traveling if you are not fully immunized. RUBELLA (German measles) causes fever, rash, swelling of the neck glands, and swelli ng and pain in the joints . It can cause bruising and bleeding. If a pregnant woman gets rubella, it can be very dangerous for the unborn baby. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful muscle spasms, breathing failure, and can lead to death. It is caused by bacte ria and spores in the soi l that can infect wounds. VARICELLA (Chicken pox) is a highly contagious viral infection. It can cause fever, headache, chills, muscle or joint aches a day or two before the itchy, red rash appears. A pregnant woman with chicken pox can pass it on to her unborn baby. Mothers with chicken pox can also give it to their newborn baby after birth. Chicken pox can be very severe or even life threatening to newborn babies. 2.6.3 Illness and Work Restrictions Practitioners and staff are justifiably concerned abo ut contracting infectious diseases from patients through their regular work -related duties. As previously referenced, procedures such as the following can reduce risk for staff: TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 32 adhering to routine practices with strong emphasis on effective hand hygiene using additional precautions when warranted triaging or rescheduling patients when appropriate regular and effective cleaning and disinfecting of office space and equipment encouraging appropriate immunization based on risks and dut ies Practitioners and st aff who are ill can act as the infectious agent who spreads infections to patients and other staff. Staff members who are ill or injured need to use good judgment in taking precautions so that patient health is not compromised, e ither through actions tha t control and prevent the spread of the disease or by staying at home. Listed below are some of the considerations that should be part of the discussions and training with staff. Common Cold and Upper Respiratory Illnesses continu ous and diligent hand hyg iene practise respiratory etiquette wear surgical mask avoid contact with immune compromised patients stay at home if fevered, vomiting, or diarrhea Influenza do not work until well if you must work then: o wear surgical mask o pract ise continuous and dilige nt hand hygiene o practise respiratory etiquette o avoid contact with high risk patients (e.g., older patients, chronic cardiac) Dermatitis (chapped hands or eczema) note: areas of broken skin increase the risk of infection transmissi on cover with bandage or glove practise good skin care Cuts, Abrasions covered with bandage or protective dressing re-evaluate work duties if large or persistent cuts are present Cold Sores cover the lesion if possible avoid touching practise diligent ha nd hygiene assess the ris k to certain patients and take appropriate additional precautions Herpetic Finger Infection avoid all patient contact until the lesion is resolved note: medical gloves are not effective in preventing the spread Shingles do not ha ve contact with high risk patients until lesions are crusted TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 33 some duties may still be carried out (except with high risk patients) if all lesions can be covered and diligent hand hygiene is used Vomiting, Diarrhea or Fever do not work until well 2.6.4 Bl ood -borne Pathogens: Prec autions, and Exposure Management Blood -Borne Pathogens: Precautions for Staff The most effective approaches to reduce exposure to blood -borne pathogens are based on practices that assume all blood and body fluids (except tears and sweat) are potentially i nfectious. As well, blood and body fluids do not have to be obvious or visible on an instrument or equipment in order to be potential sources of infection. Most exposures are preventable through adherence to practices that include safe handling and disposa l of sharps, use of personal protective equipment, appropriate immunization, hand hygiene, and effective cleaning of blood spills. Blood -Borne Pathogens: Exposure Management Exposure to blood -borne pathogens such as HBV, HCV and HIV requires practitioner s and staff to react in an organized and swift way. This requires attention and pre - planning in order to minimize any risk to staff caused by accidental exposure to blood (needle stick) or mucous membrane (splash) accidents. Establ ishing an effective plan provides an efficient and defensible process that protects staff and patients. If the exposure is deemed significant , the following steps are recommended. 1. Immediately provide first aid after sharps injuries o allow the wound to ble ed freely for a brief tim e o gently wash with soap and water o bandage as required after exposure to eye, nose, or mouth o flush area with generous amounts of water for at least 10 minutes after exposure to broken skin o wash with soap and water 2. Assess patient's status and seek patient consent for testing practitioner should assess the risk by examining patient's medical history and questioning the patient patient cooperation should be sought to clarify status if HBV, HCV, or HIV status is unknown or uncertain, a dvise patient to consent to testing of blood -borne pathogens by qualified medical professionals 3. Staff member should be referred to an infectious disease specialist or hospital emergency department for further advice and if necessary, post -exposure prophyl axis have processes and information readily available so that the staff member can have prophylaxis treatment administered as quickly as possible TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 34 4. Document the incident workplace safety requirements must be adhered to record the staff member's name, and s tatus of their immunizati ons date and time of the incident what the staff member was doing detail the extent of the exposure, the protective measures that were in place, and the actions that were taken immediately afterward the name of the source and the known status of the blood -borne pathogen identify follow -up procedures and post -exposure counselling and management 2.7 Waste Management This section provides a general overview of waste management for TCM practitioners. In most TCM practices, waste can b e categorized as either general waste or biomedical waste . Biomedical wastes are the solids, liquids, and sharps derived or contaminated from biological sources that are potentially infectious or dangerous. Biomedical waste must be handled and disposed of carefully in order to pr otect the public and staff from potential infections. The most common biomedical waste in many TCM clinics are sharps (acupuncture needles, lancets, dermal needles, three -edged needles, intradermal needles, or anything that could potentially pierce the sk in) and materials and equipment containing blood or body fluids (e.g., cotton swabs). The practitioner is responsible for ensuring that acupuncture needles and other sharps are disposed of safely. The person using the sharp must dispose of the sharp the mselves. Single -use sharps are disposed of in a puncture -resistant, rigid container that cannot be punctured by sharps under normal conditions. It is recommended that the container have a handle for safe transport and a lid that fits tightly. The contai ner should be identified with the biohazard label and placed out of reach of children. Containers should not be filled to more than three -quarters capacity. Containers must not be treated as general waste and must be disposed of i n compliance with approve d local and provincial procedures. Office staff managing biomedical waste should wear protective apparel and be informed of relevant immunizations. Licensed medical waste handlers must be used to remove biomedical waste. TCM oft en involves the use of bo tanical material, which is neither irradiated nor sterilized, and can therefore form mould. Although not \"contaminated by use\", such moulds are potential health hazards and should be disposed of appropriately and in compliance with any local requirements. Check with local municipal regulations for specific waste handling and segregation requirements. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 35 2.8 Other Regulations As required under Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), employers have a duty to have written procedures related to the health an d safety of employees. These procedures must include: safe work practices safe working conditions proper hygiene practices use of hygienic facilities control of infections Also under the act, employees are required to wear the pro tective clothing or use protective equipment that the employer has deemed necessary for safety. Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) is a national system for safe management of hazardous materials legislated by federal and provincial jurisdictions. The WHMIS l egislation provides that workers must be informed about the hazards in the workplace, and receive appropriate training to allow them to work safely. WHMIS provides the necessary information for: cautionary labels on containers of controlled products; the provision of material safety data sheets ( MSDS) for each controlled product; a worker education program. As such, practitioners who purchase or use controlled products must make sure: that hazardous materials are correctly la belled or supply labels f or all controlled materials that do not have labels; material safety data sheets (MSDS) are available to staff members; training programs about hazardous materials are provided to staff. 2.9 Breaking the Chain of Infection The fo llowing graphic summarize s some key elements of infection prevention and control from this document. The graphic highlights some strategies for practitioners in breaking the chain of infection in their practices. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 36 TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 37 Glossary of Terms for Infection Prevention and Control Additional precautions: Infection prevention and control interventions that are applied in addition to routine precautions for certain pathogens or clinical practices, based on the method of transmission (e.g., contact, droplet, airb orne). Airborne transmi ssion: Occurs by dissemination of microorganisms (infectious particles < 5mm in diameter) that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. These microorganisms (or germs) enter the host by inhalation and can survive for l ong periods and can be wi dely dispersed by air currents. Alcohol -based hand sanitizer: An alcohol preparation (usually 70% ethyl alcohol) used for waterless application in order to reduce microorganisms on the hands. It is an effective complement (but not replacement) to hand wa shing. If hands are physically soiled, hand washing with soap and water must be done. Antimicrobial soap: Soap containing an antiseptic agent. Antiseptic: A substance that destroys or stops the growth of micro -organisms on living tissue (e.g., skin). Antiseptics and disinfectants are manufactured for distinct and separate purposes. It is not advisable to use antiseptics on inanimate objects or, to use disinfectants on living tissue. Aseptic technique: A term used to describe prac tices that prevent infect ion during invasive procedures such as needling. Blood -borne pathogens (BBPs): Viruses found in blood which produce infection, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Clean field: The area that has been prepared to contain the equipment necessary for acupuncture in such a way as to protect the sterility of the needles. (Note: A clean field is not the same as a sterile field.) Cleaning: The physical removal of foreign materia l (i.e., dust, soil, orga nic matter) from an object or item using water and mechanical action (e.g., brushing) with or without detergents. Cleaning physically removes rather than kills micro -organisms. Cleaning and then rinsing is performed before further processing. Meticulous cl eaning must precede disinfection or sterilization of medical instruments. Communicable: Infectious organisms which can be transmitted to others. Biomedical Waste : Also known as infectious waste or clinical waste, biomedical waste includes waste associate d with blood, body fluids secretions and excretions, and sharps. Infectious waste is suspected to contain pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi) capable of causing a disease in a susceptible host. Whether or not they ar e infected, such items ar e considered as hazardous health care waste. Licensed medical waste handlers must be used to remove biomedical waste. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 38 Contamination: The introduction of contaminating viruses, bacteria, or other organisms into or onto previously c lean or sterile objects r endering them unclean or non -sterile. Contact Transmission : The physical transfer of an organism between an infected person and a susceptible host involving direct or indirect contact. Indirect contact occurs when a patient comes in contact with equipment contaminated with infectious microorganisms. Direct contact occurs when an infected person transfers the organism directly to a susceptible host. Droplet Transmission: Inhalation of respiratory pathogenic microorganisms suspende d on liquid particles exh aled by someone already infected. For example, a person suffering from an upper respiratory infection sneezes, allowing infectious microorganisms to leave the person's body and infect another person within close proximity. Deconta mination: The process of cleaning, followed by inactivation of pathogenic micro -organisms from objects rendering an object safe for identified use. Disinfectant: A chemical agent with a drug identification number (DIN) used on inanimate (non -living) obje cts to kill micro -organis ms. Examples include hypochlorite dilutions such as bleach, and commercial disinfectants such as LYSOL\u00ae. Disinfectants are used on inanimate objects; antiseptics are used on living tissue. Disinfection: A process that destroys or kills some, but not all, disease -producing micro -organisms on an object or surface. Disinfection usually involves chemicals, heat or ultraviolet light. Levels of chemical disinfection (high, intermediate, low) vary with the type of product used. Fomites: These are objects in the inanimate environment that may become contaminated with microorganisms and serve as a vehicle of transmission. Examples include toys or magazines in a waiting room. Health Care Facility : An organization that employs health care wo rkers and cares for patie nts/clients. Health Care Worker : Any person working in a health care facility (e.g., practitioner, student assistant, receptionist, and cleaner). Infection : Occurs when bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites enter the body and gr ow and multiply. The prog ression of the organism may cause symptoms in the infected person. However, people can be infected with an organism but have no symptoms or signs. If the infection begins to cause harm to the person, it is then called a disease . Infectious Agent : A microb ial organism with the ability to cause disease. The greater the organism's virulence (ability to grow and multiply), invasiveness (ability to enter tissue), and pathogenicity (ability to cause disease), results in the increased pos sibility that the organis m will cause an infection. Infectious agents are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS): Material Safety Data Sheets are produced by the manufacturer with details of the substance, including fi rst aid measures if there is exposure. Employers must have MSDS from the manufacturer of controlled products used in the office. For further information, consult the Ministry of Labour. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 39 Micro -organism: Microscopic organisms such as bacteria, virus, or fu ngus (commonly known as g erms), that can cause an infection in humans. Mode of Transmission : Method of transfer by which the organism moves or is carried from one place to another. Mucous Membrane: Thin sheets of tissue that line various openings of the body, such as the mouth, nose, and eyes. Pathogen : Any disease producing microorganism such as a virus, bacterium, prion, or fungus. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Specialized clothing or equipment (e.g., medical gloves, masks, plastic apron) worn by staff for protection a gainst infectious hazards. It is the responsibility of the health care worker to put on the appropriate personal protective equipment in any situation that is likely to lead to exposure (either for the health care worker or the pat ient) of blood, body fluids, excretions and secretions. Portal of Entry: An opening allowing the microorganism to enter the host. Portals include body orifices, mucus membranes, or breaks in the skin. Portal of Exit: A place of exit providing a way for the microorganism to leav e the reservoir. For example, the microorganism may leave the reservoir through the nose or mouth when someone sneezes or coughs. Reprocessing : The procedures required to make an instrument or equipment, that has been used (conta minated), ready to be use d again. Respiratory Etiquette: A standard of behaviour and manners established during the SARS outbreak used to minimize transmission of respiratory infections. Routine Practices: A Health Canada term used to describe basic sta ndards of infection preve ntion and control that are required for safe patient care. Routine practices are based on the concept that all patients are potentially infective, even when asymptomatic, and that the same safe standards of practice should routinel y apply to contact with b lood, body fluids and secretions (e.g., saliva) mucous membranes, and non -intact skin. It may also be referred to as Routine Precautions . Sanitation: A process that reduces microorganisms on an inanimate object to a safe level (e. g., dishes and eating ute nsils are sanitized). Sterilization: A validated use of procedures that kills all pathogenic micro -organisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and spores. Items must be cleaned thoroughly before effective sterilization can take place. Sterilization is a rigid standard and there is no such thing as partial sterility. In acupuncture, sterilization is required for all instruments that pierce the skin (e.g., needles , plum blossom needles, lancets) and guide tubes. Sterilant: A subs tance or agent used in st erilization. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 40 Vulnerable Host : A person who is unable to resist a microorganism invading the body and resulting in infection. The host is susceptible to the disease, lacking immunity or physical resistance to overcome the invasion by the pathogenic microor ganism. Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS): Federal and provincial legislation enacted to ensure safety in the workplace with respect to hazardous products. Waste Management System : All the activities relat ed to the creation, handl ing, storage, transportation and disposal of waste generated by health care establishments.TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 41 TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 42 Section 3: Risk Management of TCM Practice 3.1 Introduction The provision of all health care se rvices requires applicati on of professional judgment, and this comes with inherent risks. This risk can be minimized and managed by making informed professional judgments with thorough knowledge and understanding of best practice guidelines and applicable regulations. TCM practit ioners must comply with all local, provincial, and national regulations related to the safe delivery of health care services such as: obtaining informed consent to treatment creating, using, storing, and disposing of patient recor ds maintaining confidenti ality of patient information and records reporting of communicable disease As well, the TCM practitioner must adhere to safety requirements, such as: building codes and safety codes when establishing or renovating a clinic, or working from a home -based s etting fire regulations, fire protection and detection requirements, and electrical safety provincial and national safety standards and related policies and procedures safe handling of chemicals and biohazards in the workplace the proper documentation of a ccidents related to injury or property loss as required safety of patients and staff related to abusive or violent behaviour in the workplace 3.2 Risk Management: Working Environment 3.2.1Principles for Maintaining Safe Working En vironments The premises u sed for the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture must be appropriate and suitable for the safe delivery of professional health care services. The premises must allow for safe, clean, and sanitary practices. The premises must have hand -washing facilities. The treatment room must allow for ease of movement and efficient cleaning. The treatment room and work room procedures must reduce the risk of possible cross -contamination. The premises must allow for safe, cle an, and sanitary practice s. The premises must: be used only for the TCM practice or for delivery of related health care services; have convenient and sufficient washroom facilities for clients and staff of the practice; comply with current local building, fire, and health and saf ety regulations; be in good repair and properly maintained . TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 43 If the practice is in a private home, the treatment room(s) must be entirely separate from any rooms used for living, sleeping, dining or other domestic purposes that are not compatible with the delivery of health services. The treatment room must be clean and should have a designated working area that sterile equipment can be placed (e.g., a table covered with a clean towel). Sterile equipment should be covered until ne eded for use (e.g., cover ed with clean linen). The treatment rooms must have adequate light and ventilation. It is recommended that a cleaning and maintenance schedule be established and documented in the event that such activity is required for evidence . The premises must have hand washing facilities. The facility must have a hand sink with a clean running hot and cold water supply. It is preferable to include hand washing facilities that are for the sole use of the practitioner. The hand washing facili ties must be located in o r in close proximity to the treatment area in order to reduce the risk of cross contamination. It is recommended that faucets be hands -free operated, or with sensor taps. The facility must include a liquid soap dispenser, disposabl e paper towels and a wast e receptacle next to the sink. It is not recommended to use bar soaps or cloth towels in hand washing areas. If the waste receptacle is lidded, it should be equipped with a foot -operated lid. The treatment room must allow for eas e of movement and efficie nt cleaning. The treatment room must: have sufficient space to allow for safe practice; have sufficient space for the safe and clean storage of instruments and supplies (enclosed storage is recommended to protect from moisture and dust); have adequate heat ing, ventilation, and artificial lighting; be constructed of materials that are washable and can be easily cleaned and disinfected, as required. Countertops, trays and all working surfaces must have smooth, impervious, easily cleaned surfaces (e.g., lamin ate, stainless steel). Practitioners are reminded that viruses such as Hepatitis B can survive on surfaces at room temperature for one week or more. Sterilized tools and equipment (e.g., needles) are not to be placed on work surfa ces, unless the surface i s prepared as a clean field. If the work surface comes into contact with a used needle or blood, it must to be cleaned with a high level disinfectant ( see Section 2: Infection Prevention and Control ). Low -level disinfectant is suff icient for regular cleani ng of work surfaces. Patient tables, chairs, mats or other furniture used for treatment or that come in direct contact with patient's skin during treatment must have smooth surfaces, be impervious to moisture, and be easily cleane d. Smooth, nonporous flo oring is recommended (e.g., hardwood, tiles, or laminated flooring). Carpets and rugs are not easily washed and are not recommended in treatment areas. If carpets are used in the waiting or reception room, they should be short -piled and easily cleaned. Wal ls should be painted or paneled. Cloth -type wallpaper is not recommended for the treatment areas. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 44 Treatment rooms should be equipped with a box of disposable medical gloves, disposable paper towels or single -use cloth towels, a wa ste container (with plast ic liners), and a sharps disposal container (if applicable) that is not in reach of patients. As applicable, the room may require a suitable receptacle for soiled linen or a separate receptacle for clinical waste. Storage jars for such items as cotton bal ls and tweezers must be cleaned regularly. Never refill the dispenser without first cleaning the container. The container for isopropyl alcohol should be cleaned and its contents replaced regularly. Alcohol can evaporate leaving a solution which can act as a breeding -ground for bacteria. The level of activity in the practice must guide the frequency of regular and ongoing daily and weekly cleaning that is required. Clinics should have a documented cleaning schedule by staff or outs ide workers. Cleaning sta ff must be instructed how to safely handle and dispose of any found sharp that was not disposed of in the sharps container. The following cleaning schedule may be appropriate for many practices. Daily Cleaning Clean immediately any surface that has been contaminated with blood or body fluids. Clean daily all surfaces in the treatment area and instrument reprocessing area with an appropriate detergent/disinfectant. Inspect the floors in the treatment areas for sharps that have b een mistakenly dropped. Wash all floor surfaces in the treatment area and instrument reprocessing area with appropriate cleansers. Clean all counters, sinks, and washrooms. Spot -clean walls and doors. Clean and disinfect door handles and other high -touch a reas as appropriate. Remo ve all garbage. Weekly Cleaning Clean with detergent/disinfectant cleanser all tabletops, vertical surfaces on cupboards, door handles, and hard surface equipment and furniture (e.g., desks, carts, vinyl chairs). Clean the inside of cupboards weekly or m onthly depending on use. See additional information regarding cleaning in Section 2: Infection Prevention and Control . The treatment room and work room procedures must reduce the risk of possible cross - contamination. Treatment su rfaces must be covered wi th: clean paper roll that is disposed of after treating each patient, or fresh, clean towels or linens that have been boiled or machine -washed on hot water setting before being reused. Work surfaces must be cleaned and dried: when visibly soiled; after each treatment session; after contact with contaminated equipment or materials; TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 45 after instruments are cleaned on the surface; at the start or end of the day. The reprocessing area is a designated area of the practice that is used to clean and to sterilize reusable instruments and equipment. Reprocessing areas should: be designed to ensure that equipment can be handled safely to minimize the risk of cross contamination; have a separate sink that is only used for reprocessing inst ruments and not for hand washing. It is recommended that reprocessing sinks are double sinks to allow for cleaning and rinsing as two processes that reduces the risk of cross contamination; be well ventilated and free from excessive humidity. Food prepar ation areas must be separ ate from the reprocessing area. Staff must be educated on where food and drinks can be prepared and consumed. Food, drink, cosmetic application, or similar activity must not occur in areas where there is exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials may occur. 3.2.2 Guidelines specific to the storage and preparation of Chinese herbs The following guidelines apply to setting in which herbs are prepared, compounded, dispensed or stored. All work surfaces, storage facili ties floors, floor coveri ngs and furniture should be made of materials that can be easily and thoroughly cleaned. There is a supply of hot and cold water that is adequate for the effective operation of the dispensary and for washing utensils and equipment used in the preparation, service, or storage of herbs. A refrigerator is available for the exclusive storage of herbs requiring refrigeration. Sufficient containers are available for storing waste in a safe and sanitary manner. Hand -washing facilities are available for staff and a re located in a separate location in the dispensary. Only a potable water supply should be available and used in any room where herbs are prepared, compounded, dispensed or stored. All herbs should be stored on or in shelves, dra wers or fixtures provided for that purpose. Every room in a dispensary where herbs are prepared, compounded, dispensed, or stored should be kept free from materials and equipment not regularly used in the room. Herbs are botanical material which can form mould and be a potential health hazard. Enclosed storage is recommended (as appropriate to the type of herb) to protect herbs from moisture. Labelling should indicate expiry date so that herbs can be safely managed and disposed of as required. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 46 The room s hould be well ventilated and free from excessive moisture and sunshine. The room temperature for safe storage of herbs should not be in excess of 20 Celsius. The use of high speed fans to cool work areas is discouraged in rooms designated for processing a nd compounding of herbs. The use of fans increases the risk of possible cross -contamination of dry powders caused by rapid movement of air. The use of other means of room cooling, such as air conditioning, is encouraged. Refrigerators for the storage of h erbs in a dispensary shou ld be maintained at a temperature between 1.3 Celsius and 10 Celsius. Refrigerators should be kept clean and in sanitary condition and be located in an area not accessible to the public. When cleaning equipment and surfaces wher e herbs are prepared, car e must be taken to ensure residues from the cleaning process itself (e.g., detergents, solvents, etc.) are also removed from surfaces and equipment. Additional information is available in Section 5: Safe Procedures and Processes: Herbology . 3.3 Risk Man agement: Site of Practice Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture is practised in a variety of locations and settings including private clinics, hospitals, educational institutions, and multi - disciplinary health care settings. Each site must comply wi th the appropriate regulatory requirements and jurisdictional bylaws. The following are guidelines for the building and site of the practice. Location: Check city bylaws to ensure the premises are zoned for the practice of TCM. Make sure that building cod e requirements are met. Accessibility for disabled patients or employees: Wheelchair accessibility to a TCM practice may or may not be a requirement for your jurisdiction. If wheelchair access is not required and not available at your site, try to make ar rangements for treatment of those patients who are unable to access your practice. Where required, patients and staff may need wheelchair access from the parking area to the office. Where required, patients and staff will need acce ss to a restroom with a t oilet stall equipped with a transfer bar, and with a sink that is at an accessible height. Electrical/Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning Systems The electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems must be maintain ed in suitable working co ndition. Install smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in compliance with local requirements. The use of moxa increases the importance of ongoing monitoring and preventative maintenance. Moxa smoke may set off smoke detecto rs in the practice or in neighbouring offices. If you use moxa in your treatment room(s), the ventilation system is of particular importance and must comply with local government requirements. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 47 Air Quality Control: The quality of air in the TCM clinical environment is very impor tant. Fumes, odors and vapors can affect the health of the practitioners, staff, and the patients. Moxa smoke may require the installation of special ventilation systems (or choosing other options such as smokeless moxa sticks). M oxibustion treatments nee d to be carefully monitored as a potential fire hazard. Ventilation and air filtration systems are important considerations when working with herbs, especially if the air is particularly humid or dusty. Consider installing ventila tion and air filtration s ystems in dusty or vaporous conditions. Odors from disinfectants such as bleach and other solvents may cause allergic reactions or illness. Thoughtful selection of a disinfectant is an important risk management consideration. Weak air exchange systems and mould s are also important considerations in air quality control. 3.4 Risk Management: Emergencies 3.4.1 Emergency Actions Anticipating and planning for emergency situations is a critical step in risk management in order to protec t your patients and staff , and to avoid or reduce the likelihood of possible liability issues. Clearly identify and post a list of phone numbers to call in the event of an emergency. These telephone numbers may need to include local hospital, local physic ian and community health centre, and the poison control centre. Develop responses so that staff members know what to do in a power failure. Post or have on file guidelines for common mishaps (e.g., burns and scalds, chemical burns, electrical burns, eye i njuries, choking). Post the locations of emergency items such as first aid boxes and fire extinguishers. Establish and post escape plans and routes in case of fire or other emergencies that requires the premises to be evacuated. Check with local authoriti es on any requirements th at require staff training or practise of the evacuation plan. Establish procedures in order to account for all individuals after evacuation. Fire Emergency Plans Health care settings often have flammable items that can start or a ggravate the spread of fire. Fire emergencies are a potential risk factor in the practice of TCM and acupuncture, especially in the use or moxa or fire -cupping therapies. Moxa extinguishers or containers with sand are critical when using moxa in the clinic . It is important that c linics and practices have a documented fire prevention plan that includes: information on location of fire alarms and fire extinguishers instructions on how to use the fire extinguisher TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 48 how and where to evacuate the building guide lines to assist the evacu ation of patients or staff with disabilities guidelines if people become trapped in the building due to the fire lists of flammable chemicals used or stored in the practice Ensure that you or a staff member is trained on how to us e the fire extinguisher. It is strongly recommended that this training be documented. The fire extinguisher must be checked, maintained, and replaced as required by the manufacturer's instructions and local fire regulations. It is recommended that you main tain a list of potential fire hazards or ignition sources for fire, and consider appropriate the safe storage for chemical or flammable items. Fires may occur in neighbouring facilities and spread to your clinic. Patient medical files and other important documents should be secur ed in fire proof storage. Check with your local authorities to ensure proper and regular inspections or approvals as required. Fall Injuries Good housekeeping practices are the best preventative measures that can reduce the likel ihood of falls by staff o r patients. Keep main walkways clear of trip or slip threats. Practitioners may be liable for preventable situations that cause falls to staff or patients (e.g., dangling electrical cords, slippery or recently washed floors, loose rugs, stairways without railings, ice on outdoor sidewalks). If renting or leasing, check your agreement on what is required of the landlord and of the renter/leaser. When in treatment, patients may faint or fall asleep. Ensure proper placement and monito ring of the patients. Ens ure the patient is able to safely move onto and off tables. All fall or slip incidents must be documented. Staff should have access to forms that allow them to document the who, what, when, where and why of an accident. 3.5 Risk Ma nagement: Chemicals and W aste 3.5.1 Chemical Hazards and Labelling Disinfectants, bleach, alcohol and iodine are often used and stored in TCM practices. Most of these items can be safely stored and used as long as containers are properly labelled (with com mon or chemical name and any hazards clearly indicated) and used as directed. Correct storage and use of chemicals ensures that contamination does not occur. Precautions do need to be taken with chemicals that are decanted or transferred from bulk contai ners to other generic con tainers. These generic containers should be labelled or referenced with important precautions clearly indicated so that chemicals are not improperly used . TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 49 Guidelines for Storing Chemicals In order to safely store chemicals, att end to the following proc edures. Store all chemicals in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All chemicals are to be clearly labelled and are easily read. All solutions that have been decanted from bulk containers are to be clearly and fully labelled to allow for sa fe use. Include the date of decanting and any applicable expiry date. Read the relevant material safety data sheet before decanting any chemical. See Section 2.8: Other Regulations for further elaboration related to WHMIS. 3.5.2 Waste Management See Section 2: Infection Prevention and Control for detailed information on waste management. Check with local municipal regulations for specific waste handling and segregation requirements. Important Reminders Single -use sharps must b e disposed of immediately after use in a puncture - resistant, rigid container that complies with local requirements. Sharps must only be disposed of in the approved manner and never disposed of in general waste, recycled waste, or in industrial waste bins. Local directories will id entify companies that can manage biohazard waste disposal. 3.6 Risk Management: Staff 3.6.1 Introduction There are many aspects of a TCM practice that require staff (and practicing students) to be aware of and trained in order to operate in a safe and pr ofessional health care environment. The practitioner has the responsibility of ensuring that staff members will receive the required training, and will have their training refreshed and updated as appropriate and needed. The import ant nature of the service s provided in a TCM practice require staff members to be fully trained in order to support the delivery of safe, responsible, quality health care to patients. Many of these specific training requirements have been identified previ ously in the course (e.g. , training on infection prevention and control processes, educating and training related to confidential patient records and the protection of private data). There may be situations that arise that are unforeseen and staff may be unsure of what actions t o take. In a health services setting, it is important to establish duties, protocols, and a hierarchy of decision -making rights and responsibilities with staff so that actions are not taken or decisions are not made that unintentio nally affect the health a nd safety of patients. Establishing a positive working environment in a TCM practice requires staff and student practitioners to understand the scope and limits of their decision -making. Decisions and actions that are beyond their training and qualificati ons and are related to patient TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 50 health, safety and privacy must be directed to the supervising practitioner. Actions that are assigned to student practitioners remain the responsibility of the qualified supervising practitioner. Su pervising practitioners a re required to provide appropriate monitoring and supervisory processes of students in order to be assured that patients continue to receive safe, high quality, health care experiences. 3.6.2 Managing Abusive or Violent Behaviour of Patients In health care settings, patients may experience anxiety or stress related to their illness and may target their feelings of anger, fear, frustration, or aggression toward others. As a result, staff members are at potential risk of being abused, harassed, threatened or assaulted in circumstances related to their work. For example, staff may experience verbal abuse (e.g., swearing, insults, condescending language), harassment (e.g., demeaning or humiliating statements, bullying, unwelcome behaviou rs or acts), threatening behaviours (e.g., shaking fists, throwing objects, verbal or written threats of harm), or physical attacks (e.g., pushing, hitting). Abusive or violent behaviour of patients can happen in any clinical setting. The following guidel ines are to raise awarene ss for practitioners and staff. The guidelines do not provide all the necessary tools and training that may be required to manage situations safely. It is encouraged that all practitioners receive appropriate training by certified instructors, e.g., Non Vi olent Crisis Intervention (NVCI). Such training is strongly recommended for practitioners and staff who work in settings with a history or increased risk of abusive or violent behaviour by patients. Guidelines for managing abusiv e or violent behaviours of patients: The primary concern when presented or addressing aggressive behaviours is to ensure personal safety and the safety of others. Do not place yourself in physical risk. Assess your personal safety and the safety of others in the vicinity. Do not aggravate or escalate the situation. Remain calm. Do not become confrontational. Engage the help of others as appropriate or required. Clinics should establish protocols so that assistance from others can be signalled for without intensifying the situatio n. If the aggressive behaviour is by a patient, the behaviour should be documented in the patient file at some point following resolution of the incident. Further actions may be required based on the nature and severity of the issu e. Verbal Intervention S trategies If no immediate physical danger is evident, then the use of verbal intervention strategies may be appropriate. The following provide some suggested strategies and considerations. Be an empathetic listener. Give your full attention to what is bei ng said and be non-judgmental. Try to discover the source of the distress. If you sense patient anxiety or a noticeable change in behaviour, then speak in tones that let the person know that you care and that you are there to help. Focus the discussions on your efforts to help or resolve the distress . If the patient becomes defensive, non -compliant or is starting to lose a logical perspective, then use statements that provide simple directions or set reasonable limits. Providing the patient with choice in o ther acceptable TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 51 behaviours can be very effective. o Describe the patient's unacceptable behavio ur and state the behaviors that are expected. Describe acceptable alternate behaviors or actions (e.g., talking about feelings). o Inform t he patient of limits and help the patient understand the reason for the limits. Be aware of the tone and volume of your voice. Speak in a calm voice that does not further provoke actions. Be aware of body language that may be perceived by the patient as th reatening (leaning forwar d with hands on hips) or dismissive (rolling your eyes). Do not confront or crowd the individual. Provide them personal space. Your stance should communicate that you are non -challenging or non-threatening. Your actions should be f ocused on calming the sit uation. Listen carefully and be supportive. Do not take what is said by the patient as personal. There may be many unrelated and unknown factors that are provoking their behaviour. For patients that are acting out or demonstrating a loss of physical or em otional control, there are physical interventions that offer safe means of control that can be used by practitioners or staff who are trained in such strategies. 3.6.3 Medical Emergencies and Staff In the case of emergencies, firs t aid should be applied a s required, and the patient transported to a medical emergency centre for treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture should not be used to replace a necessary surgical intervention. Traditional Chinese Medicine and acu puncture is contraindicat ed in medical emergencies in which the condition is life -threatening and requires immediate transportation to a medical facility with emergency services. TCM practitioners should inquire of patients of any recent medical emergenc ies and describe steps fo r post -emergency follow -up with patients so that safe services may continue to be delivered as appropriate. First Aid and First Aid Certification Every TCM clinic should be equipped with a functional first aid kit. Guidelines for the content and number of first aid kits can be found at the Canadian Red Cross (www.redcross.ca ). It is recommended that: registered practitioners hold a current Standard First Aid Certificate (or equivalent), or a person is present at the TCM clinic that holds a current Standard First Aid Certificate (or equivalent) and has been appointed by the registered practitioner to administer first aid as required. In Newfoundland and Labrador, practitioners must consult wit h the College of Traditio nal Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists Newfoundland and Labrador for these requirements. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) CPR is an emergency procedure used to assist an individual who has suffered cardiac TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 52 arres t. The main purpose of CP R is to at least partially restore the flow of oxygenated blood to the heart and brain. CPR can extend the window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent damage being done to the brain. It is recommended th at: registered practition ers hold a CPR certification (level A), or a person is present at the TCM clinic that holds CPR certification (level A) and has been appointed by the registered practitioner to administer CPR as required. In Newfoundland and Labr ador, practitioners must consult with the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists Newfoundland and Labrador for these requirements. See sections Section 4: Safe Procedures and Processes: Acupuncture and Section 5: Safe Pr ocedures and Processes: H erbology specifically related to adverse reactions and contraindications. 3.7 Risk Management: Patients and Their Records 3.7.1 Scope of Practice Practitioners of TCM offer an important and unique set of diagnostic and treatment skills to their patients. Like all health care professionals, TCM practitioners have a defined scope of practice. Unless training and applicable legislation allows, TCM practitioners must not make a medical diagnosis based on non -TCM modality/therapy. This is important for the safe ty of patients. If evidence is found in patient case records of practitioners acting beyond their scope of practice, patients could be harmed and practitioners may be subject to legal actions by patients, insurance companies, and/o r regulatory bodies or ag encies. The health and best interests of the patients must inform all decisions about suggested treatments. When the situation warrants, TCM practitioners must refer patients to other practitioners, medical or otherwise, who have the required knowledge an d skills to deliver the needed services. TCM practitioners must make referrals to other health care professionals based on: limitations of their personal training and skills, or limitations of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Check with appropriate regulat ory bodies to ensure your understanding of your scope of practice responsibilities. 3.7.2 Legal Concepts that are Relevant to the Practitioner -Patient Relationship Risk management is not solely about safety issues, but also incl udes practices and action s that reduce a practitioner's vulnerability to legal consequences and lawsuits. The following are some of the legal concepts that are relevant to practitioners and are highlighted in this course. It is recommended that these and o ther legal topics be stud ied in greater depth by the practitioner through further readings or courses. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 53 Confidentiality : patients have the right to expect that their personal information will remain confidential Defamation : can relate to disparaging commun ications that are slander ous (transitory statements) or libelous (written, published or broadcast statements) Informed Consent: (see section 3.7.7) Standard of Care : patients can expect a standard of care that a reasonably prudent professional practitioner would provide 3.7.3 Term inating the Practitioner -Patient Relationship There are a variety of situations where practitioner -patient relationships should or must be terminated. For example, termination may occur if: treatment has been completed; the passing of either the patient or the practitioner; the patient chooses to end the relationship; the practitioner chooses to terminate the relationship (this process is further clarified below). TCM practitioners have an ethical responsibility not to abandon the ir patients. If there is a situation where the practitioner, using professional judgment, decides to terminate the practitioner -patient relationship, it must be done carefully and thoughtfully in order to ensure the health of the patient and the continuity of care needed for the p atient. The practitioner must provide written notification to the patient, outlining the specific reasons for termination and the date that care will be terminated. If applicable, the practitioner must identify the need for conti nued care and establish p rocesses to allow for the efficient transfer of records to the new practitioner. 3.7.4 Patient Record Keeping The following provides general guidelines for the managing and maintaining of patient records. This section will NOT det ail all legal requirements or liabilities related to record keeping and management, but will focus on standards and guidelines that support safe delivery of service. Note: Practitioners must refer to the provisions of their College for specific and detai led requirements. TCM pr actitioners have a legal and ethical responsibility to keep patient information confidential . Practitioners must comply with all laws and regulations related to: collection, use, disclosure, disposal and transfer of information; processes that affect the quality and security of the information; procedures that grant access to patient information. Patient case records are the practitioner's or the clinic's memory. Records are the outputs that document the practitioner's activiti es, and the activities of patients and contacts external to the practice. Records provide evidence of decisions, transactions, and events which may need to be recalled or proven at a later date. TCM practitioners have the responsibility to ensure that al l staff members with acces s to TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 54 patient records are properly educated and trained in ensuring patient record confidentiality. Records build on the foundation of quality patient information gathered through effective clinical interviews during every practi tioner -patient consultatio n. The clinical interview is a critical stage in the consultation/visit process. At every consultation, accurate and appropriate information is gathered during the clinical interview to support the diagnostic, treatment, and plann ing processes. Patient rec ords document this critical process and support quality and consistent care. Purpose of Record Keeping Building an adequate record of every patient consultation is a critical element of quality TCM practice. Patient records ar e legal documents. Patient case records provide: a record of the patient's health history; thorough, organized and chronological documentation of important information such as assessments, treatments, significant communications, incident reports, referrals , delegation and supervisi on, discharge process, and so on; guidance that promotes consistency of care among TCM practitioners and among all health care professionals; means of legal protection for the practitioner and for the patient; potential legal docu mentation of treatments; enhanced quality care by documenting relevant information (both current and historical) that can be efficiently communicated to other treating practitioners and health care professionals; the basis for professional development and continuous improvement act ivities regularly carried out by TCM practitioners; foundation for retrieval of treatment details to assist in resolving disagreements or supporting evidence; a demonstrable record of accountability by the practitioner for the p rovision of responsible ca re. The patient 'record' includes all written, scanned, digital, photographic, radiological or other forms of chronicled or documented patient information. patient health records (either paper documents or electronic documents) photographs, images, audio or video tapes lab reports, imaging reports administrative records (e.g., contact information, complaint or commendation records) e-mails, records of telephone conversations or text messages Actions, observations and discussion s need to be documented; o therwise it may be assumed, in a legal context, to have not occurred. 3.7.5 Overview of Recording Requirements Sound risk management requires the documentation of consent, procedure explanation, patient comments and responses, o bservations, diagnostic pr ocesses, and other clinical recommendations and findings. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 55 TCM practitioners must inform themselves regarding relevant laws and standards and ensure compliance with regulations. The legislative requirements apply to all individua ls who handle patient info rmation. In Ontario, patient records can be initially written in the preferred language of the practitioner. However, patient record information that is mandated must include a translation in one of the official langu ages in order that relevant health car e information can be accurately shared with health care professionals and patients as required. In British Columbia, practitioners must reference the CTCMA regulations for specific standards and practices related to th e language requirements for patients' records. In Newfoundland and Labrador, practitioners should consult with the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists Newfoundland and Labrador for further information. The following pr ovides an overview of requirements. Th e list is not complete and is not intended to be complete. The list highlights selected requirements that are relevant to the safety course. A more complete list of requirements should be referenced through the College or through courses and training that is focused on legal requirements related to TCM practice. Patient records are confidential. These records must be legibly handwritten (in ink), typed or in elect ronic format. Records must be permanent. Records must be accurate and concise. All entries m ust be dated. All pages of a patient case record must clearly and uniquely identify the patient. Financial records must be kept separate from patient records. Key information in the records must be understandable to ot her health care professionals, particu larly another TCM practitioner. (See WHO International Standard Terminologies on Traditional Medicine in the Western Pacific Region (2007), available in pdf format at: http:// www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/WHOIST_26JUNE_FINAL.pdf The record is to be made at the time of the consultation or as soon as practically possible following the consultation. If there are alterations or amendments made to the records, all original ent ries must be clearly identifiable. If corrections are necessary at any time, liquid paper or erasable pens are not permitted. The changed words should be circled and struck through with a line, and the revised words wr itten or typed next to the change in a manner that makes it clear that it was added at a later time (this is true for both paper and electronic changes). The changed entry should be signed and dated. If a new document is re -created the original document mu st be kept and referenced. It is highl y recommended that the acupuncture points used in the treatment be documented with the numbering detailed in WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region , World Health Organization (2008) . The use of commonly accepted abbreviation s that are generally recognizable by professional peers is allowed. Codes and abbreviations that are obscure or personal should be avoided. In an emergency, a non -consulting TCM practitioner should be able to understan d the record so that the patient can b e TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 56 aided. Best practices recommend that records use factual, objective, and non - judgmental language. Personal information that is collected from patients should be carefully restricted to information that is required fo r the safe and effective delivery of TCM services to the patient. Responsibility for the accuracy of clinical information is solely that of the treating TCM practitioner and cannot be delegated to another person (e.g., student trainee, staff member). If an individual under the direct supervisi on of the treating practitioner (e.g., a student trainee) records the information in a patient record, the practitioner is still responsible for the content , and must countersign the recorded notes at the time of writi ng by the student. A patient or their authorized representative may request access to their personal patient record. There are only limited and prescribed legislated situations in which a practitioner may refuse a patient access to their medical records (e .g., likelihood of significant risk of serious bodily harm to patient or third party). Patient access to their records can be provided in a variety of ways (e.g., inspection, provision of a copy, documented explanation or summary of contents). If it can be shown that factual information is ina ccurate or incomplete, patients can request to have information corrected or updated. Patient records must be safeguarded. Safeguarding includes securing and controlling the access, use, storage, or disposal of the rec ords. In clinical situations where sev eral practitioners require access to the records, the responsibility to safeguard the records can be assigned to an appropriate individual. If a practitioner works in a clinic with other practitioners, the responsibili ty for safeguarding patient records is the shared responsibility of the clinic operator and the treating practitioner. The physical file (i.e., paper file and/or product of electronic file) is owned by the treating practitioner. The patient has a right of access to the information, but does n ot own the documents. Confidentiality requirements do not preclude a practitioner from discussing patient cases with other practitioners. However, for such discussions to occur, patient names and other identifying and private information must not be share d as part of that professional dialogue. 3.7.6 Information Contained in Patient Records Patient records should be accurate and provide an \"adequate level of detail \".The nature and complexity of the presented condition will influence the type and extent documentation. As well, follow -up consultations may focus on progress details and treatment, while initial consultations may focus on symptoms, health history, and diagnosis. When deciding on the level of detail in a pa tient record, the practitioner can app ly professional judgment. However, the practitioner must make those professional judgments with an understanding of the legal and medical importance of patient records. Practitioners may follow standard medical record ing methods, such as the use of SOAP TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 57 notes, when documenting information. SOAP notes have four components: Subjective information (patient description of reason for consultation, medical, family, and social history) Objective information (obtained by pract itioner, such as pulse, tongue) Assess ment of condition or progress from treatment Plan for treatment (TCM diagnosis, pattern differentiations, treatment principles, treatment including herbs, points, lifestyle advice, etc.) Patient case records can incl ude the following documentation of car e (not necessarily in the described order). date and time of consultation patient's name, address and contact number (where applicable, include parent or guardian information) relevant medical and health history (alle rgies, prescription and non -prescripti on medications, past illnesses, pregnancies, etc.) relevant family and social history other treatments/therapies being used (including herbal, dietary, naturopathic, manipulative, pharmaceutical, psychological) allergi es with any allergy alerts noted. Thou gh identified in medical history, it is important to make many allergies and allergic reactions very visible and prominent in the record keeping document adverse reactions to medications, foods, environmental substance s, etc. reason(s) for the TCM consult ation symptoms and signs (identified by the patient and detected and recognized by the practitioner using the four diagnostic methods of Inspection, Auscultation and Olfaction, Inquiry and Palpation) assessment finding s including tongue and pulse observati on/palpation TCM diagnosis (with clear evidence of thorough assessment of the patient's condition) treatment principles options for care if applicable (clearly document that patient had choices identified) detailed tr eatment plan evidence of informed cons ent by patient. (e.g. a dated and signed \"Consent to Treatment\" form. ) other relevant information (e.g., identification of possible side effects, alternative treatments available) evidence of patient's refusal to cons ent to treatment (as appropriate) evid ence of non-compliance to treatment by patient treatments performed: o acupuncture (include name and number of points and methods of stimulation) o herbal (prescribed formulas documented) o other modalities used with additi onal documented informed consent advic e provided to patient (e.g., diet, exercise, lifestyle) referrals to other services or practices discussions/contacts with other health care professionals (as it relates to the patient's condition) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 58 discussions with fam ily (with patient's consent, if applic able) patient response to treatment subsequent adjustments to treatment plan (with accompanying consent forms) To help summarize this list, the initial patient visit to the practice may include some or all of the foll owing information being detailed in th e patient record. chief complaint and other complaints health history allergy notation medications other therapies being utilized TCM diagnosis treatment principles treatment plan consent to treatment treatment perf ormed advice given Follow -up visits m ay include components shown above, as well as: progress notes, significant observations during appointment, and clinical findings explanations given to the patient discussions with the patient or his/her other health c are providers responses to previous tr eatment(s) documented patient's refusal to follow recommendations document missed appointments, cancellations, and late arrivals correspondence with the patient and others (e.g., blood tests, e -mail messages) 3.7. 7 Do cumenting Informed Consent to Treatmen t A patient has the right to receive sufficient information in order to make an informed decision on whether to accept treatment. A TCM practitioner may not impose care on a patient. It is the responsibility of the pra ctitioner to inform the patient about the procedure in order to obtain informed consent from the patient (or substituted decision maker) prior to treatment. Informed consent means that the patient agrees to the treatment and that he or she understands: the nature of the procedure that is be ing proposed; alternatives for the treatment; consequences of not having treatment; possible risks of the treatment; expected results of the treatment. A complete clinical record should contain documentation that informed consent has occurred, whether the consent has been given orally or in writing by the patient. The most defensible form of consent is in writing using a comprehensive and credible Consent to Treatment form that is signed and dated by the patient (o r legal guardian). Documented consent is especially important with procedures that may be perceived as causing damage or bruising to the patient (e.g., direct moxibustion and cupping, gua TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 59 sha). It is important that consent be informed by a meaningful dial ogue between the practitioner and the patient. A signed form is simply evidence of informed consent. The actual consent is the dialogue that occurs between the practitioner and the patient. If a patient is asked to sign a form without having had the discus sion with the practitioner, then the practitioner has not managed risk. Once the dialogue is complete, and the patient has provided informed consent, the practitioner can document this in the record and ask the patient to sign a consent form. If a patie nt does not provide informed consent t o treatment, then the practitioner should not treat the patient. Obtaining informed consent to treatment is essential for the protection of the patient and the practitioner. As appropriate for risk management, the pra ctitioner may record a patient's refus al to consent to treatment and that the consequences of the refusal have been explained to the patient. Full requirements and meanings of informed consent are described in the College practice standards. A more comple te description of the requirements for informed consent , including exceptions such as emergencies, is identified in: Health Care Consent and Facilities Admissions Act (British Columbia) Health Care Consent Act, 1996 (Ontario) Documenting Noncompliance Documenting noncompliance provides best p ractice evidence, if required. Document the recommended treatment. Describe the instructions or procedures that the patient was expected to follow. Describe the instructions that were not followed by the patient. Descr ibe specific patient behaviours that w ere observed and document specific patient comments in quotation marks. Document the discussions that identified consequences of noncompliance for the patient. If possible, have the patient sign the form indicating non compliance. 3.7.8 Records Management Records management is the process of systematically managing and organizing records and the data, information, and documents that are contained in these clinical records. Effective records management can make better use of physical space and electronic spac e, promote staff efficiency, improve security and control procedures to protect private information, and ensure evidence of compliance to legislated and regulated requirements. Traditionally, records were held in pape r format but are now held increasingly within electronic systems. Even for small practices, it is a challenging task to establish an effective records management process given the scope, volume, and the wide variety of formats, locations, people, documents and media that are required to create , access, and store records. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 60 The detailed processes and procedures for records management are beyond the scope of this safety course. However, the following points highlight important information for the practitioner that is relevant to the course. Any r ecord, up until the point that is legally disposed of by the practitioner, may be subject to information requests under the applicable privacy legislation. Staff must be trained on the secure handing of confidential re cords. Legal obligations and standards of practice must be described to staff in order that they may fulfill their duties. Establish in your practice the procedures and protocols that conform to the legal and regulatory requirements for the creation, use, retention, appraisal, and disposal of patient records. It is obligatory that records are closely monitored and managed throughout their life cycle. It is recommended that practitioners and staff regularly review the privacy policy and consider signing c onfidentiality agreements to affirm th e critical importance of privacy and confidentiality by all who manage patient records. The following summary identifies important considerations for the TCM practitioner, but full description of the regulations is ou tside the scope of this course and mus t be the responsibility of the practitioner to seek further information, training, or legal advice. Creation The treating practitioner is solely responsible for the creation and accuracy of the clinical records. Recor d management systems should allow for the creation of credible and useful records that are easy to retrieve but securely stored. Use, Disclosure and Transfer Records must be handled and accessed in compliance with provincial personal information and prote ction of privacy acts. Establish proce dures and controls to the movement and location of records. There are a range of statutory provisions that may limit the disclosure of records, even to the police, other health care professionals, relatives of patients , etc. Such regulations are sourced or practitioners are advised to obtain advice. Patient records, or any other patient -related information, should not be sent by email unless there is protection, such as encryption, from potential unauthorised access. No individual should be permitted to ac cess or use the practice's computer(s), other than the TCM practitioner and authorised staff. Authorized staff must be trained so that they are aware of who can and cannot have access to the records and who can and can not request information from records ( e.g., patients may request information from their own file, parents may not have access to records of a child who is capable of making their own treatment and privacy decisions). Individuals can complain to the Privac y Commissioner in their province if th ey believe their privacy rights have been violated. If in doubt, all staff must be trained and obligated to seek direction of the treating practitioner before any confidential information is released in any form. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 61 Pract itioners are responsible for the recor ds of your patients. If a practitioner leaves a practice, she or he must provide a safe arrangement for the transfer of those records. Either you designate a new practitioner for your practice or you store the records for future use by another practitioner or agency as required for continuous patient care. Retention and Storage Patient records have a life cycle, and must be retained for a stated number of years after the records are closed. Currently patient records must be retained for ten (10) years (o r longer if the patient is under 18 years of age), but practitioners should reference the College regulations for any details or changes to the requirements. The storage area for current records should prevent or limit damage to records (e.g., fire, water) . Storage areas should be secure to restrict unlawful or unauthorized access. Electronic files are subject to technical failure (power failure, computer break - down). Backup files and establish restore protocols and pro cesses. Adequate backup systems to pro tect patient records are essential. Paper records may be placed in a secondary storage area (off -site) or scanned and saved electronically if they need to be retained but are no longer required for current use. Dispos al Disposal of patient records (follow ing the end of treatment plus the recommended periods of retention) must be conducted in a managed and confidential way. Practitioners should obtain their own legal advice. Practitioners must comply with all regulation s and requirements related to the legal disposal of patient records. Records must be destroyed or shredded in a secure environment. Contractors who are used must agree and adhere to confidentiality requirements and agreements. Keep a register of the recor ds that have been destroyed. 3.8 Pati ent Privacy and Duties to Report As a health care provider, practitioners have a legal and professional duty to keep information about their patients private and confidential. However, there is a responsibility and a n eed to report particular events or con ditions to the appropriate government or regulatory agency. Requirements for mandatory reporting include, but are not limited to, the following: suspected child abuse and neglect suspected elder abuse certain communi cable and reportable diseases ( Health Protection and Promotion Act , report to Health Canada or equivalent provincial offices such as British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 62 Strong patient and practit ioner relationships are built on trus t and good communication. When it is possible to do so without putting themselves, their patients, or others at risk, practitioners should inform their patients when they are required to make a mandatory report. Practit ioners have a legal obligation to rep ort, but are expected to apply sound professional judgment in deciding how best to communicate with patients or their guardians in the process. 3.9 Relevant Regulations British Columbia's Privacy Acts The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (http://www.oipc.bc.ca) is independent from government and monitors and enforces British Columbia's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) and Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) Personal Health Information Access and Protection of Privacy Act Newfoundland and Labrador's Privacy Acts Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (ATIPPA) Personal Health Information Act (PHIA) Ontario's Privacy Acts The Information and Privacy Commissioner oversees FIPPA, MFIPPA an d PHIPA: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) Municip al Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA) Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 63 TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 64 Section 4: Safe Procedures & Processes: Acupuncture The information in this course is not a comprehensive instruction manual. The course materials are only a selective summary of important information related to the safe practice of acupun cture within a TCM practice. It is expected that practitioners will continue to remain informed and current with current research and literature related to the safe and effective practice of acupuncture. 4.1 Required Course Materials As part of the co urse, practitioners are expected to know and reference the following document. Table of Points: CTCMA -BC Dangerous/Cautionary Points (Draft) (in Appendix 1). The document (currently in draft form) will be used as a reference f or the course content and th e course assessment in the identification of dangerous and cautionary points. As a draft document, it is not intended as a complete reference for a practitioner's practice. For example, at this time contraindications and caution s for extraordinary \"extra\" points are not identified. Extra points and Ashi points carry risks similar to points on meridians. Knowledge of the local anatomy, depth and angle for points in the immediate area, as well as indications and contraindications of the points is importan t to prevent needling accidents. The depth and angle of needling is critically important, requiring deliberate and careful attention by the practitioner. In practical situations, the precise depth and angle must be based on an in formed foundation of knowled ge, and applied with a professional interpretation and understanding of the variables (e.g., body shape and size). Practitioners are expected at all times to remain informed and vigilant, and practice with thorough understandin g of the requirements for sa fe and knowledgeable attention to depth and angle. As required in their practice, practitioners are expected to reference reputable professional texts as sources for specific information related to depth and angle. 4.2 Clean N eedle Technique 4.2.1 Introd uction to Clean Needle Technique The Clean Needle Technique (or sterile needle technique) was established in order to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B transmission in the clinical setting of acupuncture. The technique has proven t o be successful and continue d adherence is expected and critical to the offering of safe acupuncture services. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 65 The basis for the effective use of the clean needle technique is practitioner understanding of infectious diseases and the means of transmission . See Section 2: Infection P revention and Control . For TCM practitioners who administer acupuncture, there are two main sources of infectious agents that inform the need for the clean needle technique : autogenous infections and cross -infections . Autogeno us infections are self -produ ced infections that occur if an infectious agent natural to one location gets carried to another area that doesn't have the same natural defense, causing an autogenous infection. For example, a needle can be infected by being in serted too deeply in the abd ominal area, and this infection can be transferred if the needle is reused at another location on the patient's body. Single -use disposable needles provide an effective means of controlling autogenous infections. Cross -infectio ns are not self -produced, bu t are transferred from another person or from the environment. The risks of cross -infections establish many of the procedures and requirements of the clean needle technique. Cross -infections were examined in detail in Section 2 Infection Prevention and Con trol. 4.2.2 Clean Needle Technique Principles The clean needle technique includes the following basic principles: 1. Always wash hands between patients, before needling, and after needling. 2. Always use sterile single -use needles an d other instruments that may break the skin (e.g., lancets, sevenstar or plum blossom needle). 3. Always establish a clean field before performing acupuncture. 4. Always immediately and safely isolate used needles and swabs. Washing Hands See Section 2.3.2 for general information on hand hygiene. Hands should be properly washed between patients and before and after conducting acupuncture. As well, hand washing should be done if there is a possibility that hands have been contaminated by materials that are potent ially infectious. Alcohol -based sanitizers are not a substitute for hand washing, but may be used in instances where hand washing is not possible. Medical gloves are not a substitute for hand washing, but may be used in instances where hand washing is not possible. Medical gloves sh ould be used when a practitioner has a hand wound (e.g., cuts or abrasions). A practitioner with a significant infected lesion on hands (e.g. herpes or staphylococcus) should not practice until hands are healed. In such cases gl oves are not acceptable prot ection. It is highly recommended that a practitioner with a significant infected lesion on hands should not practise until hands are healed . Use of Sterile, Single -Use Needles Disposable needles reduce risks to patients. Disp osable needles must be in ap propriate packaging and be approved by Health Canada: Medical Devices, subject to all Federal Legislation. Needles in TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 66 packages that have the seal broken or show evidence of moisture or other damage should not be used. Single use sterile needles should not be used past their expiry date. Disposable needles must be removed from the packaging without becoming contaminated. The needle shaft must remain sterile before and during insertion. (see section 4.4: aseptic technique) Each ste rile filiform needle should be used for puncturing once, and once only. Disposable sterile lancets and three -edged needles are strongly recommended in all instances. Establish a Clean Field Set up the area without any instruments contacting clothes or oth er possibly contaminated mat erials. Lay out the clean field without contaminating it. Set out needles, cotton balls, alcohol swabs, and sterile gauze pads without contaminating the field and for ease of access. Do not let alcohol swabs make the clean field damp. Lay out an appropriat e number of needles for the procedure without contaminating the site or the needles. Sterile needles must not be placed on a non-sterile environment (e.g., tray, cotton). The waste bag and sharps container must be established in an area away from the clean field. Safe Disposal of Needles Immediately dispose of the needle in the designated sharps container without touching the container. Contaminated needles pose a real risk to the patient and practitioner. Dispose of used cotto n or other waste in the wast e bag without touching the bag. Wash hands. 4.3 Preparing the Site The following should be considered when preparing the site prior to needle insertion. Wash hands. Inspect the site for lesions or other contraindications. The s kin at the needle site shoul d be clean and free from cuts, wounds or infections. Areas that are noticeably dirty (e.g., feet, neck) should be washed first then swabbed with 70 % ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Swab the point to be needled with 70 % ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Swab the point from the centre to the surrounding area using an outward rotary motion. In this way, the point has less risk of recontamination. Allow the alcohol to dry. If palpating the acupuncture point after cleaning, then hands must be clean. Wash or use hand sanitizer as required. 4.4 Aseptic Technique The aseptic technique details the necessary procedures for the hygienic and safe insertion and removal of needles, and is summarized below. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 67 4.4.1 Hygienic and Safe Insertion of the N eedle Open all single -use ne edles and instruments just before use in the presence of the patient. Patients should be placed in a comfortable position that allows safe access to the selected points. After being removed from the packaging, the shaft of the needle is never touched with bare fingers or with non -sterile materials. Do not place a needle on a non -sterile surface before use. If the needle shaft becomes contaminated before insertion, it must not be used. It must be disposed of in the sharps contain er. Use sterile material (e. g., sterile gauze pad) to support the shaft of the needle once it has been inserted or if it is inserted without a guide tube. Guide tubes should be sterile at the start of the treatment. Hands must be cleaned if they become co ntaminated during the treatm ent (e.g., touch non -sterile surfaces or materials, touches saliva when needling near the mouth). The use of disposable medical gloves is recommended in situations such as: the patient begins bleeding during the treatment the p atient has open lesions or i s known to have a contagious disease the practitioner has a skin infection, or hand wounds, cuts, hangnails that are not properly bandaged where exposure to blood borne pathogens are likely i.e. use of lancets, three - edged need le, plum blossom and seven s tar needle or lancet for blood -letting. 4.4.2 Hygienic and Safe Removal of the Needle Wash hands immediately before the removal of needles. Remove the needle without touching the shaft or the insertion site with bare fingers. Dispose of each needle immedi ately into the properly labelled sharps container. On withdrawing a needle, a sterile cotton ball (from the clean field) can be used to press the skin at the insertion site. All compresses or cotton balls that are contaminated b y blood or body fluids must be disposed of appropriately. Do not touch the waste bag. If blood is drawn, apply light pressure with clean swab. Dispose of the swab immediately. After needling, do not immediately re -palpate the point with a bare finger unles s it has been washed or sani tized. Following treatment, thoroughly wash hands to reduce the risk of cross -infection with subsequent patients. 4.5 Acupuncture Instruments and Equipment Overview 4.5.1 Needling Specifications Single -Use Pre -Sterilised Dispos able Needles Needles must b e disposed of immediately after use in the sharps container. If the seal is broken and not used during treatment of the patient, the needles must be discarded. Any needle with a damaged packaging seal must not be used. Needles m ust not be used TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 68 past their s terility expiry date. Contamination must be avoided once the needle is removed from the sterile packaging by the practitioner. Guide Tubes Needle guide tubes must be sterile. The guide tubes must be pre -sterilised and come pack aged with each individual ne edle or set of needles. They must not be used past the treatment session in which the seal on the package is broken. The guide tube is disposed of immediately after use. Plum Blossom Needles/Seven Star Hammers Pre-sterilized d isposable needles must be us ed. The disposable heads of the plum blossom equipment must be disposed of immediately after use. Detachable needle heads should be handled carefully since they may pose an increased risk for needlestick injury. o All seven -star/ plum blossom needle handles must be cleaned with a high -level disinfectant : the handle with new needle head may be used on the same patient; the handle is cleaned and disinfected (high -level disinfectant) between same client sessions ; once all needle head packs are used on the same patient , the handle must be thrown out. Needles should be stored in a safe, clean, well -ventilated area that is free from excessive humidity (to control for condensation and mould growth). Improper storage conditions can give rise to lose sterility well before the expiry date. 4.5.2 Other Equipment Cupping is not a sterile procedure. However, cups must be cleaned and disinfected after each patient use. o Cups used on intact skin is a non -critical item and should be cleaned and disinfected with a low -level disinfectant between patients. o Cups used on non-intact skin (e.g., used with needling) is a semi -critical item and should be cleaned and disinfected with an intermediate -level disinfectant between patients. o If bleeding occurs, cupping devices must be auto claved, or otherwise sterilized. o Bamboo cups should not be used because of the difficulty in disinfecting. Lancets or three -edged needles used for blood -letting must be sterile (disposable lancets or three -edged needles are reco mmended). Based on use, disi nfect or sterilize moxa equipment as required. When an electro -stimulation machine is used, the clippers that attach to the handle of the needle must be cleaned and disinfected between patients. Re-useable needle trays should be sterilized after each patie nt. Any item that is used to handle or manipulate the sterile needle before insertion must also be sterile. Instruments that contact the needle after insertion (forceps, tweezers) must be cleaned and disinfected between patien ts. Sterilization may be req uired based on use. 4.6 Managing Needlestick Accidents Needlestick accidents are injuries caused by needles that unintentionally puncture the skin. Needlestick injuries can transmit infectious diseases, especially blood -borne infections such as Hepatitis B and HIV. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 69 Safe needle management is essential to reduce the risk of needlestick accidents. Needle management requires the practitioner to account for every needle that is inserted, removed, and disposed of during treatment. 4.6.1 Routines to Reduce Ri sks of Needlestick Accidents Establish routines and procedures that will reduce the risks of stray or lost needles. For example: Thoroughly check the patient for needles that have been left in after treatment. Be vigilant during treatment knowing that need les can accidentally fall out of the patient's body before removal, or can drop to the ground during removal. Check the bed, linens and surrounding areas for dropped needles before, during and especially after a treatment. Be es pecially carefully when chan ging bed linen. Do not sweep your hands over the area, but rather hold the sheet up by the edges and allow any needles to drop to the floor, and disposed of safely. Needlestick injuries are an important concern for the practit ioner, not only for personal health, but also the health and safety of patients and staff. The risk of developing an infection after a needlestick injury will depend on the infectious status of the source, the immune status of the injured person, the sever ity of the injury, and the a vailability and use of proper post -exposure treatment following exposure to the pathogen. Thoughtful and informed procedures to reduce the likelihood of needlestick injuries are essential for all acupuncture clinics. It is recom mended that medical gloves, mask and goggles be used when using three -edged needle or lancet for blood -letting. See Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety http://w ww.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/disea ses/needlestick_injuries.html Because of the risks associated with needlestick accidents, it is strongly recommended that all TCM practitioners and staff are immunized against Hepatitis B, as well as having an annual blood tes t to check for HIV, Hepatiti s C, and other blood -borne diseases. The patient source of the contamination should be asked to consent to testing for blood -borne pathogens. The patient is not required to undergo such testing. If the practitioner or staff memb er suffers a needlestick acc ident, the individual must seek immediate medical attention from a physician. 4.6.2 Recommended Actions following Needlestick Accident If the exposure is deemed significant, the following steps are recommended. If you suffer a needlestick injury, act qui ckly for your own safety. 1. Immediately provide first aid after sharps injuries allow the wound to bleed freely for a brief time gently wash with soap and water apply skin antiseptic and cover with a clean dressing or bandage after exposure to eye, nose, or mouth flush area with generous amounts of water for at least 10 minutes TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 70 after exposure to broken skin wash with soap and water 2. Assess patient's status and obtain patient consent for testing practitioner should assess the risk by examining patient's medic al history and questioning the patient patient cooperation should be sought to clarify status if HBV, HCV, or HIV status is unknown or uncertain, seek patient consent for testing of blood -borne pathogens keep records of the cons ent process 3. Staff member sh ould be referred to an infectious disease specialist or hospital emergency department for further advice and, if necessary, post -exposure prophylaxis have processes and information readily available so that the staff member can have prophylaxis treatment administered as quickly as possible it is strongly recommended that practitioners keep a list of emergency numbers readily available in their practice 4. Document the incident workplace safety requirements must be adhered to recor d the staff member's name, a nd their immunization status date and time of the incident what the staff member was doing detail the extent of the exposure, the protective measures that were in place, and the actions that were taken immediately afterward the name of the source and the k nown status of the blood -borne pathogen Keep records according to the requirements of the provincial regulatory body. In Ontario patient records must be kept for ten years. Similar to needlestick injuries, the above guidelines apply to other accidents re lated to blood -borne pathogens that can occur during treatment procedures such as: suffering a cut on contaminated equipment (e.g., from a broken cup) blood splashed on broken or cracked skin blood splashed on mucous membranes (e.g., a practitioner's eyes or mouth) 4.7 Contraindications and Precautions for Acupuncture With practitioner skill and training, many acupuncture points have little or no inherent risk to patients. However, some points carry particular potential risk and have an increased possibili ty of serious injury to the patient if the practitioner lacks the specific experience and training. The selection of points by the practitioner can be adapted to their knowledge, experience and skills. For some practitioners, t he selection of acupuncture points should be carefully limited. With increased experience and skill, the range of acupuncture points and techniques may expand, but there are points and manipulations that should not be undertaken except in very extraordinar y circumstances by very skil led professionals. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 71 Because of varied interpretations and regulatory requirements for acupuncture, it is challenging to establish absolute contraindications for the practice of acupuncture. Based on offering safe and profession al patient care, acupuncture should be applied with great caution or avoided in the following situations. During Pregnancy Acupuncture should be performed with great caution during pregnancy. Points on the upper abdomen and lumbosacral region, and points which cause strong sensation s should be needled with extreme caution and only by experienced and skilled practitioners. Some ear acupuncture points may also induce labour. Reference Appendix 1 and reputable texts for more detailed direction related to acup uncture during pregnancy. Medical Emergencies In emergency situations, practitioners are expected to use sound judgment within their defined scope of practice. A medical emergency may require trained use of first aid or CPR techniques. Other situations may require practitioners to terminate treatment and seek medical and first aid assistance from emergency responders and other health care professionals, or to have the patient expeditiously sent to a medical site. The nature of the emergency is an import ant factor in guiding practi tioner actions. A stroke or heart attack is an emergency situation that warrants immediate action and calling 911, since acupuncture should not be the sole form of treatment. There are situations that acupuncture or other treatm ents may aid or resuscitate a patient while waiting for first responders to arrive. As a Replacement for Surgical Procedures Acupuncture may assist patients in the preparation for and recovery from surgery, but should not be used to replace a required su rgical procedure. Malignant Tumours Acupuncture should not be used alone to treat malignant tumours. Needling at the site of the tumour should only be performed by an experienced TCM practitioner who has advanced training. Acupuncture may be used as a co mplementary measure for the relief of pain or other symptoms, to alleviate side -effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and to improve the quality of life. Specific Areas of the Body Specific areas of the body should not be punctured: fontanelle (or fo ntanel) area of an infant's skull external genitalia nipples eyeball Patients with Bleeding Disorders Needling should be applied with great caution or avoided on patients with bleeding and clotting disorders. These cautions extend to patients who are on anticoagulant therapy or taki ng medications with an anticoagulant effect (with the exception of aspirin). TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 72 Broken or Infected Skin Additional precautions need to be considered if needles are required to be inserted through sites that are inflamed, irritated , or have skin lesions or br oken skin. Deep Puncturing near Vital Organs or Sensitive Areas Points located near large blood vessels or vital organs are contraindicated for deep insertion or should not be punctured. Additional Precautions Acupuncture sh ould not be conducted, or co nducted only with additional precautions, on patients who: are intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; have a very empty stomach, fatigued or weak because of possible reactions to treatment; have just completed vigorous ph ysical activity; are sufferi ng uncontrolled movements; are confused, emotionally unstable, non -cooperative, or have a needle phobia; are unstable diabetics for which extra care is required because of possible effects on blood sugar levels and blood circu lation at the extremities (peripheral circulation); are on steroids that may impede healing; have a pacemaker or other electronic implants (if using electro - acupuncture). Certain patients are at greater than normal risk for infection from acupuncture : these include patients with: recent heart valve surgery; diabetes; myocardial damage from previous infection of the heart muscle; suppressed immune systems from previous infections, or from use of anti - rejection medications or high -doses of steroids. Refer ence the Table Dangerous/Cautionary Points (CTCMA -BC) in Appendix 1 for a more complete examination of precautions. 4.8 Managing Adverse Reactions to Acupuncture Treatment Acupuncture is a safe procedure when conducted by trained and sk illed practitioners who have taken informed and thoughtful precautions and are prepared to respond to accidents or adverse reactions of patients in their care. Practitioners are expected to identify symptoms, causes and management strategies related to th e adverse reactions and acci dents such as: fainting bent needle stuck needle broken needle TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 73 The following sections provide summary information related to these adverse reactions as required for the course but is not intended to be comprehensive. Practition ers are expected to continua lly expand their professional learning to effectively identify and manage adverse reactions or side effects to acupuncture treatment. Terminology Side Effects are undesirable effect s which occurs in addition to the desired therapeutic effect of treatment . Side effects are unwanted, but are often unavoidable because they are predictable reactions to the treatment in many patients. Adverse reactions are unexpected and undesirable effects that were not predicted or foreseen. The reasons for adverse reaction vary greatly based on the current mental, emotional, and physical status of the patient. 4.8.1 Fainting A patient may feel faint during acupuncture treatment. Especially for patients that have not had previous treatments, patie nts should be informed of th is possibility and treatment should be done gently while the patient is lying down. Fainting can be the result of the patient being nervous, weak, fatigued, or overly hungry. It may also be the result of uncomfortable position ing, overly forceful needle manipulation, or over stimulation. Patients should be monitored for symptoms that may indicate that a fainting spell may be approaching. Symptoms during treatment of potential fainting include: feeling ill, nausea, possible vom iting dizziness, vertigo, gi ddiness seeing movements or swaying of nearby objects oppressive sensation in the chest, palpitations complexion or lips turn pale More severe cases may be shown by weakened pulse, cold hands or feet, cold sweating, lowered bl ood pressure or loss of cons ciousness. If the practitioner identifies symptoms of pending fainting, carefully remove needles and ensure the patient is lying flat on their back with head down and feet elevated. The patient should be offered sips of warm wa ter or water with sugar. In most instances, patients will recover following rest, but if symptoms persist, seek medical assistance. The practitioner can reduce the likelihood of fainting by attending to gentle needle manipulation, and monitoring early war ning signs (such as changes to complexion colour and signs of disorientation). Patients that may be predisposed to fainting should be treated while lying down or firmly supported while sitting up for treatment. 4.8.2 Stuck Needle Following insertion of the needle, it may be difficult to rotate, lift and thrust, or withdraw. The cause of a stuck needle is often the result of a patient muscle spasm or sudden movement, but can also be the result of rotation with too wide an amplitude or rotating in only one di rection causing the needle s haft to tangle with muscle fibres. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 74 The key to resolving a stuck needle is to reassure the patient and ask him or her to relax. It may be necessary to leave the needle in for a while to allow for relaxation, or to tap or massage around the point. It is oft en helpful to needle a nearby point to help relax the muscle. If needles are still entangled in fibrous tissue, needles can be slightly and gently rotated in the opposite direction to loosen and allow for withdrawal. 4.8.3 Broke n or Bent Needle There are m any factors that may cause a needle to break or bend, including: poor needle quality erosion or cracks between the shaft and the handle sudden movement or strong muscle spasm by the patient improper withdrawal of a stuck needle or bent needle excessive fo rce manipulating the needle needle is struck by external force (e.g., practitioner extends to reach another point and accidentally leans against an existing insertion) A needle that is bent during insertion should be withdrawn and replaced by another. Exc essive force should not be used when manipulating needles, especially when lifting and thrusting. The most common part of the needle that is prone to breaking is at the junction of the handle and the shaft. For this reason, it i s strongly recommended that needles never be inserted up to the handle, and at least one -quarter (1/4) of the shaft is always being kept above the skin. Risks of broken needles can be further reduced by carefully examining needles prior to treatment, and n ot using excessive force to manipulate needles. It is recommended to always remind patients to remain still during acupuncture treatment. If a needle breaks, ask the patient to stay still and calm so that any movements do not cause the broken part of the needle to sink deeper into t he tissues. If a portion of the broken needle can be seen above the skin, remove it gently with forceps. If the needle is at skin level, gently press around the site until the broken end is exposed, and then remove it with f orceps. If the broken needl e shaft is completely under the skin, seek medical assistance. Do not cut the skin to allow access to the needle. Surgical intervention may be required. Properly Positioning the Patient Practitioners must be aware that the prop er positioning of patients c an reduce the likelihood of fainting or of causing sudden movements that can result in bent or stuck needles. Depending on the area to be needled, the practitioner should carefully consider both the comfort of the patient as w ell as the requirements for effective and safe insertion and manipulation of the needle. Both the patient and the practitioner should feel comfortable. 4.9 Injury to Vital Organs Accidents may occur near vital organs or very sensitive areas as a result of the site chosen, the needle depth, the needle direction or angle, the manipulation technique used, the stimulation provided, and other factors. Injuries can be avoided if additional precautions are taken by the practitioner when treating points near vital organs. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 75 Accidents must be ma naged effectively but any injury to vital organs may be serious and may require the practitioner to act urgently to arrange medical assistance. Lung and Pleura Attend very carefully to the depth and angle of inserted needles on the chest, back, or immedia tely above the clavicle (supraclavicular fossa). Deep insertion may cause collapsed lung (traumatic pneumothorax). Attend to symptoms such as cough, chest pain, and difficult or laboured breath (dyspnoea) that happen immediately or gradually develop in the next few hours following treatment. Pneumothorax is one of the most frequently reported complications (point Jianjing GB 21 is the most commonly reported point). Points on the Chest, Back and Abdomen Attend carefully to the depth and direction of inser ted needles. Liver, Spleen and Kidney Attend carefully to the depth and direction of inserted needles. A liver or spleen puncture may cause pain or tenderness that is localized, a tear with associated bleeding, or stiffness of the abdominal muscles. A kidney puncture may cause pain in the lumbar region and the patient may see evidence of blood in the urine (haematuria). If bleeding continues, the patient may suffer shock due to dropping blood pressure. Circulatory System Atte nd carefully to the depth an d direction of inserted needles. Feel for the pulse to locate artery. Bleeding caused by penetration of shallow blood vessels can often be stopped by applying direct pressure. Additional precautions should be taken in needling areas of poor circulation where there is a risk of infection (e.g. varicose veins). Avoid puncturing of arteries . Central Nervous S ystem Exercise caution at points between or beside the upper cervical vertebrae (Yamen GV 15, Fengfu GV 16). of the brainstem (medulla oblongata) may cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, and slowed respiration. This can be followed by convulsions, paralysis or coma. Seek immediate medical assistance. Exercise extreme caution near the spinal cord. Deep ins ertions may cause lightening pain for the patient or more serious complications such as loss of sensation or movement. Other Points Other points that require significant precautions and specialized training include : near the carotid artery (Renying ST 9 ) near the femoral artery (J imen SP 11, Chongmen SP 12) on the radial artery (Taiyuan LU 9, Jingqu LU 8) points near the eyes (Jingming BL 1, Chengqi ST 1) front of the trachea (Tiantu CV 22) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 76 4.10 Other Possible Side Effects and Adverse Reactions The foll owing side effects and adver se reactions can be experienced by patients as a result of treatment. Acupuncture De-Qi (acupuncture sensation) - a commonly experienced sensation of warmth, tingling or tightness . (Note: Other sensations include numbness, mild electrical shooting sensati on that last for seconds, distension, soreness, pulsation like waves. These are all good sensations (or good pain) of de qi. There is also sharp, excruciating and uncomfortable pain (or bad pain) that can be experienced. Practit ioners should stop the inser tion or manipulation and slightly withdraw the needle to relieve the bad pain.) common reactions are feelings of light -headedness , or slight disorientation or euphoria feelings of cold if needles are retained for longer periods minor bleeding or bruising d ue to penetration of small blood vessels minor swelling or bruising from hematoma fatigue caused by the temporary lowering of blood pressure (may also cause fainting) (Note: It is common for patient to feel fatigue d or relaxed during or after treatment. It is highly recommended that the patient experience no intensive stimulation for the rest of the day. Going to sleep early is also recommended after acupuncture treatments.) dizziness, light -headedness, vertigo may occur if too many needles are used or if the patient has a weak constitution (Note : caution should be taken and needles should be immediately removed if symptoms do not subside .) rashes, itching, discomfort at site of insertion caused by allergic reactions to metals a gainst their skin Moxibust ion blisters and 2nd degree burns if burning herbs are too close to the skin or left too long . Cupping and gua sha the suction action of cupping, to reduce the stagnation of qi and blood, draws blood close to the skin surface and may cause mild bruising , redness and some local tenderness for several days. Patients are advised to stay warm and avoid chills for 1 or 2 days . like cupping, the scraping action of gua sha to stimulate circulation of qi and blood may cause mild bruis ing, redness and some local tenderness for several days. Patients are advised to stay warm and avoid chills for 1 or 2 days. Tapping, Plum Blossom, Bleeding, Pricking bruising or bleeding caused by the intentional drawing of blood, or using multiple need les that may rupture small b lood vessels . Electrical Stimulation (PENS, TENS) temporary tingling due to electrical stimulation . TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 77 electro -stimulator, if not used properly (on for too long, setting is too high) or poorly maintained, can cause nerve damage . Tuina Tuina therapy may ca use soreness - Tuina and other manual therapies often make muscles and tendons sore from various techniques such as pressing, stretching, and tapping on the meridians system. De -Qi sensation may be more pronounced. Tuina therapy may cause bruising in patie nts who are prone to bruising . Blood -letting slight bruising may occur at the site where the lancet is inserted . 4.11 Specific Considerations Related to Other Techniques All ancillary techniques and therapies must be conducte d in a safe manner, and prac titioners must be properly trained in their use. 4.11.1 Electrical Stimulation Contraindications to Electrical Stimulations Do not use with patients with pacemakers or other electronic implants . Do not use with patients with a h istory of seizures . Due to r isks of interference with the heart muscle, two branches of the same electrode should always be on the same side of the patient's body. The circuit should never cross from one side of the back or the chest to the other side (i.e., current does not cross t he midsagittal or median plane) . Do not apply stimulation in regions close to the heart . Precautions and Considerations Carefully examine the equipment before each treatment. Clean and disinfect required surfaces prior to treat ment. Ensure that all dials are set to zero before applying current or attaching the clips to the needles. Increase intensity gradually. Throughout the treatment, make sure that the patient is not in discomfort. Stimulation should never become painful. Carefully monitor the patient t o prevent neural injury. Carefully consider the time requirements of treatment. All dials must be set to zero before switching off power and removing connections . Use additional precautions with older patients or with frail pati ents. Ensure that all electr ical stimulators, acupuncture scope, probes and hand held devices, if using 110 voltages, are plugged into a surge protection bar, not directly to the outlet. The consequence in a power surge could transfer extra current to the patient. For portability, m any of these electrical devices provide optional battery back -up. Inspection of medical devices on a regular basis is important to ensure effective treatment and safety of the patient. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 78 4.11.2 Moxibustion Accident s may occur usin g moxibustion. Practitioners must be fully trained and competent in the procedure and must consider the precautions /considerations . The patient should never be left unattended at any point during a procedure involving the use of any form of moxibustion. See also Appendix 1 Table o f Points CTCMA - BC Dangerous Cautionary Points . Precautions and Considerations Be cautious when using the treatment for pregnant patient . Be cautious using the treatment near mucous membranes. Be cautious of using the treatme nt on hypo -sensit ive or hype r-sensitive patients. Be cautious of using the treatment over main arteries or organs and on the face or sensitive areas (due to increased vulnerability to burns) . The use of scarring moxibustion should be evaluated carefully to determine if it is a requir ed method for treatment as it causes scarring. Use with extreme caution on patients with decreased sensitivity to heat . Needling after moxibustion requires the skin to be swabbed. Moxibustion is a fire hazard. Practitioners nee d increased awareness about the use of fire extinguishers and emergency procedures in the clinic. Practitioners using moxibustion (particularly direct moxibustion) are encouraged to be very clear and explicit with patients. Ensure that signed consent to treatment forms identify possi ble risks of the procedure. Heated needle methods require increased attention to risk management procedures. Use a disposable heat shield under the needle and when burnt moxa is being removed from the needle. Managing Burns Mox ibustion carries a risk of b urns which requires practitioners to carefully attend to risk management procedures and legal actions as a result of burns and scars . Small blisters should be protected and may be allowed to heal without the need of puncturing . Severe burns or large bliste r may need to be seen by a physician. A large blister may need to be treated as follows: o Wash hands thoroughly. o Disinfect the blister area. o Puncture the blister with a sterilized needle and drain hygienically . o Apply an approp riate dressing of sterile ga uze. o See a physician as required. As appropriate, it is highly recommended that treatment rooms have a wireless call button or alert button to notify the practitioner or staff of any situations that require swift response (e.g., strong electro -acupunctu re stimulation, heat lamp too strong , patient feeling discomfort or in an uncomfortable position, patient needing to use the washroom during the treatment). The call button also assures more sensitive or anxious patients that they can call the practitioner w ithout the embarrassment of having to call TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 79 out loudly. If a call button is not used, the practitioner should stay in the treatment room or regularly check on the patient at frequent intervals. 4.11.3 Heat Lamps For patient safet y and carefully managed risk , the use of heat lamps requires the practitioner to cautiously attend to the operation and maintenance of the equipment. Heat lamps must be used and maintained in strict accordance to manufacturer's instructions. It is essentia l that practitioner frequent ly and regularly monitor the heat lamps to confirm and ensure that the lamps are operating as intended and maintained in safe working order. 4.12 Acupuncture Treatment in Unfamiliar Settings Practitioners that make home visits are expected to meet the he alth and safety standards that are equivalent to working in a clinic. The clinic, home , or business premises of the practitioner must have the facilities to establish a clean and sterile setting for the establishment of a travel kit. The practitioner will require at least one room where equipment can be adequately disinfected and sterilized (as required), instruments and materials that will be required can be stored in a clean environment ; and clinical waste, used sharps, and soiled equipment and linens can be stored temporarily but safely. The setting for the off -site treatment (e.g., a patient's home) should allow for safe treatment. The room should have adequate lighting, be clean, and have easy access to sanitary hand washing facilities. It must not be a ssumed that any needed clean supplies are available on site. Pack the travel pack with all required supplies and equipment required for treatment. Include supplies to allow for sanitary hand washing, creating sanitary work and treatment surfaces, and to es tablish a clean field. (See Travel Kit Contents .) Following treatment, all used sharps must be disposed of in a portable sharps container, all clinical waste appropriately collected for removal and disposal, and all other waste must be disposed of consiste nt with local requirements. Allow adequate time in the schedule of visitations to confirm that the patient is not suffering adverse reactions before leaving. If you carry out treatment at a patient's home, you must ensure that , as much as possible, the t reatment is carried out in a clean room with sufficient lighting and convenient access to hand washing facilities. As well as required instruments and materials, the practitioner should bring supplies to ensure appropriate hand washing (liquid soap, saniti zer, paper towels, etc.) and to establish a clean field. Travel Kit Contents Sterile equipment and materials can be placed in an easily disinfected portable container that can be sealed for easy, sanitary transport. The follo wing sterile items can be ca rried in this container: single -use disposable needles in a separate sealed plastic bag supplies to establish a clean field, each in separate sealed plastic bags (e.g., sterile gauze, cotton ball, sterile linen or equivalent). U se sterile tongs to aid pack aging disposable medical gloves as required TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 80 sterile, packaged equipment such as tweezers or forceps (package should indicate date of sterilization) package 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs (or equivalent) in a separate container . Packaged separately from ste rile items: a plastic lined bag to receive clinical waste portable sharps container appropriately labelled . Additional Items liquid soap for hand washing, hand sanitizer, sealed and clean paper towels or equivalent (paper tow els should transferred immed iately in aplastic sealed bag to keep clean) clean paper rolls (or equivalent) to cover work surfaces or patient's bed or couch where treatment will be conducted required documents (e.g., consent to treatment forms), record keep ing notes to document consul tation . Preparing the Clean Field Wash your hands . Select the area for the clean field and clean and dry the area thoroughly. Wash your hands. Cover the chosen area with your clean field linen or equivalent. Arrange materials a nd instruments on the clean field. Open the storage bags and remove items in such a way as to minimize handling. The sharps container and waste bags are placed away from the clean field. Safe Insertion and Removal of Needle The hygienic safe insertion an d removal of the needle shou ld follow the same procedures (aseptic technique) as outlined for on -site needling (see Section 4.4) . 4.13 Patient Privacy and Draping Practitioners must be in compliance with all regulations related to proper draping of patien ts, including the applicable College's Practice Standards. Establishing and maintaining ethical draping procedures is an essential element of risk management for the acupuncturist. Practitioners have a professional and moral responsibility to ensure that a patient's dignity and pri vacy is maintained in the conduct of consented treatments. For some treatments, draping may not be required. If the patient has loose fitting clothing, it may be possible for the patient to remain fully clothed during treatmen t by rolling sleeves above t he elbow, pant legs to above the knees, and allowing full exposure to the abdomen or back. It can also be suggested that patients bring loose fitting clothes or shorts that they can change into for treatment. For other procedur es, draping may be necessary . It should be explained fully to the patient why draping is necessary as it relates to their personal safety making needling safer. Draping significantly reduces the opportunity for clothing to inadvertently cover TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 81 needles or to having needles left in afte r treatment. The patient must be given the opportunity to consent to undressing and draping. The patient must be provided with adequate and appropriate draping materials. The practitioner must not be present during undressing an d the dignity of the patient must be maintained at all times. The degree of undress must be based on the treatment requirements. It is recommended that if draping is necessary, unless specific procedures cannot be conducted safely and effectively, female s remain clothed in a bra (p referably with a hook at the back) and all patients remain clothed in underwear. If full undress is needed, a female's breasts and a client's genitalia and gluteal cleft must remain properly draped at all times except for the sa fe, comfortable and effectiv e application of treatment requirements. Every effort must be made by the practitioner to ensure the dignity and modesty of the patient is respected and maintained by the use of maximum proper draping. The use of gowns may be m ore comfortable in addition to site specific draping of private areas involving woman's breast, genitalia and gluteal cleft of all patients. Patients should be informed to express any concerns whenever he or she is uncomfortable or unsure of any aspect of the treatment. If the patien t is comfortable with not being draped or clothed, it is the duty of the practitioner to insist, for the practitioner's protection, that the patient be properly draped. At all times, the practitioner must establish an uncompromi sed professional environment of treatment. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 82 The following graphic is a visual guide to draping that is useful for many common situations. The graphic is for reference only and is not meant to be comprehensive for all procedures or point selections. Reference your College's Pr actice Standards for additional details related to draping. DRAPING FOR PATIENTS TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 83 TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 84 Section 5 - Safe Procedures and Processes: Herbology The information in this course is not a comprehensive instructi on manual. The course materi als are only a selective summary of important information related to the safe practice of herbology within a TCM practice. It is expected that practitioners will continue to remain informed and current with current research an d literature related to the safe and effective prescribing and dispensing of herbal medications. 5.1 Required Course Materials As part of the course, practitioners are expected to know and reference the following documents included in the Appendices. Index of Materia Medica ( Pin -yin, Chinese and Botanical or Pharmaceutical Name) See Appendix 2. Animal and Plant Ingredients in Traditional Medicine (Environment Canada, 2011) See Appendix 3. 5.2 Overview of Safety Issues related to Herbal Medications Herb al medicine is very complex in its nature, and practitioners have a responsibility to continue their professional learning related to the safe prescribing and dispensing of herbal medications. Research continues to enrich practitioner's knowledge of adve rse reactions and contraindi cations related to the effective use of herbs. Every herb can potentially cause problems when not used properly. Knowing the potential adverse reactions of individual herbs is important but not sufficient, since reactions may ch ange when used in combinatio n or in formulas. Many factors must be considered and the studies of herbal interactions continu ed. Terminology Intolerance means a lowered threshold to what is seen as normal reactions to the herbal medicine. Though not preva lent with herbal medications , some patients may have less (or more) tolerance requiring appropriate adjustments to the dosage. Side Effects are an undesirable effect which occurs in addition to the desired therapeutic effect of the medication. Side effect s are unwanted, but are ofte n unavoidable because they are predictable reactions to the therapeutic effects of the medication (e.g., some herbs contain compounds that can act as mild stimulants that may cause incidents of insomnia). Practitioners should ad vise their patients of any c ommon side effects when prescribing herbal medications. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 85 Adverse reactions are unexpected and undesirable effects that were not predicted or foreseen. The reasons for adverse reaction vary greatly (e.g., caused by unwanted inte ractions with pharmaceutical medications, incorrect identification of herb, incorrect diagnosis, incorrect use of herb, and contamination of herb). Allergic reactions are \"overreactions\" by a person's immune system to normally harmless substance (i.e., al lergen). Allergens include d ust, food, in sect bites, animal dander, etc . Some herbs can cause food allergy reactions in select individuals (rash, nausea, indigestion). 5.2.1 Allergic Reactions to Herbal Medications It is beyond the scope of the safety cour se to provide for a complete discussion of the very important and dynamic information related to allergic reactions. Practitioners at all times need to be aware and vigilant of the potential for allergic reactions. Through professional learning and quality assurance programs, CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO will continue to further support practitioners in the recognition and understanding of allergic symptoms. It is strongly recommended that all practitioners subscribe to Health Canada's Canadian Adverse Reactions Newsletter or to r egularly monitor the newsletter's summaries. http://www.hc -sc.gc.ca/dhp -mps/medeff/bulletin/index -eng.php 5.2.2 Adverse Reactions to Herbal Medications Human metabolism varies wide ly across the population, so it is understandable that patients will not react uniformly when using TCM herbal remedies. The uniqueness of patients presents professional challenges to TCM practitioners as it does to all health care providers whether they a re is prescribing herbal remedies or drugs. Adverse effects may or may not be a reaction to the herbal medication. For example, some herbs may have mild effects that can interact with prescription drugs resulting in inflated o r reduced effects. However, practitioner reporting any adverse effects is important for the patient in that it provides relevant clinical data for the practitioner providing the patient fully informed treatment options and modifications. As research conti nually expands related to in teractions of TCM herbs (e.g., herb -to-herb interactions, herb -to-food interactions, herb -to-natural health product interactions, herb -to-pharmaceutical drug interactions) new information and legislation is continually evolving related to the knowledge req uirements for the safe practice of prescribing and dispensing herbal medications. Practitioners have a responsibility to remain current on such information through updates, readings and courses offered by the Colleges (CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO) and b y other governmental, professional and private organizations and associations. Minor Adverse Reactions With trained TCM practitioners and the skilled use of herbs prepared in accordance with TCM methods, the bulk of the advers e effects will be minor in n ature and short in duration. The practitioner should openly welcome the patient describing adverse effects so that possible causes can be examined and appropriate adjustments made to treatment. Adverse events are an important so urce of clinical data, so th ey should not be ignored. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 86 Care should be exercised when using TCM herb concentrates and extracts. Practitioners should inquire about the concentration/extract ratio in order to avoid potential overdosing. Severe Adverse React ions Severe adverse reaction s herbal medications are rare, but patients should be advised how to seek medical assistance as needed (i.e., information about the local poison control centre, contacting physician, seeking emergency care). Severe reaction to an herbal medicine should be reported to the Canada Vigilance Regional Offices and Canada Vigilance Nation Office . Reporting can be done by the practitioner or directly by the client. Information on how to report such adverse effects is at the following we bsite: http://www.hc -sc.gc.ca/dhp -mps/medeff/report -declaration/index -eng.php#a1 The practitioner should provide positive encouragement to patients to report suc h adverse reactions and to p rofessionally manage such reports so appropriate follow -up is provided to the patient, the practitioner, and to the profession as required. Reporting severe adverse reactions is a measure that may support practitioners in any as sociated malpractice complai nt. Canada Vigilance Adverse and Precautions Herbal medications are contraindicated or used with great caution in specific situations. These situations include: patient is taking many different drugs after using herbs, liver -function test indicat es abnormality symptoms of liver or renal failure are clearly evident or patients are on medications to treat the condition (cautionary use may be appropriate) patient has suffered allergic reaction to herbs in the past during t he first three months of pre gnancy (used with great caution) babies under one year of age (used with great caution) . 5.2.4 Dosage and Duration Traditional dosages are well known to practitioners, but the multitude of client - dependent variables can impact f inding the optimum dosage fo r each individual patient. It is recommended that starting doses should be relatively low, allowing increases to occur as required by the treatment and supported by positive reactions to treatment. Starting with full dosage may be warranted if the situatio n is predictable and uncomplicated, or may be necessary if treating severe symptoms. Dosage for patients must be carefully considered and analyzed by the practitioner, and be given thoughtful consideration to such factors as : body weight or body surface area character of the illness condition general health of the patient severity of the symptoms (for acute or serious conditions, larger dosage may be appropriate, and for chronic or mild conditions, small dosages are preferred) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 87 form of the medication (her bs in the form of decoction may be given in a higher dosage than herbs given in powder form) previous experiences and use of herbs gender of the patient (e.g., during menstrual period, dosage may be smaller) climate and seasonal differences (e.g., cold or hot temperatures can affect the skin pores and the amount of sweating, pungent and bitter herbs that dry damp are less used in dry climates) age of the patient (older patients and children may require lower doses) . The followin g guidelines can be referenc ed to assist in deciding on dosage for children based on age . 1-6 months 1/18 -1/10 of adult dose -1/8 of adult dose 1-2 years 1/8-1/6 of adult dose 2-4 years 1/6-1/3 of adult dose 4-6 years 1/3-2/5 of adult dose 6-9 years 2/5-1/2 of adult d ose 9-14 years 1/2-2/3 of adult dose The following guidelines can be referenced to assist in deciding on dosage based on weight for children, the elderly, and small adults . 30-40 lbs 20-27% of adult dose 40-50 lbs 27-33% of adu lt dose 50-60 lbs 33-40% of adult dose 60-70 lbs 40-47% of adult dose 70-80 lbs 47-53% of adult dose 80-100 lbs 53-67% of adult dose 100-120 lbs 67-80% of adult dose 120-150 lbs 80-100% Other considerations effecting dosage include : quality (e.g., herbs t hat are wild may require sma ller doses than farmed herbs) texture(flowers and leaves may require smaller doses; non -toxic plant herbs commonly use 3 -10 grams; non -toxic mineral herbs commonly use 10 -30 grams) flavour (e.g., stronger flavour may require sma ll doses) toxicity (e.g., do sage of toxic herbs need cautioned consideration) . Herbs that eliminate a pathogen (promote urination, promote bowel movement, promote sweating) or increase blood/Qi movement, should be closely monitored and reduced in dosage o r stopped when the condition improves. Some herbs, if the dosage is too large, or if used for too long a time, may cause harm to the patient's kidney, liver, heart, stomach, or nervous system. The list that follows includes some of the herbs that require careful attention to dosage and toxicity . Ma Huang , TCMPA : 2012 Page 88 Guan Mu Tong (Aristolochia Man Gledits iae Ginko Zhu Sha (Cinnabar is),Cinnabaris Aside from dosage, another important consideration is the number of days that the herbal m edication may be prescribed. Duration of the prescription will be influenced by many factors including the patient's condition, experience and understanding of herbal medications, and severity of symptoms. Prescriptions of longer than 1 week should be li mited to situations where the practitioner is very familiar with patient's history and condition, and is knowledgeable about the formula to know that it can be taken for a longer duration without risk of adverse effects. 5.2.5 Safety of Raw Herbs Practit ioners should strive to ensu re that herbal products are of high quality. Quality controls for Chinese herbs should include provision s for: correct identification of each herb ; manufacturing in hygienic conditions with clear identification of each prod uction batch ; stringent pr ocesses to ensure no microbial contamination as well as contamination from heavy metals, pesticides, aflatoxins, residual solvents, and other foreign substances . In order that practitioners work within their scope of practice and within the law, practiti oners must be fully aware of TCM herbs and formulas that are banned or restricted, or herbs that have legislated controls and requirements due to their derivation from endangered animals or plants . The Natural and Non -prescript ion Health Products Director ate (NNHPD) is the regulating authority for natural health products for sale in Canada. The role of NHPD is to ensure that Canadians have ready access to natural health products that are safe, effective , and of hig h quality whil e respecting freedom of choice and philosophical and cultural diversity. The Natural and Non -prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) can -dpsn/index - eng.php The importing and use of herbs must comply with Health Canada regulations through the Natural Health Products Dir ectorate, and Canada's Wildlife Trade Law through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES ). Environment Canada is the lead agency responsible for implementing CITES on behalf of the federal government. The regulation act is the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act (WAPPRIITA ). TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 89 NHPD in their regulations prevent the use of specific TCM herbs that are identified as extremely toxic. NHPD regulations r elate to herbs in their end products or manufactured substances but do not prevent the importation of these toxic herbs in raw form. Requirements for the importation of raw herbs is under the jurisdiction of Health Canada's Food Directorate and CITES . TCM practitioners who operate their own herbal dispensary an d use raw herbs need to be vigilant and aware of serious safety and lega l issues related to agriculture and quality control, and use a reliable distributor. Practitioners must be fully aware of the f ollowing : The restrictions and requirements related to t he importation or use of specific animal or plant parts or derivatives based on the classifications identified under CITES . Read the information provided in Appendix 3 and continue to be fully inform ed through regular updates on government web sites. o http://www.ec.gc.ca/cites An electronic copy of the brochure Animal and Plant Ingredients in Traditional Medicine found in Appendi x 2 is available at : o http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection _2011/ec/CW66 -289- 2011 -eng.pdf This document identifies some toxic herbs (pages 87 -88) that require careful attention to dosage. All TCM practiti oners in prescribing highly toxic herbs should do so cautiously and within their area of expertise. 5.3 Safety Considerations: TCM Prescriptions Significant portions of Section 5.3 have been adapted from: Guideline for the Practice of Chinese Herbal M edicine , Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria, Australia (2006). Safety considerations apply to the following kinds of prescriptions for Chinese herbal medicine: individual raw herbs single herbs in the form of granules, powders, liquids and extracts manufactured formulas (i.e., formulas that have been manufactured into pills, tablets or granules ). TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 90 These considerations do not apply to TCM Natural Health Products sold over -the- counter (OTC) without prescription. Practitioners who are enga ged in the over -the-counter distribution of such products must meet all provisions of the Natural Health P roduct Regulations, 2004 . Additional information specific to OTC is clearly identified in this document. 5.3.1 General Overall Requirement of Pres criptions The prescribing practitioner has responsibility for the completeness, accuracy and comprehensive ness of information that is provided on the prescription. Clarity of prescription information is the guiding principle for practitioners. The accura cy and clarity of the herbal prescription is important in all situations, but has increased importance whe n the prescribing practitioner uses an external dispensary to fill the prescription. TCM prescriptions should be legible and should contain all neces sary information to allow the prescription to be accurately and safely dispensed, used , and tracked. For the safety of the public, the information in the prescription must be useful to and understandable by other health professionals, especially in emergen cy situations. Language Requirements for Writing Prescriptions In Ontario: A practitioner may choose th eir preferred language to initially record the prescription. However, they must include a record that other health professionals who use the official languages (English or French) will understand. In Newfoundland and Labrador : A practitioner may choose t heir preferred language to initially record the prescription. However, in the event that a file copy or a report is required , this must be provided in English. In British Columbia: A practitioner may choose their preferred language to initially record t he prescription. However, in the event that a file copy or a report is required , this must be provided in English. 5.3.2 Guidelines for Writing a Prescription The information required on a TCM herbal prescription includes: name, address and contact telephone number of the practitioner name of the patient (and patient's parent or guardian where required) date the prescription was written name of ea ch herb included in the prescription part of the herb (when relevant to avoid confusion) method of preparation (e.g., whole, powdered, granule, tincture) form of processing (when relevant to avoid confusion) TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 91 quantity of each herb preparation inst ructions number of packets or dosage as applicable instructions on how to use the medication as required for safe usage Requirements for Naming Herbs In general, the name of the herb may initially be written in Chinese characters or in Chinese using Pin yin (see f urther explanation below) but it is expected that the botanical or Latinate medicinal name will also be provided. The guiding principle is that information be communicated in an effective and understandable way so that patient safety is best ensu red. The use of Chinese characters (traditional or simplified) or the Latinate medicinal name provides the most unambiguous herbal names. Standard names, as per the Chinese pharmacopoeia , are recommended. The use of Chinese using Pinyin may be included but shoul d not be used alone since this may result in confusion. The botanical name or Latinate medicinal name should always be provided along with Pinyin. The use of the botanical name or the Latinate medicinal name is required, but may not be sufficie nt for all situations. The Chinese characters (traditional or simplified) or Chinese using Pinyin name should always be provided along with botanical name or the Latinate medicinal name in order to meet the safety requirement. Care should be taken to accur ately spec ify the herb required. In cases where a number of species may share the same Chinese name, specific nomenclature is needed to provide clarity. It is not sufficient to use only an English name if that could lead to confusion. To assist practition ers, Appen dix 2 contains a reference table with Chinese, Pinyin, botanical name and Latinate medicinal name. Abbreviations Unclear abbreviations can result in dispensing errors and uneven and unintended interpretation of the prescription by the dispensa ry. When w riting the names of herbs, shortened forms of the names may be acceptable only if such abbreviations are consistently interpreted by dispensers. Part of Herb In some cases, various parts of a plant may be used to obtain different effects. When there is a possibility of confusion or inconsistent interpretation, the part of the herb must be specified. Amount of Herb The amount of each herb should be specified on the prescription. This amount may be stated in grams or in numbers as applicable. Fo r safety, the measurement unit should be specified clearly. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 92 Form of Processing The form of processing of the herb should be specified if a dispenser is required to do processing. If more than one form of processing is commonly used, then identification of the type of processing is required so that the dispensary acts accordingly. When there is only one common kind of processing used for the particular herb, then use of 'preparata' or 'processed' is sufficient when using the botanical name, Latinate medic inal or co mmonly used TCM herbal name. Preparation Instructions Special preparation instructions should be provided. If a herb is expected to be handled, treated or used differently from other herbs in the prescription (e.g., specific requirements when to add her b, steeping, etc.) , these instructions should be provided clearly on the prescription adjacent to the relevant herb or herbs. Number of Packets The number of packets or bags to be dispensed should be evident on the prescription. Administration Instructi ons Specific or special instructions for the patient on how to us e the herbal medication (e.g., use only after meals, do not take wit hin 1 hour of other medications, do not consume caffeinated drinks or alcohol while on this medication ) should be provided to the patient on the prescription or alternatively on supplementary information provided to the patient. Warnings Warnings related to the use or storage of the TCM herbal medication should be clearly written on the prescription ( e.g., keep out of reach o f children ). 5.3.3 Prescribing Granulated or Powdered Herbs When prescribing granulated or powdered herbs, the previous guidelines are applicable (Guidelines for Writing a Prescription) . However, there will be directives that may no longer be rel evant (e.g ., special preparation instructions). Additional requirements for granulated or powdered herbs include: Prescribing single herb extracts : specify the weight of each herb, the total weight of the prescription and the dosage Prescribing a formula extract : specify the name of the formula, weight and dosage Prescribing a formula with additional single extracts : specify the weight of the formula, the weight of each addition, the total weight of t he prescription, and the dosage If relevant to ensure quality a nd safety, the manufacturer of the granulated or powdered herbs should be specified on the prescription. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 93 5.3.4 Prescribing a Manufactured Herbal Medicine If manufactured herbal formulas are prescribed, the information is kept on file by the prac titioner. The prescription documentation supplied to the patient should allow clear identification of : specific medication being prescribed ingredients manufacturer of the medication medication batch number Over -The-Counter Products Over -the-counter (OTC) herbal me dications should already have the necessary prescription information printed on the packet (or included inside), and this should be sufficient. However, if the information is not provided, the practitioner should make the required information ava ilable to the patient in written form. Dosage and Administration The dosage and patient use instructions must be provided in written form to the patient (e.g., one pill three times per day). Repackaging Over -The-Counter Medicines In many circumstances, O TC medicin e will be supplied with the manufacturer's packaging intact allowing compliance with packaging information requirements established by Health Canada and Natural Health Products Directorate. If the herbal medication is no longer in the original manufactur er's packaging (i.e., dispensed in a loose form) the practitioner must ensure that the patient receives the required information when the medication is dispensed. The information must include the name of the herbal formula, manufacturer, and iden tification of the individual ingredients (using clear and acceptable terminology). In order to ensure the herbal formula can be readily identified, the name of the formula may initially be written in the practitioner's preferred language or style (e.g., C hinese characters or Pinyin) but should also include: anglicised formula name as used in reputable texts, and the name of the manufacturer Practitione rs must check their respective c ollege ( CTCMA -BC, CTCMPANL and CTCMPAO) for further guidance and requireme nts for na ming herbs. If a manufacturer's packaged product uses non -standard names, the practitioner should use the names as used by the manufacturer, and clearly specify the name of the manufacturer so that dispensing can be accurate. Herbal medications that are unlabelled must not be prescribed or dispensed. 5.3.5 Providing Prescriptions to the Patient The patient should be provided with a copy of the prescription. The patient copy should provide the following additional information: Number of allowed refills One-time use prescriptions should be clearly indicated (e.g., indicate \"no TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 94 repeats\"). Herbal medicine are most often one -time use, then monitored to adjust the herbal formula. Expiry date If no expiry date is indicated, the prescription is assumed to expire one week following the date of writing. Dosage and use The dosage, frequency and timing of use of the medication (e.g., 100 ml, three times a day, one hour after a meal ). Warnings Include any applicable warnings on the use of the prescription. 5.3.6 Pr oviding Instructions to Patients Clear instructions should be provided to the patient (or the patient's parent or guardian as required) both verbally and in writing, to allow the patient to safely: use and fill the herbal prescription ; prepare th e herbal m edication as required (see below) ; consume or use the herbal medication. The method of preparing an herbal decoction should be explained verbally and in writing. The instruction sheet should be in a language that is understandable to the patient or design ate. The verbal instructions should provide the patient with information related to : frequency, timing, and duration of the prescription ; expected factors or normal reactions related to the medication (e.g., unexpected taste, likely aroma, commo n sensatio ns that may be experienced after use) ; possible adverse reactions, and specific guidance on what the patient is to do if adverse effects are experienced ; when to stop taking the prescription (e.g., nausea, significant change in bowel movements, h aving a me nstrual period, in the event of pregnancy); what to do after completion of the medication (e.g., what repeats may be utilized, or if further consultation may be required to continue medication) . If the patient is required to fill a prescription at a separ ate herbal dispensary, instructions should be given regarding how to find a dispensary and what to tell the dispenser to do. 5.4 Dispensing Chinese Herbal Medications This guideline applies to the dispensing of the following kinds of prescriptio ns for Chinese herbal medicine: individual raw herbs single herbs in the form of granules, powders and extracts manufactured formulas (i.e., formulas that have been manufactured i nto pills, tablets or granules) This guideline does not apply to TCM Natura l Health P roducts sold over -the-counter (OTC) without prescription or to the supply of individual herbs or combination of herbs requested by a client. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 95 5.4.1 Accurate Dispensing of the Components of a Prescription The dispensing TCM practitioner has the responsibilit y for patient safety by ensuring that the formula the patient receives is identical to that recorded on the prescription. If individual herbs are specified, all herbs indicated on the prescription are included in the formula in the same form and in the sa me dosage as specified on the prescription. If manufactured formulas are specified, the dispensed formula will have the same name as indicated on the prescription and contain the same individual herbs. Substituting Herbs When an herb or form ula is unavai lable, or the dispenser is unsure of what is written on the prescription, the dispenser should obtain further advice from the practitioner who wrote the prescription before dispensing the prescription. The need to contact the practitioner may be waived if : the difference in the individual herb specified and the herb available has no significant therapeutic implications. Thorough knowledge of comparable therapeutic effect of different form s of herbs is an expected competency of dispe nsers who make the subs titution. the specified formula is not available and a formula of the same name and composition can be substituted from a different manufacturer. The substitution should be done with care and the patient and the practitioner should be advised of this chang e. If the dispenser is at all uncertain about the appropriateness of a substitution, the dispenser has the professional responsibility to consult with the TCM practitioner before the prescription is dispensed. Patient safety must guide these decisions. In Canada, dispensers cannot prescribe TCM herbal formulas to patients but may sell the OTC products or individual raw herb. If a prescription needs a substitute herb, the dispenser should consult with the prescribing practitioner. If another p ractitioner changes the formula (e.g., substitution of individual raw herb or single herb in powder), the revising practitioner will have assumed some or all of the responsibilities for patient safety. Providing Herbs in the Form Specified The dispenser sh ould provide herbs in the form specified on the prescription. Accuracy in Weighing Each herb in the prescription should be weighed independently. Raw herbs should be weighed with a level of accuracy of \u00b1 1 g. Toxic herbs may require greater accuracy. Granulated herbs or herbal extracts should be weighed with a level of accuracy of \u00b1 0.5 g. Toxic herbs may require greater accuracy. Checking Prescriptions The dispensing TCM practitioner should carefully examine the prescription and check that there are no inadvertent e rrors evident (e.g., herbs correctly identified, appropriate dosages). If the dispenser suspects that an error was made, the dispenser should contact the prescribing practitioner for clarification or confirmation. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 96 If contact cannot be made w ith the presc ribing practitioner and the nature of the error is clearly evident to the trained dispenser, the dispenser may correct the error, and dispense the prescription and contact the practitioner at a later time. The correction or alteration should b e clearly not ed on the prescription. The patient is informed of the change at the time of dispensing and the practitioner should be informed of the change in a prompt manner. 5.4.2 Accurate Identification of Herbs and Quality of H erbs The dispensing TCM p ractitioner s hould ensure that herbs are accurately identified and of good quality upon receipt in the dispensary and at the time of dispensing. If the dispenser is uncertain of the provided identification or labelling of an herb by the supplier, it is exp ected that th e dispenser will seek further information and clarification from the supplier before dispensing the herb. The herb should not be dispensed if there is uncertainty. Herbs of poor quality or significant deterioration should not be dispensed. Her bs, being nat ural materials, may have minor evidence of deterioration that can be suitably handled. If readily removable contaminants are evident (e.g., other plant matter, grit) they should be removed by the dispenser. 5.4.3 Accurate Dispensing of Amount of the P rescr iption The dispenser should provide the client with the same number of packets of herbs specified on the prescription. If no number is specified, at most three packets should be dispensed. The dispenser should provide the client with the same number of pa ckets/ bottles of pre-packaged manufactured formulas specified on the prescription. If no number is specified, the dispenser should dispense one bottle or packet (or up to one week supply). The dispenser should not fulfill requests by the clie nt for an inc rease in the amount of the prescription without first consulting the prescribing practitioner. 5.4.4 Labelling of the Medicine D ispensed Dispensers are expected to adhere to the following labelling guidelines: Each packet or container is labe lled with the name of patient and dispensing date. If multiple packages are bagged together, the identifying name should be written on the outside bag. If several packages are supplied and the patient is required to use them or prepare them in a certain s equence, the dispenser should label the packages appropriately so that instructions are easily followed (e.g., packages are labelled as 1, 2, 3 , etc., with appropriate supporting instructions). Pre-packaged manufactured medications that are properly labell ed require no additional labelling. Include appropriate cautionary labels (e.g., related to safe storage or kept out of reach of children). TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 97 5.4.5 Record Keeping The following procedures are recommended in order to keep accurate dispensing records. After di spensing the herbal medication, the dispensing practitioner should provide the following information on the client's prescription (or on a separate form and attach it to the prescription): o date that the prescription was dispensed o the dispenser's name (or n ame of the di spensing outlet) Return the prescription to the client. For risk management purposes, the dispensing practitioner is strongly encouraged to make a copy of the prescription to keep in the dispensary files. If the dispenser is also the patient's prescriber a nd practitioner, the comparable information should be recorded in the patient record. 5.4.6 Provision of Repeat Prescriptions The dispensing practitioner should only provide the client with the number of repeats specified on the prescription. If the numbe r of repeats is not specified, the dispenser should fill the prescription only once. If a client requests repeats not specified on the prescription, the dispenser should either : o consult with the prescribing practitioner to determine whether a dded repeats should be dispensed, or o refer the client back to their prescribing practitioner for further consultation. 5.4.7 Expired and Undated P rescriptions An expired or undated prescription should not be dispensed without seeking further direction from the TCM prac titioner who wrote the prescription. If no expiry date is evident on the prescription, the dispenser should assume the prescription expiry date is no more than one week after the prescription was written, or should check number of packets of h erbs specifie d on the prescription (e.g., 3 packets means the expiry date is after three days). Dispensers should not fill prescriptions that have not been prescribed by a TCM practitioner. 5.4.8 Providing I nstructions The dispensing practitioner should p rovide the cl ient with instructions about the correct preparation of the prescription. These instructions are not required if provided previously by the prescribing practitioner. The dispensing practitioner should provide verbal instructions of what the p atient should do if experiencing adverse reactions. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 98 5.5 Safe Management of a TCM Herbal Dispensary These guidelines are not applicable to retailers of over -the-counter TCM herbal products. 5.5.1 General Requirements for D ispensaries The following gener al specifica tions apply to all Chinese herbal dispensaries: The dispensary should be clean and orderly. Medicinal substances should be stored and handled in a hygienic manner. The facility should be able to monitor humidity, temperature , and air flow. The dispensary should be organised to allow for effective and safe preparation and dispensing of medications. Staff should be trained for the tasks required and demonstrate competence in carrying out duties. Facilities for hand washing should be readily avail able. Facili ties for cleaning of utensils should be readily available. Proper records should be kept including batch identification and supplier identity. Expiry date should be monitored as applicable. Procedures should be established to ensure the accurat e dispensing of prescriptions. Procedures should be established to prevent prescriptions from being confused, mishandled , or mislabelled. 5.5.2 Labelling of H erbs Herbs should be clearly identified and labelled to avoid confusion. Containers and/or dispens ary drawers and packets of herbs in storage should be clearly labelled. Purchased herbs should be inspected to confirm that the herb is correctly identified and labelled. Incorrectly labelled herbs should be referred to the wholesaler. If an herb's identi ty cannot be confirmed, it should be returned to the wholesaler. Packets of herbs supplied to clients should be accurately labelled. 5.5.3 Storage of Herbs It is expected that herbs will be stored using safe procedures and appropriate containers that ensu re that the herb can be kept free from contamination and that herb quality can be maintained. Herbs should be stored in clean, dry containers. The containers should provide protection from insect and rodent infestation. Herbs that show signs of deteriorat ion (mould, discoloration, insect attack) should be discarded. When herbs are transferred from storage into dispensing containers, they should be checked for deterioration and any extraneous matter. Herb storage containers should be properly managed. Do n ot top -up co ntainers leaving older herbs at the bottom of the container. Empty containers should be properly cleaned before re -filling. Keep herbs out of reach of children. TCMPA : Safety Course December 2012 Page 99 The optimal method of storage will vary based on the herb. (e.g., some herbs do best in air -tight containers , some others do best with regular exposure to air to keep them mould f ree). 5.5.4 Handling H erbs A clean and hygienic environment must be established and maintained for the handling and dispensing of herbal prescriptions. Proced ures to avoi d contamination and prevent cross -infection are further detailed in Section 2: Infection Prevention and Control . Dispensing practitioners should wash and dry their hands prior to dispensing a prescription. The surfaces on which herbs are dispe nsed should be clean and free from extraneous matter. Medical gloves, tongs or other means of hygienic handling may be used to reduce risks of cross -infection. Scales used for weighing herbs should be accurate and regularly and thoroughly cleaned. Utensils used in the processing of herbs should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned. Prescriptions must be packaged using clean materials (commonly paper or plastic). 5.5.5 Supervising Dispensary A ssistants It is the responsibility of practitioner to ensure that the dispensa ry is properly managed and prescriptions are safely and accurately dispensed. The dispensing practitioner is responsible for all aspects of the TCM herbal dispensary. Dispensary assistants must be provided with sufficient training to enable th em to perfor m all assigned tasks. Practitioners and dispensers must provide dispensary assistants with training in relevant regulations and practice guidelines such as labelling and dispensing, dispensary management, controlled substances, patient privacy requirement s, and infection control procedures.

CITES is an international agreement to ensure that international trade in wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Over 5 000 animal species, subspecies and populations and over 29 000 plant species, subspecies and populations are listed under CITES. All imports and exports of species listed under CITES have to be authorized through a permit system, as described in the table to the right. It is illegal to trade a CITES listed species or its parts and derivatives without the appropriate CITES permits. Depending on the species' severity of endangerment, CITES animals and plants are classified into one of three appendices.Appendix ClassificationPermit Requirements Appendix I Species are threatened with extinction.CITES Export Permit from country of export/ re-export AND a CITES Import Permit from country of import. NOTE: Trade in wild specimens for commercial purposes is prohibited (with few exceptions). Appendix II Species not considered threatened with extinction but may become so if their trade is not regulated.CITES Export Permit OR a CITES Re-Export Certificate from country of export/re-export. Appendix III Species not considered threatened with extinction, but are under special management in certain countries.CITES Export Permit OR a CITES Certificate of Origin from country of export/re-export.Animal and Plant Ingredients in Traditional Medicine This brochure is intended to inform practitioners, pharmacists, importers/exporters, and users of medicinal formulas or packaged medicines that list or contain wildlife ingredients about Canada's wildlife trade law, and how it may affect them. WAPPRIITA - The Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act In Canada, CITES is administered by Environment Canada and is implemented under the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act (WAPPRIITA).Under WAPPRIITA, it is unlawful, among other offences to: 1. Import or possess any wild species of the animal or plant kingdoms, including their parts and derivatives, that were obtained or exported in violation of a foreign state's law. This is not restricted to CITES-listed species. 2. Import or export CITES-listed species without the appropriate permits. 3. Offer for sale, or possess, Appendix I CITES species, in most cases. If a thing is labelled as containing CITES-listed plant or animal ingredients, it will be deemed to contain those ingredients unless proven to the contrary. Importing and exporting include shipping by air, sea and rail, by mail and courier, and in personal luggage. To legally import Appendix I species , a CITES Export Permit is required from the country of export AND a CITES Import Permit is required from the country of import. To legally import Appendix II species , a CITES Export Permit or a CITES Re-Export Certificate is required from the country of export/re-export. To legally import Appendix III species , a CITES Export Permit or a CITES Certificate of Origin is required from the country of export/re-export.Appendix I species are threatened with extinction, therefore require strict trade control. Commercial trade in these species is prohibited. The only exceptions are plants that have been artificially propagated or animals that have been produced in CITES Registered captive breeding operations. Possession of Appendix I specimens is allowed if the specimens were removed from the wild prior to July 1975 when CITES was created, or if they were legally imported with permits. For the Register of operations that breed and/or artificially propagate Appendix-I species for commercial purposes please go to: http://cites.org/eng/resources/registers.shtml. Appendix II species are not considered threatened with extinction at present but they may become so if their trade is not regulated. Appendix II also includes species whose parts or derivatives may resemble endangered species (e.g., the American black bear parts may resemble parts from endangered bear species). When an animal or plant is listed under CITES, it includes not only live specimens, but also any part, derivative or by-product of that species, including herbs and medicines. Plants are not exempt just because they are cultivated, rather than taken from the wild.

You must ensure that there are no Appendix I species animal or plant parts, or derivatives, listed in the ingredients in any of the medicines in your store.1 If any part or derivative of an Appendix I species is found in your store, it may be confiscated and you could be charged. You may sell Appendix II species parts or derivatives in your store, but only if the necessary permits were obtained when the items were imported. Ask the importer to give you a copy of the permits. Inspections of your store by wildlife officers can be made at any time, so keep a record to prove that the items were legally imported. Are you an importer or exporter of herbal plant or animal parts, or medicines that contain wildlife derivatives? If you import or export herbs or medicines that contain wildlife parts or derivatives, be sure that none of the parts are from Appendix I species and that none of the medicines list Appendix I derivatives.1 If you import medicines that contain wildlife parts or derivatives containing Appendix II species, you must first obtain the necessary CITES permits and present them to the Canada Border Services Agency upon entry into Canada. Otherwise, your goods may be confiscated and you could be charged. What happens if you do not comply with the law? The goods will be seized, and you may receive a warning or a ticket, or fines of up to $150,000 and/or up to five years in jail for individuals, and fines up to $300,000 for businesses. A separate fine can be imposed for every illegal item. For instance, an individual could be charged for every box of a product containing endangered species parts or derivatives. As of 2012, Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMPS) will be in place, which allows for penalties to be laid outside of the court system. 1 Trade may be possible for captive-bred or artificially propagated specimens.What can a customer or user of herbs and medicines do to ensure wildlife laws have been met? You must only buy parts or products that have been imported legally. Ask the store owner for proof of legal import. If you travel with medicines, make sure they do not list Appendix I species as ingredients. Ginseng that is native to Canada, even if it is returned after being shipped to Asia, is not exempt . Are there exemptions from requiring CITES permits to import/export wildlife parts or derivatives? Yes. There are non-commercial exemptions for tourist souvenirs, and personal and household goods, but restrictions apply. You are legally responsible to know what these exemptions are before you travel.
