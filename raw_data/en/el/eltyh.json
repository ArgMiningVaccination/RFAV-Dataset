The severity will depend upon your genetic make-up. The only solution is to make changes in your lifestyle to bring your blood pressure under control without these meds. I'm not advising anyone to simply stop taking them, especially if your blood pressure is dangerously high or if you are experiencing arrhythmias, but you can make changes that will improve your blood pressure so that you can begin taper off the meds. The problem with high blood pressure is due to stress. There are many kinds of stress. It is easy for someone to say that you must manage your stress, but how do you do that when you live in a stressful society that only seems to be getting more stressful each day, but there are things you can do to mitigate this problem, and they do work.

You can return to eating these things in moderation after you have broken the cycle that is causing the elevated blood pressure, but for now, eliminate them. The reason is that these foods contain protein, and protein is rich in the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which get converted into adrenaline. Try switching to a vegan diet or vegetarian diet. Second, cut out all sources of caffeine. I know this is rough for all you coffee lovers, but it is a must unless you want your head to shine. Third, cut out salt. Fourth, detox! You can buy detox teas at any supermarket and they are cheap, but the best product I have found is Liver Cleans Tea, which is available from Baseline Nutritionals. Look it up on the web. This is a great product that will purge the gall bladder of gall stones and the toxins you have been accumulating in your body. It will also flush out the liver, which will better enable it to cleans the blood, and for you men with enlarged prostates, that will help with emptying the bladder and eliminate multiple trips to the toilet throughout the night. Other benefits include eliminating the bloating after meals, indigestion, and acid reflux. I suggest that you also use an herbal colon stimulator to help with elimination after flushing these toxins out of your system. Fifth, drink hibiscus tea and plenty of water. Hibiscus has been shown to have a mild blood pressure reducing effect. Don't get over-heated. If you like to soak in the tub, don't make the bath water too hot. That is another form of stress. Last, exercise! Be consistent and do it regularly. Exercise moderately. I have the philosophy of keeping my exercise ritual short and sweet. A half hour to forty five minutes is plenty, or an hour at most. This way you are more likely to keep it up. Best wishes to you all. "}
