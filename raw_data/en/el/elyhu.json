Student Objectives: Students will conduct investigations and analyze and interpret data to classify viruses as living or nonliving organisms. Students will obtain information about the human immune response and communicate their reasoning through graphic organizers. Prior Student Knowledge: 1) Students will have examples of living and non-living things to use for comparison. 2) Students will have personal experience with illness and symptoms that may occur. 3) Students will be familiar with forms of genetic code and the central dogma [DNA --> RNA --> Proteins] Science & Engineering Practices Disciplinary Core Ideas Crosscutting Concepts Engaging in argument from evidenceHS-LS1-3 Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that feedback mechanisms maintain homeostasisPatterns: Organize or Classify Analyzing and interpreting data Cause and Effect: Show Cause and Effect Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may think that there is always a right and wrong answer in science. 2) Students may not be aware of the differences between pathogens: bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc. 3) Students may have limited knowledge of living vs. non-living things. 4) Students may believe that symptoms from an illness are due to the pathogen itself, and not also the immune system. LESSON PLAN ENGAGE: Are Viruses Alive? 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teacher will introduce the Qualities of Life by projecting them for the class. Then, the teacher will ask students to determine whether viruses are alive. Students will discuss with their partner(s) for at least two minutes. The teacher will take a poll to determine the initial class opinion. There is no consensus on this issue among scientists, so all answers can be justified.Are animals, plants, ect. alive? What are some examples of non-living things? Are bacteria alive? What do you know about viruses and how they survive?Google Slides Template [Slides 4 & 5] Quick Student Poll Tool ex: Google Forms, Mentimeter *optional* Extra Resource(s): Khan Academy Article: Are Viruses Dead or Alive? EXPLORE: C-E-R Justification 20 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Students can work alone or in pairs to investigate using a C-E-R worksheet. Teacher will give student(s) worksheet that lists the characteristics of life and asks specific questions about viral structure. Students will research to provide justifications for each choice. At the end of their investigations, students will decide if they still support / reject their hypothesis that viruses are / are not alive.Do viruses reproduce? Can viruses survive on their own? Do viruses mutate and change over time? Can viruses make their own energy? Do viruses grow and/or develop? Can a virus respond to its environment?Google Slides Template [Slides 5 & 6] Are Viruses Alive? C-E-R WorksheetEXPLAIN: Viruses & Your Immune System 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Key Vocabulary: Resources: Teacher will explain that there is no consensus among scientists and that - as long as reasoning is provided - either claim [ viruses are alive vs. viruses are not living ] could be supported. Teacher will show virus structure and explain that viruses are pathogens that invade the human body. But why do they make you feel so awful? Is that really your immune system working for you? Instructor will show TedEd Video.Virus : genetic code surrounded by a protein coat Immune System : The immune system is a complex organ system within an organism that protects against pathogens. Feedback mechanism: These maintain a living system's internal conditions, allowing it to remain alive even as external conditions change. They encourage (positive feedback) or discourage (negative feedback) what is going on inside the living system.Google Slides Template [Slides 6 - 12] TedEd Video: The Surprising Reason You Feel Awful When You're Sick ELABORATE: The Human Immune Response 15 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teachers will introduce the final task for students to create a flowchart showing what happens inside the body once someone has a viral infection. Students can use the TedEd Video or other resources to help them collect and evaluate the way in which the immune system responds to infection.What usually lets you know that you're not feeling well? Do you typically feel a fever first? Headache? Tiredness? Would this change based on what kind of virus you're infected with? Would it this process be different for a bacterial infection?Google Slides Template [Slides 11 - 13] Human Immune Response Flowchart Worksheet CLOSURE: Individual Immune Responses 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teacher will have students compare their immune response flowcharts with one another, then discuss implications and explanations for why the immune response might not be exactly the same for everyone. Does everyone have the same immune response? Have you ever had the same illness as someone else [influenza, COVID, etc.] and have it affect each of you differently?N / A EVALUATE: Submitting Worksheet Teachers & Students Will... Resources: Students will submit their C-E-R worksheet in which they supported their claim regarding viruses, as well as their flowchart following the immune system response to viral infection. These can be graded based on how well-supported the student argument was, or by completion.Are Viruses Alive?

Student Objectives: Students will model mutation of viral genetic code and evaluate the effect of changes to their heritable traits on the proportion of those variants spreading in the population. Prior Student Knowledge: 1) Students will be familiar with forms of genetic code and the central dogma [DNA --> RNA --> Proteins], but may not be familiar with the types of mutations 2) Students will be familar with the concept that genetic code influences traits of an organism Science & Engineering Practices Disciplinary Core Ideas Crosscutting Concepts Developing and using modelsHS-LS3-2 Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from(1) new genetic combinations through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by environmental factors.Systems and System Models: Illustrate or Model Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating informationHS-LS4-3 Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.Cause and Effect: Show Cause and Effect Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may have heard about the COVID-19 variants that are being monitored on a global scale. 2) Students may be aware of these variants being more contagious, more virulent, etc. 3) Students may believe that all mutations are beneficial to the organism. LESSON PLAN ENGAGE: Recalling Background Information 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teacher will ask students what they know about SARS-CoV-2. This should prompt a casual conversation about the global pandemic. Teacher can list the topics and / or student responses on the board for the class to see.How does it spread? What are the symptoms? What's the difference between the virus and the disease?Who does it affect? When did the pandemic start? How did it start? What happened to schools and businesses? Are there vaccines? What mutations are out there?Google Slides Template [Slide 15] EXPLORE: Modeling Mutations Activity 20 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teacher will show the CDC Cases of Variants of Concern in the United States . The teacher will tell students that these variants are caused by mutations. The teacher will introduce the \"visual telephone\" activity, where students will be in groups of 5 or more. Detailed instructions can be found on the activity worksheet. Students will complete the activity, then will be asked to make comparisons between what happened during the game and the different types of mutations. Students will list traits that could be impacted by mutation of a virus. These traits should be organized into \"harmful\" \"beneficial\" and \"no impact\".Why do you think some places have more variants? Why do you think some places have more of a particular variant? Why are these variants concerning? What traits do they share? How are mutations like the game telephone? How do the mistakes during the visual telephone game relate to the different types of mutations? What would a virus need to do to survive? What is beneficial to a virus? What does a virus control in the host cell?Google Slides Template [Slides 16 & 17] CDC Cases of Variants of Concern in the United StatesViral Mutations and Variants Worksheet Printed Message for Visual Telephone ActivityEXPLAIN: Viral Mutations 15 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Key Vocabulary: Resources: Teacher will explain / review the different types of mutations. Then, the teacher will explain that viruses replicate faster and have fewer check mechanisms in place to ensure that the copies they make of their genetic code is accurate. Therefore, more mistakes get made. Most mutant strains of viruses are less effective because of these mutations, but sometimes a mutation helps a virus spread or infect. Teacher will explain that the genetic code in viruses are responsible for making proteins that regulate its reproduction, determine its structure, its virulence [how harmful it is to the host], its binding proteins, etc. The instructor will ask students for examples of the traits they listed on the worksheet. These traits should be organized on the front board [Harmful, Beneficial, or No Impact]. Teacher will explain that the \"beneficial\" traits will be more likely to show up more and more in the population. Mutations : changes to genetic information Point Mutation : a change to one nucleotide Substitution : the wrong nucleotide is used in place of another Frameshift Mutation : change to DNA that alters the number of nucleotides and may affect the result of translation Insertion : adding an extra nucleotide, increasing the length of code Deletion : deleting a nucleotide, decreasing the length of codeGoogle Slides Template [Slides 18 - 22] Optional Resource: Mutation Creation Game ELABORATE: Correlations Between Deadliness & Infectiousness 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will show the graph of historical diseases and their Deadliness vs. Infectiousness and ask students to interpret what they see. Are the deadly viruses typically the most easily spread?What if a virus is really hard to catch / doesn't spread easily? Can a virus be too deadly? Will that impact how many people the virus can infect? Why does a virus need to balance how deadly it is with how infectious it is?Google Slides Template [Slide 23] CLOSURE: Why Are COVID-19 Variants Concerning? 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teacher will explain that the more a virus is spreading unchecked in a population, the more likely mutations / variants are. The students will be given a closing / exit question \"Why are COVID-19 variants concerning?\"In the news, what do you hear about the variants? Is it possible that the mutations will help the virus evade immunity from previous infection or vaccination? Do other viruses mutate? Has anyone had influenza twice (or more)?Viral Mutations and Variants Worksheet EVALUATE: Exit Question 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Resources: Students will submit their explanation of the closing / exit question. This question asks students to evaluate why COVID-19 variants are concerning for the Centers for Disease Control.Viral Mutations and Variants Worksheet Elaborate Further / Reflect / Enrichment Epidemics vs. Pandemics: When viral strains experience mutations that make it more effective at spreading, it can cause epidemics and/or pandemics. Students Variants Activity Instructions: Get a paper and pencil. Form a line or a circle and decide who will be the first to start the message chain. After your instructor hands the first person the message, they will get 10 seconds to look at the message, then will use only words to pass the message to the next person. The second individual will get another ten seconds to write down the message, then they will share it with the next person. Continue until everyone has received and passed on the message. As a group, compare the end message with the beginning message. 1. What was the first message? 2. What was the last message in your group? 3. Define mutation. 4. How do the mistakes (if there were some) during the activity relate to genetic mutations? 5. What traits do viruses have? To help you answer this question, think of what a virus does. Beneficial to Virus No Harm to Virus Harmful to Virus Exit Question: Why are COVID-19 variants concerning?Visual Telephone Activity Print & Cut Message for Each Group Vaccines & Your Community Day 3 of 10 NARRATIVE / BACKGROUND INFORMATION Grade Level: 9th - 10th Subject: Biology Topic: Vaccines & The Community Lesson Description: Examining the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases in a community and the vaccination policies that might limit this spread. Student Objectives: Students will construct reasoned explanations for vaccination policies, based on evidence and ethical considerations, considering the impact of disease virulence on herd immunity threshold. Prior Student Knowledge: Students will have personal experiences with their own childhood vaccinations. Students will have background experience from the rapid spread of COVID-19. Students will have heard about the COVID-19 vaccination and will have more understanding of how vaccines work from the lesson delievered a day beforehand. Science & Engineering Practices Disciplinary Core Ideas Crosscutting Concepts Asking questions and defining problemsHS-LS2-8 Evaluate the evidence for the role of group behavior on individual and species' chances to survive and reproduce.Cause and Effect: Show Cause and Effect Constructing explanations and designing solutions Engaging in argument from evidence Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may believe that vaccines for some diseases are no longer necessary, because they are no longer common. 2) Student may think that the herd immunity threshold is the same for all diseases. 3) Students may believe that vaccines are either required or not required; they may not be aware of exemptions that exist at the state level. LESSON PLAN ENGAGE: Vaccine-Preventable Diseases 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Teacher will prompt students to discuss with a partner the different vaccine-preventable diseases. Students should share examples. Examples include: Flu, Chickenpox, Polio, HPV, Tetanus, Measles, Hepatitis B, and COVID-19. What is the role of vaccines / vaccination? Are all vaccinations required? Have you heard of all of these diseases? Are they no longer common because of the success of the vaccine?Google Slides Template [Slides 26 & 27] CDC: Vaccines and Preventable Diseases EXPLORE: Modeling Disease Spread through POX Game 20 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The instructor will have students play the POX Game individually or in partners. This game can be played on an iPad or as a printed board game. The student(s) start with a community of people. Vulnerable people are shown in yellow - they cannot get vaccinated and are at risk of severe infection. Red indicates infected individuals. The red beads will spread across the board according to each round (app) / card (paper). The role of students is to vaccinate (with blue beads) the population and prevent death. Death (black bead) occurs when an infected individual is surrounded by other infected individuals.Why can't everyone get vaccinated? Who is included in the \"vulnerable\" people? By age, allergies, etc. In this game, why do \"vulnerable\" people die when they are infected? Why do you think a \"death\" happens to healthy people when they are surrounded by infected individuals? What are the realistic aspects of this game? What are the limitations of modeling infectious spread with this game?Google Slides Template [Slide 28] POX Game iPad App (free) OR POX Game Printed with 5 black, 40 red, & 50 blue pony beads Alternative Resource: The Habitable Planet - Disease LabEXPLAIN: Vaccines & Herd Immunity 15 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Key Vocabulary: Resources: The teacher will use TedEd video and/or History of Vaccines animation to explain how vaccines mimick the viral agent to stimulate and teach the immune system to respond. Teacher will explain the role of herd immunity in protecting a community. Herd immunity is different for different diseases, because the R 0 is different. The teacher will show graphic relating the disease to its R0 and effective herd immunity. As the R0 increases, so does the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT).Group Behavior (when sick): social animals change their behavior when sick to protect the group. This only works if you're contagious period aligns with when you feel sick. R0: average number that one sick person will infect. Herd Immunity : existence of immunity through previous infection or vaccination to the extent that spread of disease is limited. Herd Immunity Threshold : percentage (based on disease) of the population that needs to be immune (previous infection or vacciantion) in order to limit large outbreaks.Google Slides Template [Slides 29 - 34] TedEd Video: How Do Vaccines Work?The History of Vaccines Animation: How Vaccines Work ELABORATE: Vaccine Requirements & Exemptions 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will ask students, \"how do we get to the appropriate herd immunity threshold (HIT)?\" Students may respond with suggestions like making vaccines free, making them widely available, having physicians recommend them, etc. Teacher will explain that for required vaccines, often K-12 public schools require them. At the state level, there are also exemptions for people who cannot or do not want to get vaccinations for medical, religious, and/or personal beliefs.Under what circumstances, and to what extent, should we respect an individual's choice not to be vaccinated? What are the risks and benefits of vaccination for individuals? What are the risks and benefits of vaccination for the larger community? Is it fair to allow some individuals not to be vaccinated, recognizing that they will receive protection from a disease because others take on the burden of getting the vaccine? Questions: Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health Template [35 & 36] CLOSURE: Examining Opt-Out Scenarios 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will ask students to discuss several scenarios and decide whether they believe each is a good reason for opting out of vaccination. Scenarios: Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2009.Are some reasons for opting out of vaccination more acceptable than others? What responsibilities do individuals have to their communities? Questions: Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2009.Google Slides Template [37] EVALUATE: Reflection Questions 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Resources: Teacher will assign the following reflection questions for students to answer before they leave for the day: Why are some vaccines required and some are not? What exemptions should be allowed?Google Slides Template [38] Vaccines & The Community Exit Question Elaborate Further / Reflect / Enrichment What else is in a vaccine? Students can investigate the other materials in a vaccine, including some that are responsible for negative side effects.Name: _____________________ Date: _________ Hour: _______ Vaccines & The Community Exit Questions Exit Questions: Why are some vaccines required and some are not? In your opinion, what exemptions -if any- should be allowed? Please explain your reasoning. - Medical exemptions only - Medical and religious exemptions - Medical, religious, and personal belief exemptionsINSTRUCTION BOOKLETA GAME OF DISEASE CONTROL FOR 1 TO 4 PLAYERS FOR AGES 12+ Game Board 28 POX cards InstructionsPROVIDED MATERIALS 50 blue (immunization) chips 40 red (infection) chips 5 black (death) chips Recommended \u00bd inch diameterYOU MUST PROVIDEGOAL OF THE GAME A deadly disease has broken out in your neighborhood, and it's your job to halt its spread! Work with your fellow players to contain infections by vaccinating and curing people. The game is won when the disease can no longer spread to infect others, no matter which direction it spreads. The game is lost if five people die OR if all infection chips have been played.2nd Edition HOW TO START Shuffle the deck of cards, and place it face down beside the board. Place a red chip on each of the two red spaces on the board. These are the initial infected people. Before play begins, players should agree to a difficulty level \u2014 the number of people permitted to die before the game is lost. CHICKEN SOUP: 4 DEATHS COUGH MEDICINE: 3 DEATHS IV FLUIDS: 2 DEATHSINTENSIVE CARE: 1 DEATH MIRACLE: 0 DEATHS\u00ae 2) OUTBREAK CARDSTHE CARDS There are two types of cards you will draw in your attempts to halt the swiftly spreading disease: 1) SPREAD CARDS When you draw a spread card, every infected person spreads the disease, infecting healthy people in the direction(s) shown. If, because of immunized people, no new infections occur, then you may vaccinate or cure twice the amount shown on the card, or a combination of the two. HOW TO PLAY Select difficulty, then the youngest player begins. Each turn follows the same steps: 1) Draw a card. 2) Add red infection chips as directed by the card drawn (either Spread or Outbreak). 3) Check to see if anyone has died (see last page).4) Vaccinate or cure as many people as the drawn card allows. If no new infections resulted from the drawn card, vaccinate or cure twice the number of people stated on the card. When an outbreak card is drawn, a red infection chip must be placed on a healthy person matching the type shown on the card. This person cannot be next to someone who is immunized or infected. If there is no such person, the outbreak does not occur, and you may vaccinate two people instead of one. The yellow spaces on the board are people who cannot be vaccinated, such as pregnant women, newborns, and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer or HIV/AIDS. Immunization chips cannot be placed on them, and they will die immediately if infected. Special care should be taken to protect them. VACCINATING Choose any healthy person to vaccinate. That person becomes immunized and can never become infected. CURING Choose any infected person to cure, and replace the red infection chip with a blue immunization chip. Immunized people can never be infected. CAST OF CHARACTERS At the start of the game, there are three groups of people living in your neighborhood: 3) VULNERABLE PEOPLEThe red spaces on the board are people who are infected at the start of the game. The infection may spread from them to adjacent healthy people. They may be cured and become immunized during the course of the game.1) INFECTED PEOPLE The gray spaces on the board are healthy people. They are at risk of infection, but may be vaccinated during the course of the game. There are four variations of healthy people on the board. Each variation may be affected by an outbreak card. If healthy people become infected, they may then be cured.2) HEALTHY PEOPLE \u00a9 2011 Mary Flanagan. All Rights Reserved.tiltfactorDEATH If the infection becomes too widespread, a person on the board may die. To mark death, cover the red chip with a black chip. Death may occur in one of two ways: 1) Any infected person surrounded on all possible sides by infected people will die. 2) Whenever a person who cannot be vaccinated (a yellow space) becomes infected, that person immediately dies. Dead people cannot be cured OR vaccinated. The game is lost when too many people die, based on the chosen game difficulty. To learn more, visit tiltfactor.org\u00a9 2011 Mary Flanagan.

Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may not be aware of the differences between reliable and unreliable sources. 2) Students may have a difficult time understanding that science cannot prove a negative, but can only provide evidence against it. 3) Students may believe that scientific ideas are absolute and unchanging. LESSON PLAN ENGAGE: Discuss Prior Knowledge 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The instructor will ask students to list all of the theories, rumors, stories, or questions they've heard about the COVID-19 virus or vaccine. The teacher will list those on a board or display them in a way that all students can see. Then, the teacher will explain that science has a hard time disproving some of these claims. For example, the teacher can say \"I believe unicorns exist. Prove to me that they don't.\" Students may be able to see that science can only provide evidence against a claim or point to the lack of evidence supporting a claim. The teacher will explain that science can only support or refute claims based on evidence.What reasons have people listed for not getting the vaccine? What were some concerns about COVID when it first started to spread? What stories have you heard from people whom have had COVID-19 or whom have received the vaccine? Have you seen any questionable information going around in the last year? Some Myths & Facts can be found here to prompt conversation: CDC Myths and Facts about COVID-19 VaccinesGoogle Slides Template [Slide 41] EXPLORE: Examining and Evaluating Validity 20 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: In partners, students will choose 1 listed item from the class conversation (above) to investigate and support or \"debunk\". The students can use the flowchart on Student Worksheet Day 4 to help guide them in their investigation. They will have 15-20 minutes to research and develop their decision. They will share their findings next.Can you trust the source? Are you able to identify the author or organization of the information? Is the author an authority in their field? Did they cite the information they used? Is the information unbiased? Is the information current?Google Slides Template [Slide 42 - 44] Viral Mythbusters WorksheetEXPLAIN: Mythbusters Presentations 20 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Key Vocabulary: Resources: The teacher will have students go through their presentations one group at a time. The presentation template has two slides for the teacher to use depending on the students' conclusion - \"Busted\" or \"Supported\". While the presentations are going on, the teacher should record notes for the debrief after the presentations.Supported : terminology used when the evidence supports the claim; this is used in place of 'proven' Refuted : terminology used when the evidence goes against the claim. In this activity, \"busted\" will be used in place of refuted.Google Slides Template [Slides 45 & 46] ELABORATE: How and Why Does False Information Spread? 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Instructor will ask students to think about why false theories / myths spread? Students should talk to their partner(s) about examples or implications of this occuring during the global pandemic. If the students are having a difficult time coming up with ideas, the teacher can relate this to how news spreads at their school.Do you usually pay more attention to good news or bad news? How quickly does gossip spread at school? Do other pieces of information spread as quickly as gossip? Are there potential motivations behind getting people worked up about negative information? positive information?Google Slides Template [Slide 47] CLOSURE: Community Interview Assignment 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will explain that every community is made up of a dynamic group of individuals. It is important when designing an intervention for a community, that you know and understand the community members. Then, the teacher will introduce the homework assignment \"Community Interview\". Students will be expected to conduct an informal interview with a member of their community / neighborhood. This person should not be a close friend or relative and should come from a different cultural background from the student.Why is it important to understand a community when designing an intervention for that community? Would it be necessary to know the community concerns / needs? Will everyone in the community feel the same way about an issue? How much exposure do you have to people of different cultural backgrounds? What is the difference between equality and equity?Google Slides Template [Slide 48] Community Interview Worksheet EVALUATE: Student Presentations 0 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Resources: Teacher will record notes of the student presentations and could give formative or summative feedback to the student(s). N/A Elaborate Further / Reflect / Enrichment Weighing the Risks. The teacher can have students investigate the risks behind vaccination. These can be compared to other risks that are taken in life where the benefits must be assessed with the risks. When is something worth the risk? When is it not worth the risk? This site can be used as a resource: _________ Hour: _______ Community Interview Assignment Document the following during / after your interview. Interview Information: What is the name of the individual you interviewed? How do you know this person? How is this individual culturally different from you? Interview Questions: How do you define community? How do you define culture? How would you describe our community / neighborhood? Do you believe our community has equitable healthcare access for everyone? Everyone has a fair opportunity to live a long and healthy life with the absence of systematic disparities between social groups who have different levels of underlying social advantage. From your experience, how has COVID-19 impacted our community? Where do you think people in your community turn for trusted health information?Vaccines & Your Community Day 5 of 10 NARRATIVE / BACKGROUND INFORMATION Grade Level: 9th - 10th Subject: Biology Topic: Neighborhood Health - Assets & Barriers Lesson Description: Investigating the influence of social determinants on the health of individuals within a community and mapping community assets and barriers that improve or limit community health. Student Objectives: Students will be able to explain the connections between social determinants of health and the health outcomes of a community. Students will be able to compare the assets and barriers to health that exist within their neighborhood. Finally, students will be able to define cultural responsivity and its role in improving social determinants of health. Prior Student Knowledge: Students have personal experiences with their health and the health of their family. Students may have experience visiting other communities with better or worse health outcomes from which they can relate to social determinants of health. Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may not consider all of the factors that influence the health of a community and the individuals that live there. 2) Students may think that cultural responsiveness is just awareness of cultural diversity, rather than responsive action to address inequities. 3) Student understanding of community assets and barriers may be limited to infrastructure assets and barriers. LESSON PLAN ENGAGE: Social Determinants of Health 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The instructor will show the students the video A Tale of Two Zip Codes. Then the teacher can lead a debrief discussion about the video. This should lead students to make comparisons between their own community and those near it. The teacher will show the Social Determinants of Health diagram and explain that there are other things that impact the health of a person, including the assets and barriers to health that exist more systemically.How do social determinants of health impact culturally marginalized groups within a community? What do you notice when you travel to different areas of the city / town? Are there any that you think might have different levels of access to education, healthcare, clean water? Do you notice more or less diversity in different areas of the city / town? What is the difference between equity and equality?Google Slides Template [Slides 50 & 51] Youtube: A Tale of Two Zip Codes EXPLORE: County Health Rankings 20 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will direct students to County Health Rankings where students should use the \"Find County Rankings\" tool to search their county. Students will use the How Healthy Is Our Community? worksheet to document the data that they find regarding community demographics and community health outcomes. Students can be paired up to do this work, or can be assigned the worksheet invididually. However, if done individually, the teacher should allow for students to share in partners or small groups after their research.Why would mental health impact your quality of life? Why would low birthrate impact your quality of life? What is the Food Environment Index? How would that impact health? Are physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities linked? Why is it important to have a high ratio of health providers to people? How does unemployment impact health in a community? Does driving alone to work impact air pollution? How do those two issues influence the health of people living in that community?Google Slides Template [Slides 52 - 55] How Healthy Is Our Community? WorksheetEXPLAIN: Class Discussion & Call to Action 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Key Vocabulary: Resources: The teacher will ask students to share their findings with the class. The teacher should ask students to reflect on what they learned about the demographic makeup of their community, the health of their community, and the reflection questions about healthcare inequality and its impact on different cultural groups. The teacher will define cultural competence and cultural humility to lead into a conversation about the importance of culturally responsiveness. Cultural responsivity allows individuals and communities to leverage their assets to address the barriers that exist in their community in order to improve overall health and wellness. Teachers should prompt students to reflect, \"what is my culture and how does it infleunce the ways others view and interact with me?\".Cultural Competence: Ability to understand, appreciate and interact with people from cultures or belief systems different from one's own. Cultural Humility: Practice of self-reflection on how one's background, experiences, and expectations impact a situation or interaction. Cultural Responsiveness: Putting cultural awareness, competence, humility into action for more equitable systems. Assets: The human and structural resources that a community has to benefit the health and wellness of a community. These are useful or valuable things or qualities within a community. Barriers: Obstacles that limit the health and wellness of a community. Conditions, policies, or attitudes that prevent or make health and wellness difficult in a community, as well as personal and social hurdles that many people have to surmount on a daily basis.Google Slides Template [Slides 53 - 58] How Healthy Is Our Community?

Probing Questions: Resources: Students should be directed to the next worksheet \"Assets & Barriers in My Community\". The teacher will give students time to discuss with a partner or small group and collaborate to generate a list of barriers that exist within the community, as well as assets that can be leveraged in the community. The google slides for assets and barriers can be shown to help students generate these lists.What is special about our community? How easy is it to get healthy food in our community? Do we have plenty of fire stations? Are there any vacant homes? Are there safe playgrounds in our community? Are they easy to get to? Do we have enough teachers? Good schools? Is it easy to get to a hospital or healthcare clinic?Google Slides Template [Slides 59 & 60] Assets & Barriers In My Community Worksheet CLOSURE: COVID-19 Assets & Barriers 5 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will ask students to connect their Asset & Barriers to COVID- 19. It may need to involve the teacher giving an example of how an asset and/or barrier listed before could relate to COVID-19 and/or COVID-19 vaccination rates. The example listed below can be utilized, or one more specific to the community could be developed. Example: In our community, we have several pharmacies that offer drive- thru testing and vaccination. However, these pharmacies close at 8 or 9pm and it's difficult for people working two jobs to get tested / vaccinated.How do community barriers contribute to individuals questioning and/or refusing the COVID-19 vaccine? In what way could assets of this community contribute to overcoming those barriers? Who in the community could help build confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine? What resources could be used to increase access and ease of vaccination?Google Slides Template [Slide 61] Assets & Barriers In My Community Worksheet EVALUATE: Submit Worksheets 0 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Resources: Teachers will have students turn in their completed worksheets (How Healthy Is Our Community? and Assets & Barriers In My Community). This will give instructors a good idea of how well students made the connection(s) between their community's health and those assets and barriers that exist within their community.How Healthy Is Our Community?

Student Objectives: Students will be able to define privilege and explain their own privileges. Students will be able to compare equality and equity, with a particular focus on their impact on health and wellness of a community. Students will be able to synthesize information gained from community interviews to improve their understanding of residents of their community. Prior Student Knowledge: Students have been introduced to the social determinants and culturally responsiveness in day 5. Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may think of privilege as it relates to race and may not consider the other forms of privilege that exist. 2) Students might relate privilege to an 'easy' life and therefore may believe they don't have privilege. 3) Students might not consider the ill-effects of saviorism on a community. LESSON PLAN ENGAGE: The Meaning of Privilege 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will ask students what privilege means. This should lead into a discussion about different types of privilege. Privileges advantage the in-group and make it easier for an individual to move through the world and address some obstacles they encounter. This does not mean that life is easy for those with privilege, but it does mean those individuals may not need to consider particular challenges. The \"Invisible Knapsack\" from Peggy McIntosh might be a useful reference for the instructor and students.What experiences do you have with privilege? How might privilege make a particular situation easier for someone? Are there different types of privilege? Why do you think people might not be aware of their privilege? Why would it be an issue that people remain unaware of privilege?Google Slides Template [Slides 64 & 65] Additional Resources: Hive Learning: Diversity and InclusionWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack by Peggy McIntosh EXPLORE: Examining Our Own Privilege 15 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher will introduce the Priviledge Beads Activity, where students will move around the room to four different stations (each station can be repeated for a larger class, resulting in 8 stations). These stations will focus on gender privilege, race privilege, religious privilege, and ability privilege. The students will collect one bead from each station for each statement that they feel relates to them. Students can collect up to 7 beads per station, with a maximum or 28 total beads collected during the activity. Teachers should not place single colored beads at each station, as that might make students feel vulnerable about disclosing particular privileges (or lack thereof) to other students. Optional: The teacher can also provide string or cord to allow students to make something wearable out of their privilege beads. Otherwise, the beads could be reused for following classes or activities.Invite participants to reflect on what it was like to focus on privilege and advantage, rather than on oppression or disadvantage? Why is it important for us to be aware of privilege as an aspect of our identities/experience? What does it mean for us to have some privileges and some oppression? What insight can this give us in connecting with others? Being allies or advocates? What identities (systems of privilege) were not represented here today? If we had them how would that affect your collection of beads? How noticeable, to us and others, are our privileges on a daily basis? Can we and how do we hide (deny, justify, ignore) our privilege on a daily basis? What does the collective privilege present here mean for us as leaders in our community?Google Slides Template [Slide 66] Privilege Beads Activity Activity Adapted From: Allen, Brenda J., and Thomas E. Walker. Nd. \"Privilege Bead Exercise.\" <http://differencematters.info/uploads/pdf/privilegebeads- exercise.pdf>EXPLAIN: Privilege Activity Reflection & Cultural Responsiveness 15 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Key Vocabulary: Resources: The teacher will ask students to reflect on the Privilege Beads Activity (discussion questions can be used from above). The teacher should ask students to reflect on how privilege relates to health outcomes. The teacher will remind students of the terms cultural competence, cultural humility, and the importance of culturally responsiveness. Cultural responsivity allows individuals and communities to leverage their privilege (an asset) to address the barriers that exist in their community. Leveraging these assets can begin the process of dismantling systemically oppressive and racialized outcomes.Privilege: An advantage that comes with belonging to an in-group. Cultural Responsiveness: Putting cultural awareness, competence, humility into action for more equitable systems. Equality: Everyone in a community receives the same support(s). Equity: Everyone in a community receives the supports that they need. Health Equity: Everyone in a community has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy, through equitable supports.Google Slides Template [Slides 67 - 70] ELABORATE: Sharing Community Interview 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The instructor should group students into pairs or small groups. Each student should share the content of their interview with their partner(s). Then, the teacher will prompt the students to discuss the similarities and differences with their interviews, as well as how what they learned will help them become allies and advocates in the community to create more equitable systems.What was similar about the interviews your group conducted? What was different about the individuals you interviewed? Did any common things come up in the interviews? Do these interviews give you a better idea of the impact of COVID on our community? Do they give you more insight into the areas where our community needs more support?Google Slides Template [Slides 71 & 72] Community Interview Assignment Worksheet CLOSURE: Community Advocacy Project Introduction 10 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: At this point, the students should be introduced to the community advocacy project. The teacher will explain that the students will work in groups (ideally groups of 3 or 4) to develop a health communication campaign with the goal of increasing COVID-19 vaccination in their community. This campaign should be targeted to a specific group and should attempt to address that group's potential questions about vaccination and / or address their barriers to vaccination access.What groups in the community should we targeted with this campaign? What are some of the vaccine advertisements you've seen, if any? Where are effective places to get a message out? Do you think scare tactics work to convince people to do something?Google Slides Template [Slide 74] COVID-19 Vaccines & Your Neighborhood Worksheet EVALUATE: Submit Interview Assignment 0 MINUTES Teachers & Students Will... Resources: Students will turn in their interview assignment from Day 4. It is suggested that the instructor grade this assignment based on completion, as long as the student followed the guidelines and provided some notes from the interview to share with their group.Community Interview Assignment Worksheet Elaborate Further / Reflect / Enrichment Saviorism: Consideration should be made for classes based on the diversity of the community. If there is little diversity and high privilege in the community, consider extending the discussion about using privilege in appropriate ways. \"Saviorism\" can refer to a person or group using an imbalance of power or privilege to justify their privilege through volunteering and public service. Saviorism is done without involving the community and without working to address the systemic injustices. It is instead important to create equity-empowered systems.Privilege Beads Exercise Adapted and revised from instructions written by Dr. Thomas E. Walker University of Denver, for Colorado Leadership for Equity, Advocacy and Discovering Social Justice MATERIALS : Printed privilege lists (5-6 copies of each) Small beads of assorted colors (ex: pony beads) Bowls or cups to hold beads at each table Small cups (3oz. disposable; one for each participant) SUGGESTED SETUP: 1.Create 8 stations around the room and space them so that multiple students can stand at each station. Each station should have a bowl of multicolored beads. 2.Post 2-3 copie s of each \"privilege list\" at each station so that several students can read the m. There will be 2 stations with Ability Privilege, 2 with Religious Privilege, etc. 3.Provide each student with a cup (into which they will place their beads). 4.Point out stations around the room and provide instructions: Each station includes a list of 7 statements related to a specific social identity. Each statement describes one possible example of privilege related to that category's system of oppression and privilege, that is to say, the likelihood that an individual is might experience advantage or disadvantage. Note that neither the stations nor the statements are meant to be exhaustive or comprehensive; these are meant to be a sampling, and a starting point for discussion . You might think of other categories that could be included, or you might contest some of the items. Please do not over-analyze the statements: our goal is to begin reflection and discussion. If you can quickly answer \"basically yes,\" take the bead. If your answer is \"basically no,\" do not take a bead. Each list is meant to focus on your current status in life, which may mean that you haven't always enjoyed the privileges that you can identify today, or that you may have less privilege in a category than you once did. Please visit each station, and read every item on each list. As you read a list, for every item on the list to which you can answer, \"Yes,\" take one bead. If your answer to an item on a list is \"No,\" do not take a bead. As you read each item, know that while some persons in the room may be taking a bead, others may not be. Do this for each list. When you are finished with every list, you will have a set of beads that represent your composite of privileges. 5. Allow students to move through the stations. They will visit 4 total stations focusing on ability privilege, race privilege, religious privilege, and gender privilege. This should take about 15 minutes.Ability Privilege 1.I can assume that I will easily have physical access to any building. 2. I have never been taunted, teased, or ostracized due to a disability. 3. I can do well in a challenging situation without being told I am an inspiration because of my ability status. 4. I can go shopping alone and expect to find appropriate accommodations to make the experience hasslefree. 5. I do not have to request accommodations due to my ability status. 6. If I am not hired for a job , I do not question if it was due to my physical or mental ability. 7.Other people do not think that my mental ability is limited because of my physical ability.Gender/Sex Privilege 1. If I have children and a successful career, few people will ask me how I balance work and home. 2. I do not have to think about the message my wardrobe sends about my sexual availability. 3.

I can do well in a challenging situation without being called a credit to my race. 6. I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group. 7.I can go shopping without concern that store employees will monitor me because of my race. Religious Privilege 1. I can assume that I will not have to work or go to school on my religious holidays. 2. I can be sure that mainstream media will celebrate the holidays of my religion. 3. My religious views are reflected by the majority of government officials and political candidates. 4. Food that honors my religious practices can be easily found in any restaurant or grocery store. 5. Places to worship or practice my religion are numerous in my community. 6. Most people do not consider my religious practices to be \"weird.\" 7. I do not need to worry about negative consequences of disclosing my religious identity to others. Vaccines & Your Community Days 7-10 of 10 PROJECT OVERVIEW Grade Level: 9th - 10th Subject: Biology Topic: Vaccine Advocacy Project Lesson Description: Students work in partners or small groups to develop a health communication campaign to increase vaccination rates in their community . Student Objectives: Students will develop persuasive communication examples targeted to their community . Students will be able to defend their rationale for targeting a specific group and their questions about vaccination. Students will curate a better understanding of vaccination themselves, which will make them more confident when they are presented with the opportunity to vaccinate. Prior Student Knowledge: Students will have experienced the audience perspective of advertising and health communication campaigns. Students have prior knowledge of the various platforms that can be used to share information and reach an audience. Students have developed a deeper understanding of their community , its residents, and their role in leveraging the assets of their community . Possible Preconceptions / Misconceptions: 1) Students may believe that there are limited ways to get information to people and may rely too heavily on social media to develop their campaign. 2) Students may not put specific thought into how their campaign wording should be put together and may use scare tactics or particular words without intention. 3) Students might think that vaccine deliberation is a negative thing, however , informed choice is essential and their job is to provide information and access. LESSON PLAN INTRODUCING THE PROJECT Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The instructor will explain the campaign guidelines and expectations for the final group presentation. The teacher should go over the rubric to make sure that students understand how they will be graded during the presentation. The rubric categories are Quality of Information, Vision, Creativity, Quality of Example, and Cooperation. Students should aim for a three minute presentation, but class size would need to be a consideration in how long each group has to present. There is an example of what could be done with this project, however the example lacks specific data and citations. Please use this as a general idea of what students should expect to create for this project.Who will you target with this campaign? Who has the lowest / near lowest vaccination rate in your community? What were the common concerns / issues that were brough up in your Community Interviews? What is the most effective way to get information to the general public? How will you create an example of your health communication campaign material?Google Slides Presentation [Slides 74 -76] COVID-19 Vaccines & Your Neighborhood Worksheet Health Communication Campaign Project Rubric Researching Testing & Vaccination Access Suggested: Day 7 Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The teacher should start this project work day by showing students some resources they can utilize to collect data for their community. The two resources provided help determine the local availability of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. The teacher should prompt students to think about what the actual barriers to vaccination are in the community . Then, students should begin their work time with groups. During this first day , the majority of the work will be data collection and determining a target audience in their community.What is the actual barrier to vaccination - is it lack of information or is it lack of easy access to vaccination? Do you notice any patterns with regard to communities with more / less access to testing / vaccination? Are vaccination sites close to public transportation? Will community members struggle to get to these sites or are they easy to get to? What does this information tell us about how we should design a health communication campaign?Google Slides Presentation [Slide 77]Health Communication Suggested: Day 8 Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: The instructor will project the CDC COVID-19 Communicator's Tip Sheet to start the class. Students will be asked to make comparisons between the two lists. The teacher will explain how the student groups need to carefully consider their wording in their communication campaign. Students will spend the majority of this work day determining the mode and content of their communication campaign. Students may begin to design their campaign example, in which case, the instructor may want to demonstrate free design tool available to them, such as Canva.com. Why do you think it is important not to use judgemental language? Why should you avoid dismissing an individual's concerns about the vaccine and/or its side effects? Message fatigue can make someone pay less attention to an important message or piece of information; why do you think that is? Why should health communicators use easy-to-understand language? For this project, you are choosing a 'target audience'; why is it important to tailor your message to the needs and values of your audience?Google Slides Presentation [Slide 78] Informed Choice: Vaccine Deliberation Suggested: Day 9 Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: At the beginning of this final project work day, the instructor may want to clarify for students that informed choice is an important part of taking ownership of your healthcare. It is absolutely understandable for someone to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine and concerns should be respected. However, refusal should not be due to lack of access, lack of information, or because of misinformation. It is the role of community leaders to make sure all community members are making an informed choice about vaccination.Why is informed choice so important? Is it fair to an individual if they make a choice without all of the facts or with partial / misleading / false information? 'Lack of access' should not be a reason for vaccine refusal; what do you think this means? Do you think informed choice should be a right?Google Slides Presentation [Slide 79] STUDENT PRESENTATIONS Suggested: Day 10 Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Student groups will deliver presentations to the class. While the students present, the teacher should evaluate the work based on the project rubric. At the end of each presentation, if there is time, the teacher can direct other students to ask questions of each group. Example questions are shown to the right.Why did your group decide to target this group? Will your campaign material reach your target audience? What are some potential issues you could run into with this campaign? Do you have any initial ideas on how you might fund this project? What language did you include and/or leave out of your message based on the target audience or the Communicator's Tip Sheet?Google Slides Presentation [Slide 80] Health Communication Campaign Project Rubric GRADING / EVALUATION Teachers & Students Will... Probing Questions: Resources: Students will present their group's ideas to the class. During the presentation, the instructor should have several copies of the rubric, to be used for grading. The grading of presentations should assess the students' quality of information, how well they developed and explained their vision, the amount of creativity shown in the work, the quality of example shown, and how well the team worked together .
