What Our Students Have To say \"I have known Steve Schechter for several decades and have taught Sports Nutrition at The Natural Healing Institute for 10 years. I also attended NHI and received my Clinical Nutrition Certification there in 1999. I love the school because they teach health and healing in a format that recognizes all life as being sacred. The students I have taught are eager to learn and are excited to become teachers and healers. I highly recommend anyone interested in health and healing attend The Natural Healing Institute.\" Jay Robb, CNC, CPT Bestselling author and business owner To say that I loved what I learned at NHI is an understatement! It is hard to put into words the amazing experience I received & all that my NHI courses meant to me. Many times, I felt as though I was in the midst of an ancient rite, privileged to be included in an inner circle of wisdom as I was being taught proven sacred knowledge handed down from hundreds of generations, those secrets that would keep the body healthy, well, empowered, & safe. It was truly an education of a lifetime, one that I have shared with many and that changed my eating and health practice forever. Steve, your classes were beyond deeply helpful, they were inspirational. Thank you for who you are and all that you do!
