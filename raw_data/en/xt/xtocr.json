She has been developing her holistic healing practices for over a decade, initiated by her own personal healing journey. After many years of studying under various teachers of different healing lineages, Taegan created this practice as a way to weave together the common threads of each modality. The intention of this approach is to create a truly holistic, integrative system of healing. Taegan received her Ayurvedic Health Counseling Certification through Kripalu Institute, and has since studied under the incredible Dr. Vasant Lad, receiving her Ayurvedic Practitioner Certification. She has also received her Reiki Attunement and Marma Acupressure Certification, and uses energy work to support her client's healing. A lifelong dancer, Taegan has experienced the extremely healing effects of using movement as medicine. Movement practices are pivotal for physical and energetic healing, allowing the body to process and release what has built up over time. Taegan facilitates Ecstatic Dance classes on a weekly basis in Rochester, creating a safe space to move through and support this healing journey. Check the Workshops page for more info on weekly dance classes! For the past 5 years, Taegan has been studying Ancestral lineage healing & ceremonial practices under various teachers, within both Native North and South American traditions. These philosophies of healing have been deeply influential to Taegan's approach to healing, specifically in regards to energy medicine and ceremonial practice. Taegan believes that Life is Ceremony, and we have the opportunity each day to usher ourselves across thresholds of healing and learning. The experiences of our life are the raw materials for these levels of initiation into deeper growth & wisdom, and Ceremony creates a container to deepen that process. Her work is deeply influenced by the work of Dr. Daniel Foor, who she is currently studying under through Ancestral Medicine. Taegan is currently in Cohort 7 of the Ancestral Medicine Practitioner Training program, learning how to facilitate deeper connection between individuals and their healthy, healed ancestors. Western and Vedic Astrology are a personal passion of Taegan's; she has studied under various teachers over the past decade. Using Astrology as a tool to give context + guidance as we maneuver life's initiations can be extremely supportive. These tools are used when necessary, to offer further insight and support in the process of healing. Taegan is also versed in Astro-Herbalism, which offers further insight as to how to address the needs of each individual, through herbal + astrological support. Taegan has also completed various certifications in Somatic Therapy, through a practitioner training led by Embodied Philosophy and the Embody Lab. The field of Somatics offers frameworks of healing that reconnect the relationship between Mind + Body. Somatic healing is an emergent way of counseling that incorporates all aspects of healing, from the physical to the spiritual, emotional, and psychological well being of each individual. This work has been revolutionary in Taegan's path, and rests at the heart of her practice. All of these practices have supported Taegan in her personal journey, as she recognizes no parts can be left behind in the name of truly holistic healing. The intention of VAYA's practice is to create a unique system of healing that works for your unique needs, while supporting and strengthening the connection to mind, body, and soul.
