Watching the 'Food Matters' film helped me turn my life around & I'm forever grateful.

We have created the Clean Eating Program to be 100% inclusive, so you can choose from our Classic (includes small amounts of fish), Vegetarian, and Vegan meal plan options. We're not about removing entire food groups, but this meal plan will help you to reduce some of those inflammatory foods containing dairy, wheat, gluten, and refined sugars. While this program isn't a 'diet', removing inflammatory food groups and reducing your intake of any processed foods will help your body burn fat more effectively. To reap the full benefits of the Clean Eating Program, we recommend abstaining from alcohol for 21 days. We strongly recommend reducing your daily coffee intake to no more than one (and drinking preferably black coffee). Each recipe can be made in less than 30 minutes (and some will take you less than 10 minutes). Many meals can be prepared the night before or at the start of the week to save time. While organic isn't 100% necessary, we do encourage you to buy organic where possible.
