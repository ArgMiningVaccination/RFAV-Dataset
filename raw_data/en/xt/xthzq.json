It is defined as the presence of functional endometrium (the internal cellular lining of the uterus), insights other than the uterus. It is of 2 types- external and internal. External refers to endometriosis of any part of the body except the myometrium (muscular wall of the uterus). Although evidence has been presented that subtle endometriotic lesions are a normal physiological condition occurring intermittently in all women. But normally these extra growths are destroyed by our immune response, whereas in endometriosis this mechanism fails. Endometriosis also makes conception harder for some women. According to Ayurvedic physiology, Arava (the reproductive apparatus along with the menstrual blood and the ovum) is formed from the Rasa Dhatu (the first tissue formed after digestion and metabolism). When the food habits are faulty like an excessive indulgence is heavy, fried, oily, or too dry food, incompatible foods like fruits with milk, excessive junk food, non-vegetarian dominant or dairy dominant food, overeating, etc, the metabolism is hampered leading to inflammation and formation of endotoxins in the Rasa Dhatu, which is passed on to the Arava too. [Can I Get Pregnant With Endometriosis?](https://www.fertilitydost.com/articles/article-details/can-i-get-pregnant-with-endometriosis) Other contributing factors are sedentary lifestyle, habitual constipation, suppression of natural urges like urination, defecation, etc, excessive stress, environmental factors, and drug abuse leading to endotoxins or toxic metabolite formation which leads to improper nutrition as well as an altered immune response in the reproductive system overall leading to excessive endometrial growth and weak ovum or egg. The overall sustained toxicity in the tissues over time leads to these endometrial growths to implant in the other areas outside of the uterine cavity making conception difficult. There is a retrograde menstrual spill (reversed flow of menstrual blood) due to dysfunction in the normal movement of Vata dosha. The Ayurveda treatment is based on the state and stage of the disease. The three types of lesions namely peritoneal lesions, endometrial lesions (chocolate cysts), and Rectovaginal nodule have to be treated differently. Various Treatment protocols are adopted to neutralize the endotoxins with an appropriate scientific nutrition schedule. Fasting, lighter meals, bitter ingredients are added to the diet. Medications to improve metabolism, reduce inflammation, and balance the Vata dosha are given judiciously. Later altered immune response is corrected by 'medicated ghee' given internally. Treatment procedures like Uttar Basti are useful in Vata dysfunctions or to regulate pain. The format of the dietary regimen includes the following: [Despite Low AMH I Conceived Naturally With Holistic Fertility Management](https://www.fertilitydost.com/articles/article-details/despite-low-amh-i-conceived-naturally-with-holistic-fertility-management) Completely avoid- milk and milk products like milk, buttermilk, casein, curds, yogurt, mayonnaise, khoa, milk drinks, lassi, ice creams, desserts, butter, cheese, etc. Avoid all forms of deep-fried items.
