Summary In 2018 the total sales of medicines amounted to 19.5 billion NOK (AIP), of which 1 billon was veterinary medicines. Sales of medicines for human use increased by 3.1% in 2018. The cost in 2018 given in AIP corresponds to around 29 billion NOK in estimated retail prices (AUP). Total sales, measured in the number of defined daily doses (DDD) increased by 0.7 % in 2018 . The increase in sale measured in DDD has been relatively stable over time . Prescription only medicines and non -prescription (OTC) medicines accounted for 92% and 8% respectively of total sales of human medicines in NOK (AIP) in 2018 . OTC medi cines accounted for approximately 11 % of to tal sales in doses (DDD) in 2018. ATC group L - Antineoplastic and immunomodulati ng agents continues to be the largest group in terms of costs and accounted f or 27% of the total cost in 2018 . The co st increase in this group was 4% in 2018. This group includes cancer medicines and biolo gical medicines used in the treatment of for example rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis . Figure 2 on page 22 show s the trend in the total sales of human medicines in terms of cost (NOK, AIP) and in number of DDDs. The cost increase has over time been higher than the increase in number of DDDs. Increased prices and more expensive medicines have influenced the cost increase. Changes in currencies has also influenced the cost level. Changes in the population with increasing share of elderly people has also contributed to the increasing use of medicines. Introduction The report Drug Consumption in Norway has been published annually since 1977. The ATC statistical chapters are only partly translated into English. ATC codes are included for all the substances in order to increase the understanding. A list of ATC and DDD alterations valid from 1 January 201 9 is included on p. 87. 8 Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet \u00c5ret edition incl udes data for the period 2014-2018. The figures are based on sales from all drug wholesalers in Norway and include sales of medicines which are sold from non -pharmacy outlets. The statistic includes total sales of medicines in Norway, i.e. both prescriptio n only and non-prescription medicines. Requests regarding the statistics can be forwarded by email to lmfin@fhi.no. Data source According to the regulation (chapter V ) all wholesalers are required to report the total sales of medicines in Norway . Data are reported to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) on a monthly basis. The NIPH is responsible for the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics . The wholesalers report sales per article number both cost (pharmacy retail prices (AIP)) and quantity in number of packages. The data in this report include total sales of medicinal products with marketing authorization (MT) in Norway. Sales of medicines without MT in Norway are included when this would influence the total figures . In the latest years, drug shortages have become an increasing problem both in Norway and in other European countries. In Norway the Norwegian Medicines Agency has given permission to use similar medicines without marketing authorization in Norway to reduce the shortage problem s. The re are various reasons behind t he wholesalers' delivery problems. When medicines without MA in Norway is included in the data this is given in tables in this report. Drug statistics using wholesales data are important basis for medical and health economic asse ssments. The statistics can be used to: - monitor trends in drug use over time at various levels and therapeutic areas - measure the effect of regulatory changes and informational efforts - define needs for further monitoring of use Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 has some limitations also. It should be emphasised that sales from wholesalers are not necessarily equal to what is actually consumed. The source of the data should always be considered when interpreting and evaluating drug use and the ne cessary limitations should be included in the conclusions. Information regarding the use of the ATC /DDD methodology is included below. Reading these chapters would give a better understanding of the data presented in this report. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system The statistical tables are sorted according to the ATC classification system, and the Defined Daily Dose are used as the unit of measurement. In the ATC system the drug substances are classified into group s at 5 different levels. The drugs are divided into 14 main groups (1st level), then further divided into pharmacological/therapeutic subgroups (2nd level). The 3rd and 4th levels are chemical/pharmacological/therapeutic subgroups and the 5th level is th e chemical substance. The ATC code A complete classification of spironolactone with the ATC code C03DA01 illustrates the structure of the ATC system: C Cardiovascular system (1st level, anatomical main group) C03 Diuretics (2nd level, therapeutic subgroup) . C03D Potassium -sparing agents (3rd level, pharmacological antagonists (4th level, pharmacological subgroup) C03DA01 niv\u00e5), tall for de ulike undergruppene (2., 3. og 4. niv\u00e5) og ned til som viser er benyttet i rapporten. WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology I 1982 opprettet WHO et koordineringssenter ved NMD i Oslo, WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology med tilknytning til WHOs Europakontor i K\u00f8benhavn. med medlemmer fra 12 ulike land. Fra 2002 har senteret lokalisert ved Folkehelseinstituttet. Prinsippene DDD er n\u00e6rmere beskrevet i publikasjonen Guidelines for ATC classification and DDD assignment 201 9, Oslo 201 8. Denne ) are assigned the code C03DA01. The ATC classification system makes it possible to compile drug statistics on 5 different levels, that is, figures showing total consumption of all prod ucts classified in main group C - Cardiovascular system (1st level), figures for the various subgroups (2nd, 3rd and 4th levels), and down to figures showing consumption of each active ingredient. The ATC code for all pharmaceuticals on the Norwegian market is included in the monographs of the national drug c atalogue Felleskatalogen. The ATC/DDD version valid from January 201 9 is used in this report . The WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology In 1982 the WHO Regional Office for Europe established a coordinating centre at NMD in Oslo; the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology . In May 1996 the Centre was attached to the WHO Headquarter in Geneva due to the increasing global use of the ATC/DDD system. The main tasks of the WHO Centre are to classify drugs according to the ATC system, assign Defined Daily Doses and to further develop the ATC/DDD system. This work is performed in close cooperation with a global expert group representing 12 different countries. As from 2002 the Centre has been located at the Norwegian Instit ute of Public Health. The principles of the ATC system and the DDD are further described in the publication Guidelines for ATC classification and DDD assignment 201 9, Oslo 2018. This publication is available on the website www.whocc.no The ATC Index with DDD s includes all assigned DDDs for plain products. The ATC/DDD Index can be ordered from the WHO Centre website. A searchable version of the index is also available on the website. Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet 11 M\u00e5leenheter Definert et preparater der of measurement The Defined Daily Dose (DDD) Prices change with time, prices differ between alternative preparations and between countries. Statistics based on currency is hence difficult to assess. Other quantities, independent of price changes and changing exchange rates, may offer a better basis for professional evaluations. But, when using quantities such as number of tablets, number of packages etc., comparisons between different drugs used alternatively on the same indications, will often not be possible. The use of DDDs as units of measurement offers better possibilities for comparisons between alternative medicinal products, independent of price differences. The evaluation of drug consumption over time, nationally and internationally, is s implified and improved by the use of DDDs. A DDD is defined as the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used on its main indication in adults . The DDDs are determined on the basis of evaluation of international use of the substance in ques tion, bearing in mind that national therapy traditions (indications, dosages) often differ greatly. Each DDD should therefore be regarded as a technical measuring unit. Drugs used for more than one indication are a challenge. For antipsychotics (N05A) t he doses used in psychoses and not the lower dose used in the treatment of neuroses, are chosen as the basis for assignment of the DDDs. With the exception of some specific paediatric products, adult dosages are used. The DDD for a substance will often b e one and the same, irrespective of the route of administration. Drugs with different bio - availabilities for different routes of administrations may, however, have more than one DDD, each of them linked to a specific dosage form. For products where a boo ster dose is followed by a smaller maintenance dosage, the maintenance dose will form the basis for the DDD. Whenever possible, the DDD is indicated as the quantity of active substance. When this is impossible, as is the case with combination products an d some liquid products, the DDD is given as the number of unit doses (no of tablets, millilitres etc.). 12 et The DDDs are not necessarily the most frequently prescribed or used doses. This must be considered when evaluating the data. Accordingly it will often be difficult to estimate the number of users by using the DDD as the measuring unit. The sales figures are given as the number of DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day, calculated as follows: Total consumption measured in DDDs x 1000 3651) x number of inhabitants This figure offers an estimation of what proportion of the population that may receive a certain drug treatment. An estimated drug consumption of 10 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day corresponds to a daily use of this drug by 1% of the population. This estimate is, however, only valid if there is good correlation between the DDD and the actual consumed dose. For some drug groups mainly used during shorter periods, a presentation of the sales data as the number of DDDs/inhabitant/year may be more convenient. An estimated sale of 5 DDDs/inhabitant/year will indicate that each inhabitant may undergo a treatment o f 5 days duration. If the standard treatment lasts 7 days, one may alternatively estimate the number of 7 - day courses by dividing the total number of sold DDDs by the course duration. The DDDs used in this report are for most plain products (one active ingredient ) indicated in adjacent bracket s for the respective ATC code. List of DDDs for fixed combination products is available on www.whocc.no . For some substances the sale is too low to be given in the statistics . This will be indicated as e.g. 0.00 or 0.0. 1) 366 dager ved skudd\u00e5r / 366 days in leap year Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet 13 Kroner Omsetningstallene som apotek Costs in Norwegian currency (NOK) Sales from the wholesalers are reported in pharmacy purchase prices (AIP). AIP is used in the tables in the introduction chapter (e.g. table 1, 2 and figure 2). The calculation of the estimated pharmacy retail price is based on the invoiced pharmacy purchase price with the addition of the pharmac y margin including fees and VAT (i.e. using the Norwegian Medicines Agency price formula in the calculation of the app roved maximum retail price). This estimated costs may deviate from real retail costs especially in groups where lower prices have been achieved for drugs used in hospitals or where the pharmacy purchase prices are lower than the approved maximum purchase p rices. In these cases, the real pharmacy retail costs may be higher than the estimated pharmacy retail costs (AUP) presented in this report . In earlier editions tables included estimated retail cost has been included in the different ATC groups. These tables have been excluded in this report. In the current issue only the total sales of human medicines is given i n estima ted retail prices (AUP) (table 3). For prescription medicines, the actual costs can be retrieved from the NorPD ( www.norpd.no ). There is no price regulation of non -prescription medicines in Norway and it is therefore difficult to estimate the OTC sales in terms of pharmacy retail prices. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has no information of the actual retail prices for OTC medicines. The retail prices (AUP) for OTC medicines are estimated by using the purchase prices multiplied with a factor of 2.1. Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) The Norwegian Prescription database (NorPD) is situated at the Norwegian Instit ute of Public Health. NorPD includes prescribing information at Legemiddelstatistikk utviklingen i salget av humane legemidler fra 1999 -2018 i kroner (AIP) og i doser (DDD). Figur 1 og 2 viser at kostnadsveksten i perioden 2007 - 2013 var relativt lav, mens det i 2014 til 2017 e omtrent samme niv\u00e5 som 2013. the individual patient level from all Norwegian pharmacies and data is available from 2004 . NorPD offers more detailed information about the prescription only medicines in the population (i.e. age and sex distribution) . More information regarding the NorPD is available at the website www.norpd.no . A separate report from NorPD is also published once annually. Data from the NorPD will give the actual cost in pharmacy retail prices of prescription only medicines . Comments to the statistics Cost In 2018, the total sales of medicinal products with marketing authorisation in Norway totalled 19.5 billion NOK (AIP), incl. 1 billion for veterinary medicines (table 1 ). The estimated total retail costs (AUP) was around 29 billion NOK in 2018. In order to reduce reimbursement costs, changes in price regulations have been introduced in Norway. The graded price model is a stepwise price reduction when generic alternatives are marketed. This regulation has reduced the cost increase. The funding of several medicines has in the latest years been transferred from the National I nsurance to be financed by the Health Trust institutions. This includes expensive medicines for the treatment of e.g. cancer, rheumatic diseases, HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and orphan medicines. For medicines financed by the Health Trust institutions, the prices are negotiated to minimise the cost. Figure 1 shows the annual changes in the sales in the period 2007 -2018. Figure 2 shows the sale of human medicines from 1999 -2018 in Norwegian currency (AIP) and in DDDs. Figure 1 and 2 shows that the annual cost increase was relatively s table in the period 2007 -2013, and that the cost increase was relatively higher in the period from 2014- 2017. This cost increase may be explained by increasing use of new expensive medicines, but changes in currency exchange rates may also have influenced the cost . In 2018, the cost increase was at the same level as in 2013.

The sales according to ATC main groups are given in table 1 page 20 . Sales in defined daily dose s (DDDs) The sales volume measured in number of DDDs increased by 0 .7% in 2018. Sale in DDDs has been relatively constant the latest 10 year period (see figure 1 and 2). Sales according to prescription categor ies In 2018, prescription only medicines (POM) and non-prescription med icines (OTC) have a share of 92% and 8 % respectively of total cost (AIP). OTC medicines account ed for 11 % of total sales measured in DDDs in 2018. The total sales of OTC medicines in 2018 amounted to around 1.5 billion NOK (AIP, table 2) and this represent an increase of approximately 3% compared to 2017. The total sales measured in DDDs for O TC med icines decreased about 11 % from 2017 to 2018. A selection of vitamin products are no longer classified as drugs, but as dietary supplem ents, and thi s is the main reason for the reduction in DDD sales in ATC group A . Dietary supplements is not included in the statistics. Turnover per ATC group The 2018 sales per ATC main group measured in million DDDs and in million NOK, pharmacy purchase price (AIP) are shown in table 1 (p. 20). ATC group L - Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents accounted for 27 % of total cost in 2018 and is the largest group in terms of cost. The cost increase was 3 .9% compared to 2017. ATC group L includes high cost medicines for use in cancer treatment and biological medicines for the treatment of e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Introduction of \u00abbiosimilars\u00bb for some agents has reduced cost. In addition, achieved price reductions for prescrip tion medicines financed by the Health Trust institutions have also contributed to minimise the cost. The top selling 20 medicines in ATC group L had a total sale of around 3 billion NOK (AIP) in 2018, which 16 Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet minske De 20 samlet omsetning over 3 milliarder kroner (AIP) 2018 og utgj\u00f8r 61 % av salget i gruppen i 2018.

ATC group N - Nervous system is the second largest group in term of sales in NO K (AIP), and accounted for 13.4% of total cost in 2018 (table 1). Measured in DDDs the sale was unchanged in 2018 compared to 2017. The sale of anxiolytic s, sedatives and hypnotic s has gradually decreased during the latest 10 years ( see figure p 73). The sale of benzodia zepines (N05BA and N05CD) and benzodiazepine related drugs (z -hypnotics, N05CF) has decreased 29% from 2009 to 2018, while sale of melatonin has increased almost three fold during the same period. Benzodiazepines and z -hypnotics is addictive drugs. Melatoni n is a natural hormone used to regulate the circadian rhythms . Melatonin has few side effects and has no addictive potential . In 2014, The Norwegian Directorate of Health published national guidelines for prescribing and use of potentially addictive medici nes. Increased focus on optimal use, introduction of electronic prescribing and new driver`s licence regulations, may also have contributed to the sales reduction of benzodiazepines and z -hypnotics. ATC group A - Alimentary tract and metabolism is the third largest group in terms of cost in NOK (AIP), and the second largest group measured in DDDs. The total cost for this group increased by 7 .7 % compared to 2017. Drugs used in diabetes (A10) accounted for 40 % of the total costs in ATC group A, and the cost increase fo r drugs used in diabetes was 11 %. Increasing use of new medicines for treatment of diabetes, including use of fixed combinations, has contributed to the increase. In 2018, the total sale in ATC group A reduced by 4 % measured in DDDs compared to 2017. This reduction is mainly due to the new regulation of vitamins from November 2015, when many vitamins earlier classified as medicinal products were changed to be regulated as dietary supplements . Sales of dietary supplements is not includ ed in the statistics. ATC group C - Cardiovascular system is the largest group in term of sales in DDDs (table 1). Reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases is important. Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet 17 forhold til 2017. Kostnadene har g\u00e5tt ned for man ge av legemidlene i gruppe C (f.eks. ATC C08, C09 DDD \u00f8kte med vel 6 % i 2018 (se figur side 40).

In 2018, sale of medicines in ATC group C was relatively stable compared to 2017, measured both in number of DDDs and NOK. For many medicines in ATC group C (e.g. ATC C08, C09 and C10) the cost has been reduced over time due to the introduction of pricing/reimbursement regulations . In 2018, the sales of lipid modifying agents increased by 6 % measured in DDDs (s ee figure p. 40). The sale of ezetimibe, including combinations of ezetimibe and statins, increased by 36% in 2018 compared t o 2017. Atorvastatin is the top selling statin and the sale is nearly threefold from 2009 to 2018. Reduction in sales of antibacterial agents for systemic use (J01) . In 2018 there was a 4% reduction in sales measured in DDDs of antibacterials. There has been a gradually decline from 2012. The national action plan against antibiotic resistance in health care aims to reduce the use of antibiotics by 30% from 2012 to the end of 2020. If the decline in sales of antibacterials continues also in the next years, the goal of the action plan would be reached. Sale of non -prescription medicines (OTC) Table 4, p. 23 shows the sales of top selling OTC medicines in 2014 - 2018. The table includes medicines that is available also in non -pharmacy outlets. Measured in DDDs the total s ales of drugs included in table 4a increased by 1 % in 2018. The proportions of sales in non -pharmacy outlets were almost unchanged in 2018 compared to 2017 (table 4b). The medicines included in table 4a accounted for around 50% of the total turnover of OT C medicines in terms of cost (AIP), while they accounted for 97% of the total sales of medicines in non -pharmacy outlets. Analgesics Sales of OTC paracetamol measured in DDD, has been relatively constant over time, in 2018 the sale increased by 1%. Non -pharmacy outlets accounted for 55%, of the sale and this is unchanged compared to 2017 (table 4) . In 2018, the total sale was 9. 3 billion packages, this 18 Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet innbygger 3 viser ibuprofen i redusert med 6 % i 2018, mens totalt salg av ibuprofen ble red usert med 5 \u00f8kte 70 kombinasjon % (7400 doser) av det totale salget av correspond to OTC sale of around two packages of 20 tablets per inhabitant. Total sales of paracetamo l (prescription and OTC) increased by 5% in 2018. Figure 3 shows the trend in total sales of paracetamol in the period 2004 - 2018. Sale of prescription packages of paracetamol continues to increase, while OTC packages account for a decreasing share of the total sale of paracetamol. In 2018, OTC packages accounted for a share of 34 % of total sales of paracetamol. Increased prescribing of paracetamol for treatment of chronic pain, which may also be reimbursed, have probably contributed to the increased sale of prescription packages. Total number of DDDs for OTC formulati ons of ibuprofen decreased by 6 % in 2018 while the total sales of ibuprofen decreased by 5 %. The OTC sales of ibupr ofen in terms of DDDs was 54% of the total sale. This proportion has b een relatively stable over time (table 4b ). Nasal decongestants The sale of nasal decongestants xylometazoline) has be en increasing over time . The sales measured in DDDs increased by 2% in 2018. For the most common used nasal decongestant s, which contains xylometazolin e, the share in non -pharmacy outlets have gradually increase d, and in 2018 the share was 70 %. The proportion of sale in non -pharmacy outlets of the combination product of xylometazoline and ipratropiumbromid (R01AB06) was 32% in 2018 (table 4b). Nicotine replacement products The sale of nicotine replacement products has gradually increased. I n 2018, the sale increased by 2%. The non -pharmacy share has gradually increased since 2003 when it was allowed to sell these products i n non -pharmacy out lets. In 2018, the share was 50 % (table 4b). Emergency contraceptives 117 730 doses in total were sold in 2018 of emergency contraceptives, a reduction by 4% since 2017. The share of sale in non -pharm acy has been limited since the s ale of emergency contraceptives outside pharmacy was allowed in 2009. In 2018, the sale in non -pharmacy outlets Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet i g\u00e5tt med run dt 29 % i perioden 2009 -2018. Mens salget av n\u00f8dprevensjon som hormonspiraler og p -stav g\u00e5tt opp (se side 45). Dette er ut fra 2015, og fra 2017 til 2018 ser vi en reduksjon p\u00e5 om lag 3 % (se figur side 45). Bidragsordningen for \u00f8konomisk st\u00f8tte til prevensjonsmidler apotek fiskeoppdrett. accounted for only 6 % (7400 doses) of the total sale. In total, the sale of emergency contraceptives measured in DDDs has decreased by around 29 % during the period 2009 -2018. While the sale of emergency contraceptives have decreased, the sale of long acting contraceptives such as hormone releasing intra -uterine devices (IUD) and hormone implants have increased (see figure page 45 ). This reflects the recommendations from the authorities that more young women should be offered long acting contraceptives. Sales of oral contraceptive s have levelled off since 2015 and from 2017 to 2018 the sale reduced by 3% (see figure page 45). Alter ed reimbursement regulation was implemented in 2015 including also long acting contracept ives in young women . In 2016, an extension of the nurses and midwife s prescribing to include also long acting contraceptives was introduced. Better profiles of contrac eptive use may have contributed to the reduced sale of emergency contraceptives. Selection of medicines in non- pharmacy outlets Retail sale for some nicotine replacement medicines was allowed outside pharmacies from January 2003. From November 2003 this regulation was extended to include a selection of other OTC medicines (e.g. paracetamol, ibuprofen and xylometazoline) according to a list issued by the Norwegian Medicines Agency. The list of medicines allowed for sale in non -pharmacy outlets has been ex tended over time. However, the non -pharmacy outlets still sell only a limited number of top selling OTC drugs. Veterinary medicines Sales in ATC group Q - Veteri nary medicines increased by 1.6 % in 2018. This group includes vaccines and most agents used in fish farming. 20 Legemiddelstatistikk 2019 :1Folkehelseinstituttet Tabell 1.
