This year The Christie was delighted to play a major role in celebrating the 70th birthday of the NHS. Of course The Christie itself has a significant history of pioneering cancer treatment, research and education and has been at the forefront of cancer care for more than 100 years. Events like this are important. Not only do they allow us to celebrate and reflect on our achievements over the years, they are also a key driver in our continued strive for excellence. We can't help but be proud of our history, but it is vital we use that history to inspire us to pursue innovation and progression in our aim to provide world class care and treatment for all our patients. We know there is always more we c an do. This year, having successfully achieved what we set out to do in our 2020 Vision strategy two years early, our new five year strategy was introduced, outlining our ambition to grow services even more for the benefit of our patients. We went through an extensive process of consultation and engagement over the course of 12 months, adapting our original plans to embrace our vision for a truly world- class cancer centre. O ur strategy remains focused on four key themes; Leading cancer care, The Christie experience, Local and specialist care, and Best outcomes. And we work hard to ensure everything we do is focussed on achieving our goals in these areas . We have some wonderful exampl es this year of our progression. Most notably, we were privileged to open the NHS's first high -energy proton beam therapy centre . The trea tment we are now providing will make a huge difference to patients who previously had to travel abroad for this specialist form of radiotherapy. As well as continuing to develop our main s ite in Withington, The Christie also remains committed to promoting care closer to home for as many patients as possible. This year we continued to expand our chemotherapy outreach provision with a new service in Winsford in Cheshire . We also announced ou r plans to build a new Christie cancer centre in Macclesfield, allowing thousands of patients in the East Cheshire catchment area to benefit from chemotherapy , radiotherapy and other services far closer to home. Our charity will play an important role in this project which we hope will open during 2021. We were also delighted to mark the completion of a brand new \u00a37m outpatient facility at The Christie, which offers a more accessible, spacious and comfortable environment for the 95,000 appointments that t ake place there each year. Fully funded by The Christie charity, it aims to offer patients a more seamless experience with more consultation rooms, improved access to testing facilities and a new appointment system with self- check- in screens that will help to reduce patient waiting times and increase capacity. The Christie is well known for many world -firsts which have advanced cancer treatment on a global scale. We have an excellent reputation as an international leader in research and innovation, which i s further strengthened by being a partner in the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) and this year our plans to build a new research centre to replace the Paterson building have been further developed. The number of clinical trials that are recruitin g patients at The Christie has increased by 11 per cent in the last year , with more than 1800 patients benefitting from the latest treatments available. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) acknowledges that The Christie remains one of the mos t active NHS clinical research organisations in the UK, reflecting our vibrant research culture . These studies not only have the potential for improving outcomes for Chair and Chief Executive's statement 6Chair and Chief Executive's statement those patients taking part, they also enrich our understanding of cancer and benefit patients in the future. Above all, o ur biggest commitment at The Christie is to put patients at the heart of everything we do and to ensure we provide the highest quality care and treatment with very real patient benefits. Our performance in national surveys and the positive feedback we receive from our patients continues to be a source of pride and encouragement. 2018- 09 saw The Christie once again rated Outstanding by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), making us the first specialist trust in the country to be given its highest accolade twice. The CQC described The Christie as 'a leader in cancer care' and a pioneer in developing innovative solutions to cancer care'. It also praised the positive culture, our compassionate and effective leadership, and our exce ptionally kind and caring staff who 'go the extra mile ' to meet the needs of patients and their families. The rating is the highest we could have been given and is testament to the dedicated, expert staff in every Christie department who work tirelessly t o give the very best care and treatment to our patients. N one of our achievements would be possible without our staff, partners, governors, members, volunteers, charity, patients and so many others we work with across Greater Manchester and Cheshire, as well as nationally and internationally. W e thank you for your continued support, commitment and dedication in our goal to provide the very best care for our patients, and to develop treatments that will transform cancer care for patients for many years t o come. C hristine Outram Chairman R oger Spencer Chief Executive 7The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 At The Christie, we are proud of our history at the forefront of cancer care for more than a century, but we are even more proud of our forward thinking nature and our desire to constantly innovate and develop our services for the benefits of patients. W e continue to lead the way in cancer care, research and education and remain committed to helping all those affected by cancer, both now and in the future. We are the largest single site cancer centre in Europe treating m ore than 44,000 patients a year and the first UK centre to be accredited as a comprehensive cancer centre. As part of the NHS , we provide radiotherapy in one of the world's largest radiotherapy departments and at our local centres in Oldham and Salford. We are also home to the UK's largest brachytherapy service. We deliver chemotherapy treatment through the largest chemotherapy unit in the UK, as well as via 10 other sites, our mobile chemotherapy unit and in patients' homes. We also provide prostate cancer community clinics at five different locations. We provide highly specialist surgery for complex and rare cancers and a wide range of support and diagnostic services. And this year, we became the first NHS organisation in the UK to deliver high energy proton beam therapy, providing untold benefits to hundreds of patients nationally who would have previously been treated with this highly specialist form of radiotherapy overseas. The Christie School of Oncology provides undergraduate education and clinical professional and medical education - the first of its kind in the UK. We serve a population of 3.2 million people across Greater Manchester and Cheshire while more than a quarter of our patients are referred to us from across the UK. This year we were once again rated Outstanding by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), becoming the first specialist trust in the country to be given its highest accolade twice, and warmly described by the CQC as 'a leader in cancer care' and 'pioneers in developing innovative solutions to cancer care.' We have a number of component parts to our structure which includes The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, The Christie Charity and The Christie Pharmacy Company (a wholly owned subsidiary providing pharmacy dispensing services to the Trust) . We are also a partner in two joint venture entities ; The Christie Private Care, a joint venture partnership with HCA (HCA International Limited) for the provision of private oncology activity and The Christie Pathology Partnership where we partner with Synlab UK to deliver oncology pathology services. We are ranked as the most technologically advanced cancer centre in the world outside North America, and have been named, by the National Institute for Health Research, as one of the best hospitals providing opportunities for patients to take part in clinical research studies. We are part of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) working with The University of Manchester and Cancer Research UK. The MCRC partnership provides the integrated approach essential to turn research findings in the laboratory into better, more effective treatments for patients. Building on Manchester's strong heritage in cancer research, the MCRC provides outstanding facilities where scientists, doctors and nurses can work closely together. About us 8Our performance We are also one of seven partners in the Manchester Academic Health Science Research Centre. We share a common goal of giving patients and clinicians rapid access to the latest research discoveries, and improving the quality and effectiveness of patient care. There are only six health science centres in the country. Glo bally, The Christie is recognised as a leader in providing high quality patient -centred cancer care and has become increasingly influential internationally. During the year we retained our international designation as a Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Excellence and also joined the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) in its ambition to reduce the global cancer burden. Our experts are in demand to provide advice to cancer develop ments across the world and during 2018- 19 have worked with Cork University Hospital (Eire) to help create a new radiotherapy centre and have been chosen to provide advice on the cancer care element of a new hospitals development in China. Th e Christie i s home to a Lord Norman Foster designed Maggie's Centre which is based on our site and offers emotional and practical support to our patients and their families. Run by the Maggie's charity, it is the first of its kind in the North West. O ur charity is one of the largest NHS charities in the UK, providing enhanced services over and above what the NHS funds. It has over 50,000 supporters who helped raise \u00a313.9m this year. A ll of our achievements and successes are only possible due to our dedicated and sp ecialist staff, hardworking volunteers, generous and loyal supporters and fundraisers and our interested and enthusiastic public members, all bringing with them a wealth of experience, knowledge and understanding. Th e key issues and risks that could affect us as a Foundation Trust in delivering our objectives are managed on a monthly basis through our board assurance framework which can be viewed in our public board papers available on our website . More detail relating to the key risks in 2018 -19 are set out in the Annual Governance Statement on page 205 of this report. O ur overall performance in 201 8-19 has been excellent and we have continued to deliver the 31 day referral to treatment target . Our 62 day cancer waiting time performance has not been achieved following changes to the reporting mechanism. T he Christie is one of only eight specialist trusts in England deemed to have maximum autonomy and no potential support needs by NHS Improvement. This places us in the top 15% of NHS providers in th e country. R oger Spencer Chief Executive 23rd May 2019 9The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 We have delivered m ajor servi ce improvements during the year and we have dedicated significant investment to support the development of cutting edge radiotherapy. Our radiotherapy department has continued with its tradition of supporting innovation and research in ensuring our patients have access to the latest equipment and treatments as well as access to the latest clinical trials. We have two other radiotherapy centres in Oldham and Salford ; the Salford centre also offers a specialist stereotactic rad iosurgery service which is used to treat small malignant and benign brain and spine lesions, providing a highly specialist state of the art service to Greater Manchester and Cheshire . Radiotherapy fractions Almost seven and a half thousand patients have been treated with radiotherapy during 201 8/19 which eq uates to over 104,000 treatments , delivered over our three sites . Equipment provision We have ten linear ac celerators (or linacs) at our Withington site, with two l inear accelerators at our Salford site and two at Oldham as part of our strategy to treat patients closer to home. During the year we have replaced one linear accelerator on our Withington site, completing the current phase of the replacement programme and ensuring that all linacs on this site are capable of volumetric intensity modulated radiotherapy . The replacement lin ear ac celerator has a higher technological capability including the ability to deliver Flattening Filter F ree (FFF) radiation beams . The upgrades have seen the total numb er of FFF -enabled lin ear accelerators increase to seven out of nine . This technology provides larger dose treatments that cannot be delivered traditionally. During 201 8-19 we continue d the introduction of a method of reducing the dose of radiation deliver ed to the heart and its associated arteries during breast radiotherapy. Deep Inspiration Breath -Hold (DIBH) has the potential to reduce long term adverse events. The treatment is now routinely delivered with four linear accelerators capable of this treatme nt. The Trust has used this technology innovatively to develop a method of using the DIBH technique in patients with lymphomas in appropriate disease sites . Radiotherapy 10Radiotherapy Technique improvement As older models of linear accelerators have been phased out on our Withington site, capacity for improved treatment techniques have increased. This has seen the use of Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiotherapy (VMAT) increase and offered to additional patient groups. The rolling linac replacement programme has seen the removal of wedged -based radiotherapy techniques at our Withington site so that all appropriate curative patients are now offered intensity modulated radiotherapy. The stereotactic radiotherapy programme has expanded during 2018 -19. In addition to lung, spine and liver Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR), T he Christie now offers SABR for adrenal, lymph nodes and bone disease. Magnetic Resonance (MR) linear ac celerator The radiotherapy service includes a prototype MR-guided linear accelerator. The MR -linear accelerator offers the possibility of advancing radiotherapy to enable us to deliver more targeted and more personalised radiotherapy for patients. The Christie is part of the Atlantic Consortium consisting of clinical, academic and industrial partners in four countries to research the use of MR -guided radiotherapy and move it from a development stage to clinical implementation. Significant training activity has been undertaken to upskill staff on this novel treatment device that includes the precision treat ment of a linac with the enhanced imaging capabilities of a magnetic resonance imager. This is one of only twelve in the world . As a marker of the role of The Christie in this project , Manchester was chosen to host an Atlantic Consortium scientific and t echnical conference in 2018. The first patient treatment is expected in the first quarter of 2019 -20. Magnetic Resonance (MR) linear accelerator Proton beam therapy centre The Christie has opened the first of two proton beam therapy centres as part of a n ational proton beam therapy service. Having received handover of the building in early 2018, the first patients were imaged in the new centre mid -year and the first patient was treated in December. Working with our partners at UCLH , the Department of Health and Manchester Foundation Trust, we have continued to lead the patient pathway design process. The number of patients being treated is increasing as planned paving the way for the repatriation to the UK of all proton beam treatment s once t he second national unit opens in London. 11The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Christie Medical Physics & Engineering (CMPE) is a division of the T rust providing physics and engineering expertise for treatment and research at The Christie and has been established for over 70 years. We provide peripatetic services to other NHS t rusts throughout the North West region and have groups of clinical scientists, technologists and engineers in the Manchester Foundation Trust at Wythenshawe Hospital and The Christie centres in Oldham and Salford. Our role spans service delivery, requiring t he application of scientific skills and judgement, and original research driving innovation and furthering knowledge. We are organised into several operational groups supported by general management, central administration and mechanical engineering workshop facilities. The operational groups based at The Christie are radiotherapy physics, i maging physics and radiation protection and n uclear medicine. The Radiotherapy Physics group supports clinical radiotherapy services at The Christie and at our Oldham and Salford centres. The medical engineering group is based at The Christie and in the Manchester Foundation Trust site at Wythenshawe to provide medical engineering services. The Imaging p hysics and r adiation protection group include the speciali st areas of diagnostic x - ray imaging, radiation protection, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and optical radiation. The group supports activities at The Christie and also provides scientific support services to many hospitals in the N orth West and other private healthcare organisations locally and nationally. The nuclear medicine group provides diagnostic nuclear medicine, PET -CT and molecular radiotherapy services at The Christie. Research and development in th ese areas are carried out in collaboration with national, international and commercial partners. Through our regional radiopharmacy , we manufacture and provide radioactive tracers to The Christie and eight other nucle ar medicine departments in the North West. The group also provides scientific and regulatory advice to those departments and others. In 2017 , the group led a successful bid to NHS England to provide an expand ed network of PET-CT scanning in Greater Manchester which com menced on 1 st April 2019. On a wider level, the group provides m edical physics oversight to the national PET -CT contract provided by Alliance Medical Ltd. Christie Medical Physics and Engineering 12The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 201 8-19 With new targeted treatments and more treatment options available for patients diagnosed with cancer, the number of treatments we deliver is rising every year. In 2018- 19 we will have delivered over 70,000 treatments. Our service provides 50 treatment sp aces for solid tumour treatments with separate facilities for phase I and II clinical trials, h aematology and teenage and young adult o ncology. We also have an extensive outreach and home care service. A key part of our SACT strateg y has been to provid e more treatment closer to our patients' home s. The development of our outreach chemotherapy services ha s resulted in improved patient experience, a reduction in patient travel time and has released capacity on the main hospital site. Together with our own nurse led home service, we also deliver treatments in the following areas: Arden House m edical practice (New Mills) Bolton (Mobile u nit) Bury (Townside p rimary care centre) Leighton (Mid Cheshire) Macclesfield (East Cheshire) Oldham (Hospital site and mobile (Salford Royal) Develo pments during 2018-19 Expansion of the Christie at Home service including i ntravenous treatments. Opening of a new treatment facility at St Luke's Hospice in Winsford. Introduction of five local phlebotomy services . Implementation of nurse led oral SACT c linic. Implementation of the use of handheld devices for nursing staff on the treatment floor. Systemic Anti -Cancer Treatment service (SACT) 13The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Our directorate of surgery is a specialist tertiary surgical referral centre that concentrates on rare cancers, specialist procedures and multi - disciplinary cancer surgery. All of our specialties work as a single service in a network across populations ra nging from 1.5m to 25m. In most cases , our teams of surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and allied health care professionals work in a network across more than one hospital or community site. Surgery is an integral part of the comprehensive cancer centre. Working with all clinical groups allows for specialist multidisciplinary care of patients requiring multimodality the rapies to occur under one roof. Additionally , many patients undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy for their cancer may suffer from complications or side effects that require surgical opinions or management. We provide a crucial service to local, regional and national populations. Much of our work is based on rare and specialist cancers under the remit of specialised and highly specialised co mmissioning, whilst ensuring patients being treated non - surgically, within the comprehensive centre, are supported appropriately. The following specialties are represented within the directorate Colorectal and p eritoneal surgery Urological surgery Gynaec ological surgery Plastic surgery Our current services and populations served are summarised below: Rare cancers Anal 6 cancer : 1.5 million Specialist procedures Electro -chemotherapy: 3.2 million Intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy: 25 million Photodynamic therapy: 4 million Post -radiation and p ost-chemotherapy side effects requiring surgical management: 3.2 million Robotic surgery : 3.2 million ( urological, colorectal, gynaecological) Specialist abdominal wall reconstruction : 3.2 million Specialist diagnostics: 3.2 million (including multi- disciplinary cancer team (MDCT) approach, virtual MDCT, and template prostate biopsies) Multidisciplinary treatment We formed the UK's first MDCT, which has been functioning since 1970 and has grown significantly over the last three decades . The MDCT undertakes the management of specialist pelvic cancer and retro - peritoneal cancers and conditions including: Advanced and recurrent rectal, anal and colon cancers requiring combined chemo -radiation and multispecialty surgery, including perineal reconstruction. Advanced gynaecological malignancy requiring multispecialty surgery, including and cytoreductive surgery. Retroperitoneal / abdomino -pelvic sarcomas radiation and/or surgery. Melanoma requiring reconstruction, chemoth erapy and on rare occasions MDCT surgery. Prophylactic breast cancer surgery. A multidisciplinary approach to living with and beyond cancer: treating radiation and cancer induced fistulae, bleeding and intractable symptoms of urinary tract and bowel, recur rent tumours post radiation and chemotherapy, and lat e onset radiation induced tumours. Surgery 14Surgery Colorectal and Peritoneal Oncology Centre (CPOC) The Christie CPOC is an internationally renowned centre for highly specialised surgery offering a national and regional service to the UK NHS and was awarded the 2013 BMJ Cancer Care Team of the Year Award. It specialises in: 1. Peritoneal surface malignancy - One of two centres commissioned by NHS England providing cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) patients with appendix tumours and metastases (CRPM). 2. Advanced pelvic and retroperitoneal malignancies (primary and recurrent) - CPOC offers a regional and national multi- visceral resection service colorectal, urology, gynaecology and reconstructive surgery. The UK National Bowel Cancer Audit recognises it as one of three tertiary cancer centres in the UK. 3. Anal cancer - The largest anal cancer unit in the western world with an established database since 1988 of over 750 patients, with 80 new cases diagnosed per annum. CPOC has actively contributed to the development of the leading international anal cancer clinical trials and remains in the highest centil e for recruitment to those trials. 4. Neuro endocrine tumours - CPOC is recognised by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) as an accredited centre of excellence for the management of these rare neoplasms. CPOC is a core member of the neuroendocrine endocrine tumour MDT engaged with treatments for small bowel, appendix, colonic and rectal tumours. 5. Organ preserving treatments for rectal cancer - A leading international centre with expertise in managing patients with complete clinical response following long course chemoradiotherapy. Initially working through the GI disease group, CPOC established the 'Oncological Outcomes after Clinical Complete Response in Patients with Rectal Cancer' (OnCoRe) database from a North West England and Wales collaborative initiated in 2005 , reporting outcomes in Lancet Oncology in 2016. OnCoRe is a major contributor to the international collaborative watch and wait database recently reporting outcomes from a cohort of 1 ,009 cases (Lancet 2018). The team hosted the n ational PTS meeting in January 2019, which included a discussion of data from all units with a view to improving patient outcomes. The team have continued to develop educational projects to improve the appropriateness of referrals. With this in mind , the team now runs a programme inviting MDT participants to attend a course explaining what they need to know in this field. In 2018, an additional consultant was appointed to support the activity which will be generated fro m the development of the t otal pelvic exenteration service for advanced and recurrent rectal cancer. For a more detailed review of the service, please refer to the CPOC Annual Report team provide s surgical management for patients with prostate, renal, penile, testicular and other rare types of urological cancer including abdomino- pelvic sarcomas. The North West Penile Cancer Network (NWPCN) covers a population of 8.7 million, over a large geographic area and a diverse population. It provides specialist diagnostic, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical treatments (including reconstruction) for pat ients with suspected or diagnosed penile cancer. The service offers the full range of penile cancer treatments including the latest up to date penile sparing and reconstructive techniques. Reflecting t he national trend, the team has developed additional capacity and 15The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 capability to deal with the increase in robotic prostatectomy cases over the last financial year. The team is recognised as a national training centre for robotic prostatectomy surgery. The Christie team is the key provider in the GM wide reconfiguration of cancer urology service s. The lead and key providers are tasked with delivering a single urology cancer surgery service for Greater Manchester. The single service will integrate services across the whole pathway What has been recognised as pa rt of the reconfiguration is that patients in GM have different pathways depending on which unit or part of the city they are geographically located in, hence it has been agreed that new pathways will be designed to meet the demands and standardise care fo r the population served. During 2018 the team has worked w ith colleagues from across the r egion to implement changes to the prostate pathway. The academic credentials of the u rology research team are internationally renowned: encompassing FASTMAN prostat e centre, a long history of laboratory and clinical research and leading one of the world 's largest prostate cancer trials (stampede). The team are also are u rogenital cancer leaders within the European Reference Network eUROGEN and are recognised in research within rare cancers. Gynaecological surgery Established in December 2014, T he Christie g ynae - oncology multidisciplinary team provides services to over half the population of Greater Manchester and East Cheshire. The service has grown since its incep tion in 2014. The gynae -oncology team provide surgical management to patients with endometrial, ovarian, cervical, vulval, vaginal and other rarer gynaecological cancers. As well as providing high quality traditional gynaecological surgery, the team empl oys a range of techniques and cutting edge technologies including robotic and laparoscopic surgery, sentinel lymph node technology and electro -chemoradiotherapy. The team has an established track record in providing enhanced recovery, fertility sparing surgery and exenterative surgery. With surgical colleagues from urology, colorectal and plastics, the gynaecology surgeons also provide supra - radical exenterative surgery, cytoreductive surgery and complex reconstructive surgery. In 2018, the team undertook 50 joint procedures with surgical colleagues. The team is highly regarded for its educational activities and is recognised as a training centre for gynaecological robotic surgery. The service is delivered in a networked (hub and spoke) manner ensuring that regular attendances for outpatients and diagnostics are provided closer to home, with specialist cancer surgery being delivered on a central site . Plastic surgery The p lastic surgery team ensures we can provide integrated cancer surgery and oncologic al care in a multidisciplinary, one site service. The team is co - located with surgical and non- surgical oncology teams, often working in parallel or shared clinics for the provision of one stop, comprehensive cancer management with dedicated nurse specialists working across specialties for continuity of patient care. This year we have moved outpatient clinics and local anaesthetic daycase procedures to the new Integrated Procedures Unit. This allows for the most efficient and effective care, whilst optimisi ng the patient experience. The p lastic surgery team provide two main models for delivery of care: that of a primary resection and reconstructive service and also delivering the reconstructive options for the other three surgical specialties. Similar to 20 17, w e have delivered almost 2,000 treatment episodes this year and 16Surgery over 10,000 outpatient consultations. We undertake primary resections and reconstructions for patients with skin malignancy. This includes the provision of the Cheshire and Greater Manches ter Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) service, undertaking approximately 180 SLNBs per year. This element of the p lastic surgery service encompasses block lymph node dissections of the head and neck, a xillary, inguinal and i leoinguinal regions, undertaken for skin cancer. The latter is performed as part of a multidisciplinary minimally invasive surgery team, in order to minimise morbidity and optimise recovery and discharge. The team have also continued to look to expand the lymphedema service in conjunction with the physiotherapy team. In addition , the team supports and liaises closely with the specialist pelvic MDT, to provide reconstructive solutions for difficult cases which would be otherwise inoperable or leave patients with suboptimal results or de bilitating/chronic wounds. The p lastic surgery team operate s on approximately 45 -50 such cases per year, including reconstruction of vulval defects utilising local or pedicled flaps, pelvic obturation and perineal closure following total pelvic clearance or abdominoperineal resection, pelvic brim resections and abdominal wall reconstructions, abdominolipectomy to aid pelvic access and optimise wound healing. As part of the overall provision of reconstructive services, the team perform s microvascular free tissue transfers, allowing reconstruction of large or complex defects by the provision of tissue from distant donor sites. This service saw growth in 2018- 19, with an expected increase to 35 cases from the 25 that were undertaken the previous year. 17The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Clinical Support Services play an important role across the Trust, working closely with other professionals to ensure our patients' and families physical and emotional needs are met. Services offered are both clinical and non-clinical. Clinical s ervices Nutrition and dietetics This service provides evidence based treatment to inpatients, head and neck outpatients and the upper GI and gastrostomy drop -in-clinic. The team also lead in the development of nutrition policies and standards, regular audits an d research and engage in patient satisfaction work to help improve outcomes, improve the patient pathways and ensure compliance with national standards and guidance. We recently improved the management of nasogastric and g astrostomy tube management with i mproved training, a self-assessment form and placement chart. We have demonstrated compliance with the national guidance framework ' the British Dietetic Association ( BDA ) nutrition and hydration digest'. Working closely with Salford Intestinal Failure Unit (IFU) we have successfully implemented a remote discharge h ome parenteral nutrition (PN) pathway, and the results have been shared nationally by the B ritish Association of Parenteral & Enteral Nutrition ( BAPEN for Clinical Nutr ition (ESPEN ). This has provided the opportunity for greater research and enhanced the patient experience . This research will be published. Physiotherapy/Occupational therapy (OT) Physiotherapy and OT support patients in an inpatient and outpatient setti ng to return to their earliest independence often by a rehabilitation programme involving movement, exercise and functional activities. They are involved in discharge planning and ordering specific equipment or adjustments to prolong the patient's indepen dence wherever possible in the home setting or arranging intermediate care. The physiotherapists also work closely with other medical professionals in providing advice and rehabilitation for metastatic spinal cord patients and patients who have respiratory problems including those on the Oncology Critical Care U nit. Recentl y the service has introduced a staffing system to meet our objective s of working towards seven day working. In the last year , physiotherapy ha s expanded to provide a lymphoedema se rvice to clinics covering Bolton , Stockport and East Manchester , which has proved to be extremely successful. Speech and language therapy We provide a speech, language and dysphagia service to our inpatients, head and neck team and the new proton beam therapy o utpatient service. The team ha s been working hard to ensure the new national patient safety alert IDDSI is fully implemented across the Trust. Transport and interpreters The transport and interpreter services are integral to operational services across T he Christie. The transport service provides non- emergency patient transport to patients who have no other means to travel to our services or have a medical reason which would affect their ability to drive or use other means of transportation. The interpreter s ervice continues to provide an enhanced interpreter service consisting of face to face, telephone and British Sign L anguage support to patients who have difficulty understanding English or have a hearing impairment. Clinical Support Services 18Clinical support services We continue to work with service providers to improve our services and to ensure patients receive the best experience. Living with cancer The living with cancer service focuses on the physical and emotional impact that cancer can have on people. The department offers an array of support services including wigs, an art room , the Cancer Information Centre and the Chaplaincy. Cancer Information Centre (CIC) The cancer information centre provides a drop in service to offer support to patients and visitors. This can be in the for m of listening to their concerns, signposting them to relevant support services or providing relevant information verbally and in booklet format etc. A key part of the role is to support patients experiencing hair loss through the side effects of treatmen t, providing them with emotional support, information and advice, as well as enabling them to access the wig room and other services to manage the pra ctical element of hair loss . The wig room provides a drop in service five days per week and patients can usually collect their wig the same day. The centre also provides additional support in arranging weddings on site for our end of life patients. One member of staff was nominated for an unsung hero award and the centre was twice featured as a Christie Hero for the NHS 70 celebrations . Chaplaincy The chaplaincy team is committed to supporting patients and visitors at a time when they may be experiencing challenges around their beliefs and identity. They are trained to help people of faith, or any individ ual, with questions around spirituality, meaning and value. They are available for patients, visitors, staff and volunteers. The c hapel and prayer room are always open and may be used for prayer, worship, meditation or quiet time. The multi -faith space in the chaplaincy suite is suitable for all faiths as well as those who do not have a particular religious belief. Art room The art room offers patients and their care givers the opportunity to spend some time in a supportive and non -clinical safe environmen t, where they can experience a period of rest within which they are able to forget real world illness or work related pressures and reaffirm a confident sense of self -esteem , potentially learning a new skill. Complex discharge t eam The complex discharge team consists of an MDT including nurses, occupational therap ist and social workers who work closely with other multi- disciplinary professionals to support and facilitate discharges for patients with complex health and social care needs. These can be patients who may wish to return home with nursing needs or go to a nursing home or hospice. The team provide practical and emotional advice to patients and their families to help them make the right decision to ensure patient needs and choice can be accommodat ed, whilst maintaining a safe discharge. Over the past three years , we have been able to provide an a dult social work service on site, working in collaboration with an external organisation. The service provides advice about services which are availabl e in the community setting and allows our patients to voice their preference for packages of care that meet their needs. This is an essential service for patients and their carers, as it provides support, advice and information about the services availabl e within the community, as well as assisting patients who are in a less fortunate posit ion, for example, homeless patients or those seeking asylum. The 19The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Social w orkers also work closely with the safeguarding, psycho -oncology and dementia teams to provide advice and assessment. Complementary health and w ellbeing Our award winning complementary therapy service supports patients and carers through all stages of their cancer journey. Diagnosis and subsequent treatment can bring on many emotions and symptoms inc luding stress, depression, fear, worry and anxiety induced nausea. It is a specialist service which is unique nationally due to its size, diversity, the level of integration it has with acute cancer services and the level of activity it has within clinical , research and educational fields. The t eam has multiple skills and offer s an array of therapies to support and alleviate some of the symptoms experienced above, which are the side effects of treatment and illness. It also accommodates the health and wellbeing smoking cessation service. The s ervice has recently appointed several new roles and continues to be supported through The Christie c harity. Providing services to the pre -operative surgical team has been a great success this year with much improved patient outcomes and compliance. 20The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 We deliver an adult and later life liaison psychiatry inpatient and outpatient service along with an outpatient psychology, counselling and psycho -sexual therapy service. We support all other clinical teams with the management of psychiatric illness and behavioural disturbance be it pre- existing, arising as a consequence of diagnosis and treatment or as a direct consequence of disease processes . We provide teaching and supervision throughout the T rust. Through our programme of engagement events and part icipation in trust events, we promote mental health and psychological wellbeing. Our aim is to ensure parity of esteem for mental health problems and psychological difficulties with cancer -related physical symptoms. We are a unique service offering int egrated psychiatric and psychological care to our patients. In the last 12 months , we have delivered 2 ,442 outpatient contacts and 1, 217 inpatient contacts. Liaison psychiatry We provide liaison psychiatry input to the inpatient wards for adults and manage pre- existing mental illness and psychiatric symptoms arising during or as a consequence of cancer diagnosis, disease process and treatment. This includes risk assessment and management of those with suicidal ideation and thoughts of harm to others a long with supporting the medical teams and ward staff in looking after these patients. On the wards , we assist with the management of behavioural disturbance resulting from the disease process, delirium or psychiatric diagnoses. The team is also involved in complex capacity and best interest decisions, supporting the clinical teams and work closely with safeguarding and the complex discharge team. We also ensure continuity of psychiatric care post discharge . The team also provide outpatient psychiatric assessment and follow up for our patients, liaising with their local services as necessary. We support other outpatient areas and clinics in the management of those with psychiatric symptoms. We also attend ward multi -disciplinary meetings to support staff with the management of patients with mental health problems and to work with them to provide early intervention, if required. Counselling and psychology We provide evidence based psychological therapies including counselling, cognitive behavioural therap y, cognitive analytical therapy and psychotherapy to outpatients at all stages of treatment and follow -up. Our clinical psychologist is an expert in the treatment of complex trauma. A consultant in psycho -sexual medicine attends twice a month to provide t herapy. Dementia and later life liaison services The later life m ental health liaison service offers clinical assessment and support in both inpatient and outpatient settings for those patients aged 65 and over experiencing mental health issues . This service also contributes to discharge planning. We also offer a service providing support for our patients with dementia or memory issues who are receiving treatment . This is a unique nationally recognised service that provides dementia and oncology educati on both internally and externally . We showcase our work at conferences local ly, regionally and nationally. The service also provides clinical assessments, practical advice and support for our patients with dementia and their carers and in addition patien ts having cancer treatment who care for people with dementia. Staff also have the opportunity to seek advice around any concerns or personal issues they may have in relation to dementia and their loved ones with the aim of reducing their s tress and improv ing their wellbeing. Psycho -Oncology Service 21Psycho -oncology service As a result of research taking place around cancer and dementia in collaboration with The Christie and Manchester University, various papers were published in 2018 around this unexplored area of work. Supervision The psycho -oncology team provide clinical supervision to individuals and groups of staff including specialist nurses and AHP s, complementary therapy and information centre staff. We deliver psycho -sexual supervision to staff working with patients who present with sexual difficulties. Education The team also deliver s a teaching programme entitled Introduction to Psychological Aspects of Cancer for staff banded 1 to 6. We deliver Level 1 and 2 psychological support training to trust staff. We contribute to external and interna l study days including the Postgraduate Certificate of Oncology Course and the Postgraduate Certificate of Breast Oncology Course (both at the University of Manchester) and contribute to the T rust's patient health and wellbeing e vents and to patient suppor t groups. We are member s of the Psychological and Mental Health Pathway Board, the Trust 's Healthy Workplace Steering Group and the Schwartz Round Steering Group. Mental health Promotion We regularly run events to promote the mental health of patients, staff and visitors. 22The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 We deliver a comprehensive a cute oncology service. Ambitious performance standards and new ways of delivering cancer care continue to increase acute patient episodes and the requirement to care for a more diverse set of cancer toxicities. We deliver an acute medicine service which has proved transformative in improving patient care across the Trust. Working in collaboration and partnership under a service level agreement has enabled enhanced level 3 critical care support, as well as the on -site provis ion of acute medical specialty input. The majority of our patients are ambulatory . However, patients with acute problems relating to their cancer or cancer treatment , are admitted via the acute oncology management service (AOMS) to the oncology assessment unit (OAU) staffed by acute physicians, oncologists and acute oncology nurse practitioners. Acute oncology management services (AOMS) and metastatic spinal cord c ompression (MSCC) The acute oncology management service is a 24 hour telephone helpline service (Hotline) that is available to our patients, their carers and professionals for advice management on the side effects and complications of cancer treatments. The hotline supports the enhanced supportive care clinic by directly booking patients into the clinic. This option has helped to reduce the need to contact GPs. The past year has seen the incorporation of the MSCC into AOMS service as part of a network wide provision of care, advice and support for patients with spinal cord compression due to cancer . Oncology critical c are unit (OCCU) The eight bedded mixed level 2 and level 3 c ritical care u nit provides specialist support for nearly 700 admissions per year, following major surgery or patients suffering from complications of cancer or its treatment . Activity rises year on year by 10%. Enhanced supportive care (ESC) Over the last 12 months , we have continued to work towards the development of an ambulatory care setting to transform our acute services and unplanned care. The ESC model continues to offer patients rapid access to immediate specialist oncology acute or supportive care for any of our patient presenting with problems due to their cancer, or cancer treatment. Oncology assessment u nit (OAU) All unplanned admissions are routed through the oncology assessment unit (OAU). The demands placed on the OAU have increased dramatically over the past few years with changes in practice for admissions, wider ranges of treatments being given in an outpatient setting, more complex patient demographics and advances with exciting new treatments in R&D and surgery. Pre-operative assessment The anaesthetic high risk pre-operative assessment clinic has continued to develop its capacity to provide assessment, optimisation and risk stratification for patients w ho are due to undergo surgery. To aid this we have developed the UK's first virtual surgery school that aims to prepare patients for surgery by working with patients to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. he success of this has attracted outside agencies who are in discussions about linking to the Christie Virtual Surgery School. Future developments include the introduction of cardio -pulmonary exercise (CPEX) and lung function testing on site. The aim is to aid patient assessment and pre -operative optimisation and prevent the delays currently experienced with patients having to attend other hospitals for these investigations. We are working to develop a pre-operative anaemia clinic to diagnose and treat pre-operative anaemia to improve pati ent safety and reduce transfusion requirements. Acute Oncology Service s 23The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 20 18-19 The Directorate of Radiology is responsible for the service delivery of MRI Scanning, CT Scanning , x-ray, fluoroscopy and interventional radiology, ultrasound and for PET- CT reporting . The department currently supports 24 disease related clinical Multidi sciplinary Team Meetings (MDTs) with each MDT having a lead consultant radiologist Radiology reporting turnaround times continues to be met in the backdrop of increased d emand across the majority of imaging modalities . The continued increase in ima ging is a local and national trend . The directorate continues to run under its establishment for trained radiographers due to a national shortage of this staff group . To mitigate against this the directorate is undertaking a skill mix review to determine future recruitment plans and succession planning. A means to try to manage demand and ensure patient s are not over -exposed to imagi ng radiation has seen the directorate and clinical stakeholders develop a number of i maging protocols which have been incorpor ated into the Trust Clinical Web Portal (CWP) . The system remind s clinical referrers of the agreed protocols prior to referring . Work to implement the protocols for other disease groups is continuing. We support a number of Multi -Disciplinary Team (MDT ) meetings across multiple disease groups ; with activity and complexity continuing to grow. MDTS are accommodated into radiologist job plans. We also have a vital role in supporting research at The Christie, through provision of a comprehensive biopsy servi ce and the reporting of clinical trials scans. CT Scanning We have performed over 24,600 CT scans this year; an activity increase of 5.8% . Significantly, the CT biopsy activity has increased by 16.5%. Extended working days are well established; as a means of meeting demand as well as offering our patients a choice of appointment times to fit around their personal commitments. There are plans to increase our service portfolio, with the introduction of CT guided ablation. MRI Scanning We have performed nearly 10,000 MR scans this year; an increase of 11%. As for CT, the department operates an extended working day . The department is reviewing options to increase scanning staffing capacity as well as achieving the implementation of a 7 day service . X-ray We have s een no significant change in activity for this modality. The proposed refurbishment and co-location of general radiology facilities would assist with the proposed introduction of an assistant practitioner role . We are mindful of the advanced pra ctice role f or chest x- ray reporting, and looking to train staff as staff turnover. Interventional Radiology Overall activity has increased by 19.9% over the last year, with over 2,000 procedures performed. One notable recent development is the conversion from femoral to radial access for suitable patients and procedures, which has allowed cases to be changed from inpatient stays to day case procedures. A planned further development is to implement same day admission for gastrostom y patients; reducing over all length of stay. Ultrasound We have performed nearly 5,000 diagnostic and interventional US examinations this year; an activity increase of 9.6 %. We operate this service from the Integrated Procedures Unit and from the Radi ology 2 facility. The directo rate is to evaluate the possible introduction of non - medical sonography, as part of the skill mix review. Radiology 24Radiology PET- CT Reporting We are responsible for Nuclear Medicine reporting, including PET-CT scans . The Academy continues to provide teaching and training modules, facilitating the expansion of further PET -CT reporters. The service has secured award of the National Contract 2. Other developments have included the establishment of a partnership board with MFT and c ollaboration continues between Christie, WMI C and A lliance Medical Ltd to develop novel tracers and to enhance research and clinical trials opportunities 25The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 We have built on last year's achievements and are increasingly recognised both nationally and internationally as a major contributor in practice changing cancer research. Such recognition is on the basis of the depth and breadth of its research programme and its reputation for improving patient outcomes by driving continuous clinical improvem ent through research and innovation. Our research focus es on prevention and early detection, developing personalised medicine approaches that target specific therapy to an individual's cancer, through to living with and beyond cancer. We are investigating everything from understanding the molecular and cellular basis of cancer to the development and testing of novel treatments. Partnerships The strength of our research is built on deep and effective partnerships. Working with the University of Manchester and C ancer Research UK, under the umbrella of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC), professionals from different disciplines work together to realise the shar ed aim of deliver ing groundbreaking research for the benefit of patients. A series of \"town hall' forums were launched in 2018 and involved such disease areas as breast, lung, prostate, skin, gynaecological and blood - based cancers. Scientists, nurses, surgeons, radiation and chemotherapy specialists, imaging and biopsy technicians , and importantly , patients came together to agree on a common challenge, that had a unique 'Mancunian' focus and would be deliverable within 2 -3 years. The outputs from these ev ents are helping to form our future research strategy. Innovation Our partnerships with industry - pharmaceutical and technological - are also crucial in our pursuit to develop new personalised therapies for cancer. We are working with industry partners t o create the UK's first rapid learning health system for oncology. These partnerships will mobilise and surface real -time patient outcome data, linking genomics data and patient reported feedback whilst extending its utility to the wider healthcare network . We believe these partnerships will catapult Manchester and subsequently the UK to become a leader in real w orld data driven research, discovering and developing the next generation of cancer medicines, realising the benefits of personalised healthcare and contributing to the fulfilment of the UK Government's Life Sciences Industrial Strategy ambition. In December 2018, we formed a strategic precision cancer research partnership with Roche, one of the world's leading pharma companies. Over the next 3 year s, Roche will fund up to \u00a320 million to merge cutting-edge genomic technology with data analytics to accelerate the next generation of digital clinical trials in rarer cancers. The collaboration should help Greater Manchester become a leading global hub fo r clinical research trials. There is considerable worldwide interest in developing new medicines based on genes and human cells/ tissues. These are called advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP's). Such an example would be new immunotherapy medicines wh ere human immune cells are removed from a patient, activated to certain proteins that attack cancer cells and then re - infused. A Manchester based consortium led by The Christie - iMATCH - was awarded \u00a37m of funding from Innovate UK (an arm of government) in 2018 to streamline the assessment and processes enabling patients to access these new drugs more easily via research trials. In November 2018 it was also successful in winning an additional \u00a32m from Innovate UK to work with other advanced therapy centr es to develop a standardised approach for the collection of tissue and cell samples. Research and Innovation 26Research Infrastructure The \u00a312m National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) funding for the discovery and translation of laboratory -based science into cutting- edge cancer treatments has delivered strongly through 2018/19 with the three cancer themes - advanced radiotherapy, precision medicine and prevention and early detection - making strong progress. P lans are already in place for the development of further themes, such as survivorship, in time for the next NIHR BRC competition in 2022. The NIHR Manchester Clinical Research Facility (CRF) a t The Christie which receives annual funding of c\u00a31m for the continued d evelopment of specialised, early-pha se experimental cancer research studies has supported early phase clinical research, focus sing on patients taking part in clinical trials of the newest anti -cancer drugs which are not yet available as standard of care treatment. The centre con tinues to be the leading UK site and is still on track to become one of the top three Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres for the delivery of precision medicine in Europe by 2020, through augmentation of its scientific and clinical experimental cancer med icine capabilities by supporting over 500 patients/annum receiving investigative medicinal products. A priority over the next few years will be to further increase the quantity and quality of clinical research and provide greater access to these trials f or more impoverished and ethnically diverse communities. Our CRF team were recognised at this year's GM Clinical Research Awards for their achievements in this space. In late 2018, MCRC was successful in a highly competitive process run by CRUK to become 1 of 6 UK and US centres to work collaboratively on large scale cancer research into earlier diagnosis. The award is worth several million pounds over the next 5 years. Its principal driving ethos is to foster earlier diagnosis of cancer via early identif ication of patients often before they have symptoms via new techniques/ models (eg novel blood markers and new types of selected screening). An added advantage of this international network is to be able to offer innovations from other world leading centres to our GM population earlier than would otherwise be the case. Other highlights: National funding was obtained in December 2018 to start the world's first randomised trial of surgery versus radiotherapy in addition to systemic anti -cancer therapy in a po tentially curable type of lung cancer with the patient's quality of life (as opposed to survival) as the primary outcome measure. The development and delivery of a world leading Patient Reported Outcomes/Experience Strategy. Working with platform supplier DrDoctor, a new system has been implemented in our clinics and new outcomes measures have been defined and rolled out. C ontinued development of this work will be a key priority for us over the next year. Leadership Our academic investment plan continues to drive the strategic recruitment of world leading academics across multiple disciplines and disease groups. Recruits over the past year include Professor Peter Hoskin, Chair in Clinical Oncology, who arrived in May 2018 and will drive the strategic growth of r adiation related r esearch. Professor Silke Gillessen, Professor and Chair in Genitourinary Oncology Systemic Therapy Research and Honorary Consultant in Medical Oncology, took up her role in July 2018. She will develop and lead a programme of novel biomarker -driven systemic Phase II trials using molecular- targeted drugs and immunotherapy as part of the Urology/STR research group. Professor Tim Illidge, Clinical Lead in the Advanced Radiotherapy theme and programme 27The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 lead for 'New Radiotherapy Immunoth erapy combinations' was selected as a new NIHR Senior Investigator and will become a member of the NIHR College of around 200 Senior Investigators. Performance In 2018-19 Christie Research continued to increase the number of patients on clinical trials . Excluding screening failures, there was an increase in consented patients on trials by 10% at the end of the year. The research and innovation division continued to perform well against the NIHR study set up performance target, reducing the number of days taken from 61 days in the fourth quarter of 2017- 18 to 31 days in the third quarter of 2018-19 against a target of 40 days. In clinical trial delivery, the recruitment to the time and target performance measure increased from 33% in the fourth quarter of 2017- 18 to 63% in the third quarter of 2018-19. We are also in the top 5% of all NHS Trusts for the number of studies opened during the third quarter of 2018/19 and the top 3% of all NHS Trusts for commercial studies closed during the period. The divis ion met the Greater Manchester Clinical Research Network (CRN) recruitment target by December 2018 and is expected to exceed this by 20% at year end. It has increased its com mercial income by 28% from 2017-18 and remains the biggest oncology commercial clinical trials centre in the UK. In multiple clinical trials, The Christie has recruited the first global and UK patients and been the top UK and global recruiter. High impact patient case studies Richard Jackson Richard Jackson (50), a primary school head teacher from Chester was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2003. Despite treatment, his cancer returned three years later and had spread to his chest. He was given between six and nine months to live. The news was devastating for Richard and his wife J udith who had a young family at the time. We added him to a trial for an exciting new immunotherapy drug as the sole patient under the compassionate use programme. \"The results were remarkable,\" said Richard. \"Within 24 hours of my first treatment, Judith started to notice the huge lump on my neck visibly shrinking. To see it disappearing was miraculous.\" Now more than ten year's cancer free, the trial has enabled Richard to see children Archie (15) and daughter Mabel (12) grow up. \"I have lived to tell my story and see things I should not have,\" says Richard. \"I've taken my son to watch Manchester City, my daughter to dancing lessons and even watched England in a World Cup semi - final for the second time in my life!\" Richard's consultant, Dr Paul Lorigan ad ded: \"We've gone from immunotherapy being a novel but promising experimental therapy through to it being a standard line of treatment for some melanoma patients. Prior to 2010, the median expected survival for someone with advanced melanoma was just 6 to 9 months, now it is 30 to 36 months, with some patients being long term survivors and potentially cured.\" Barbara Stojkovic Barbara Stojkovic, aged 69, a retired secretary from Birmingham, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer five years ago. She was referred t o The Christie early in 2017 because her tumour wasn't responding well to conventional chemotherapy. The first trial Barbara was placed on proved to be unsuitable for her and doctors decided she would be an ideal candidate for the TARGET trial. The TARGET trial involves the analysis of DNA from a patient's tumour tissue and blood sample 28Research to identify the faulty gene or genes driving their cancer. If a faulty gene (or mutation) is found, doctors may be able to match this up to a treatment directed specifically against that mutation, usually as part of a clinical trial. Barbara was genetically matched to a 'Wee1 inhibitor', a drug which induces damage in cancer cells. While on this trial, CT scans revealed that Barbara's tumour had shrunk by a remarkable 57%. Barbara later tried another drug matched specifically to her cancer. For this trial, Barbara is travelling to The Christie once a week for chemotherapy and capsules of a new drug called SRA737 to take during the week. Barbara is currently feeling fit and well. She said: \"I'm grateful to be given the opportunity to have been on three different clinical trials. The clinical trials team at The Christie gave me hope. I know I'm being treated in the right place for my cancer. The level of support and care they provide to patients is above any expectations and I am so grateful. 29The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 The Christie School of Oncology continues to lead the way in the delivery of local, national and international programmes of education and training. This year has been a particularly busy period for the School with all aspects of its service seeing major developments , including involvement in a number of projects with regional and national significance . The School remains in the centre of cancer education delivery across Greater Manchester, and this year has seen the appointment of Dr Cathy Heaven to the post of Director of the GM Cancer Education Programme . Teamwork and partnership have been a theme for all services across the School over the last year with a range of opportunities for us to work internally and region ally to develop new initiatives . We have been keen to build relationships which help to improve the quality of service offered. This approach has been applied on a local, national and international basis leading to the development of a range of partnership opportunities. The clinical s kills team has contributed significantly to the work across the Trust in consolidat ing and developing a more strategic approach to the delivery of SACT training. This has involved working closely with clinical services, and a national organisation to support the introduction of the UKONS (UK Oncology Nurse Society) systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) competency passport. Th e development has been supported through the implementation of study days as well as the development of online learning opportunities. The team have also provided s upport for new roles including trainee nurse a ssociates (TNAs) . The medical e ducation team has worked closely with the University of Manchester and clinical colleagues to support the placements of Y1 physician a ssociates . These have been well evaluated and will continue for the next academic year. This has also led to the addition of four qualified physician associates into the workforce structure and ongoing development of these innovative roles is being planned. The profess ional development team has worked closely with all services across the Trust to facilitate the uptake of apprenticeships. This has involved supporting the development of new opportunities for both current and future staff . Alongside this, the team has worke d closely with HR, Stockport and Trafford College, the Job Centre and all services to provide pre - employment placements. Other projects to meet the H ealth Education England (HEE) targets have included working with Manchester College in providing work experience placements for BTEC Level 3 students across a range of clinical placements. Our practice education f acilitator has continued to support mento rs and students, working clos ely with clinical services and h igher education institutions (HEIs). This has a lso involved the development of new mentors and a new placement for student radiographers from the University of Cumbria. A source of pride across the Trust is that the Oak Road Treatment Centre has been voted top placement of the year 2018 by University o f Manchester Nursing students in the Recognising Excellence and Achievement Awards. This reflects the commitment across the Trust for developing our future workforce. Work is also taking place in aligning a number of online learning systems to ensure that the School continues to be responsive to new developments in technology and support the learning and development of staff. The education e vents team has delivered a diversified portfolio of events across the year ; a particular highlight being the Greater Manchester Cancer Conference , attended by over 500 people from all clinical and patient backgrounds . This School of Oncology 30School of oncology event was a particularly important showcase for the work of the team, with excellent feedback. Another exciting event was the Enhanced Supportive Care Conference, with over 130 attendees . The team has also expanded its reach into the delivery of conferences for a range of national charities and has also continued collaborative working with the complementary therapies team and the research division, to provid e a range of learning opportunities . The Kostoris library team has also expanded the theme of collaboration through writing blogs and providing resources to support events . This ensures that events are supported through the provision of evidence bas ed materials. The library continues to offer a range of diverse and creative approaches to knowledge service delivery, which has included reviewing module delivery to make them even more accessible to a range of staff. One interesting piece of work has been the introduction of two new projects, randomised coffee trials and the introduction of a reading group. The library is particularly excited to have received a grant to develop v irtual r eality education. The education c entre continues to provide a hub for the delivery of meetings and events . A key piece of work has been to promote the use of 'live-streaming' within the Trust. This work has included opening up accessibility to team briefing. In addition, both grand rounds and specially selected study days are now available for either 'live -streaming' or 'on -demand'. This is an exciting development across all School teams as it allows access to education from anywhere in the world. This has also included patient health and wellbeing events. The team will continue to work closely with technology enhanced learning colleagues on continuing to identify opportunities. The technology enhanced learning (TEL) team is an important resource for all of t he School's education work, although they particularly support the work of both GatewayC and the PET- CT projects. The regional rollout of GatewayC has meant a significant increase in the work of the team, alongside identifying innovative ways of delivery for all education, including the masters programmes which the School runs with the University of Manchester. The team is also an integral part of the virtual reality education bid with the library. This year has also seen the initial development of a new range of online learning opportunities under the banner o f ChristieLearn! The Maguire communications t eam has continued to deliver its programme of education across the UK, which this year has inc luded the delivery of open access wo rkshops in London , as well as a number of workshop s in Gibraltar. The team are also working closely with a number of other projects, including GatewayC and PET-CT, alongside contribution to the online development of ChristieLearn! This year has been a significant year for many of our colleagues, particularly in proton beam therapy. The School is really excited to work in partnership with our colleagues to support the development of the International Proton School . We are developing a portfolio of learning opportunities and an educa tion space in the newly opened proton beam therapy c entre. GatewayC continues to go from strength to strength with its innovative online education programme for GPs and primary care to support early cancer diagnosis. The portal is now available across the North of England and in select ed parts of the South. The team has been working hard with commissioners across the UK in facilitating take up with the use of innovative marketing techniques. Education which has been developed continues to be innovative and creative. This year has seen the inclusion of eigh t new modules on the system, including lymphoma, brain tumours and leukaemia, and a specific general module on 31The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 improving the quality of referral specifically developed to support early detection targets nationally . The Christie established the PET-CT Academy in 2017, since then its reputation has grown nationally and internationally. This is, in part, due to the unique blended learning approach to the training of PET -CT reporters that is currently being piloted and has proven successful amongst radiolo gists internally and externally. Nationally there has been an increase in the use of PET- CT. Reporters internally , and across the NHS , who do not r eport PET -CT are choosing to upskill, some using our course. The PET- CT Academy has also found success in introducing a new suite of face to face mandatory training for our partners Alliance Medical Lt d. Staff are now accessing communication skills and sessions on managing patients with dementia. The teams have trained over 500 diagnostic imaging staff nationally. The Academy has launched a novel blended training course for radiographers and t echnologists, the first phase of the course was completed in 2017 and the second phase is due to be completed in 2019 . A new course for clinical assistants which tracks t he patient pathways is also currently being piloted, for release in spring 2019. The Academy is working with experts nationally and internationally to develop the most up to date training in PET -CT and continues to work on its current research projects and look for research opportunities internationally, an area the team will be focussing on in greater detail in 2019. 32The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Our ability to take care of our patients reflects the financial health of the organisation. Every penny that we spend is used to support the people we care for so it i s really important that we manage our finances well. 2018- 19 was another strong year f or the T rust financially, reflect ing the hard work and dedication from all of our staff to ensure that services are delivered in the most efficient and effective way for patients. Financial highlights Our regulator, NHS Improvement , sets out a comprehens ive framework to assess and monitor the financial performance of NHS trusts. Financial performance is evaluated across several financial metrics to arrive at an overall 'use of resource ' score, where 1 represents the lowest financial risk and 4 the highes t level of risk . For 2018 -19, The Christie achieved the best financial rating available from NHS Improvement. Throughout the financial year, we have recorded a 'use of resource' score of 1. Performance The financial trading results for the year ending 31 st March 2019 were better than the original plan agreed with NHS Improvement . Importantly, against the backdrop of continued resource constraints in the health service, the Trust continues to operate sustainably , whilst continuing to provide the highest levels of quality, safety and care . This is supported by the Trust's efficiency programme, which has delivered improvements of \u00a3 7.8m in 2018 -19. The Christie c harity is a critical part of the organisation's overall financial wellbeing. In line with our accounting policy, we are required to consolidate our accounts with those of T he Christie charity.

The financial position was also improved by additional resource from the NHS Provider Sustain ability Fund (PSF) of \u00a326.6m, which was made available to trusts who exceeded their financial control total. Activity and income The Trust receives the majority of its income for delivering patient care, which equated to \u00a3238.3m i n 2018 -19. Of this total, the Trust received \u00a3200.5m during the year from its principal commissioner, NHS England , and \u00a330.0m from clinical commissioning groups. Total clinical income has increase d by \u00a320.6m (9.5%) over the last 12 months. This represents a significant investment by our commissioners to provide additional cancer treatment s and the best safety and quality of care availab le for the population we serve. 34The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Provision of goods and services Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 requires that the income from the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England must be greater than its income from the provision of goods and services for any other purposes; The Christie NHS Foundation Trust has met this requirement. Any surplus derived from the limited diversification of income has helped support the Trust in delivering high quality healthcare services for our patients. Value for money and improved efficiency Our total operating expenses for the Trust , excluding depreci ation, amortisation and impairment , year \u00a3272.2m (\u00a3 250.5m in 2017- 18). Of this, \u00a3132.2 m was spent on staffing, ensuring we continued to attract and retain over 282 doctors, 698 nurses, 615 scientific, technical and therapeutic staff and 207 health care assistants and support staff. Over 24% of our total operating expenses were spent on chemotherapy and other cancer treatment drugs and has helped ensure our patients continue to have access to the latest and most effective treatments . The surplus was achieved by delivering \u00a3 7.8m of efficiency savings. These have been achieved through a combination of quality led service change, improved productivity, procurement and a reduction in wastage. Quality Innovation Productivity & Preventio n (QIPP) QIPP is a national scheme supported by NHS England which is recognised as the major vehicle to encourage organisations to transform their services and deliver the savings required by the NHS. In 2018- 19 the Trust delivered \u00a32.3m of QIPP savings wh ich were passed directly on to our commis sioners through schemes such as the Improving Access to Medicines Sc heme which saw the transfer to generic and biosimilar drugs for patient s on certain chemotherapy treatments. Joint v entures The Christie Clinic L LP was formed on 15 th September 2010 and is a joint venture partnership with HCA (HCA International Limited ) for the provision of private oncology activity. In 2017- 18 the LLP was renamed The Christie Private Clinic LLP. The joint venture profit share in 2018- 19 is \u00a35.7m, as per the terms of the LLP membership agreement . In Ju ne 2014 we entered into a joint venture partnership with Synlab UK, the UK division of one of the largest European independent providers of pathology services. The Christie Pathology Partnership LLP will allow the Trust to develop further its pathology services drawing on the European expertise of Synlab UK combined with the established can cer expertise at The Christie. The joint venture profit share in 2018 -19 is \u00a30.1m, as per the term s of the LLP membership agreement. Subsidiary c ompanies On 11 th December 2017, The Christie Pharmacy Limited (Company Number: 11027496) was formed, to provide pharmacy dispensing services to the Trust. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust and its financial performance is included in the consolidated group accounts. For 2018 -19 the principal imp act for the group has been a financial surplus of \u00a3 0.3m, which is in line with the Trust's expectation. Charitable funding We are fortunate to be supported in our activities by T he Christie c harity . These funds are administered by a separate charity for which the Board of Directors acts as corporate trustees . The charity is considered a subsidiary and 35Our f inancial performance therefore there is a requirement to consolidate its account s with that of the Foundation Trust. The charity accounts will also continue to be reported in its separate annual report. Over the past 12 months, we spent \u00a34.4m on capital projects from charitable grants and we received a charitable revenue contribution of \u00a38.0m to enable us to enhance our services. Value of our buildings and land All property, plant and equipment are measured initially by cost. Our land and building assets are subsequently measured at fair value in line with our accountin g polic ies. As part of this, the Trust's land value is based on an alternative site methodology. To ensure an independent and fair value of our estate we eng age with the District Valuer, who review s our asset values . The proton beam t herapy facility was b rought into use in a year and was impaired by \u00a316.6m. Together with a decrease in building value indices, there was a total downwards net revaluation of our assets of \u00a317.4m in 2018- 19. Capital investment The Trust has continued to invest in its estate a nd equipment assets with another comprehensive capit al investment programme for 2018- 19. The Proton Beam Therapy facility was completed in 2018- 19 and is now fully operational. This development provides patients from across the region and beyond with acc ess to the latest and most precise forms of rad iation treatment. The facility also house s our new ly opened outpatient department, which provides state of the art clinical and non- clinical space. The development of an ambitious integrated research facility on the site of the fire damaged Paterson research building is progressing at pace. The Trust is working in partnership with the University of Manchester and Cancer Research UK to ensure Manchester remains at the forefront of research to support better ou tcomes for patients. Demolition of the previous site is underway, and plans are being finalised for the new development, which will be completed in 2021- 22. The Trust has also replace d major diagnostic equipment, including a PET -CT. In addition, we have continued to invest in information technology and the estate maintenance programme that ensures our infrastructure continues to support effective patient care.

This is an increase on the previ ous year and reflects the balances generated through operational performance. Public sector payment policy - better payments practice c ode In accordance with the Better Payments Practice Code and government accounting rules, the Trust's payment policy is to pay creditors within 30 days of the receipt of the goods or a valid invoice , whichever is the later , unless o ther terms have been agreed. The Trust paid 96% of non- NHS tr ade invoices by value within 30 days . 36The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Trading environment and financial risks Whil st we have continued to maintain a healthy financial posit ion during 2018 -19, there have continued to be significant changes in the external economic and political environment which will impact on our operational and strategic plans for the future . The im plications for lower growth in health spending are continuing to be seen with a n inherent efficiency factor of 1.1% in the income received from commissioners for 2019 -20. Our financial strategy for 2019- 20 is to continue to focus on delivering productivit y and efficiency improvements and to reduce costs. Being a financially sustainable organisation is critical to support the delivery of safe services and deliver the investment required to fulfil our ambitious capital and programme. In 2019- 20 the Trust pl ans to achieve a \u00a3 9.390 m financial control total in line with the target set out by NHS Improvement. This is supported by the Provider Sustainability Funding of \u00a31. 130m. Achievement of this target is conti ngent on delivering a CIP target of \u00a3 8.670 m, whil st taking account of the investment requirements around staffing and non- pay required to deliver t he anticipated activity growth and continue to meet all our performance targets . Following the change in commissioning arrangements for the Trust in 2017 -18, the main commissioner contract for all our English services remains with NHS England. CCGs responsible for treatments that are not considered specialist will commission services from The Christie on behalf of their populations. Our contract arrangements are based on the principle of equitable risk and reward with commissioners, which we have had in place over a number of years. This principle mitigates financial risk for both parties and enables us to develop and implement efficiency schemes that benefit the Trust and commissioners. With the creation of Greater Manchester H ealth and Social Care Partnership , our future commissioning arrangements will change again and we are working closely with partners across the area to understand the impact for 2019 -20 and beyond . We are hopeful that the strong working relationship we h ave with NHS England and local commissioners continues with the new commissioner framework and any further service changes . Our partnership with HCA International in The Christie Private C are continues to perform well and our forward plans anticipate further growth which will secure support for our NHS services. Going concern After making enquiries , the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to conti nue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. External audit services Grant Thornton LLP was appointed as our external auditor on 1 st October 201 7 for a period of three years. We incurred \u00a3 61k, (\u00a3 93k for the group) in audit service fees in relation to the statutory audit of our accounts for the period ending 31 st March 2019. Non- audit services provided by the auditor Our external auditor provides non -audit services in limited circumstances in accordance with a policy recommended by the audit committee and approved by the council of gov ernors. Auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded for any non -audit services provided by the auditor by 37Our f inancial performance limiting the fees arising from such work in any one year to \u00a3 50k + VAT and ensuring that differe nt auditors carry out the work. Grant Thornton LLP did not provide additional services relating to any non-audit related services during 2018- 19. Countering fraud and corruptio n The board of directors attaches significant importance to the issue of fraud and corruption and has continued its increased investment during the year. Reported concerns have been investigated by our local counter fraud specialists in liaison with the N HS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service and the police as necessary. We work hard to maintain an anti- fraud culture and have a range of policies and procedures to minimise risk in this area. A number of events were held over the year to highlight how staff can raise concerns and suspicions . As part of our mandatory training programme, we ask staff to complete anti -fraud awareness training. Statutory framework This is the twelfth set of annual financial results prepared since we became a foundation trust on 1 st April 2007 . Consi stent with our statutory status, these accounts have been prepared under a direction issued by the independent regulator NHS Improvement. In under taking NHS business transactions, the Trust has complied with the cost all ocation and charging requirement set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance . Statement of d isclosure to a uditors In accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004, the Trust confirms that for each individual who was a director at the time that the director's report was approved, that: so far as each of the Trust directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Trust's auditor is unaware; and each director has taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Trust's audito r is aware of that information. For the purposes of this declaration: relevant audit information means information needed by the Trust's auditor in connection w ith preparing their report; and that each director has made such enquiries of his/her fellow directors and taken such other steps (if any) for that purpose, as are required by his/her duty as a director of the Trust to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. 38The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & A ccounts 2018 -19 This year, having successfully achieved what we set out to do in our 2020 Vision strategy two years early, our new five year strategy was introduced, outlining our ambition to grow services even more for the benefit of our patients. We went through an extensive process of consultation and engagement over the course of 12 months, adapting our original plans to embrace our vision for a truly world- class cancer centre. Our strategy at The Christie remains focussed on four key themes; Leading cancer care, T he Christie experience, Local and specialist care, and Best outcomes. And we work hard to ensure everything we do is focussed on achieving our goals in these areas. 2018- 09 saw The Christie once again rated Outstanding by t he Care Quality Commission (CQC) , making us the first specialist trust in the country to be given its highest accolade twice. The CQC described The Christie as 'a leader in cancer care' and a pioneer in developing innovative solutions to cancer care'. It also praised the positive cultur e, our compassionate and effective leadership, and our exceptionally kind and caring staff who 'go the extra mile to meet the needs of patients and their families. The rating is the highest we could have been given and is testament to the dedicated, exper t staff in every Christie department who work tirelessly to give the very best care and treatment to our cancer patients. Those patients are always at the heart of everything we do. In July, we were proud to play a major role in celebrating the 70 th birthday of the NHS. This gave us an opportunity to showcase some of our life-saving work nationally, and culminated with an open day, where hundreds of visitors were welcomed behind the scenes to view some of the facilities which help make us world leaders in cancer care. This year, we were also proud to welcome NHS England Chief Executiv e Simon Stevens to view our new proton beam therapy facilities. After many years in preparation, we were delighted to finally start treating patients at the end of December. We have an expert team in place and are proud to be the first NHS organisation in the UK to provide this specialist cancer treatment. We were also delighted in February to mark the completion of a brand new \u00a37m outpatient facility at The Christie, whic h now offers a more accessible, spacious and comfortable environment for the 95,000 appointments that take place there each year. Fully funded by The Christie charity, it aims to offer patients a more seamless experience with more consultation rooms, improved access to testing facilities and a new appointment system with self -check- in screens, helping to reduce patient waiting times and increase capacity. We also reaffirmed our commitment to providing specialist cancer care local to patients' homes where possible , by continuing to expand our chemotherapy outreach services. In July we opened a new chemotherapy and blood service in Winsford in Cheshire, which will save many of our patients a round trip of up to three hours to our main site in South Mancheste r. We also anno unced our plans to embark on a fundraising project to build a state of the art new cancer centre in the heart of East Cheshire. The new Christie Cancer Centre will be built in the grounds of Macclesfield District General Hospital, providing Christie cancer care closer to home for more than 1,500 new patients a year. The new centre will transform cancer care in East Cheshire, bringing together essential cancer services into one purpose -built unit delivering local specialist access to radioth erapy, chemotherapy, holistic support and information services, outpatient care, palliative care - and for the first time, clinical trials, meaning patients in A year in Focus 39The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & A ccounts 2018 -19 East Cheshire will be among the first in the country to access new treatments as they become ava ilable. Meanwhile our plans for a new research centre to replace the Paterson building gathered pace. A public consultation was carried out to share our ambitious proposals for a new world -class cancer research facility . The new centre will integrate rese archers and clinicians in one building, understanding and tackling the diversity and complexity of cancer to drive better outcomes for patients with the very latest discoveries and breakthroughs. The multi -million pound development will be led by The Chris tie on behalf of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC), an internationally renowned and hugely successful partnership between The University of Manchester, Cancer Research UK and The Christie. In addition to housing the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, the new development will be a major step forward in realising MCRC's ambition of becoming one of the world's top five centres for basic, translational and clinical cancer research by 2025. The new building will also harness the potential of hea lthcare research within a catchment area of over three million people as part of the Greater Manchester Cancer Plan (part of the healthcare devolution project in Greater Manchester) and in partnership with Health Innovation Manchester. Research, of course, continues to be of prime importance in everything we do. The number of clinical trials that are recruiting patients at The Christie increased by 11 per cent during this year . Figures published by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) demonst rated that we recruited to 214 studies in the year ending in March 2018, compared with 193 the previous year. The figures show that the number of participants recruited to trials in the past year was 1,809, which is 31 per cent higher than the target set f or The Christie by the Clinical Research Network (CRN), the NHS organisation that coordinates and supports research. This means we remain one of the most active NHS clinical research organisations in the UK, and were ranked in the top five per cent in the NIHR's national 2017 -18 research activity league table . We are ranked 10th of all the trusts in England for commercial research activity, having supported 89 commercial research studies, an increase of 22 per cent on the 73 studies it supported in 2016 -17 - the fifth best increase in the country. All of our research activity, and indeed everything else we do , is centred around patients and this year p atients have once again rated The Christie as one of the top performing trusts in the country for patient satisfaction in the annual national inpatient survey published by the CQC. The survey ranked The Christie as one of only eight acute specialist trusts to be given the CQC's top banding of 'much better than expected' by patients. The Trust was also rated as one of only of 10 to score 'much better than expected' for medical care and one of only eight to be ranked as 'better than expected' for surgery experiences. This year our charity has continued to play an important role in what we do, supporting the work of the Trust through its fundraising activities and delivers projects, equipment and improvements that are over and above what the NHS funds. The charity has over 50 ,000 supporters who helpe d raise \u00a3 13.9m . Everything we achieve at The Christie is only possible because of our staff and their hard work and dedication. We continue to perform well in staff surveys, with the majority of employees 40The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & A ccounts 2018 -19 saying they would recommend the hospital to family and friends. The success of our clinicians continues to be celeb rated. Professor Ranald Mackay, director of medical physics and engineering at The Christie was named by NHS England as Healthcare Scientist of the Year. The award celebrates 'an exceptional individual who has used their skills and scientific ability for a maximum patient or service user benefit, as recognised by their peers'. Professor Mackay has been instrumental in the development of proton beam therapy at The Christie. As a foundation trust, we are accountable to the communities we serve, and as such our public members play an essential part in sharing their opinions, shaping our future and making a vital contribution to how our services are developed. We acknowledge their extremely valuable input. This report looks back on the highlights of the last 12 months, but also establishes our plans and aspirations for the year ahead. We are determined to improve and develop still further to ensure that all of our services are truly world - class. 41The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 The Christie is committed to involving and informing both patients and the public about every aspect of our service. We believe that such involvement helps us provide a service that meets the needs of our patients. By listening to what people think about what we do at The Christie, we understand what is important to our patients. As part of our commitment, we promise d to: Provide an extensive range of information to patients . Recruit, inform and engage with our members . Have a council of governors which has representatives from our public members . Hold quarterly council of governors meetings . Keep interested members of the public well informed of developments and news through our website, the media and other communication channels . Have a Freedom o f Information (FOI) lead officer for all enquiries under the FOI Act Hold our regular board of directors meetings in public . Publicise our complaints procedure on our website and ensure that the investigation of any complaint is thorough and prompt. Purs ue an open and positive relationship with the media . Focusing on the people who count 42The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 We are proud to deliver excellent care to cancer patients from the immediate population of 3.2 million people in the Greater Manchester and Cheshire area, and to a significant number of patients from across the country in need of some highly specialised t reatments. We are able to provide a service based on expert staff and a specialised infrastructure dedicated to the delivery of cancer treatment care, research and education. Our focus and size enable us to uniquely deliver effective and efficient specialist care offering patients the best possible outcomes from our research programmes. This is enhanced by the support that we receive from The Christie charity which enables us to provide a level of care and experience for patients above and beyond what is funded by the NHS . Our strategy describes where we want to be as an organisation in the coming years. It was developed throughout 2017/18 following extensive consultation with patients, staff, governors and our board of d irectors. It sets out a clear vis ion of how we will transform cancer treatments, care & support and improve outcomes for our patients . Within the strategy, we set ourselves four pledges to prepare for the future. These are: 1. We will continue to lead the development of cancer treatment, r esearch and education so that by 202 5 we will be the leading organisation in the UK in reducing the burden of cancer . 2. We will build on the success of the patient and staff experience recognised by the CQC Outstanding rating. We will go further in understanding and acting upon the needs of our patients throughout and after their treatment. 3. We will further expand our networked care model and the breadth of services available in the communities to ensure fewer patients have to travel to receive the best care . 4. We will continue to offer the latest technology and develop new treatment s for the future, making our data on outcomes of treatments available to the public. We have made huge progress so far and through our ambitious strate gy, we aim to further improve a cross these four pledge s. Throughout this report, there are tangible examples of projects helping us achieve our goals and making a real difference to patient care. Seeing more clearly: Our strategy 43The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018-19 As an NHS organisation, and as a spender of public funds, we have an obligation to work in a way that has a positive effect on the communities we serve. Sustainability means spending public money well, the smart and efficient use of natural resources and building healthy, resilient communities. By making the most of social, environmental and economic assets we can improve health both in the immediate and long term even in the context of the rising cost of natural resources. Demonstrating that we consider the social and environmental impact ensures that the legal requirements in the Public Services (Social Value) Act (2012) are met. We acknowledge this responsibility to our patients, local communities and the environment by working hard to minimise our f ootprint. As a part of the NHS, public health and social care system, it is our duty to contribute towards the level of ambition set in 2014 of reducing the carbon footprint of the NHS, public health and social care system by 34% (from a 1990 baseline) equivalent to a 28% reduction from a 2013 baseline by 2020. It is our aim to supersede this target by reducing our carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 using 2013 -14 as the baseline year. Policies The Trust sustainable credentials/policies are being enhanced using the new NHS sustainable development unit sustainable development assessment t ool (SDAT). The SDAT is an online self- assessment tool, which uses four cross cutting themes: Governance and policy Core responsibilities Procurement and supply chain Working with staff, patients and communities The toolkit is being used as a baseline and w ill allow benchmarking for the T rust. The SDAT will now be used to provide a map (i.e. actions will be derived from the requirements) to aid and support staff in updating po licies to meet the new requirements, ensuring all staff move together to ensure sustainable objectives are embedded within the Trust, to meet Government, NHS and local targets/timelines, measure progress and help make plans for the future. The refreshed sustainable development committee (SDC) will drive through the objectives and obligations required. The previous sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP), Good Corporate Citizenship (GCC) toolkit actions/progress and the existing sustainable travel plan have already been used as the foundations for detailing progress/scoring and the SDAT will now be monitored by the SDC Following media programs on the effects of climate change, such as Blue Planet, it is evident, particularly in the last year, that st aff want to be more sustainable. The Trust acknowledges its responsibility towards creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. The Trust will help achieve the objectives by running awareness campaigns across the four themes, promote the benefits of sustainability and embed a culture change via policy update and promotion. Whilst climate change is at the forefront of sustainability, most recently the T rust has fully recognised its responsibilities to the local village/community, particularly the regeneration of the area. The Trust is now actively supporting the Withington regeneration partnership and has joined its membership. Local businesses such as the swimming baths/leisure c entre are participating in the h ealth and wellbeing of staff by atten ding special events ; a real partnership is developing. Policies will be developed to ensure this process is continued and embedded. Sustainability Report 44Sustainability report Energy Through 2018 and into 2019 t he Trust h as progressed with an energy project to identify a suitable partne r to support its next phase of energy m anagement. Thi s will be developed through an energy performance c ontract to commence at the end of the current energy management arrangements in September 2019. The contract the Trust will aim to enter into will provide ambit ious targets under a 'guaranteed savings m odel ' and will ensure contract monitoring arrangements are secure for the duration of the agreement. The project will improve site resilience and reduce energy related backlog. The Trust requires an energy partners hip that will address both the carbon and energy performance of the site and the potential for financial savings and carbon reduction. Grid electricity consumption and gas use have risen throughout 2018 -19 and CHP electricity generation has dropped by 8%. The increased consumption is mainly due to the addition of the PBT centre and some CHP downtime in June 2018.

There has been substantial investment in a variety of energy conservation initiatives over r ecent years. The Trust's revised energy strategy, managed with the support of the newly appointed partner from September 2019, will ensure we develop strategies that deliver continuous reduction s in future years. T he Trust has met and continues to exceed the energy reduction objectives set out by the NHS Sustainable Development U nit's Carbon Reduction Strategy. H owever, the energy strategy will be further developed to meet the strict targets imposed by the Government's Climate Change Act (2008). Our focus will be on replacing the ageing plant and equipment and delivering renewable energy initiatives. Carbon emissions were up 6% on the previous year which is due to the opening of the PBT which is expected to contribute around 31% of the Trust's overall e missions. As the Trust qualifies for the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) scheme, its liability and reporting commitments are managed in line with Environment Agency guidance. However, 2018 - 19 will be the final compliance year in CRC as the scheme is to be replaced by the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting scheme (SECR). The Trust is not required to comply with SECR but increased Climate Change Levy charges will apply. Designing the built environment Our designs for new capital developments maximise opportunities to reduce our environmental impact, improve our natural environment and make re ady for a change to our climate, helping us create environmentally sustainable care. We recognise the importance of delivering on this agenda through the design a nd build process with all projects undergoing an environmental, risk and quality assessment. Our 45The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018-19 designers are assigned projects from our consultancy framework and have been selected to ensure that they fully develop our sustainability agenda. Our capital planning team continues to process the capital programme while conforming to the guidelines of the toolkit, developed by the Sustainable Development Unit (SDU) to help cut carbon footprints and improve environmental performance. Travel We can improve local air quality and improve the health of our community by promoting active travel choices - to our staff and to the patients and the public that use our services. Every action counts and we are a lean organisation trying to realise efficiencies across the board for cost and carbon (CO2e) reductions. We support a culture for active travel to improve staff wellbeing and reduce sickness. Air pollution, accidents and noise all cause health problems for our local population, patients, staff and visitors and ar e caused by cars, as well as other forms of transport. The Trust aims to provide methods of travel which do not have a significant adverse impact on the environment or add to problems of congestion, while at the same time aiming to reduce carbon emissions in line with relevant Government legislation and the Trust's agreed sustainable travel plan. The Christie green travel plan (GTP) 2014 -2030 was prepared in partnership with Manchester City Counci l (MCC). The Trust has successfully achieved the modal shift targets from the previous five year plan and is committed to sustainable development. The intenti on of the GTP is to support Manchester City Council's carbon reduction schemes and address the Trust's commitment to good corporate citizenship. Data to mo nitor progress on modal shift is obtained annually through a survey of all site users. At the time this travel plan was written the survey had only been issued to those staff on The Christie payroll, not other site users. This indicated that 34.7% of staff members commute via sustainable travel. These results were used to form the baseline against which this GTP will be measured. The new modal shift target is to aim high with the following targets for staff using sustainable travel: - Short term (2019) - 48% - Medium term (2024) - 52% - Long term (2030) - 60% The progress of the GPT plan is monitored through quarterly meetings with an MCC travel policy officer. The survey for 201 8 indicated a 41.7 % modal shift. The next modal shift target in 2019 is to ai m for 48% with a number of actions in place to support this target including: All business cases required to consider low carbon travel Budget for cycling facilities - \u00a3245k for showers/changing facilities \u00a3100k realised in 2017 to fund sustainable travel Weekly walking group (Walking Wednesday) .

Systems are in place to ensure that the prevention, segregation, handling, transport and disposal of waste is properly managed to minimise the risks to the health and safety of staff, p atients, the public and the safety of the environment. Waste stream minimis ation and segregation legislation and guidance have been implemented in full across our whole site. External assurers undertake an annual audit, where the Trust is reported to be m eeting legislative requirements. The Trust produces data to satisfy the new NHS annual reporting manual for sustainability. Performance is continually assessed, via key performance indicators, evidence based department surveys, monthly scorecards and ke y issues reports. Increases in patient and site activity are applied and continually reviewed in the monitoring process to ensure all factors are embraced. Targets are set in line with governmental and trust requirements. Achieving the ongoing targets r elated to C O2 emissions is crucial in the T rust's endeavour to fully embrace the NHS sustainability objectives. Achievement of the targets is met by adopting 47The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018-19 the waste management strategy of prevent, reduce, reuse, recycle and rethink. In June 2018 , the Trust undertook a procurement tender process for clinical waste management and waste minimisation services. Key benefits of the procurement process ensured waste contractors complied with all waste, health and safety, environmental and transport legislat ion through focus sing on the waste hierarchy of eliminating, minimising, recycling and recovery of waste. The procurement process also required contractors to address the carbon impacts related to waste through resource, efficiency, transport impacts, and disposal arrangements. The growth of our site and patient treatments will ultimately have an overriding effect on the amount of waste generated and our capacity for waste storage. Moving forward s, the T rust will assess waste storage facilities to ensu re that the obligations of the T rust to the environment are achieved in full. Waste minimisation and management metrics are summarised in the financial and non -finance matrix of this report. Catering and food waste The catering department has maintained a monthly average of 6.04% food wastage over the last 12 months. The storage of frozen and chilled provisions has been reviewed and all freestanding fridge and freezers replaced with a walk -in freezer and fridge. The newest technology , such as LED lighting with zonal p assive infra- red sensors , has been introduced to ensure lights automatically turn themselves off where there is no activity. This provides a potential saving on energy and maintenance. The monitoring of the legislative temperature requirement s will be enhanced to demonstrate good working practic es to our internal and external stakeholders. In addition, the blast chiller has been replaced with an environmentally friendly model using R44 -8 gas. All departmental training details w ithin the cate ring department are now fully available on ESR via e-lite bites. This provides staff with the opportunity to access the training from any computer or mobile phone with the benefit of a significant reduction in paper and better use of resources. The catering d epartment continues to apply sustainability criteria to food suppliers and contractors, and these are reviewed when contracts are due for renewal. The Christie charity and the c atering department have worked together for a greener Manchester and launched a reusable cup to be sold for use within our dining room/ coffee lounge facilities. This has been a great success and we are look ing to expand the range available in the future to include a reusable drinking bottle for cold beverages and boxes for h ot/cold food to reduce known recycling wastage. Finite resource use - water 2015 -16 2016 -17 2018 -19 Water m3 102248 100661 97065 95049 tCO2e 35 35 33 33 The Trust has an obligation to provide a hygienic and safe water system for patients, staff and visitors. Whilst maintaining this system to the highest standard, the efficient use of water is carefully considered on all refurbishments and new developments. The Trust has continued to invest in the water system to improve safety . Some of these measures will have increased water consumption e.g. Kemper f low systems and Rada thermostatic taps. This has increased general consumption in some areas but measures have been taken in others to control the use of water. 48Sustainability report Modelled carbon footprint The information provided in the previous sections of this sustainability report uses the ERIC returns as its data source. However, we are aware that this does not reflect our entire carbon footprint. Using a scaled model, developed by the Sustainable De velopment Unit (SDU) in 2009 -footprint.aspx ) resul ts in an estimated total carbon footprint of 28,491 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (tCOe). Our carbon intensity per pound is 117 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per pound of operating expenditure (gCO2e/\u00a3); a verage emissions for acute services is 200 grams per pound. Biodiversity action planning The Christie understands that sustainable health requires not only effective medical treatments but also healthy environments. The value of green space and nature is reflected in the Government's b iodiversity strategy refle cting that people intuitively feel nature is good for them, and The Christie believes good environments make us feel better. Therefore our capital projects are designed to provide, wherever possible, accessible green space to help maintain ecosystems and to provide areas for exercise, relaxation and to promote wellbeing. It is our strategy to provide sustainable development which maximises green space to give a feel good factor to as many people as possible. Sustainable procurement The Trust's procurement policies and procedures incorporate appropriate sustainability practices. Significant sustainable development aspects, opportunities and risks are identified and addressed when undertaking key procurement projects. Procurement raises stakeholder awareness of and commitment to sustainable issues emphasising to project teams the importance of considering and taking into account sustainability issues when formulating procurement requirements at pre- qualification stage, when developing specifications and at tender evaluation/award stage. This in turn encourages the adoption of suppliers that are sustainable. In accordance with the Greening Government commitments the Trust aims to cut paper use year on year. Year Number of reams Events such as heatwaves, cold snaps and flooding are expected to increase as a result of climate change. To ensure that our services continue to meet the needs of our local population during such events we have developed and implemented a number of policies and protocols in partnership with other local agencies these include: Major incident plan Business continuity plan Evacuation plan Pandemic influenza plan Heatwave p lan Winter plan These are all operational plans that comply with the NHS England framework for emergency preparedness, resilience and response. Risk assessments and contingency plans are in place for specific events such as flooding and heatwave. 49The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 The Christie is internationally renowned for cancer treatment, research and education, taking pride in providing the very best care for our patients . Our employees, in whatever type of occupation they hold, consistently work to the highest standards, with individuals, teams and The Christie as a whole often being recognised regionally, nationally and internationally for outstanding work and excellence. We all work together as one team to deliver the highest possible standards of patient care, research and teaching, and as a result, regularly receive awards, accolades and accreditations. The selection below is just some of the awards we are most proud of during 2018/19. Healthcare Scientist of the Year Professor Ranald Mackay, director of medical physics and engineering at The Christie was named by NHS England as Healthcare Scientist of the Year at the prestigious Healthcare Science Awards. He collected the accolade from HRH Princess Anne at the Chief Scientific Officer's Annual Conference at the Royal Soci ety in London. The award celebrates 'an exceptional individual who has used their skills and scientific ability for a maximum patient or service user benefit, as recognised by their peers'. Professor Mackay has been instrumental in the development of proto n beam therapy at The Christie. Patient Safety Awards Our enhanced supportive care team was shortlisted in the national Patient Safety Awards in the Cancer Care category. 'Enhanced Supportive Care' was developed by specialists at The Christie and has sinc e been nationally recognised and rolled out to 23 other cancer centres across the country, supported by NHS England. The initiative encourages care teams to address more fully the needs of cancer patients - in particular, preventing and managing the adverse physical and psychological effects of cancer and its treatment. Rather than waiting until patients are in crisis, Enhanced Supportive Care ensures that patients have early access to specialist support where there are pain or symptom problems. This early intervention helps avoid the need for emergency admission to hospital. RCNi Nurse Awards Lorraine Turner, an advanced nurse practitioner, was shortlisted for the RCNi Nurse Awards for her work in identifying the holistic needs of patients referred to experimental cancer medicine trials. Lorraine was shortlisted in the Excellence in Cancer Research category. Her work recognises that people living with a cancer diagnosis can be affected in a variety of ways: some will have physical concerns, others may hav e emotional or spiritual needs, while practical and financial worries can also put significant strain on people. The project encompassed nearly 200 patients who completed a holistic needs assessment to assess their physical, psychological, family, social, religious and spiritual concerns and the effects of their illness and treatment. North West Charity Awards 2018 The Christie charity was proud to be a finalist in the North West Charity of the year category . Our charity is an extremely important part of w hat we do. It supports the work of the Trust through its fundraising activities and delivers projects, equipment and improvements that are over and above what the NHS funds. The charity has over 50,000 supporters who helped raise \u00a315.3m last year. Macmill an Professionals Service Excellence Awards 2018 The Christie secondary breast cancer nursing team was shortlisted for the Macmillan Professionals Service Excellence Awards 2018. Awards and Accolades 50Awards and accolades People living with secondary breast cancer often live with perpetual uncertainty and high levels of physical and psychological morbidity. Unlike patients with primary breast cancer, those with metastatic disease may have a limited support structure. The team recognised this disparity in care and established a dedicated service that provides secondary breast cancer patients with a clear pathway of support. Nursing Times Workforce Awards 2018 A nurse recruitment and r etention project at The Christie was shortlisted in the best recruitment experience category in the Nursing Times Work force Awards. The shortage of candidates with the right skills, abilities and experience in some areas of nursing has created a competitive market. The ability to deliver high quality, compassionate care depends upon recruiting and retaining the right peop le with the right skills. The nursing workforce is key to the success of the Trust, its values, strategic goals and objectives; therefore an effective recruitment and retention plan that complements the overall workforce plan and the Trust business plans i s essential. The recruitment and retention p roject was established to work collaboratively, take initiative, be creative and challenge the status quo to tackle and prevent recruitment and retention issues at the Trust. Kate Granger Award for Compassionate Care Christie nurse Irene Budd won the Kate Granger Award for Compassionate Care in the 1970 -79 category. Irene, 80, has been at The Christie since 1979 and was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to nursing in 2014. The Kate Granger Awards fo r Compassionate Care are dedicated to Dr Kate Granger who died in July 2016. Kate was the founder of the globally recognised #hellomynameis campaign to encourage all health and care staff, whatever their role, wherever they work, to deliver care with compassion, recognising the individual and their care needs. Greater Manchester's Building of the Year The proton beam therapy centre at The Christie was named as Greater Manchester's Building of the Year by the Chamber of Commerce. Judges were impressed by the 'truly staggering' infrastructure needed to enable cancer treatment. Care Quality Commission: Outstanding We were delighted to announce in October that we have once again been rated Outstanding by The Care Quality Commission (CQC). The Christie is the first specialist trust to be given the health regulator's highest accolade twice. The Outstanding rating was first awarded to the Trust by the CQC following our inspection in 2016. The report says that The Christie is 'a leader in cancer care' and 'is a p ioneer in developing inno vative solutions to cancer care'. The rating is the highest we could have been given and is testament to the dedicated, expert staff in every Christie department and site who work tirelessly to give the very best care and treatment to our patients. St Peter's Medal by the British Association of Urological Surgeons Urological Cancer Surgeon Professor Noel Clarke was awarded the prestigious St Peter's Medal by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS). It recognises his sustained contributions to the advancement of urology. The St Peter's medal is the highest honour that the national association can give. It is awarded annually and is the first time in 48 years that it has been awarded to a urologist in the North West. Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) recognition Three of our clinicians were recognised at The RCR Fellows Admissions Ceremony. Professor Tim Illidge won the Gold Medal, Professor Neil Burnet won the Exceptional Contribution Award, 51The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 and Professor Catherine West was awarded an honorary fellowship. Greater Manchester Research Awards Researchers at The Christie won two awards and were shortlisted in six categories at the prestigious Greater Manchester Clinical Research Awards. A team collaboration between The Christie and Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust won the Outstanding Contribution to Research award and r esearch manager Alison Walker won The Debbie and Martin Special award for 'Exceptional Experiences.' Urology Nurse of the Year Helen Johnson was named 'Urology Nurse of the Year' at the British Association of Urology Nurses annual conference and awards ceremony in November. Sustainable Health and Care Awards Congratulations to our green travel team wh ich was presented with a Highly Commended award at the Sustainable Health and Care Awards in the Travel and Logistics category. 52The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 The Christie charity provides enhanced services over and above what the NHS funds. With more than 50,000 active supporters , our charity is vital in our quest to improve cancer treatment and research for all our patients. In the last year, there have been 1,050 community events, 9,393 sporting event participants, 1,300 corporate fundraisers, 261 legators and we had support from 57 charitable trust s. Our supporters have raised \u00a313.9m. We have once again managed our costs to ensure that as much money as poss ible goes to our patients - 81 p in every \u00a31 will go towards the high standard of treatment and care for patients and their families at The Christie. From cakes bakes to sky dives , our supporters certainly didn't hold back this year. This year we introduced a bungee jump at Media City and 53 brave souls jumped from a crane suspended high in the air. We were once again Manchester City Council's charity partner for the Great Manchester Run and raised a whopping \u00a3381,000. Supporters briskly strolled through Tatton Park at our W alk of Hope event. Just over \u00a338,000 was raised on the night to honour the courage of those battling cancer and of those who have sadly lost their fight. Night of Neon lit up the sky at Salford Quays when a record breaking 617 neon dres sed supporters walked 10k around media city and Salford Quays. Our walkers raised a very impressive \u00a363,000. Our charity centre in the Oak Road main entrance has gone from strength with many supporters visiting us and purchasing our seasonal retail product s. Our carol concert at Manchester Cathedral in December saw a 678 strong audience enjoy a performance from local singer Jo Farrow and pupils from Beaver Road Primary School. Radio DJ Wes Butters was once again our host for the evening and a good festive s ing song was had by all. Our May Draper tea bar volunteers donned their aprons and served endless amounts of tea and coffee to patients. The tea bar has raised \u00a3 44,000. Our Tower Run at Beetham Tower in Manchester was a huge success this year. 217 people took part and raised \u00a3 58,000 , utilising every ounce of energy they had to get to the top of the tower. Havana nights was the theme of this year's ball. The event started with an Argentinian tango from ex strictly dancers Flavia and Vincent and culminated in a fantastic DJ set from T V presenter Gok Wan. The evening was hosted b y Cold Feet's John Thomson and raised \u00a3150,000 . Whilst we have achieved a considerable amount thanks to the support of our loyal and committed donors, our charity continues to have exciting and ambitious plans for the future. Work will continue to ensure our patients and their families receive the best care and treatment and that The Christie Our genero us supporters 53The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 remains at the forefront of research advancements. We only exist because of the fantastic support from all of our amazing fundraisers. We really do value everything that our supporters d o, whether it's raising funds or giving up their time to volunteer. 54The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Being a member is a way of showing your support for The Christie. Members can be patients, friends, relatives, staff and members of the public. We keep our members informed about the latest Trust news and invite them to special events, giving them a voi ce via the ability to elect their governor. Through the model of membership, people can influence the way we deliver our services and future strategies. Recruitment and representation By the end of March 201 9, The Christie 's total membership was 19,547 members (including staff and volunteers) . Having a large group of supporters providing a wide opinion base helps us to maintain a high profile for the Trust and develop the services we provide. We use a variety of approaches to recruit members including through our membership newsletter, as a result of community engagement by our publ ic governors and via social media and our website. As a specialist tertiary centre, we feel our membership should reflect both the size and diversity of the population we ser ve and the activities we undertake. We monitor the age, gender and ethnic mix of our membership and would like to recruit more members particularly from underrepresented groups. The council of gov ernors, through its membership and community engagement c ommittee, is responsible for ensuring that we have a representative, active and engaged membership. This is achieved through our three year membership strategy and supporting annual action plan. The next three year strategy will run from April 20 19 to March 2022 . Our governors have taken a proactive approach to engagement and go into the community and act as Christie ambassadors, being an open line of communication between the community and the hospital. We have an established and increasing group of members who have join ed our 'patient databank ' representing patients and carers. These members are invited to take part in focus groups to give us first hand feedback about our existing services and input into the ways in which we may wish to develop our ser vices in the future. Focus group topics discussed this year included patient fatigue, Equality Delivery System 2 , patient engagement, the Goals of Care Initiative , complaints responses, the electronic patient reported outcome m easures p latform , radiotherapy environment and charity fundraising. There are two constituencies within the membership, as detailed below : Public membership This is open to anyone aged 16 or over, living in England and Wales. There are currently 1 3 areas within this constituency, 1 1 based on local government electoral boundaries within our network with the others covering the 'North West' and 'R emainder of England and Wales'. There is one governor for all public areas except Manchester and Cheshire , which each ha ve two. At the end o f March 201 9 we had 16,417 public members. Staff membership Our staff and volunteers automatically become members as they join The Christie. The classes within the constituency are medical staff, nurses, other clinical professional staff, and non -clinical staff and volunteers. At the end of March 201 9 we had 2,948 staff members and 18 2 volunteer members.

I am pleased to introduce this year's quality report which once again builds on our established foundations of delivering high quality services which we were delighted were once again rated as Outstanding by the Care Quality Commission in their routine and well- led Inspections in July 2018. Our track record of publishing information on the quality of our services continues, with our integrated qua lity and performance report published monthly which demonstrates our achievements on each of the three components of quality; patient experience, safety and effectiveness of care. This annual report shows the progress we have made over the past 12 months and our quality improvement plans for the future. Through the on -going hard work and commitment of all our staff we continued to provide high quality care and services to our patients and their families. We continue to be one of the top scoring trusts for quality of care in the national inpatient survey. During the course of 2018/19 we have continued to work hard on presenting readily available information for our patients about the quality of our services. Information screens outside each ward and depart ment provide live information about safe staffing levels and achievement of safety standards. Feedback from our patients on the Friends and Family Test patients has consistently scored us at over 96% as a recommendation of a place for care. During 2018/19 a quality accreditation programme for the wards continued and all of our wards have been accredited to 'Gold' standard, the best that can be achieved. All three of our radiotherapy centres have achieved The Christie Quality Mark accreditation which means our patients will have the same high standards of care whether they come to the main site at Withington or to the centres in Salford and Oldham. The board has a quality assurance committee which scrutinises, monitors and provides assurance on our quality programmes and further assurance is given by our governors' quality committee through which our council of governors supports and advises on current quality and priorities for the future. It is the voices of our patients and their families that really make the difference both in assuring us that we get it right most of the time and more importantly letting us know when we get it wrong and allowing us to make changes. We are extremely grateful to the many people who as health and social care partners, gov ernors, members, patient representatives and our patients take the time to support and advise us. The board of directors is strongly committed to building on our existing high standards of quality and we aim to maintain our reputation for excellence throug hout the coming years, especially at a time when any additional resources available to the NHS remain limited . Our results show that we provide high quality care and we want to maintain this through the implementation of our quality plan for 2017 -2020 whi ch is a supporting plan to our five year strategy. I am pleased to present this report to you and to certify the accuracy of the data it contains. Roger Spencer Chief Executive Officer 23 rd May 2019 Quality report 57Quality Report Part 2: Priorities for improvement and statements of assurance from the board 2.1 Quality priorities for 2018/19 1. Delivering the Greater Manchester Cancer Strategy for Living with and Beyond Cancer The above quality priority was agreed by Greater Manchester Cancer Provider Board as part of the Greater Manchester Cancer Plan. The Christie will play its part in delivering the Greater Manchester Cancer Strategy for Living With and Beyond Cancer by ensuring the cancer Recovery Package is implemented for all patients by March 2019. The Recovery Package consists of four elements, three of which are hospital based and they are: Holistic needs assessment and care planning, at diagnosis and at other significant points in the patient pathway Treatment summaries, after significant phases of treatment Health and wellbeing events, providing information and support This quality improvement is part of a two year programme which commenced in 2017/18 and will be monitored and measured quarterly through the Recovery Package Implementation Group and Management Board. 2. Improving Outpatient and Pharmacy Waiting Times for the benefit of our patients Through our internal patient experience surveys, review of our performance metrics and review of our Patient Advice and Liaison Service and Complaints themes we know our outpatient and pharmacy waiting times do not meet our patients' expectations or our internal quality standards. Therefore by March 2019 we will improve our patients experience by: o 80% of outpatient pharmacy prescriptions will be available within one hour o 80% of outpatients will have been seen within 20 minutes of their appointment time This quality improvement will be monitored and measured monthly through the Management Board 3. Ensuring C onsultant Review following Emergency Admission to Hospital As part of the 7 day hospital services review the Trust has been providing audit data to NHS Improvement. This dataset designed for acute trusts is no longer required for our specialist and triage d admissions. Assurance that we are meeting our standards for our patient population is still required. Therefore by March 2019 we will ensure that: 95% of patients are seen by a consultant within the first 24 hours of admission We have clear clinical prot ocols for consultant reviews within 14 hours or earlier, and for subsequent senior input 95% of patients have documentary evidence of a plan of care agreed with the patient This quality improvement will be monitored and measured mont hly through the Manage ment Board. 58The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Outcomes of our quality improvements for 2018- 19 1. Delivering the Greater Manchester Cancer Strategy for Living with and Beyond Cancer The Recovery Package Implementation project was established to fulfil the Christies ambition to fully implement the Recovery Package in line with the national ambition to ensure \"every person with cancer will have access to elements of the Recovery Package by 2020\" (Cancer Taskforce - Achieving world -class outcomes, A Strategy For England). To enable this, a Macmillan funded team based at Christie, has been working to implement three of the four elements of the Recovery Package. Those elements are: Holistic Needs Assessments / Electronic Holistic Needs Assessments Health and Wellbeing Events Treatment Sum maries The fourth element, GP Cancer Care Reviews, does not fall under the remit of secondary care provision and as a result is outside the scope of this project. Holistic Needs Assessment / eHNA In 2018 our primary goal was to understand what existing ac tivity was being undertaken by our Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) within the Christie. The provision of holistic needs assessments for patients was in itself not a new process as this was being completed on a paper form. As such, the driver here was to recognise and respect the exiting work that is going on within teams in the hospital. To achieve this, we looked at devising a method to capture this activity via our electronic patient noting sy stem, the Clinical Web Portal (CWP). We identified a form that all CNS's complete following patient contact, therefore being a natural place to pick up on this information. The process, while producing some good results, was not perfect in the first instance and over the course of 6 months this went through a series of iterations to increase the accuracy of the completed CWP form. 59Quality Report Table 1 Initial efforts to formalise data capture, prior to implementing mandatory completion: Table 2 Following a change made to how the information was entered and making the field mandatory from October 2018. To date we have reported twice to Greater Manchester Cancer to report our quarterly results. 60The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 The data we were to report on is based from the following question. \"How many HNA's have been completed?\" 1st July - 30th of September 2018 1st of October - 31st of December 2018 Trust: The Christie Disease Group No. of HNAs completed Pathway: Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic 0 Brain/CNS 1 Brain/CNS 133 Lung 77 Breast 41 Breast 79 Sarcoma 24 Colorectal 10 Colorectal 48 Skin ex. BCCs 112 Gynaecology 144 Gynaecology 280 Upper GI 1 Haematology AML 19 Haematology Inc AML 203 Urological Inc. testicular 55 Head and neck 1 Head and neck 2 Other/unknown /undefined 189 HPB 0 Total: 1203 Lung 10 Sarcoma 6 Skin ex. BCCs 76 Upper GI 0 Urological inc testicular 10 Other/unknown/ undefined 11 Total: 329 This has been achieved via the updates to our clinical noting system as well as regular updates to our CNS teams to ensure they are engaged with this process. We have been successful in our bid to host 5 band 4 support worker roles from GM Cancer, who are going to be employed specifically to help embed our offer of eHNA's as well as supporting the other elements of the recovery package. During this period of tim e we are looking to understand the benefits this type of role will bring to the patient, the clinical teams and the organisation. Health and Wellbeing Events Since September 2018, there have been a total of 4 generic health and wellbeing events delivered by the organisation. From the outset it was made clear to all disease groups within the hospital that if there were existing disease specific events that were organised during this time, that the generic events would not supersede them. Our goal was to host 3 generic health and wellbeing events in 2018 with a view of utilising them to shape the future of events offered in 2019 and beyond. At each event, all attendees were given 61Quality Report feedback f orms and encouraged to complete them prior to leaving at the end of the event. We also held one event in April 2019. Attendees were asked to complete a demographic monitoring form and an evaluation form at the end of each session. Registered attendees : 95 Number attended: 82 (31 patients, of which 17 still undergoing treatment, 9 carers/family members, and 2 who also identified as HCPs.) Evaluation forms completed: 45 Demographics (n = 45) Age Under 24 0 25 - 44 7 45 - 54 12 55 - 64 13 Over 65 13 Gender Identity: this asked people what gender they identified with and was inclusive of trans and non- binary identities. 26 people identified as female (including trans women), 18 male (including trans men), only one person preferred not to say. Sexual Orientation - 39 attendees identified as straight and only one as gay. Three people preferred not to answer. Religion - 21 identify as Christian, 19 reported \"No Religion\" Two people identified as Muslim and one person preferred not to say. Ethni city - 37 people were white British, one was Chinese, one was Pakinstani and one of another Asian background. One person identified as from Eastern European background. Language - 41 people had English as their first language and only three didn't. Location- Ten people attended from Manchester and ten from Stockport. Five people came from Oldham, five from Warrington, 2 from Wigan and two from Bolton, one from Staffordshire, two from Cheshire Disability - 37 people considered themselves not to be disabled and only 5 people thought of themselves as having a physical disability, one person considered themselves to have another experience of disability that was not physical or a learning disability. 62The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 How did people hear about the Health and Wellbeing Events? It has been difficult encouraging patients and carers to attend the events, so we asked attendees how they heard about the events with a view to improving our marketing activity going forward. The Impact of Health and Wellbeing Events Whilst numbers of attendees have been small, there is a clear, demonstrable benefit reported by patients who have attended the sessions: 36 out of 45 people said they have started to feel more confident about dealing with life after cancer, as a result of attending a health and wellbeing event, with only three people disagreeing with this statement. 39 out of 45 said that they know where to get reliable help and advice about ongoing concerns or new problems. Two people disagreed with this question. 35 out of 45 people agreed they were more likely to access information online as a result of attending the Health a nd Wellbeing Event. 34 out of 45 people agreed they are likely to become more physically active after attending this health and wellbeing event Future plans and innovation The Trust intends to continue to deliver Health and Wellbeing Events, and continue to innovate around the format, content and delivery, including the potential for \"pop -up\" events and linking into the recently launched GMHSC prehab and recovery programme.

Definitely taking up more exercise\" \"It's been a very useful day, thank you. Patient & carer input was great, physiotherapy interaction very good, mental health sessions generated most discussion & self - help techniques very useful. Very well executed.\" 63Quality Report Treatment Summaries: During 2018 we have continued to understand what our current activity for treatment summaries is across all disease groups and treatment modalities. Initial problems with gathering this information were due in large part to not having a uniform data entry method on a single agreed platform. As it stands there is a mixed economy of the treatment summaries that are in use, though this is not across all disease groups. As with holistic needs assessments however, this is not \"new\" activity for all teams and there is evidence of some clinical teams already sending out treatment summaries to patients and GP's, though this is not a perfected method. An example of this is a medical secretary typing up a dictation onto a computer template, printing this and sending it via post. Due to this method existing externally to our clinical noting system, we have no record for the volume of treatment summaries created and by which team. We are also unable to monitor the quality of the letters. A short audit of 20 patients was carried out by our lead clinician for the implementation of treat ment summaries (TS), the results are documented below. Method: Sample: 20 patients completing treatment Nov 2018 Standards as per MacMillan Treatment Summary How -To Guide Treatment summary to be completed within 6 weeks of patient completing treatment Treatment summary sent to GP and patient Essential and Desirable data fields complete (excluded \"READ codes\") Number of patients where Treatment Summaries are complete: 64The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Treatment Summaries per disease group: % \"Essential\" Data Fields Complete: In Summary: Head and N eck and Lung using treatment summary routinely for radical radiotheapy Breast using treatment summary for chemo therapy Treatment summary more likely to be sent to patient than a non -TS letter at end of treatment Treatment summary more likely than a non- treatment summary letter to include the \"Essential\" data fields set out by MacMillan Head and Neck team seem to be leading on this. 65Quality Report Current plan: Due to the uneven nature of the completion of the treatment summary forms, we are looking toward a digital solution via out in house clinical noting system CWP. In the coming months we are looking to build and trial a form within the lung team and look to then extend this process to other disease groups in the hospital. The purpose of this form is to ensure the information contained within is written to a patient and not to a clinician, though the goal of this should be also to inform the GP of the patients progress, the primary aim of this is to inform the patient of th eir progress as well as educate about potential \"red flag\" symptoms. Once this is in place, as an organisation we will be able to report accurately on the volume of treatment summaries we are producing as well as monitor the quality of the forms includin g understanding where in the pathway they should be produced . . 66The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 2. Improving Outpatient and Pharmacy Waiting Times for the benefit of our patients 2.1 Pharmacy waiting times A key quality objective in 2018 -19 was to improve the waiting times for patients attending the outpatient pharmacy. The aim was to consistently achieve the pharmacy waiting time target of more than 80% of patients having their prescriptions dispensed, and ready for collection, within one hour of it being presented. During the course of 2018 -19 the methodology used for calculating the number of patients waiting for their prescriptions was changed, in order that this figure was more reflective of those out patients attending the pharmacy department, and their overall experience. This change made the target harder to achieve and the decision was taken to ensure there was a focus on the patients experience who were attending our outpatient clinics. The target became more difficult as pre - packaged prescriptions were excluded from the waiting times audit. The pharmacy team have undertaken a programme of continuous improvement initiatives in orde r to address the issue of waiting times, and while these actions have made some impact on waiting times they have not delivered the level of improvement required to consistently meet the waiting times target. The improvements undertaken have included actions to enhance recruitment and retention of staff; the employment of more reception staff; and changes to the skill mix in the department. In March 2019 a new waiting time computer system was introduced. This system provides improved information to patient s about the progress of their prescription, and will enable the pharmacy team to change the way work is managed in the department. It is anticipated that during 2019 -20 activity in the pharmacy will increase further, as the pharmacy department takes on mor e dispensing activity and responds to changes in how chemotherapy treatments are administered. As the quality improvement was not achieved in 2018/19, w ork will continue during 2019 -20 to address pharmacy waiting times, and in particular concentrating on how prescriptions can be electronically transmitted to the pharmacy with patients only needing to attend the department to collect their dispensed medicine. The Trust is committed to the development of pharmacy services and in the longer term this will enable further improvements which will see waiting times reduce and patient experience for a more efficient service to be achieved. 2.2 Outpatient waiting times. A key quality objective in 2018 -19 was to improve the waiting times for patients attending the outpatient department. The aim was to ensure that 80% of patients attending the outpatient department were seen within 20 minutes of their appointment time. Upon analysis of the initial data it was agreed to start by reducing waiting times to less than an hour by identifying the bottlenecks in the process and find the root cause of these. Work was then focused on addressing the root cause of these issues. During the time of this project the outpatient department moved into a \u00a36.71m purpose built unit incorporating a new patient flow system. The system allows patients to use self -check in kiosks and aids direction of patients to areas for pre outpatients tests and then to their clinic area. The new facility provides a bright and spacious environment for patients and carers. Within this 67Quality Report facility we have built on the multidisciplinary approach to care with new larger clinical hubs where all members of the multidisciplinary team are based for the duration of the clinic so that the patients have access to the research teams, alli ed health professionals and pharmacist during their visit. Findings Data was collected from the Medway (Patient system) from the time of appointment to the time that the patient was seen. Data on our business intelligence system then showed all patients that had been waiting any minutes after their appointment time. The information demonstrated that too many patients in clinics were seen outside of the 20 minute target for a variety of reasons. It therefore became necessary to focus on a few clinics and st art by ensuring all patients were seen within an hour before trying to reach the 20 minute target. The old department identified a lot of the issues related to the environment and lack of space for clinicians and it was believed these would be addressed when moving into the new outpatient building which took place in February 2019. Each month at divisional board it was highlighted the top 5 clinics where the most patients had to wait for up to an hour to be seen by a clinician. Overall we have seen a decrease in the amount of patients having to wait for 60 minutes or more to see a consultant and now aim to look at those waiting 30 minutes or more. We can see from the above data that there was a spike in January and this relates t o clinics being cancelled over the Christmas and new year period and having to re - appoint the patients. Review of the causes for delays in clinics in the \"old\" outpatient department were identified as the following: Skills and training of HCA in clinics - not performing clinical observations in a timely way and not being sure how to refer patients for tests and 1 hours to be seen patients waited over 1 hours 68The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Lack of a systematic way of identifying over run clinics and ensuring this was escalated to the senior nursing team Lack of rooms to see the growing number of referrals IT and infrastructure in the old department that required upgrading which has been achieved in the new department Ensuring staff availability when clinics overrun and recognising this impacts on the afternoon clinics Delay in blood test results due to clinic preparation not requesting the full suite of blood tests required The following actions were implemented : Computers upgraded, extra phones in clinics and analogue phones replaced with IP phones, some clinics were offered additional rooms following a review of clinic utilisation. Service managers, admin managers and front desk staff informed about incorrect clinic prep and letters and reported on each incident were documented. Additional staff made available p ast 5pm for clinics that over ran. An extra registered nurse was employed to coordinate all clinics and staffing Training guides for the running of each clinic being deployed A clinic template redesign project has commenced Improved reporting for clinical divisional boards The Outpatient and transformational team have undertaken a programme of continuous improvement initiatives in order to address the issue of waiting times, and while these actions have made some impact on waiting times they have not delivered the level of improvement required to consistentl y meet the waiting times target and therefore the quality improvement for 2018/19 was not met and this quality improvement will rollover into 2019/20 so that the ambition can be achieved for the benefit of our patients. 3. Ensuring Consultant Review following Emergency Admission to Hospital Standards for seven day care The clinical standards for seven day services in hospitals were developed in 2013 and endorsed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) for consultant -delivered acute care. These standards define what seven day services should achieve, no matter when or where patients are admitted. The four priority standards With the support of the AoMRC, four of the 10 clinical standards were identified as priorities on the basis of their potential to positively affect patient outcomes. These are: Standard 2 - Time to first consultant review: patients do not wait more than 14 hours Standard 5 - Access to diagno stic tests: patients have access to these via a 24 hour turn around (urgent requests, 12 hour and for critical situations, within one hour); Standard 6 - Access to specialist, consultant - directed interventions Standard 8 - Ongoing review by consultant twic e daily of high dependency patients, daily consultant reviews on other wards unless suitable for delegation to others. These have been the focus of work undertaken by NHS Improvement with acute trusts with an expectation that these would be in place by 2020. From 2019/20 there is a requirement to include information within Board reports. 69Quality Report The Christie position The Christie has been working with NHSI to apply the priority standards to support best care in the context of a tertiary cancer centre. There are significant differences in the patients who have unplanned admissions here compared with those that present to an acute medical admissions unit in an acute general hospital: All patients are registered and therefore known to The Christie All patients are triaged prior to admission either by the clinical team in outpatients clinic or via the Hotline team so that all admissions should be appropriate to care provided here. Patients who are experiencing cardiac chest pain, stroke, major bleed s and undiagnosed acute surgical problems would be directed to their nearest acute trust. Presentations are therefore of those with acute treatment related or cancer related problems. The large majority of these presenting problems fit with established protocols of care for example management of radiation induced mucositis, chemotherapy related nausea and neutropenic sepsis, metabolic/biochemical disturbances, ascites. There are comparatively small numbers of admissions after early evening or at week -ends. The patient pathway once admission has been agreed is through the acute oncology admissions unit. Patients are seen and assessed by their oncology teams, supported by acute physicians (Monday -Friday) and critical care outreach. Preceding the 7 day standard s, the expectation has been a consultant review within 24 hours of admission or sooner if there is a need for urgent escalation; the multidisciplinary models in oncology have established senior advanced nurse practitioners as well as senior oncology traine es, who see and assess patients in addition to consultants. There are fewer admissions at weekends and mortality data has shown fewer deaths among those admitted on these days compared with during the week. Audits of admission are regularly undertaken. The recent and previous audits have all confirmed that all admissions were appropriate for acceptance for care at the Christie. The data below describes the self -assessed position February 2018. Areas of non - compliance and work in progress Standard 2 - Consultant review within 14 hours (last audit 47%) All patients were seen by a consultant in clinics prior to admission, following admission but not within 14 hours, or time not documented in some. In this audit there were no escalations of deterioratin g patients (which would trigger immediate review). There were no patient safety issues identified where the 14 hour standard was not met. Issues: Incomplete data capture; limited hours of on site on -call consultants at week -ends (apart from critical care) Mitigation: Robust escalation policies for any deteriorating patient (confirmed by audits); care protocols for straightforward oncology interventions that do not require consultant supervision (such as drainage of ascites). Plans: Roll out of electroni c noting May 2019; planned extension of acute physician hours when workforce availability permits. Standard 6 - Access to specialist intervention: only area of non -compliance is lack of an interventional endoscopy service on site: patients would be 70The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 deferred to admission at acute trust or transfer arranged as required. No plans to develop onsite service. Mitigation: robust triaging to avoid admission here (such as upper GI bleed) or transfer arranged to acute trust if needed. In practice this is required o n few occasions and no difficulties have been encountered. Standard 8 - on going consultant review twice daily for patients on critical care; daily on other areas unless appropriate for delegation. The trust is f ully compliant for twice daily consultant rounds on oncology critical care. Currently the trust is non -compliant for daily consultant review on other wards. Issues: data capture; complexity and range of cancer sub -site specialisation and job plans with two or more days at other sites. Mitigation: there is robust escalation of deteriorating patients to oncology team, on call consultant and critical care outreach; consultant board rounds; reviews by advanced practitioners and specialty trainees; clinical protocols and capture of delegation of review . Plans: Electronic noting to record required frequency of consultant review plus delegation of reviews where clinically appropriate; recruitment of consultants with acute oncology sessions at main site. This is part of a major inpatient transformation workstream with the aim of improving patient flow and experience. Further audits will be undertaken and reported to Board Quality Assurance Committee . Our quality ambitions for 2019/20 In deciding our quality ambitions for 2019/20 we undertook a range of approaches to agree the final three to be taken forward. We reviewed themes from our complaints and concerns through Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). We asked our clinical staff to consider what the quality ambitions should be based on their interactions with the patients and the public and from their professional perspective. We reviewed the contribution required by the Trust to deliver aspects of the national and Greater Manch ester cancer strategy. We also hear from our Governors quality committee of any patient and public matters that we should consider. The Management Board, a board comprising of Executive Directors, Clinical Directors and senior managers agreed the final t hree quality ambitions and these have been shared with the Council of Governors and with staff across the Trust through the team brief. Our quality ambitions for 2019/20 1. Improving Outpatient and Pharmacy Waiting Times for the benefit of our patients In 2018/19 we agreed this quality improvement and it was not achieved. As this is an issue as described by our patients this will be a focus of quality improvement again this year. Through our internal patient experience surveys, review of our performance metrics and review of our Patient Advice and Liaison Service and Complaints themes we know our outpatient and pharmacy waiting times do not meet our patients' expectations or our in ternal quality standards. Therefore by March 2020 we will improve our patients experience by: 80% of outpatient pharmacy prescriptions will be available within one hour 71Quality Report 80% of outpatients will have been seen within 20 minutes of their appointment time This quality improvement will be monitored and measured monthly through the Outpatient board and the Management Board 2. Learning and making quality improvements from patient feedback From the outcomes of the one day every patient improvement event in May 2018 we will develop new quality metrics and improvement standards that reflect the quality standards our patients expect. We will triangulate this with our complaints and PALS data and have new quality standards in place for March 2020 . This quality improvement will be monitored and measured monthly through the Patient Experience Committee. 3. Improving Pressure Ulcer Management By March 2020 in line with NHSI recommendations (2018) we will have baseline data for the number of patients who develop moisture associated skin damage (MASD) during admission. This will inform the development of a quality improvement standard for 2020/2 1. We will maintain our standard of no category 3&4 pressure ulcers developed in the hospital There will be no more than 30 Category 2 pressure ulcers, (deep tissue injury and unstageable pressure ulcers) developed in the hospital by March 2020. This quality improvement will be monitored and measured monthly through the Executive Nursing Panel. 72The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 The Quality Improvements in the hospital are underpinned by our Quality Plan 2017/20. The driver diagram below sets out our overarching ambitions 73Quality Report 2.2 Statements of assurance from the board 2.2.1 Review of services During 2018/19 The Christie NHS Foundation Trust provided 14 relevant national health services: 1. Critical care 2. Haematology and transplantation 3. Specialist surgery 4. Endocrinology 5. Clinical oncology 6. Medical oncology 7. Acute oncology 8. Chemotherapy 9. Radiotherapy including intensity radiotherapy (IMRT) and image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) 10. Brachytherapy and molecular imaging 11. Teenage and young oncology 12. Radiology 13. Christie Medical Physics & Engineering 14. Proton Beam Therapy The Christie has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in all 14 of these relevant services. This takes place through monthly performance reviews, at our Management Board and Risk and Quality Governance committee. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2018/19 represents 100% of the total income generated from the provision of NHS services by The Christie for 2018/19. 2.2.2 Participation in clinical audits and national confidential enquiries During 2018/19 13 national clinical audits and 4 national confidential enquires covered relevant health services that The Christie NHS Foundation Trust provides. During 2018/19 The Christie participated in 100% national clinical audits and 100% national confi dential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries which it was eligible to participate in. The national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that The Christie was eligible to participate in and participated in during 2018/19 are as follows: The national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that The Christie participated in during 2018/19 are as follows: 1. Bowel cancer (NBOCAP) 2. Lung cancer (NLCA) 3. National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA) 4. Oesophago -gastric cancer (NAOGC) 5. National Cardiac Arrest Audit (NCAA) 6.

Despite an extension of the timescale, three proformas were not returned. 2.2.3 Participation in clinical research The Christie has a long history of supporting research; this was recognised in 2007 with the creation of the Research and Development Division (R&D). The R&D serves a population of 3.2 million and is the largest cancer research network in the country. The success of research is demonstrated by recruitment of patients on to clinical trials, this includes recruitment of the first patient nationally and globally. The number of patients receiving health services provided or sub -contracted by The Christie in 2018/19 that were recruited during this period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee, was 3034. This is a similar level to 2017/18 due to the increased complexity of trials and the greater proportion of early phase trials we now open which recruit low numbers of patients. Since 2015/16 there has been a 30% increase in patients recruited to research studies at The Christie. 75Quality Report 2.2.4 Quality goals and the CQUIN framework. A proportion of The Christie's income in 2017/18 was conditional upon achieving quality improvement and innovation goals agreed between The Christie and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework . The total amount of income in 2018/19 that The Christie received was conditional upon achieving the CQUIN goals was \u00a3 3,664,795. The CQUINs were fully achieved in Q1 - Q3 in 2018/19, we are awaiting confirmation of Q4. In 2017/18 the total amount of income that The Christie NHS Foundation Trust received that was conditional upon achieving the CQUIN goals was \u00a3 3,595,192 INDICATOR Brief Description Nationally standardised Dose banding for Adult Intravenous Anticancer Therapy (locally amended)Year 2 of a national incentive to standardise the doses of SACT in all units across England in order to increase safety, to increase efficiency and to support the parity of care across all NHS providers of SACT in England Two Years Achieved Hospital Pharmacy Transformation and Medicines OptimisationTo support the procedural and cultural changes required fully to optimise use of medicines commissioned by specialised servicesTwo Years Achieved INDICATOR Brief Description Adult Critical Care Timely DischargeTo reduce delayed discharges from ACC to ward level care in the same hospital by improving bed management in ward based care, thus removing delays and improving flow.

We have also seen a small increase in pre-72 hour cases of C.difficile. Whilst The Christie performance is at the higher end of the national average it was disappointing that there have been five lapses in care of the C.difficile standards (four cases were on one ward during a period of increased incidence). Remedial action plans were put in place and monitored to conclusion and there have been no further incidenc es of lapses in care.

When staff feel confident and safe to speak up the following benefits are achieved: The Trust is made aware of situations that could potentially impact on patient care The Trust has the opportunity to take action so that any detrimental consequence is avoided The Trust has the opportunity to learn Staff are able to share their anxiety about a situation and therefore reduce their stress Staff feel a greater sense of engagement, inclusion and support for Trust values Every opportunity is taken to raise the profile of the importance of raising concerns and the support available. This includes a Schwarz round where staff are able to discuss the emotional aspects of raising concerns, the provision of reflective reports by staff available on the intranet, articles in the staff magazine, displays in corridors and presentations at department meetings. It is important that staff are able to choose a way to raise their concerns in a way that is right for them and that they are confident they will be supported both during and after raising their concern. The message that they will not suffer any detriment as a result of raising their concern is of equal importance. Staff are encouraged to speak with whoever they feel is most appropriate for them, this could be their manager, the Freedom to Speak Up Guardian, the HR team, any member of the Senior team or the non -executive director with a responsibility for Freedom to Speak Up. Those who receive the concern have a clear respons ibility to listen, thank the person raising the concern and keep them updated with progress in a manner that is right for them. This could be by phone, email or face to face. In addition to the Speaking Up policy, The Christie, in partnership with trade union colleagues have developed a positive working relationships policy including a self- assessment tool which enables managers and members of staff to identify and tackle negative behaviours through a range of informal and formal mechanisms with the aim of tackling any issues or concerns at the earliest opportunity. The organisation's approach to supporting staff through this policy and subsequent breakfast seminar and educational events has been recognised nationally and shortlisted for a 2019 HPMA Social Partnership Forum award for partnership working between trade unions and employers. Those who raise concerns are asked for their views on their experience of raising a concern, including any detriment so that any shortcomings are identified and addressed . In addition to learning from staff feedback, as a direct result of feedback as part of the national staff survey, an anti- bullying and harassment listening project has taken place across the organisation to identify how the organisation can learn from staff experience in order to continually improve mechanisms to support staff at work and tackling issues at the earliest opportunity . 83Quality Report Part 3 : Other Information Review of quality performance in 2018/19 Introduction In February 2009 , The Christie adopted a framework for quality reporting (see diagram) which provides the framework for monthly quality accounts reporting as part of our regular performance reports and this annual document. The board of directors believes that quality of c are should where possible be reported and scrutinised frequently so that adverse trends can be identified early. The monthly quality accounts for the Trust as a whole are reviewed at the management board with key senior clinical leaders, as well as the directors of research and education. Quality metrics for individual divisions are reviewed as part of the regular p erformance review meetings with the executive team. Any matters of concern are followed up either through the divisional meetings or through the risk and quality governance committee. The board's Quality Assurance Committee is responsible for providing board assurance on these issues. Reports on quality of care are made to the council of governors meetings and a governor sub - committee on quality receives reports and assurance of the quality work of the Trust. The executive team regularly reviews the qu ality of care within the hospital through visits to clinical areas, through a programme of Executive walk rounds. Non -executives and governors also undertake regular visits to clinical areas to see at first hand the quality of care and environment and to hear directly from patients about their experience of the hospital. This section of our quality accounts draws on monthly performance reports and includes additional annual indicators for which annual reporting is appropriate. The data is drawn from regular surveys, audits or routine data systems that have been established to provide a focus on and assurance about quality of care. Safety Effectiveness Experience Education Research Clinical Service Components of Comprehensive Cancer Centre 84The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Patient experience Satisfaction levels with care provided at The Christie are extremely high and all our efforts are directed towards ensuring the best possible experience for patients at a time of enormous stress and worry for them and their families PLACE Assessment The quality of healthcare premises has been captured in the latest patient-led assessments. Annual patient -led assessments of non -clinical elements of care such as food and waiting areas have been published by NHS Digital on the 16 August 2018. This is the sixth year; Patient -Led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) involve teams going into NHS and private/independent hospitals to assess how the environment supports the provision of clinical care. PLACE assessments are undertaken by teams of healthcare staff and members of the public. The public members of the team, who comprise at least half of the assessing team, are known as patient assessors. At the Christie the assessment was carried out on the 23 rd April 2018. The patient assessors were recruited from the Christie membership and included an independent external assessor from Cheshire and Wirral partnership NHS Trust. Their assessments looked at areas such as privacy and dignity, food, hydration, cleanliness and general building maintenanc e, as well as the extent to which the environment is able to support the care of those with dementia. An additional assessment of how well healthcare environments support the provision of care to those with a disability was introduced in 2016. This asse ssment focused particularly on issues of access such as wheelchairs, mobility (e.g. handrails) and signage, as well as provision of visual/audible appointment alert systems and hearing loops. The report published on the 16 th August 2018 \"Patient- Led Asse ssments of the Care Environment (PLACE) 2018 - England\" covers the assessments for 2018, with comparable historical data where available. 85Quality Report 2018 PLACE Scores for the Trust All inpatient wards, except Oncology Critical Care Unit (OCCU), were assessed along with outpatient areas and oak road treatment centre. All general circulation areas were covered, including oak road foyer, lifts, corridors, public toilets, external areas, car parks C and D and the main entrances. The lunch service on three wards was also assessed. The trust continues to perform very well and all scores are well above the national average. 86The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 87Quality Report Patient experience stories to the board Board meetings are held on the last Thursday of the month at 12.45pm except for the May meeting which was held on Thursday 24th May 2018 (due to financial year end).

The CODE has enabled ward leaders and their teams to adopt quality assurance and improvement as the underpinning foundations of their everyday practice in a coherent, focused and systematic way, whilst supporting our culture of openness and candour. This framework strengthens professional leadership, empowers doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and other team members to lead and deliver quality improvements at ward level for patient benefit. There are 14 standards covering the fundamentals of nursing care, plus management and leadership. Each standard is based on current evidence of best practice, national legislation, and regulatory guidance. The aim of the Scheme is: To put patients at the centre of everything we do To celebrate excellence To demonstrate commitment to quality improvement To have methodological rigour and draw on the evidence base in the development of standards and in the process used to assess levels of performance To share best practice To be inclusive of all multi- disciplinary staff who make a substantial contribution to the delivery of clinical care All seven of our wards have now been accredited with 'gold' status and 4 of these have demonstrated maintenance of the CODE standards through annual re -accreditation. The remaining three wards will seek re -accreditation be tween May and August 2019 Work is currently underway to develop The CODE for clinical teams More information on The Christie CODE can be found at http://www.christie.nhs.uk/about Quality Strategy 2017 - 2020 Everything we do at The Christie is directed at achieving the best quality care and outcomes for our patients and The Care Quality Commission rating of 'outstanding' was underpinned by our five year strategy which is underpinned by our plans for quality and workforce. Our plans affirm the organisation's commitment to improving quality and delivering safe, effective and personal care, within a culture of learning and continuous service improvement. Having delivered against the objectives at completion of the three year tenure of the 2014 - 2017 strategy and following consultation across the organisation, in September 2017 we launched the next three year plan for 2017 - 2020. Aimed at staff, patients' carers and stakeholders this plan sets out how we will gov ern, measure, recognise, transform and improve quality in care, acknowledging the significant impact that excellent leadership, collaboration and the culture within our organisation has on the experience and outcomes for patients and the experience and empowerment of our staff. We will continue to strengthen professional leadership, empowering doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and all our other clinical and non-clinical staff to lead and deliver quality improvements. This builds on the positive and proactive work that has already been undertaken to maintain patient safety, deliver effective treatments and enhance the patient experience. We will continue in our drive to improve the quality of care for our patients by ensuring cost effectiveness and efficiency through the creative use of finite resources. And as with everything we do at The Christie our service is underpinned by meaningful communication and the provision of care by compassionate, committed, and competent staff. The plan is constructed around 4 broad objectives which will drive achievement of the trust's five year strategy and continued delivery of patient safety, effective treatment and a positive patient experience. Outcome 1 - To ensure a trust culture where high quality care and outstanding leadership are fundamental in all that we do. Outcome 2 - To promote and support quality initiatives and develop quality improvement incentives Outcome 3 - To use data to demonstrate best outcomes and achievement of established standards Outcome 4 - To ensure that the delivery of quality standards is inherent in the attitudes, behaviours and performance of the trust workforce Within this refreshed plan we have strengthened the need f or collaboration across all our services but in particular we have highlighted the synergy between quality, leadership, workforce, transformation and informatics. The joint working between these strands of the organisation will be evident in the joint func tion of the newly introduced 'Improvement Hub, established to support staff and align improvement initiatives. The Christie Quality Mark Through the five year strategy the Trust set out its ambition to deliver its services to a Christie quality mark standard that would be recognised by patients. With this ambition in mind, a patient focus group developed and agreed what the \"Christie experience\" meant to them in the form of 5 statements. We want to experience the same standard of care as if we were in The Christie@ Withington 90The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 when we have chemotherapy and radiotherapy services; We want the same safe, clean environment with standards of pride as The Christie@ Withington; We want to be greeted with a warm welcome and where we are a returning patient to be recognised by staff; We want continuity of care by our doctors and nurses and to know that we are partners in all care and decision making We want to recognise The Christie team in \"The Christie@\" sites The quality mark accreditation scheme was launched at the September 2014 annual members meeting. Through the steering group which included patients, Governors, consultants and nurses the quality mark accreditation scheme was developed, piloted and implemented. Since its launch the quality ma rk accreditations have been achieved for the following chemotherapy units: The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Acute NHS Trust, Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh NHS Foundation Trust and The Christi e Mobile Chemotherapy Unit. During 2017, the Quality Mark was developed further to include our Radiotherapy Services; and during 2018 all three of our units at Withington, Oldham and Salford achieved quality mark accreditation The Q uality Mark inspectio n was undertaken at two more units delivering chemotherapy to our patients. Mid -Cheshire NHS Foundation Trust and Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust. These hospitals and we were delighted that they achieved accreditation in Septembe r 2018 and March 2019 respectively. Of the six chemotherapy units in the original group; The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Acute NHS Trust, Stockport NHS Foundation Trust and East Cheshire NHS Trust successfully achieved their 3 yearly re -accreditation during 2018 and 2019, with the others scheduled to do so during 2019. Friends and Family Test The NHS Friends and Family Test (FFT) is an important tool whereby The Christie receives direct, regular and real time feedback from our patients. This feedback is used to help shape and further improve our services for our patients. Following their most recent experience at the Christie, patients are invited to answer the question: \"How likely are you to recommend our service to friends and family if they needed similar treatment\". Patients can respond via text message (free of charge) or on a paper form. Text messages are sent to patients within 48 hours of their inpatient stay. As an alternative, nursing staff ensure paper forms are available for patients to complete and return on the day of discharge. Patients can opt out of responding at any time. Given the number of patients who are regular patients for treatment, the text message is sent to the patient's mobile number once per month only, even if they have attended more frequently, and asks them to think about their most recent experience. Patients are asked to respond on a 1 -5 point scale from extremely likely to recommend, to extremely unlikely to recommend. Following the patient's response a second, follow up question is asked which reminds them that their comments will help us improve our servic es, and asks them to state in their own words, what the best/worst parts of the service were. Specific comments are anonymised, though patients are encouraged to contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service should they wish their comments to be handled d irectly. 91Quality Report The response rate for FFT and individual ward/department results is collated monthly and high level results published in the performance report as well as at ward level on the ward screens, where specific quotes from patients are also displayed. During the year April 201 8 to March 20 19 response rates for the inpatient ward areas ranged from 29.3 % to 42.0 % (average of 36.6%) The FFT scores, measured as percentage of positive scores ranged from 95.7% to 99.4% (average 97.8 %) for the inpatient ward areas and from 94.7% to 96.8% (average 96.0 %) for the outpatient areas. Examples of feedback received: Staff have been amazing, supportive & understanding! Brilliant team. I have been treated with respect and kindness throughout my stay. The building and treatment are first class, but the staff are fantastic. The staff are very caring, approachable, very helpful and kind. The ward is very clean and tidy. Food is great. You are all fabulous and a credit to the institution. The staff are very helpful and have been very caring. The only downside to the ward is that there are no windows Natio nal inpatient survey 2017 The Christie has again received excellent results in the annual inpatient survey by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the Trust performed better than most other trusts in all the eligible section scores. This continues the theme we have seen over the l ast number of years. 1249 patients of The Christie who had a stay of at least one night and were discharged between April and July 2017 were sent a questionnaire. The response rate was 52% when those who are ineligible are discounted. Of the 60 questions, 18 results were better than last year, 29 had shown a small fall and 6 remained the same. There was one result that showed a change upwards that was significant Being given enough notice of discharge. Whilst the Trust had an excellent set of results, four questions showed a change downwards from last year's survey that was significant; Patients finding someone on hospital staff to talk to about worries and fears Enough nurses on duty to care for patient Having enough emotional support from staff during stay Overall treated with respect and dignity while in hospital. There were no questions where our performance was worse than most other trusts. Patients were asked to rate their overall experience of care and the Trust scored a high score of 8.9. The lowest score by any trust was 7.5 and the highest achieved was 9.2 (The black diamond is the Trust score, if it lies in the green section then it is better than most other trusts, the orange indicates the same as most other trusts and the red i s worse compared to most other trusts). 92The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Following the 2017 survey an action plan was developed, discussed at Nurse Leaders Forum and monitored through the Patient Experience Committee. The outcome of the 2018 inpatient survey is expected in May 2019. Safer Staffing The Safe Staffing levels indicator is a national quality measure that was introduced in 2014. It looks to measure and ensure that a hospital's nursing staffing requirements are being met. The measure focuses on two distinct groups of staff, registered nurses and non -registered care staff. The data collected each day for both Day & Night shifts allows a member of the public to see whether the actual number of staff on duty met what wa s planned on a ward. This data is then submitted at ward & trust level nationally and is made visible on the NHS choices website as well as the Trust's internet site. The data is also made visible to patients and visitors in real- time on each ward. For 2018/19 , 95.1 % of the required hours were filled with the planned numbers of registered nurses and care staff. The monthly data on our safe staffing levels and the six monthly reports can be seen in the public Board papers which can be seen at : or https://www.christie.nhs.uk/about - us/the -foundation -trust/about -the-trust/board -of- directors 2016, all acute trusts with inpatient wards/units began reporting monthly care hours per patient day (CHPPD) data to NHS Improvement. CHPPD is calculated by adding the hours of registered nurses and the hours of healthcare support workers and dividing the total number of patients at midnight. CHPPD is reported as a total and split by registered nurses and healthcare support workers to provide a complete picture of care and skill mix. CHPPD data is now being used for peer comparison to act as a 'sense check' on professional judgements concerning nursing requirement; and is reported to the board bi - annually. 93Quality Report 3.1.

We continue to resolve complaints at source; our clinicians, matrons, ward sisters and charge nurses have a high profile on the wards and in clinical departments where they focus on the patient experience and ensuring continual improvement in care and service delivery on a day by day basis. All complaints are reviewed weekly by the executive directors and all new complaints are triaged through an executive review process so that there is a triangulation between incidents, claims and complaints 83% of written complaint responses were sent within a timescale of 25 working days Two complaints were referred to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) between April 2018 and March 2019. Five complaints investigations were concluded by the Ombudsman with four concluded as not upheld and one partially upheld Complaints s urvey The Christie has routinely sent complainants a questionnaire since August 2013 asking their views on how their complaint was handled and their opinion of the complaint response. The questionnaire was redesigned in August 2015 in line with The CQC report 'Complaints Matter' and Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman 'My Expectations' 2015. The respondents all felt confident to speak up when initially considering raising a complaint and 96The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 felt that the person to whom they initially raised the complaint to was overwhelmingly supportive and helpful. The majority of responses indicated that making the complaint was simple. The behaviour of the Complaints Team was on the found to be helpful and supportive and respondents said that they found that in genera l that their case was treated with respect and understanding. In regards to their complaint making a difference, it was split between those who maybe thought it made a difference and those who felt it hadn't, however, the majority would feel comfortable in making a complaint in the future or encouraging someone else to so.

National and local clinical audits show that the care provided by The Christie is effective in prolonging life and reducing the pain and distress associated with cancer and its treatment. As described in our 2018/19 quality accounts outcomes such as mort ality and complication rates after highly specialised, urological, gynaecological and colorectal surgery at The Christie have been reported to the board of directors and when published have set international benchmarks for standards of care. Similarly, out comes of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for specific cancer types have shown care at The Christie to be of international standard. These results are published in professional journals and discussed at the Trust's regular mortality and morbidity meetings. The board of directors receives a monthly presentation from a clinician describing a patient's story including the outcomes and effectiveness of the care that they provide. The board of directors also receives summary reports on the outcome measures. Repor ts are discussed at the quarterly morbidity and mortality meetings with the technical reports available to board members if required. Cancer survival is dependent upon the type of disease, some cancers have worse prognosis than others e.g. lung cancer an d therefore geographical differences in survival are often related to the relative incidence of poor prognosis cancers in that region. In the North West there is a particularly high rate of lifestyle related cancers in particular smoking related cancers t hat have poor prognosis. These lifestyle factors also influence how well a patient will respond to treatment. Nevertheless national published data (Figs 1) show Greater Manchester as having made the greatest improvements in all cancer survival in the Nor th West over the past 15 years and that GM has almost equivocal one year (proxy for stage at presentation) and five year (proxy for treatment quality) survival rates to those achieved across England as a whole, the gap having now almost completely closed. As a specialist cancer centre The Christie only sees patients in specific parts of the patient pathway following diagnosis rather than at the point of diagnosis and may not see some patients at all depending on their type of cancer and the stage of their cancer at diagnosis. For some cancer types only the most advanced patients are referred to The Christie. For others none of the most severe cancer patients are referred here. These differences need to be accounted for when benchmarking survival outcomes for Christie patients against national figures. Where national survival data are available by stage at diagnosis we are able to show comparable if not better 1 year survival for our patients compared to the national average (Table 1). We also publish our o wn outcomes reports available for each cancer type at http://www.christie.nhs.uk/about Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 3.2.1 Five year cancer survival 99Quality Report Table 1: One year survival by cancer type for The Christie and England as a whole. England data are based on patients diagnosed in 2012 ( http://www.ncin.org.uk/publications/survival_by_stage ). Data for the Christie are for patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2015 (time periods vary between cancer types). 3.2.2 Age-standardised 1 -year survival (%) for men (aged 15 - 99 years) diagnosed with a common cancer between 2011 and 2015 and followed up to 2016, England 100The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Age-standardised 1 -year survival (%) for women (aged 15 - 99 years) diagnosed with a common cancer between 2011 and 2015 and followed up to 2016, England Source: Office for National Statistics (ONS) Our aim is to provide leadership within Greater Manchester and Cheshire to improve awareness of cancer symptoms and to support earlier local diagnosis, for example through su pporting screening programmes. We aim to work with the providers in Greater Manchester and Cheshire to ensure effective diagnostic, treatment and referral pathways to The Christie and to ensure, through our c linical audit and other mechanisms that the treatment we provide meets best evidence based practice guidelines. As the cancer centre we have a responsibility to lead improvements in cancer services across Greater Manchester and Cheshire and whilst both on e year and five year survival rates are the result of many factors other than the services provided by The Christie they are influenced by our services. We have the opportunity to support efforts at cancer prevention and earlier detection, as well as ensuring rapid diagnosis and referral when needed. The table shows that for all cancer types the five year survival figures in Greater Manchester are similar to those for England as a whole. Differences between the figures do not reach statistical significanc e. Demonstrating that our treatments are effective is very important as is demonstrating our contribution to improvements in cancer care across Greater Manchester and Cheshire. We have selected three indicators: the coverage of our clinical audit programme , examples of outcome data available and patient safety. Clinical audit of our services provides data on the effectiveness and outcomes of care directly provided by The Christie. The audit programme is approved by the Board of directors and the outcomes of individual audits monitored by the clinical audit committee. 101Quality Report 3.2.3 Age-standardised 5 -year net survival (%) for men (aged 15 to 99 years) diagnosed with a common cancer between 2011 and 2015 and followed up to 2016, England * denotes that the age- standardised estimate is not available and the unstandardised estimate has been presented.

Upon full root cause analysis 5 of these cases were deemed avoidable by our commissioners. There were 26 cases that were identified on admission or pre 72 hours of admission and are therefore not attributable. The maximum impact of infection is a period of increased incidence of clostridium difficile of which the Trust has had one on ward 4 where four patients had clostridium difficile in a defined time period and two of the cases were found to be cross infection between two patients. Each case of CDI is subjected to a rigorous review and multi -disciplinary root cause analysis. This has demonstrated that each attributable case of CDI was induced by the specialist treatment provided at The Christie. The treatments we provide make our patients more susceptible to CDI and this is balanced against the importance of delivering effective cancer treatments. 3.3.3 Incidents Management We have a strong system of incident reporting and review which enables us to identify underlying problems and to learn from events, thereby preventing recurrence. We upload patient safety incidents from our internal system to the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). Comparison of our reporting practices with those of trusts in the same cluster of specialist trusts shows that we have good levels of reporting and low levels of patient harm, indicating an appropriate culture of reporting and learning within the organisation. Our reporting rate for patient harm incidents occurring in 2018/19 was on average 0.11% of activity (all patient episodes).

All incidents with an impact grade of 3 (moderate) and above, out of a maximum of 5, are reported on a weekly basis to the executive team. These incidents are triaged by an executive review team consisting of the Chief Nurse and Executive Director of Quality, the Medical D irector, the Associate Chief Nurse and Deputy Director of Quality, the Associate Medical D irector . The outcome of the root cause analysis is then presented to this review group. The same process is followed for complaints and claims and any concerning on -going trend of incidents of any grade. We also review our systems and processes in the light of national reports in order to ensure that similar incidents will not happen at The Christie. The data for the second half of 2018/19 is not formally closed down until the end of May 2019, therefore the data contained within these accounts is subject to further validation Patient Safety Incidences. The Christie is regarded nationally as a high reporting, low harm organisation. The Trust uploads information about its patient safety incidents into the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) on a monthly basis. Twice yearly reports are published and made available into the public domain by the NRLS, based on the incidents submitted by the Trust. In addition, monthly updates are published on the NHS Improvement website The Christie has a small number of in -patient beds, compared with o ther hospitals, and over 95% of its activity is ambulatory care (out patients and day cases). An increase in the number of patient safety incidents from 2017/18 to 2018/19 is mainly attributable to the fact that since September 2018 reactions to medication and blood transfusions have been reported as clinical incidents rather than clinical events, in line with NRLS guidance. 05001000150020002500Patient Safety Incidences 2017/18 2018/19 106The Christie Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 3.3.4 Serious Incidents There were three serious incidents reported this year. These related to: Administration of a contra- indicated medication Unexpected death following complications of elective gastrostomy insertion Safeguarding incident regarding allegation against nurse *the Serious Incident panel concluded that the death was multifactorial and not directly related to the care received following the procedure and downgraded this from a Serious Incident. Serious incident panels are chaired by a Non - Executive Director and also comprise of two Executive Directors. The panel reviewed each of these incidents, for which lessons learned were identified and implemented. 3.3.5 Duty of Candour. We have a Duty of Candour policy which is based on the requirements of regulation 20 of the Health and Social Care Act and evidence gained from national data regarding recommendations from major inquiry reports, government initiatives and the experience of other countries. Each incident handler is asked to ensure that a Duty of Candour conversation happens within ten working days for each patient safety incident graded 3, 4 or 5. The handler may arrange for a more appropriate person to talk with the patient or their family, for example the consultant or a senior nurse. Information from this initial discussion is taken account of within the incident investigation and the person undertaking the Duty of Candour keeps in touch with the patient or their family as appropriate during the investigation. At the end of the investigation, feedback is given on the outcome which will include any learning that has been identified. 3.3.6 Never Event. There have been 0 (zero) never events in 2018/19 3.3.7 Pressure Ulcers We aimed for no more than 25 category 2 or above hospital acquired pressure ulcers in 2018/19. This target remained consistent with the target in 2017/18. No category 3 & 4 hospital acquired pressure ulcers were reported. The chart below demonstrates that we have achieved the target; there have been 16 pressure ulcers category 2 and no category 3& 4 pressure ulcers that developed after admission in this financial year. An Executive Nursing Panel is undertaken to review all category 2 pressure ulcers and above . Recent NHSI guidance advises that NHS Trust's should no longer use the definition of avoidable or unavoidable. This has therefore not been included in this report. Themes arising from RCA investigations have been identified as: Inaccurate calculation of pressure ulcer risk factors. Failure to reassess risk on change of condition and change of care setting Failure to conduct a head to toe skin inspection Failure to initiate a repositioning regime for patients at risk of pressure ulcers Failure to use pressure relieving mattress pump or other pressure redistribution equipment 107Quality Report 3.3.8 Patient Falls. We aimed to maintain the 2016/17 o utturn of no more than 26 falls with harm. The chart below demonstrates that we have achie ved the target; there have been 19 inpatient falls with harm in 2019/20.

Inpatient mortality reviews at the Christie 2017/18 The Christie as a specialist trust does not participate in the HSMR reporting framework. The process for mortality reviews was established in 2011. From April 2017, mortality reviews for deaths occurring on site have been undertaken in accordance with the recommendations from the National Quality Board (National Guidance on Learning from Deaths, March 2017). The process is overse en by the Board Quality Assurance Committee and the Patient Safety Committee receives information on findings and actions form the reviews. In January 2018 Merseyside Internal Audit undertook a review of the new process and reported this had significant assurance. Areas for improvement did identify the need to improve Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 timeliness of screening completion, and follow up of learning. All on -site deaths are screened using a set of triggers for further review. This is undertaken by the mortuary team, who also a sk families about any concerns; the ward nursing team and the responsible medical team are asked to complete a brief on -line screening questionnaire. The triggers include deaths reported to the coroner, deaths within 30 days of chemotherapy, indicators of acute deterioration, planned interventions and any significant incident during the last admission. These reviews are allocated to one or more trained independent reviewers and discussed at regular Mortality Surveillance Group meetings. The RCP Structure d Case Review tool is used to define the outcome in terms of care and avoidability of the death. Concerns identified are reported to the weekly executive review group who will oversee further investigation if indicated. From Q3, mortality outcomes are included in Board performance reports. Monitoring of deaths Deaths each week are monitored by the Executive review group to identify any exceptional trends. During 2018/19 293 Christie patients died at the Withington site (as of 25th March 2019). There has been an increase over the last three years, the majority of which followed a non -elective admission. These are all Christie -registered patients, triaged prior to admission. No other factors have been identified. A comparison with the previous two year is shown below: 2016 -2017 2017 - 2018 2018 - 2019 Total deaths in year 237 271 293 Deaths following emergency admission 212 (90%) 222 (82%) 266 (91%) Emergency admissions in year deaths /total emergency admissions 4.17% admissions (excluding day deaths /total admissions 2.35% 2.51% 2.88% 111Quality Report By 25th March 2019 115 cases have been referred for structured - judgement case reviews (SCR) of which 91 have been completed. 84 cases have been further reviewed by the MSG. In 13 cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and further inves tigation. During 2018/19, 292 of The Christie NHS Foundation Trusts patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 2018/19 No. deaths onsite Triggered mortality review (number process completed to date) Q1 74 29 (86%) Q2 79 34 23 (35%) 39% of the deaths 'triggered' for a more detailed review by one or more of the categories below (one patient may have activated more than one trigger): Mortuary triggers activated Frequency Death reported to coroner 60 Death on CCU 22 Death following cardiac / respiratory resuscitation attempt 7 Death < 24 hours after admission 6 Age < 18 years - Nursing triggers Frequency DoLS in place during this admission 5 Significant mental health issue e.g. psychosis: 4 Family raised a significant concern about care in this last admission 3 Staff raised a significant concern about care in this last admission 2 A grade 3 or 4 incident OR 2 or more grade 2 incidents last admission - 112The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Clinical trigger(s) Frequency Death substantially related to or as a direct consequence of sepsis 32 Death was unexpected this admission (excluding cancer related events) 27 <30 days SACT (day 1 of any given cycle) where death may be treatment related 23 Death substantially related to or as a consequence of Stage 3 AKI 15 Other concerns where clinical team felt case review was indicated 14 Death of this patient, on this admission, is considered by you to be possibly or probably avoidable 6 Death linked to planned procedure or surgery at The Christie in last admission 5 To date, 84 (92%) reviews have been undertaken and discussed at Mortality Surveillance Group meetings (not all reviews and any subsequent process will be fully completed until the close of Quarter 1 2019 -20). No deaths in year to date have involved a patient with a learning disability. Concerns were raised by 3 bereaved families through the Mortuary screening question and reviews were triggered for each of these. These families are supported by the PALS team, with subsequent feedback offered by PALS or clinical team. Outcomes of reviews Tables below show the final outcomes of the review process year to date (validated data to end of Q3. Note these are the validated scores for avoidability of the death and overall care once any additional investigation has been completed. 13 deaths since April have been referred to the executive review group (ERG) for further investigation. Following this a final rating for care and avoidability is agreed. Avoidability Key: RCP 1 = definitely avoidable; RCP 2 avoidable; RCP 3 avoidable; RCP avoidable; RCP 5 = strongly unavoidable; RCP 6 = unavoidable and LD = learning disability The ratings for overall avoidability of death confirmed by the Mortality Surveillance Group are shown in the next table: 113Quality Report Month (2018 -19) Total Deaths (not LD) SCR final (not LD) Deaths > Deaths LD Deaths Reviewed LD Deaths Avoidable > 50% Apr 25 8 - - - - - - 8 - - - May 24 8 - - - 1 - - 7 - - - Jun 25 9 - - - - - 1 8 - - - Jul 33 15 - - - 1 1 1 12 - - - Aug 25 10 - - - - 1 2 7 - - - Sep 21 8 - - - - - - 8 - - - Oct 38 16 - - - - 2 - 14 - - - Nov 19 3 - - - - - 1 2 - - - Dec 21 4 - - - - - - 4 - - - Jan 24 3 - - - - - - 3 - - - Feb 19 - - - - - - - - 00-0 - - Mar 19 - - - - - - - - - - - Total 293 84 - - - 2 4 5 73 - - - Sub Total to Q3 231 81 - - - 2 4 5 70 - - - 114The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Assessment of care provided The final ratings for overall care in 81 reviews completed and validated to end of Q3 are shown below.

One death was investigated as a Serious Incident (subsequently down - graded); two underwent a formal root -cause analysis, and 10 required a second revie w led by either the Executive Medical Director or Associate Medical Director for Quality. As part of this process, learning is identified and a final rating for care and avoidability is agreed. In some instances, further investigation provided assurance. For example, a second review of a death relating to management of a patient with sepsis conducted by the Associate Medical Director and the trust sepsis nurse, who concluded that the clinical management was appropriate and consistent with local and national guidance. An investigation into to a missed opportunity for earlier escalation to outreach in an unwell patient identified learning relating to management of the deteriorating patient, but concluded that the death was unavoidable and earlier intervention from outreach/oncology consultant would not have changed the outcome. The serious incident investigation related to a death following a planned procedure. On hearing the outcome of the investigation, the Serious Incident panel concluded that the death was multifactorial and not directly related to the care received following the procedure and downgraded from a Serious Incident. The final overall care rating was 4 (good care) and avoidability score 4 (possibly avoidable but less than 50:50). An investigatio n concerned a death due to a complication of chemotherapy, caused by a rare enzyme deficiency (DPD) present in <1% of the population. The review identified no lapse in care although had routine screening for DPD deficiency been part of standard care, the e nzyme deficiency could have been detectable and the chemotherapy drug avoided. It was noted that there are currently no national guidelines or recommendations regarding screening patient for DPD deficiency prior to chemotherapy. NHS England has proposed an intention to commission screening for DPD deficiency through Genomic Hubs from April 2020. A working group is reviewing how this could be established earlier at The Christie while raising awareness in patients who are at risk. Learning from deaths Reviewers also comment on low level concerns (felt not to have had an impact on care outcome). A trend analysis of these has been undertaken for all reviews in year and the top themes among the low level concerns compared to the previous year. The top themes that did not adversely affect outcome but where reviewers felt there could be improvement are shown below. 116The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Actions from the reviews have included: the development of a Quality Improvement Prog ramme in interventional radiology to improve post -procedure care improving documentation and handover of Allow a Natural Death status Formation of a working group at The Christie to explore is a role for DPD deficiency screening in appropriate patients SACT delivery group introducing a pop -up to the electronic prescribing system reminding prescribers to consider stopping nephrotoxic medication when nephrotoxic chemotherapy prescribed Educating ward teams regarding process for escalating to outreach Formalis ing team -based consultant cover arrangements for in -patient care Grand Round event on Anticipating end of life and earlier 'Allow a natural death' discussions Findings from the mortality reviews have informed many of the Trust work programmes, including End of Life Care, 7 -day services and in -patient care, and ReSPECT (a communication tool to capture aims of care including resuscitation status and levels of intervention for a deteriorating patient). This information is reported 6 monthly to the Board Quality Assurance Committee. Summary A rigorous and on -going process for mortality review has been established in accordance with national requirements. This demonstrates a low level of deaths which were potentially avoidable and overall care provided was good or excellent. 6. Performance against key national priorities The Christie aims to meet all national targets and priorities. We have provided an overview of the national targets and minimum standards including those set out within Monitor's Compliance Framework below. The indicators \"18 Wee k Targets - 18 week incomplete pathways\" and \"Cancer Targets - % of cancer patients waiting a maximum 62 days from GP referral to first definitive treatment including rare and testicular cancers (based on the GM&C reallocated position , and also on the new national allocation position )\" in the table below have been subject to external assurance from our auditors 0 5 10 15 20AaND & Anticipating EoLFrequency of consultant reviewClinical ManagementCommunicationNursing documentationConsentOthers % of cases reviewed Areas for improvement per cases reviewed 2017-2018 2018-2019 117Quality Report based on the annual out -turn performance, and are marked below with: *Following a national policy change the 62 day standard has shown a decline in performance throughout 2018/19, along with the rest of the Country. Full action plans are in place to ensure that this standard will to be back on trajectory throughout 2019/20. Independent Review of Quality Reports: An assurance opinion on data quality within the Quality Report is also provided by our External Auditors, Grant Thornton who are required to perform audit work on two nationally mandated performance indicators and one local indicator mand ated this year by NHSI . The performance indicators and their criteria are as follows: Mandatory Performance Indicators The reported indicators performance has been calculated based on all patients recorded as having been referred to the Christie NHS Foundation Trust for consultant led services, against the 62 day standard and for patients who are on incomplete pathways at the end of the period. i) Maximum waiting time of 62 days from urgent GP referral to first treatment for all cancers Where the numerator is the number of patients receiving first definitive treatment for cancer within 62 days following an urgent GP (GDP or GMP) referral for suspected cancer within a given period for all cancers (ICD -10 C00 to C97 and D05) and Q2 Q3 Q4Yearly position Number of Attributable C-Diff 5 5 2 2 14 Number of MRSA Bacteraemia 0 0 0 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 31 days for diagnosis to first definitive treatment 96% 97.1% 96.1% 96.4% 97.0% 96.6% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 31 days for subsequent treatment (anti- cancer drugs)98% 99.8% 99.7% 99.6% 99.9% 99.7% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 31 days for subsequent treatment (surgery)94% 98.0% 96.2% 98.7% 98.9% 98.0% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 31 days for subsequent treatment (radiotherapy)94% 99.6% 99.7% 99.9% 99.6% 99.7% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 62 days from GP referral to first definitive treatment including rare and testicular cancers (based on GM&C reallocated position). 85% 86.3% 86.1% 82.8% 78.1% 83.4% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 62 days from GP referral to first definitive treatment including rare and testicular cancers (based on national allocated position). 85% 83.3% 80.3% 74.6% 77.5% 79.1% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 62 days from screening referral to first definitive treatment (based on GM&C reallocated position) 90% 100.0% 100.0% 88.2% 100.0% 95.6% % of cancer patients waiting a maximum of 62 days from screening referral to first definitive treatment (based on national allocated position) 90% 77.8% 91.3% 88.9% 98.6% 98.5% 6 Weeks diagnostic procedures no value 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%Cancer TargetsInfection control 118The Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 Denominator is the total number of patients receiving first definitive treatment for cancer following an urgent GP (GDP or GMP) referral for suspected cancer within a given period for all cancers (ICD -10 C00 to C97 and D05). Reallocation of breaches between Trusts are made depending on when the referral has been transferred to a secondary Trust for further treatment, with referrals made before day 42 resulting in breaches being allocated to the treating Trust but referrals after day 42 resulting in breaches being reallocated to the referring Trust. ii) Percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways Where the numerator is the number of patients on an incomplete pathway at the end of the reporting period (monthly) who have been waiting no more than 18 weeks and the denominator is the total number of patients on an incomplete pathway at the end of the reporting p eriod. Outlined below are the verbatim statements on the feedback of our quality accounts from: NHS England Specialist Commissioning The Christie Governors Statement of the Directors Independent Auditors 119Quality Report 1. NHS England Specialised Commissioning The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018/19 NHS England, Specialised Commissioning team wishes to thank The Christie NHS Foundation Trust for the opportunity to comment on their Quality Account for 2018/19. As lead commissioner, we are committed to working in partnership with The Christie to provide safe, high quality care and services. The Quality Account clearly sets out the progress against priority areas for the last 12 months and details the priorities for 2019/20. The rationale for the forthcoming years priorities are well documented. The account sets out how each priority is measured and monitored and there is clear evidence of good governance from 'ward to Board'. The Quality Account gives a thorough and detailed account of Quality at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. Commissioners wish to highlight notable achievements of the Trust, firstly in gaining 'Outstanding' for the second consecutive CQC inspection in both the routine inspection and well led, this is a testament to the hard work o f the staff and Board. The report also sets out achievements in patient experience including being in the top scoring Trusts for quality of care in the National Inpatient Survey and consistently achieving high scores in the Friends and Family test. It is e vident that patient experience and engagement is at the heart of the Trust. The Quality Account demonstrates a real focus on quality and outcomes and there is strong evidence of patient engagement and learning from patient experience, notably utilising the lessons learnt from complaints and mortality reviews to change practice to ensure continuous improvement in patient experience and care. It is evident that the Trust have used patient experience outcomes to develop 19/20 priority areas. There is a clear commitment to patient recruitment to clinical research with number of patients recruited increasing year on year. Commissioners have seen commitment to CQUIN over the last year and the Quality Account demonstrates the achievements to Quarter 3 milestones. The account also provides assurance regarding the robust governance within the Trust. There is an open and honest culture of reporting, the account details serious incidents that have occurred and shows how the learning is disseminated and changes in prac tice embedded within the organisation. The Christie has provided high levels of quality assurance throughout 2018/19 through regular contract, quality and performance meetings with Commissioners, achieving significant achievements against the National Specialised Commissioning quality dashboards. Specialised Commissioners would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all staff on their hard work in ensuring high quality care is delivered and consistently maintained throughout the year. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with The Christie during 2019/20. ANDREW BIBBY Assistant Regional Director of Specialised Commissioning (North) 120The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 2. The Christie Governors Governors Quality Statement for Quality Accounts April 2018 -March 2019 Continuing Open Relationship between the Council of Governors and Board of Directors The relationship between the Council of Governors and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust has enabled us to continue to work together throughout 2018 - 2019 and to learn from and understand the quality of the patients' experience across the Trust and see continuous improvements. The joint board of directors and council of governors' time outs continue to offer protected time for board members and governors to jointly work on quality improvements and ensure a good working knowledge of each other's remits. Our last time out was on Friday 7th December 2018. Access to Appropriate Information All Governors receive the chief executive's report and the summary integrated performance report following each board meeting with comments and questions readily invited. There are three subcommittees of the Council of Governors and executive and non -exec utive members continue to attend meetings. They provide regular updates and discuss issues with governors to keep them involved and proactively engaged. The Quality Committee The quality committee is provided with information about the quality of care. In addition, they regularly invite local managers and front line staff to give presentations, discuss specific issues so that the committee is kept informed of quality improvements and respond to any queries raised by the committee. Members of the qual ity committee are also actively supported and encouraged to meet with patients and obtain their feedback regarding the care they received and the environment at The Christie. This feedback is valued by the board of directors and the council of governors. Governors have also been involved in the Quality Mark reaccreditations and will continue to be involved when these arise. The Trust and its managers actively provide feedback to members on any issues raised and where necessary provide proactive feedback together with the efforts being made to resolve outstanding issues. Governors Evidence Based Summary Statement The above approach enables the quality committee to triangulate feedback and provide valued reassurance to the Council of Governors on key matte rs relating to patient experience. Having reflected on the comments and discussions raised at their meetings during 2018 -19 the Council of Governors believes that the Trust continues to provide a high quality and safe service for patients as evidenced by: Integrated performance reports: this document includes information on waiting times, infection rates, responses from patient surveys, serious untoward incident reports, details about the number and types of complaints received and financial information. A monthly summary from the Chief Executive: this gives information on all issues affecting the Trust and the contact details for the relevant executive staff member in case further information is required about a specific item. The report also includes regu lar updates on the Trust's 2025 strategy. Feedback demonstrates the proactive patient centred progress being made and the clear focus on staff development and support to provide high quality care and services. This is also clearly articulated in the Trust's draft annual plan which has been discussed with the Council of Governors and relevant subcommittee. 121Quality Report Feedback following the 2018 CQC inspection where the Trust was again rated 'Outstanding' by the health regulator becoming the first specialist trust in the country to be given their highest accolade twice. This followed the feedback from the 2016 CQC inspection which included factors which influenced the 'Outstanding' award and the resulting improvement plan. The annual quality report, which includes information on complaints and incident, is presented to the quality committee. This gives governors information about all the complaints that have been received; further evidence of the learning has once again been taken from complaints over the year. We are also assured that the outcomes of the complaint investigations are used to inform staff training. Information from the Patient Led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) Through 2018 -19 the committee has sought and obtained detailed insight into the following fundamental aspects of care and communications and reports from clinical areas on initiatives and new developments to improve the patient experience. These include presentations on: o Reducing the incidents of Healthcare Acquired Infections o The reduction of harm to patients who have, or are at risk of, developing diabetes o The patient meal service o Trust systems for managing incidents o NHS target to reduce e- coli blood stream infections by 10% in the first year and by 50% by 2024 The above has enabled governors to understand the mechanisms in place to address these important areas. This has provided reassurance to the quality committee and the council of governors regarding these important issues for patients and the wider community and this focus has provided valuable insight for the governors. In addition to the above the governors have access to the following: Regular communication with the Chairman of the Trust who is the Chair of the Council of Governors. Provision of the governors newslett er and lunch meetings with the Chair (attended by the non-executive directors). Freedom for all governors to attend the monthly board of directors meetings which normally include a presentation from a member of the clinical staff on the latest developments . At least one non -executive director attends the quality meetings. This practice provides a flow of information to and from the board of directors. Quality assurance committee updates are received from the non -executive chair of the committee / chief nurs e & executive director of quality. Members of the quality committee are provided with answers to any queries they may have and more detailed explanations as required. Participation in the \"Talking to patients and carers\" initiative - this is an exercise undertaken before each quality committee meeting where governors go out into the hospital and talk to patients and their families about the experience they have had. The total freedom to speak to whoever they choose (subject to advice on the patient's wellb eing on the day) gives governors the reassurance that the feedback given is a true and honest reflection of the experience patients have had. Any issues raised from the interviews are proactively reviewed by the manager and feedback is provided illustrating that all issues are taken seriously and responded to. The experience of the governors concerned, 122The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 without exception, is predominantly positive and it is almost impossible to obtain any constructive comment to help us improve our service. The committee co ntinues to produce an annual report giving details of feedback received and action taken. Minutes from all council of governor sub committees. Each year the governors, in liaison with the Chief Nurse & Executive Director of Quality and the External Auditors, choose an indicator to monitor throughout the year. The indicator can be anything from the Trust's annual external audit work programme. Updates from the relevant department are given to the quality committee in the form of presentations / reports to allow the indicator to be monitored. This year the committee has chosen complaints recording. Effectiveness The Council of Governors monitors the Trust effectiveness and efficiency through the key targets agreed for the Trust and the Trust continues to stretch itself to identify further improvements. The quality committee has been in existence since the Trust gained Foundation Trust status and this continuity means that members have a high level of awareness of the quality agenda and hence the ability t o request presentations and information they feel is beneficial. The link between this committee and the Quality Assurance Committee cannot be over -emphasised and shows how seriously The Christie takes quality in all aspects of care and treatment of patie nts. Experience The Trust has an experienced and highly committed group of governors. There are some excellent examples of community and member engagement across the areas we serve. Information gained from community engagement offers another opportunity t o ensure the patient and public voice is heard and utilised to inform quality initiatives at The Christie. Together this enables us to actively contribute to ensuring high quality patient centred care and services across The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. A presentation for governors to use for engagement purposes has been developed by the Trust and can be modified to suit the engagement situation. Based on the evidence above, the Council of Governors has confidence that the trust continues to demonstrate proactive commitment to delivering safe and high quality patient centred services to meet the needs of patients cared for by The Christie NHS Foundation Trust now and in the future. In the past year the Chair of governors has been able to guide and reass ure governors that they are continuing to help keep quality and overall performance to a high standard.

Independent Practitioner's Limited Assurance Report to the Council of Governors of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust on the Quality Report We have been engaged by the Board of Governors of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust to perform an independent limited assurance engagement in respect of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's Quality Report for the year ended 31 March 2019 (the \"Quality Report\") and certain performance indicat ors contained therein against the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and additional supporting guidance in the 'Detailed requirements for quality reports 2018/19' (the 'Criteria'). Scope and subject matter The indicators for the year ended 31 March 2019 subject to the limited assurance engagement consist of the national priority indicators as mandated by NHS Improvement : percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the end of the reporting period maximum waiting time of 62 days from urgent GP referral to first treatment for all cancers We refer to these national priority indicators collectively as \"the indicators\". Respective responsibilities of the directors and Practitioner The directors are responsible for the content and the preparation of the Quality Report in accordance with the criteria set out in the ' NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance issued by NHS Improvement. Our responsibility is to form a conclusion, based on limited assurance procedures, on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to bel ieve that: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the Criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance ; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects w ith the sources specified in NHS Improvement's 'Detailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2018/19'; and the indicators in the Quality Report identified as having been the subject of limited assurance in the Quality Report are not reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance and the six dimensions of data quality set out in the ''Detailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2018/19'. We read the Quality Report and consider whether it addresses the content requirements of the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any material omissions. We read the other information contained in the Quality Report and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with: Board minutes for the period April 2018 to March 2019; papers relating to quality reported to the Board over th e period April 2018 to March 2019; feedback from commissioners, Northwest Specialised Commissioning Hub, dated May 2019; feedback from Governors dated May 2019; 125Quality Report the Trust's complaints report published under regulation 18 of the Local Authority, Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009, dated May 2018; the 2017 national patient survey; the 2018 national staff survey; the Head of Internal Audit's annual opinion over the Trust's control environment dated March 2019; and the Care Quality Commission's inspection report dated 12 October 2018 . We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with these documents (collectively the \"documents\"). Our r esponsibilities do not extend to any other information. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (Revised) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compl iance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with the applicable independence and competency requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics. Our team comprised assurance practitioners and relevant subject matter experts. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Council of Governors of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust as a body, to assist the Council of Governors in reporting The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's quality agenda, performance and activities. We permit the disclosure of this report within the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2019, to enable the Council of Governors to demonstrate they have discharged their governance responsibilities by commissioning an independent assurance repo rt in connection with the indicators. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council of Governors as a body, and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust for our work or this report, except where terms are expressly agreed and with our prior consent in writing. Assurance work performed We conducted this limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('ISAE 3000'). Our limited assurance procedures included : evaluating the design and implementation of the key processes and controls for managing and reporting the indicators; making enquiries of management; limited testing, on a selective basis, of the data used to calculate the indicators tested against supporting documentation; comparing the content requirements of the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19 ' and supporting guidance to the categories reported in the Quality Report; and reading the documents. A limited assurance engagement is narrower in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. The nature, timing and extent of procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement. Limitations Non -financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. 126The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable, measure ment techniques that can result in materially different measurements and can affect comparability. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such information, as well as the measurement criteria and the precision of these criteria, may change over time. It is important to read the Quality Report in the context of the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance . The scope of our limited assurance work has not included governance over quality or non -mandated indicators, which have been determined locally by The Christie NHS Foundation Trust . Our audit work on the financial statements of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust is carried out in accordance with our statutory obligations and is subject to separate terms and conditions. This engagement will not be treated as having any effect on our separate duties and responsibilities as The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's external auditors. Our audit reports on the financial statements are made solely to The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's members, as a body, in accordance with paragraph 24(5) of Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006. Our audit work is undertaken so tha t we might state to The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. Our audits of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's financial statements are not planned or conduc ted to address or reflect matters in which anyone other than such members as a body may be interested for such purpose. In these circumstances, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume any responsibility to anyone other than The C hristie NHS Foundation Trust and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust 's members as a body, for our audit work, for our audit reports, or for the opinions we have formed in respect of those audits. Conclusion Based on the results of our procedures, as describ ed in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, for the year ended 31 March 2019: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the Criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual report ing manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance ; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in NHS Improvement's 'D etailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2018/19' ; and the indicators in t he Report identified as having been subject to limited assurance have not been reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance .

Poor The average prescribing rate across the Trust remains at 90%. The average for the percentage of patients where every ward round has been accounted for is at 40%. This is considerably lower than expected, in spite of interventions. Continue to collect data monthly to demonstrate improvements following intervention and Report quarterly to SMPC. Review Kardex to re- locate the Oxygen section to front page. Address nursing concerns around non- administration. Distribute Oxygen prescribing poster to raise awareness. A QIP collaborative was advised for attempting to take this project forward. Risk and Qualit y Governance Committee, May 2018 16/1781 Outpatient prescribing 2016 3. Partial Modest improvements noted in many aspects of this audit, notably for documentation of allergy status. This is most likely due to the roll out of electronic prescribing (iQemo) in the outpatient setting. Weight documentation is not mandatory and compliance reduced unexpectedly. Continue the development of e prescribing of all medication within all outpatient areas. Liaise with the clinical trials teams to review their data and maximise e prescribing, for example by returning paper prescriptions. Emails and newsletter to remind prescribers of importance of recording allergy status and weight where required. Review the audit questions in particular around electronic prescribing and re-audit in 12 months. SMPC, Jun 2018 17/1882 Annual re -audit of Intrathecal Chemotherapy 2017 3. Partial The audit demonstrated worsening areas of non - compliance with the required intrathecal documentation of doctor administering the chemotherapy and the time of administration. Drugs were collected within working hours in all but one case but unable to verify others were given in hours. Remind staff on the intrathecal register of the need to complete all details (i.e. signature and time of issue or administration). Repeat audit for 2018. SACT delivery group & DTC, Nov 2018 17/1891 Annual Safe Medicines Practice Audit: prescribing administration and storage 2017 3. Partial Areas of good compliance included demographics, allergies, prescribing. Weak areas to address included assessment of patients own medications, documentation of self -administration, printed name, designation and contact, omitted medicines (some critical medicines). Re-deploy poster highlighting how to obtain medicines & consider screen saver. Continue regular data collection and QI project approach within teams/areas. SMPC, Apr 2018 18/2189 Annual re -audit of Intrathecal Chemotherapy 2018 4. Significant Full compliance for 4 of 6 measures; nurse checking the ITC is authorised dropped to 92% and administering doctor authorised/supervised to administer ITC measure improved to 96%. Remind staff of the need for clear recording and completion of the required details. Request staff to document the reason if not administered. Repeat audit in Oct. SACT delivery group, Dec 2018 18/2276 Incidence of Hypomagnesaemia in Gynaecological Cancer Patients treated with 3. Partial The audit demonstrates that magnesium levels are not currently being tested routinely. Only one p atient on a All Gynae med onc treatment protocols now include monitoring serum magnesium levels and a Results shared with Consultant Pharmacist / Oncologists, Oct 2018 128 Platinum -based Chemotherapy clinical trial had magnesium levels taken for each cycle of chemotherapy. Hypomagnesemia is not routinely recorded on CWP. Only 3 of the 7 patients who had hypomagnesemia were treated according to the Acute Oncology Handbook. request has been made to Biochemistry to consider adding magnesium to the Christie profile (may be financial implications). 18/2289 An audit on current unlicensed prescribing practices within the Trust 3. Partial 76 patients were identified to have received an unlicensed medicine across 11 different schemes over a 2 year period to 2018. The process of prescribing an unlicensed medication needs to be standardised and streamlined across all departments. Results showed that the process of requesting authorisation of an unlicensed medicine by DTC was not being followed and when DTC gives authorisation the communication of this was not well documented. The protocol work should actually formalise the ULM process a bit mor e that currently; but still needs further work and development under the DTC. Informatics need to add an extra option on JAC under special instructions, 'unlicensed SACT.' A database should be developed by pharmacy. A new proforma to be developed on CWP, eventually to include SACT and non- SACT medication. Medicines with an off label use should also be reviewed. Benchmark processes with other cancer trusts. DTC 2018 SE18/2137 Patient Group Directions (PGDs) Audit 2018 4. Significant This audit provides assu rance that the governance processes for staff training, documentation and record keeping set out in the PGD policy are being followed appropriately in the majority of wards/departments/areas/teams in which they are being used. Reiterate the requirement for key workers to ensure that the most up to date copy of the PGD is available in the departmental PGD folders. SMPC, Oct 2018 Complementary Therapies 1 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 18/2270 Epidural Wound Dressings at The Christie 3. Partial In this study of 37 patients who underwent the placement of an epidural and developed a skin break under the dressing or tapes in 2017, no obvious themes within the possible risk factors were identified. There is no identified national guidance for epidural dressings. All lesions as a consequence of epidural dressings now being recorded in Datix as a clinical incident and photographs taken. An SOP is being written to standardise application and removal of dressings, including application of barrier film. Develop data collection tool for ongoing collation of information of potentially relevant risk factors and discuss initial data with the Anaesthetist. To re- audit once the SOP has been used for a year. If no improvement within the year, consider further ana lysis of data set through cross tabulation of possible risk factors. Dissemination through pain team, 2018 Dietetics 4 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 17/1826 Enteral Feed Documentation Re -audit 2017 3. Partial Improvements for referrals. However, bloods not being checked daily. Remind nursing staff about checklist completion Address blood monitoring - approach junior doctors TBA 17/2056 Allergen/Food intolerance/Coeliac Disease Awareness Audit 3. Partial Allergies recorded well and compliant. Food intolerances not so well recorded in this small sample. . Improve the recording of allergies/intolerances on CWP and nursing handover sheets. To review training including session for ward/kitchen staff. To re look at questions that were difficult to obtain information for and identify ways to capture this information for further audits. Nutrition Steering Group, early 2019 (TBA) 129Quality Report 18/2219 Re -audit protected mealtimes 2018 3. Partial All ward areas were well organised and meal service was tim ely, with all wards ensuring doors were closed. Poor compliance with interruptions, patients not aware of PMT, lack of menu files. Address unnecessary disruption of meal time by medics via senior staff. Communicate findings, encouraging continuation of good practice and promote the benefits of patient involvement. Review audit process to minimise subjectivity and repeat in 6 months. Nutrition Steering Group, Apr 2019 SE17/1868 Evaluation of TPN usage within The Christie 2. Weak Median length of time on TPN is 12.9 days. 20 (4%) patients on TPN over the year audited were considered by the dietitians to be on it inappropriately. In most cases TPN was stopped soon after initiation. Business case for multi -disciplinary Nutrition Support Team (NST) for specialis t management of PN as recommended by NCEPOD and NICE. Review the cases considered inappropriate to develop checklist for appropriateness of TPN and inform further plans. Re -audit. Nutrition Steering Group, Dec 2018 Health Records 1 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 18/2171 Annual record keeping 2018 3. Partial There were good results for black ink and date in this re-audit; it also showed improvement in recording the timing of entries, but more to do. Author designation and overall legibility were weak. To develop and move towards systems for electronic record keeping across the Trust; the aim is for the trust to be paperless in 2 years. A letter has been sent from the medical director to medical staff following escalation to R&QGC. Re- audit in Mar 2019. PSC, Nov 2018; R&QGC, Dec 2018 Infection Control 3 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 17/2033 Re -audit prophylactic MRSA eradication treatment and prescription 2017 3. Partial Baseline results provide good assurance that prophylactic MRSA products are being administered on OAU. Documentation around prescribing is not as good, but the newly devised drug chart does not have sufficient area for a prescriber signature. Staff survey results indicate that MRSA screening is being explained and patients reminded to use. Patient survey results showed the leaflet is not being given, the nurses are explaining the screening but were less positive about being reminded to use. 75% patients said they were using the products as prescribed. Weekly data collection to continue just for patients who have been inpatients for more than 24 hours. The date will be added to allow run charts to be produced to support regular feedback. Ward manager is pursuing possibility of a patient group direction for nurses to prescribe the MRSA prophylaxis. Infection control and ward manager, Nov 2018 18/2176 Frontline Ownership Tool (Infection Prevention and Control)2018 3. Partial The FLO audit represents a key indicator in the IPC compliance for local areas. It's used as evidence for RCAs and in the Christie Code. It gives matrons and ward managers an overview of the infection prevention 'health' of wards and departments. Compliance has improved in the last year. 9 of 28 areas were reported as not submitting an audit in January including W11 & 12. 6 areas had no remedial actions, 13 others had between 1 and 11 actions recorded, some of which were regarding full completion of the audit. Added in some new areas to cover the new Saving Lives. The IPC team ensures actions are f ollowed up in the areas and assist wards to do these. Examples include reminding staff to engage the temporary closure mechanism on sharps bin, not overfill sharps bins, BP cuffs to be cleaned between patients, clean indicator tape to be used, food to be stored appropriately, the ANTT trolley to be cleaned, and making hand gel available at every bed space. Urgent rectification of unclean rooms on OAU was sought. To continue audit. Ward results distributed regularly, Jan 2019 18/2177 Sharps Bin Audit 2018 3. Partial 20 of 23 standards have full or high compliance and 22/28 NHS areas scored 90 or higher overall. Labelling of sharps bins has fallen to 73%. Use of the temporary closure mechanism remains poor at 71% although in Review wording of the audit questions to reflect a more accurate position of the practice within the hospital.

Availability of the policy/poster has fallen slightly. compliances to the risk register. Use Bugbrief to promote the policy and poster. Request and distribute brackets for bins. Re- audit six months after this audit as per policy. Integrated Procedures Unit 2 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 18/2118 Central Venous Access Device (CVAD) care and maintenance re- audit 4. Significant Overall improvement in adhering to our four standards. There is some room for improvement, especially when it comes down to standard 1 (dressing change 24 hours post insertion). Anonymous central line care survey to be disseminated around the different wards to establish staff level of knowledge/confidence when looking after central lines. To identify any areas for training or support. Non- compliant cases were reviewed, and the proforma changed for 2019. PSC, July 2018 SE17/2041 Prospective Audit to Study Syner - KINASE use to restore Patency in Occluded Central Venous Catheters 4. Significant In this prospective audit treatment of occluded CVAD with Syner- KINASE was safe and effective in restoring patency of CVAD. Catheter occlusion clearance rates for PWO and TO combined were 84.5% and 84% after first and subsequent interventions respectively, with no adverse effects reported. This prospective audit shows promising results to assist clinicians in reaching consensus on thrombolytic protocols for the use of Syner -KINASE for occluded CVADs. The Christie input two cases to a non- renal use protocol. Poster and presentation, World Congress on Vascular Access, Jun 2018 Interventional Radiology 10 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 15/1540 RCR Audit of prevention and detection of Acute Kidney Injury in Adult Patients undergoing iodinated contrast media injections (CI - AKI) 7. Not Applicable 80 sets of data were submitted to this Royal College audit in 2015 but in June 2018 there is still no report forthcoming. Decision taken to clo se it. New guidance has been introduced locally for iv contrast and a follow up audit on this is planned. Radiology team, Jun 2018 18/2194 Audit of morbidity mortality and length of stay for nephrostomy insertions 3. Partial Our findings demonstrated that major complication rates appear in the peri -procedural setting or within 4 hours of procedure. This is similar to a day case biopsy procedure. Hence, there is sufficient evidence to perform PCN as day case procedures with appropriate post procedural nursing care in patients who are otherwise well. The group that would particularly benefit from this service are those diagnosed with malignant obstruction of the urinary tract by review of cancer surveillance scans. There would need to be provision for a more robust care service pre and post procedure, including informing patients on what to expect on the day, basic understanding of the management of the tubes and drain bags and an established pathway for patients who may encounter issues once they have been discharged home. Complication rates are in line with published literature. Consider the feasibility of provision of a day case service for otherwise clinically well patients via presentation of results, assessing logistical provisions for the service, resources needed and further steps. Radiology department interventional meeting, Jan 2019 18/2197 Audit of morbidity and mortality from CT guided lung biopsy 1. Poor Our mortality rate is higher than the national average. Although not part of the audit brief, we note that both patients who had died had not been consented for death, and the death rate had not been discussed or documented. ? The technical success rate of our chest Present findings to all operators performing chest biopsies to increase awareness of the results with a view to encourage operators to review their techniques and patient selection criteria. Present findings at the Radiology department interventional Interventional Radiology Departmental Meeting, Jan 2019 131Quality Report biopsies was above the international, but below the national standard, proposed by the ACR and RCR respectively. This could in part be explained by our sample population which has a higher morbidity rate than the general population evaluated to establish the guidelines. Increased number of adverse events coul d be related to the demanding biopsy requirements of clinical trials (i.e. increased size, number and depth of biopsies), but there was insufficient evidence to support this. meeting to debate the pros and cons of use of devices for the treatment of pneumothoraxes as well as cost effectiveness. Encourage all operators to discuss and document morbidity and mortality rates clearly and to consider pre- printed consent forms. Re -audit in 6 months. 18/2215 Audit of the Value of Abdominal Radiographs at The Christie 4. Significant Review of a random sample of 100 AXR referrals found low (17%) yield of positive findings including small bowel dilatation and bowel obstruction. A small subsection (6%) of requests featuring non- guideline indications exclusively, such as vomiting and abdominal distension, were all reported normal, suggesting unwarranted referral. 31% of patients underwent further scanning by CT, which revealed patients who were reported normal on AXR but had positive CT findings. The use of AXR in favour of selective CT referral may offer greater outcomes for abdominal symptoms where diagnosis cannot be made by clinical examination alone and avoid potentially unnecessary AXR -induced radiation exposure. However, this was acceptable practice in a small sample, so no action proposed. Radiology, Feb 2019 18/2307 An audit of the patient consent process for image- guided biopsies in Radiology. 2. Weak Results from this small student observational study with patient survey, showed that although patient satisfaction was high, there are areas in which the consent process can be improved with respect to national standards. This included initial discussion; how patients are told; content of the initial discussion; readability of patient information leaflets; asking the patient if they have questions; prepare the patient for the procedure only after consent is gained. There are plans to design a radiology -specific consent form to mandate adherence to national guidel ines. The process needs to be adapted to ensure that there is sufficient time for patients to reach a decision; initial discussions about a quality improvement project to take this forward have started.

Weak 100 patients with inoperable MBO referred for Radiological Inserted Venting Gastrostomy (RIVG) were identified and 85 Gastro- jejunostomy (GJ) tubes were placed. There was 99% technical success but 1 procedure related fatality in a patient who was of a poor performance status, and a life expectancy of less than 2 weeks. Peristomal leakage, minor irritation, peristomal infection blockages, tube migration, tube degradation or balloon rupture were among the complications. In 6 patients a venting procedure could not be performed. Symptomatic benefit was noted in the majority of patients however GJ drainage may be more beneficial for symptom control. The procedure is not risk free and should be reserved for those with a life expectancy of more than 2 weeks. Leaks are a significant cause of psychological and quality of life morbidity and provoked one patient complaint. Ability to manage predictable complications is required. Present findings to all operators performing chest biopsies to increase awareness of the results with a view to encourage operators to review their techniques and patient selection criteria, and to debate the pros and cons of use of IR devices for treatment of pneumothoraces as well as cost effectiveness. Encourage all operators to discuss and document morbidity and mortality rates clearly. Consider use of pre- populated consent forms to increase informed consent. Interventional Radiology departmental meeting, TBC Jun 2019 SE17/1979 Service evaluation of the Gastrostomy 3. Partial Good compliance was shown with the standards for No action was planned as the situation has 132 drop in clinic 2016, although the report was not fully completed due to changed circumstances. changed due to co -location of consultants and nurses and reduced availability of nutritional nurses. A further audit may be carried out in the future. SE17/2092 Audit of initial success patency rates stent replacement and secondary nephrostomy rates of Antegrade to have moderate success rate; 5 (23%) failed. Of these, 3 were not possible and 2 failed to function so nephrostomies remained in situ. To compare radiology stenting with retrograde stenting in surgery as a secondary project. To be decided SE18/2116 Length of hospital admission following radiology drainage 1. Poor Just over a quarter of chest drains requ ested in 2017 were reviewed; three quarters had a chest drain inserted for pleural effusion with an average time in- situ of 4.8 days. Output was documented only for 1/25 and only 5/13 patients discharged less than 2 days after removal. It is usual practice to obtain post removal chest x -ray, which does not add value and may further increase length of stay Obtain discharge dates for all patients. Action required to address potential to halve length of drain duration and related bed days, with financial savin gs. Radiology, Mar 2019 SE18/2206 Evaluation of MRI imaging post treatment of neck malignancies 3. Partial Around 80% of MR reports gave a definitive answer. False positive rate increased amongst MR equivocal & suspicious reports. Although the numbers for PET CT were small the results mirrored the MR reports. Considering a follow up to this baseline, with additional data for PET CT and if there is a need to implement NI RADS type reporting criteria to aid follow up imaging decisions. H&N DG, 2018 Oncology Critical Care 18 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 16/1683 NAP6 Perioperative Anaphylaxis 4. Significant National report highlights antibiotic allergy as an increasing problem suggesting that optimising preoperative allergy history could reduce the number of perioperative anaphylactic reactions. Administering antibiotics before induction of anaesthesia if practicable is recommended. Immediate management was judged good in half and a third of patients experienced harm in some form. Data not provided but no local action required. National report published May 2018 reviewed within anaesthetic team 17/1940 Cardiac arrest audit (NCAA) 2017 4. Significant A report for the year to end March 2018 was received from NCAA covering 13 cardiac arrests, the lowest of all hospitals; the small numbers make comparisons difficult. 3 patients survived to hospital discharge. Data completeness to NCAA was 100%. The non- risk adjusted rate of arrests is low compared to other hospitals. The age of patients is much lower due to being an oncology centre. For 3 patients an outpatient appointment was the reason for attendance was higher, the mean number of days from admission to arrest is lower, the proportion of patients who were deteriorating (not yet arrested) was higher than NCAA. Internal review of all cardiac arrests is carried out to determine learning; no particular learning or action identified from the NCAA report. Resus citation team, Mar 2019 17/2047 Re -audit intra -hospital critical care transfers: how are we documenting them. 2. Weak Some improvement noted in 6 of 8 standards in this re - audit, most significantly in documenting a note on return. However, overall we cont inue to fail to meet the New intra -hospital trans fer checklist and SOP designed and being implemented formally with the new transfer bag and monitoring system. Acute & Critical Care Departmental Meeting, Jul 2018 133Quality Report agreed standards in our documentation and from this it could be inferred that the quality of our transfers themselves also falls well below standards. Useful observations on possible causes and factors have been noted including availability of the transfer checklist, awareness of features of and processes for Metavision, restricted access to new monitoring system, poor introduction of the new transfer bag and numbers of new staff requiring transfer training. Metavision being updated with the new transfer checklist. Re -audit. 17/2099 Sepsis CWP Infection Care Plan Re -audit 3. Partial Since the last audit in 2016 there has been an increase in the use of infection care plans for patients meeting the criteria. However education and training does need to continue for nursing staff to ensure its proper use and completion. Continue to monitor the number of proformas for each ward via the dashboard Continue education and training of the infection care plan, explaining the rationale of why and how it is completed. Re- audit in one year making an adaption to If NO did the patient receive appropriate treatment and was this within the hour?' to consider those patients that may not have received antibiotics but in mitigating circumstances. Sepsis Steering Group 8th May 2018 by Leah Morgan, Sepsis Nurse Speciali st 17/2112 Documenting consent for anaesthesia 1. Poor The pre -operative assessment section of the anaesthetic chart was completed by an anaesthetic consultant in most cases. In nearly 60% there was some documentation of a discussion had that might constitute elements of a consent process (either an explanation of the plan, listing some possible risks etc.). In no cases was a full consent process (explanation, risks, benefits and alternatives) documented. A full consent process was not documented for any elective insertion of arterial or central lines. There was some component of consent documented in 50% cases. Accidental awareness under general anaesthesia was never documented as a risk of undergoing general anaesthesia; it was agreed that this was a serious adverse outcome that should probably be mentioned in the consent process, despite its low incidence. Although the majority of patients received a nurse- led pre- operative assessment clinic visit, there are concerns of information overload for patients. Address concerns that time limitations on the day of surgery do not enable a proper discussion to obtain consent and need to wait until after the te am brief due to an increasing frequency of surgical uncertainty in the listing of operations by carrying out a survey of the anaesthetic medical team to produce a majority consensus on what we should consent patients for in our consent process. To update t he existing guidance and information in line with the consensus agreed following the survey. Re-audit in 1 year (or sooner once change has been implemented) Critical care lunchtime meeting, Apr 2018 17/2129 Annual re -audit AAND (DNAR) 2017 4. Significant Involvement of patients and/or relatives in AaND discussions has improved to 100% overall, and just over 80% for each group individually. Recording of time, date and signature on the AaND form and related documentation in the medical notes remain fairly st atic as shown by run charts over the last few years. ReSPECT group meeting to oversee its introduction via a quality improvement initiative; the timing of further data collection to be planned around this. Spot checks carried out and an SpR survey completed to investigate barriers. Resuscitation & Deteriorating Patient Committee, July 2018 17/2144 Annual review of cardiac arrests (RCAs) 2017 3. Partial There were 10 cardiac arrests in 2017 of which 5 had a successful resuscitation with return of spontaneous circulation Two of those patients had an AaND form initiated after the crash call and died soon afterwards. Implementation of RESPECT in ongoing. To try to implement advanced care planning including resuscitation discussion for all patients with advanced disease. Resuscitation & Deteriorating Patient Com mittee, Oct 2018 134 Root cause analysis of all of them found 2 further cases where AaND form should have been in place. 18/2136 MEWS Re -Audit 2018 3. Partial Results varied from ward to ward but generally the MEWS audit results were not as good as they have been in previous years. There has been a fall in a number of key measures notably patients with score of >=2 having 4 hourly observations and observations carried out as per set monitoring frequency. Discussion with ward nurses around understanding MEWS policy and process Agree leeway on timings, for the purpose of future electronic auditing. Amend policy. Attend nurse induction talk. Assign outreach nurse to a link ward to provide smaller group teaching. R&DP committee, June 2018 (TBA) 18/2152 Preoperative airway assessment 4. Significant From this sample looks that our team is very skilled in predi ction of difficult airways and treating them correctly. Improve awareness about importance of proper documentation. Develop new anaesthetic chart with tick boxes for key information about airways to improve documentation. Re- audit 6 months after the new chart is introduced. Departmental meeting, Jan 2019 18/2153 ICNARC Case Mix Programme (CMP) 2018 5. Full All results across the indicators in the ongoing ICNARC reports are better than comparable units and the national average. Continue to participate; no other action required. Acute and Critical Care Directorate, 2018 18/2190 Cardiac arrest equipment (crash trolleys) re-audit 2018 4. Significant Trolleys checks met desired standards in 2018 for all but HTU OPD. Spot checks of Inpatient areas indicated non compliances in all but one area. Spot check content of trolleys to continue; results provided to areas. Resuscitation and Deteriorat ing Patient Committee, Oct 2018 18/2229 An Audit of the Supportive Care Team Referral Forms 3. Partial Completion of sections of the forms very good with the medications section most likely to be missed, although this is still completed in the majority of referrals. However for more than a third of referrals the information was too short to be adequate. Two thirds of referrals were for pain but the site of pain was not indicated for a third of these. There was variation in when patients are referred for 'end of life' care suggesting definitions are unclear to staff. It highlighted wider issues in regards to late referral of patients. Overall the audit has prompted discussion around late referrals and inappropriate referral, highlighting potential need to co nsider new ways of working. To redesign the Supportive Care Team referral form. Liaise with other team members working on triage of referrals. To discuss potential new ways of working, such as attending board rounds on the wards in order to try and pick up patients that require SCT input earlier. Consider re- audit in 12 months, dependent on whether new changes from ongoing inpatient work render this unnecessary. Supportive Care Team weekly education meeting, Jun 2018 18/2249 Documenting consent for anaesthesia re - audit 3. Partial With a limited sample in this re -audit, the proposed new chart appears to allow us to better meet the minimum standards for documentation of consent to anaesthesia and related procedures; documentation of discussion on the c hart, including risks and verbal consent all achieved good compliance and documentation of alternatives and awareness as a risk improved. To review, revise and formally implement a new anaesthetic chart. To review, revise and consolidate current pre- operat ive information provided to patients. To produce online information resources that patients can access prior to attending for surgery. Re- audit in 1 year. Lunchtime departmental meeting, Jul 2018 18/2279 Trust Wide Fluid Balance Audit 3. Partial Although there is still room for improvement, since introducing the new chart improvements in fluid balance recording have been made in the pilot areas. Staff feedback influenced chart amendments which led to improvement at each iteration and resulted in a chart New fluid balance chart to be ratified by Patient Safety Committee and printed to overcome resource issues on wards. Commence education and training on new chart in all remaining inpatient areas and launch th e chart in these, followed by Patient Safety Committee, Feb 2019 135Quality Report that is beneficial to all areas within the trust. the same for outpatients. Weekly audits to be carried out by ward staff with support from the AKI nurses and a dashboard to communicate results. 18/2293 Re -audit intra -hospital critical care transfers 2 1. Poor Improvements were observed in 6 out of 8 standards, the best of these being documenting a note on return. Overall we continue to fail to meet the agreed standards in our documentation and from this it could be inferred that the quality of our transfers the mselves also falls well below standards. Reasons for this are believed to include large volume of new staff, restrictions for use of new monitoring system and transfer bag to OCCU nurses only, awareness of the transfer tab in Metavision and no more paper c opies of the transfer checklist. To design and introduce a new intra -hospital transfer checklist. Update SOP and Metavision with the new intra- hospital transfer checklist. Investigate whether data can be retrospectively uploaded to Metavision from the new monitoring system. Formally introduce the new transfer checklist along with the new regional transfer bag and new monitoring system. Identify person to lead data collection for re- audit. Acute & Critical Care Departmental Meeting, Jul 2018 S18/2238 Patien t and Family Satisfaction Survey (Critical Care) 4. Significant Very good levels of patient satisfaction were received with no negative responses and some very positive comments. There were some suggestions including improvements to relatives facilities and a wider range of aprons. In 2018 OCCU has completed a programme of works to improve both the waiting area for OCCU relatives and the accommodation area. The OCCU Relatives accommodation can cater for up to two families utilising the facilities overnight with access to other Christie accommodation if required. At each bedside OCCU now uses different coloured aprons for each bed space for Christie staff to utilise. Peer Review Report; ACCD staff meeting August 2018; Patient Safety Committee, 2018 SE17/2046 Surveillance of Blood Stream Infections in Patients Attending ICUs in England (ICCQIP) 2017/18 3. Partial On-going project. 2017/18 data gathering demonstrated an increase in blood stream infection which is being investigated thoroughly by CCU Nursing team and Infection Control team. Critical care, 2018 SE18/2368 Re -audit evaluation of outcomes of unplanned medical admissions to the Christie critical care unit 2. Weak There were fewer emergency referrals in 2018 compared to 2016, with almost the same number of admissions. There was more agreement between CCU consultants and the clinical teams about the ceiling of care for patients. However there were still 5 patients who received level 3 care when the admitting CCU consultant thought it should be level 2; there was 80% mortality on the unit for these patients. 3 month mortality overall is similar to 2016 at 42%, though worse for haematology patients; APACHE mortality ris k scoring where possible to obtain, matched this well. Need to improve CCU confidence and communication between teams, involving the parent consultant including out of hours. Consider joining handovers and increasing outreach engagement. Obtain a second opinion where there is disagreement and increase communication with patients and relatives. CCU teaching meeting, Jan 2019 Patient Flow 2 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations SE18/2126 Clinical effectiveness audit of patient flow policy 3. Partial Data from this challenging week, showed an average of 25 daily unplanned admission requests, reducing to 12 at weekend due to lack of outpatient clinics and radiotherapy treatments. Findings showed 77% of unplanned requests allocated a bed within four hour s, but excluded an error, average time for bed allocation was 1 hour 20 mins. All the diverted patients due to lack of a bed were escalated to DCCO's in hours and A full audit is planned once the new Admissions policy has been embedded. This should include ; level of staff knowledge to target for future training, planned discharges from wards before midday to PATS or home, infection control updates and side room occupancy and risk by 10.30 am, patient flow manager working seven days a week, identified OCCU step downs within 4 hours and core Risk & Quality Governance Committee, Mar 2018 136 EOC out of hours as per policy. An incident and timeline was recorded for the 3 days when required. attendance at 10.30 PF daily meeting. Incident reporting and root cause analysis may be safely replaced by an IRF timeline completed by patient flow team and submitted through Datix for monitoring and reporting. A wider audit of the patient flow, including delays and escalation of patients medically fit for discharge may be added within future the patient flow work streams. SE18/2205 Patient Experience attending elsewhere 3. Partial Data from various sources reviewed. The proportion of patients not admitted with reason recorded as no bed reduced month on month to Mar 2018. The proportion of beds allocated with 4 hours rose to 94% in March with unplanned admissions more likely to wait longer. Policy was followed for diverted patients. UKONS 24 hour triage tool needs to be implemented on CWP as soon as possible. Patient flow admissions operational policy updated. A full re-audit planned after implementation. June 2018 Physio and OT 4 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 17/1998 Service evaluation of the occupational therapy role on the Oncology Assessment Unit re-audit 4. Significant Since the previous audit in 2017, the profile of the occupational therapist on OAU and collaboration between OAU and therapy team has improved substantially. The significantly increased workload generated by the greater number of referrals to t he service indicates the need for a full time therapist in post on OAU. The goal of maintaining referral to treatment times within 24hrs remains high (96%). 20% of the patients referred on whilst on OAU have a full assessment and 67% of patients referred have some form of occupational therapy input. Reflect on the most appropriate and effective way to raise awareness of occupational therapy in the treatment of acute oncological patients on OAU and the valid contribution to early discharge planning. Liaise w ith the OAU manager and improve the clarity of referrals to the service. Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy teams team meeting/in- service training, 2018 SE18/2244 Review of quality of implementation Fatigue group management as a new service at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust 5. Full 96 patients attended this new service on 4 wards in 14 months. Almost all patients rated the group as good or very good overall and all but one found it useful and would recommend it. According to the patient's feedback, advice regarding energy management was most useful, followed by exercise. Occupational therapy team to liaise with clinical audit team to structure the questions to produce more specific and measurable feedback. To pilot the fatigue group as an out patient service, which would extend the occupational therapy service to outpatient clinics. To educate CNS's on importance of fatigue management via the CNS meeting. To book a slot for fatigue management at the health and wellbeing event at The Christie. To discuss staffing levels and time constraints with rehab unit manager to increase the service. Re- audit in a year. Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy teams at their staff team meeting, Oct 2018 SE18/2277 A Review of Frailty Assessments and Discharge Destinations of patients referred to occupational therapy at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust. 3. Partial Three quarters of patients met the national standard that the majority of frail patients referred to hospital occupational therapists should be discharged home. No definitive correlation found between age increase and higher levels of frailty in this patient cohort. Increased length of stay was not directly correlated with age. The Rockwood Frailty Score, though effective for To review the range of frailty assessments and identify a holistic tool that will measure the impact of Occupational Therapy input. To review a standardised functional assessment that can be utilised alongside the frailty assessment chosen. Later life interest group, tbc 2018 137Quality Report retrospective data and gaining a basic understanding of a patient's dependency level, does not seem to be an appropriate tool to define frailty within this setting. It also does not effectively reflect the impact of Occupational Therapy input on levels of frailty. SE18/2278 Evaluate the referral system from palatine ward to therapy team (Occupational therapy & Physiotherapy). 2. Weak Only a third of 50 referrals were received with the correct paper form; this was consistent over 3 months. 9 patients were discharged before they could be seen by the therapy team and more were close to discharge, some patients were too unwell, and consent from the patient was not always sought. Educate staff about referral criteria and roles of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy within the Haematology ward. Meet with transplant CNS's to discuss need of therapy input from admission. Therapist to attend ward x2 per week to have handover from co -ordinator. Develop referral criteria and provide as a visual aid on the ward. Re- audit. Rehabilitation Department and Palatine Ward department meetings, March 2019; Haematology study day, TBC 2019. Psycho Oncology 2 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 18/2353 Mental Capacity Assessment Best Interest Decision Making and Deprivation of Liberty re- audit 2018 3. Partial This trial of CWP forms has shown a marked improvement in the quality of documentation of the online mental capacity assessment , with 100% meeting standards. The introduction of an online best interests meetings proforma has been utilised more than the online capacity assessments; 2 of 27 had a concurrent online capacity assessment form. Continue to educate clinicians a bout the availability of these electronic patient forms on CWP, particularly targeting those who are not completing them. To consider adding a reminder at the top of the best interests meeting form. To re- audit. SE17/2064 Pilot implementation: psychological screening and psychological interventions for distress and depression in the Head & Neck and Haematology clinics 4. Significant Results from this pilot indicated that it is possible for clinical teams to screen for depression and suicidal ideation in clinic and that an oncology nurse can be trained with support from a psychiatric service to deliver collaborative care for depression. For all patients, the oncology nurse liaised directly with the GP to request a review of the patient's mood and medication; GPs responded very positively. The most frequent other interventions included medication changes, safeguarding and psychiatric review. There is a case for recommending this model of depression screening and management in disease groups with high levels of depression and at high risk of suicide- i.e. lung, stomach, oesophagus and pancreatic cancers. In addition, the pilot makes a strong case for all clinicians to assess psychiatric co-morbidities in new patients. Head and neck and haematology teams, Aug 2018 Speech Therapy 2 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 18/2275 Benefits of SLT Swallowing Therapy on H&N Patients 3. Partial This data set provides evidence to support the vital role of speech and language therapy in improving the lives of this patient group. Dysphagia for head and neck cancer patients has a huge impact on the quality of life as evidenced by several patients wishing to continue with oral intake despite aspiration risks. Over two thirds had a positive change from therapy input and a quarter had psychological issues relating to their cancer. Data used to support business case to address need for speech therapy resources to improve quality of life in survivorship. Speech and Language Therapy department, Feb 2015 SE19/2441 An approach to risk stratification model for patients with Head and Neck cancer in order to effectively target Speech and Language Therapy support through and beyond chemo / radiotherapy treatment 4. Significant Results of Macmillan Innovation supported pilot to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of increased and systematic speech and language interventions in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy demonstrated the benefit of pro- active support before, during and after radiotherap y to help Subject to further funding, on -going modifications to improve the pathway, and ongoing review of the enhanced risk stratification tool to improve accuracy, the new preventative model is now becoming embedded in our practice. Quality Assurance Committee, Feb 2019; GM Pathway Board, Head and Neck Cancer, Jan 2019 138 optimise swallow recovery for patients. At the 3 month endpoint of the project, 50% of patients had already achieved their therapy goals for swallowing and could be discharged eg could eat and drink out in public again and did not require texture modified food. High risk patients were identified and transferred to Community Speech therapy services for ongoing rehabilitation more promptly. Swallow function improvements and positive patient experience, alongside a sense of greater fulfilment for the Speech therapists are leading to change. Issues to address include a greater workload for SLTs within shorter timescales and in limited physical outpatient or radiotherapy clinic environments. Surgery - Colorectal & PTS 16 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 15/1592 Splenectomy as part of Cytoreductive Surgery for PMP patients 4. Significant Splenectomy is necessary in almost 40% of patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). This can be performed safely with minimal early complications. Recurrence following CRS and HIPEC is low and rates are similar with or without splenectomy. Prospective data collection also showed that all patients were discussed at a Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting, vaccinated at least three weeks before elective surgery where appropriate and received long- term antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of post splenectomy related infections. The data co llected has supported reports regarding the need for splenectomy and where there can be preservation during cytoreductive surgery. Abstract submitted and presented in Amsterdam 2016 16/1827 National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) patient audit (year 4) 4. Significant Fully compliant with 7 standards, including reporting of CT before surgery, the documentation of which is now better captured. Risk documented before surgery improved to 67% cases. All surgery is consultant led. There is no MCOP (Medical Crises in Older People) specialist at the Christie so assessment of patients >70 years not considered applicable. P-POSSUM scoring pre -op implementation in progress. Due to change in inclusion criteria there are fewer cases included than anticipated. Continue to participate in NELA audits. Colorectal team, Mar 2019 17/1980 Bowel cancer (NBOCAP) 2017 4. Significant The Christie was identified as an outlier when looking at 18 month stoma rates in the NBOCA 16- 17 report. In all other areas we are above average in the performance indicators. The stoma rate is a consequence of our practice; 56/62 patients were given permanent stomas due to the extent of their disease. The Christie T4 staging rate for those with stomas was 53% (26% T3) against the NBOCA data set T4 rate of around 7%. On review of cases considered possible to reverse there is only 1 outstanding patient decision which is due following a forthcoming CT scan. Continue the good practice; reason no action required for 18m stoma rate advised to national team and CQC. Colorectal and Peritoneal Oncology team, Feb 2019 139Quality Report 18/2060 NPSA Oral Bowel Cleansing 2018 4. Significant The re -audit has shown stable compliance for completing the indication, medical history and medications however there has been a further decline in compliance for the completion of contra- indications. Results across 8 other standards were good. Actions continue to re -audit annually and ensure renal profiles are undertaken for those patients having Picolax including eGFR. Implementation of nurse led endoscopy clinic to assess/screen patients prior to colonoscopy. Safe Medicines Practice Committee, Colorectal Business Meeting, Endoscopy Users Group, date TBC 18/2151 Pre -operative blood transfusion requests 4. Significant An initial study fo und 50% compliance with the blood transfusion protocol for surgical units. 89 units were requested but only 8 were used. Teaching session held for all current and new junior staff; to be included in future induction programmes. The colorectal surgical cons ultants agreed revised blood transfusion guidelines and practice was re -audited at above 90%. Colorectal Research Group, 2018 18/2348 Pre -operative blood transfusion requests re-audit 3. Partial Compliance with local guidelines fell but is still above that measured in the first audit. The number of units requested is lower than the first audit. Transfusion was needed in 5 of 18 cases. Implementation of re -education programme for junior staff. Revise blood transfusion guidelines after discussion with colorectal, Urology & Gynaecology consultants. Pilot and re- audit within a month of implementation. Colorectal Research Group, 2018 CE15/1541 Temporal pattern of PMCR referrals 4. Significant Study indicates low complication rates and survival advantages compared with traditional non- surgical treatments. NCI CTAE grade 3/4 complication rates were 9.4%; 30- day mortality was 0.85%. Median OS following CRS/HIPEC was 46.0 months: patients not receiving CRS/HIPEC survived 13.2 months. Increasing awareness of th e potential benefits and low risks of CRS/HIPEC for CRPM should promote an increase in referrals. An experienced MDT should mentor new providers reducing the learning curve for selecting patients for potentially curative treatment of PM of colorectal origi n. Peritoneal Surgical Oncology team; submitted to the JCO, Jul 2018 CE16/1731 Changing patterns of referral and treatment in Psuedomyxoma peritonei 4. Significant Over the 14 years the Christie Colorectal and Peritoneal Oncology Centre (CPOC) has been operating, there has been year on year increases in the number of patients referred with pseudomyxoma peritonei. Patients are increasingly being referred in the early stages of this disease, when the likelihood of successful treatment is much higher. Earlier referral of patients with precursor lesions allows an increasing number of patients to be managed either by risk reducing surgery or active surveillance. The impact on long term survival is being monitored over time. No further action identified. Poster submitted to ACPGBI 2016 (awarded distinction rosette); RSM, Dec 2016 (awarded the Norman Tanner Prize); accepted for publication in the Journal of Colorectal Disease, May 2018 QIP18/2248 Colorectal Ward Round Audit 3. Partial Following the introdu ction of a new colorectal notes booklet, \"skinny files\" (a current admission slim set of notes) and use of a notes trolley) results improved across all measures for notes quality, which was statistically significant for 8 measures out of 14. Non significan t improvements in 5 measures. Patient Labels although not on every page were in every booklet. Continue to use the skinny files, notes trolley and colorectal notes booklet to improve case not quality. Room for improvement : ID stickers on each page of the booklet. Ensure staff wear gloves when examining wounds. Engage staff in the ward round to close the curtains, check the obs and drugs charts, fluid balance and drain output. Re- audit. Colorectal team, Nov 2018 SE17/1951 Total Pelvic Exenteration (TPE) for Primary and Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer 4. Significant Overall, this study has shown that pelvic exenteration can be performed with good oncological outcome and low rates of mortality. This study supports current evidence that R0 resection is fundamental to favourable survival outcomes. In all of the key quality standards, the reported outcomes for the Christie fell Maintain current standard of care; no action required. Colorectal research team meeti ngs between Nov 2017 and Mar 2018; also being submitted to a journal. 140 within the 95% CI reported or was higher. SE18/2127 Treatment options and outcomes for patients with Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm type II 3. Partial A significant proportion of LAMN II patients with normal CT scans having L- CRS/HIPEC were found to have EALD, with good mid- term survival outcomes. The risk of these patients developing PMP without surgery needs to be further quantified. L- CRS/HIPEC can be safely performed in well -selected LAMN II patients and results i n a significantly shorter post -operative stay, justifying the increased operative time. No action identified Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI) conference, Sep 2018 SE18/2149 Central line care in colorectal patients 4. Significant We identified that the colorectal surgical team were 100% compliant with the Local Christie Guidelines for the removal of central lines. An infection rate of 4% was noted which is within the acceptable parameters. We have not observed a direct association between length of time central line is in place versus infection rates. Continue with current practice. Colorectal Research Meeting, 2018 SE18/2150 Post -operative blood testing for colorectal patients 3. Partial 32 patients studied over 4 weeks and their blood investigation frequency monitored from postop Day 1 to the last day of data collection. All patients met standards for blood investigations sent, surgical treatment received and frequency of blood monitoring. To standardise the timings of speci fic blood tests as set out in the recommendations. Discussions are currently being held with the surgical consultants. New colorectal surgical guidelines for post-operative blood testings to be created. Colorectal Research meeting, Apr 2018 SE18/2213 Goblet cell carcinoid tumour of appendix: outcomes following CRS & HIPEC 4. Significant Right hemicolectomy showed no statistical significance on patient outcomes although a high rate of malignancy within the removed tissue demonstrated the benefit of this procedure. These results may also be a result of selection bias as this is a retrospective study. Tang C advanced T and N stage and PCI score of 4 or more were all significantly associated with less favourable patient outcomes. The standard of a minimum of one scan (post -surgery) was met in all but one case.

SACT delivery group, Jan 2019 Clinical Oncology 17 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 17/1848 Stage 1 NSCLC Northwest sector 3. Partial Whilst the majority of patients recommended for radical treatment received it as recommended by the MDT, there were delays for 19 patients (18%), recommended for surgery, but found medically inoperable. These patients were re- referred for radiotherapy but median treatment times were nearly doubled. Improved decision making within the MDT, particularly with regards to selecting patients for surgery, could be achieved with more careful consideration of patient age, PS, comorbidities, and lung function. Accurate estimation of PS and comorbidity score at time of patient presentation is imperative. A business case has been raised for a joint surgery -oncology clinic in Greater Manchester which could reduce waiting times for treatment in a proportion of patients, however further studies are needed to determine the effect on treatment outcomes and patient survival. APEP presentations, Jul 2017; BTOG, Jan 2018 17/2016 In patient admission of Head and Neck patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy 3. Partial 56 (55%) patients treated with concurrent chemo - radiotherapy for head and neck cancers developed Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) of whom 91% were admitted. 10/14 patients taking ACE -I were advised to stop. 53% patients had more than 10% of weight loss after treatment. Nearly two thirds of all patients were admitted during the course of treatment overall with mean length of stay 8.1 days. Statistical analysis is to be undertaken to identify risk factors for AKI in this cohort. Aim for early identification of those at higher risk of AKI in order to optimise their management and reduce emergency admissions.

Haematology Oncology Edu cation meeting, May 2018 CE15/1521 Adherence to the radical chemo - radiotherapy schedule in HIV positive anal cancer patients: a retrospective case- matched study 3. Partial Slightly more HIV positive patients than HIV negative patients completed chemo- radiotherapy without radiotherapy treatment gaps. A quarter of gaps were due to Bank holidays. HIV positive patients received similar radiotherapy, but less chemotherapy treatment as compared with the HIV negative patients. HIV positive patients were twice as likely to be admitted overnight as HIV negative patients. The CD4 count of HIV positive patients is measured, either by The Christie or another healthcare institute, and formally documented and dated in the patient notes. Review these cohorts for a prolonged follow up period to establish long term tumour outcomes. GI away day, Sep 2015; APEP student presentations CE16/1747 Long -term Swallowing Outcomes after Chemoradiotherapy for Oropharyngeal Cancer 3. Partial This study highlights that long term swallowing dysfunction is prevalent amongst a large cohort of oropharyngeal cancer patients, treated with chemoradiotherapy across two centres. Amongst our patients, 32% reported composite MDADI scores below 60, which would suggest poor swallowing function. Altered pre- treatment diet, poorer performance status and requirement for enteral feeding during treatment were all significantly associated with poorer MDADI outcomes on multivariate analysis. Although each centre in this study used differing treatment techniques and radiotherapy dose fractionation schedules, there was no significant difference in long term MDADI outcomes between Leeds and The Christie. In view of the significant impact of long term swallowing dysfunction on quality of life, it is important not only to counsel patients appropriately prior to treatment, but it remains a priority to develop treatment strategies which may reduce this toxicity. Accepted for publication by Radiotherapy & Oncology (the Green Journal), Jun 2018 QIP17/2057 Improving safe Cisplatin delivery and compliance in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced Cervical cancer 3. Partial Completion of all planned Cisplatin chemotherapy is relatively low in this sample compared to published data (27% patients completing all five cycles, 57% completing four or more). Hospital admission was required for 12 (27%) patients with non- neutropenic infection the main cause. Total treatment times were acceptable with the majority of patients completing treatment within 50days. Those with longer treatment times tended to be those in whom brachytherapy was not possible who went on to have an external beam boost. Aim to increase the proportion of patients safely completing all cycl es to above 35% through development and pilot of a checklist for ore-chemotherapy assessment, prophylactic G -CSF from week 2 onwards. Chemotherapy omissions will be recorded prospectively; also to check overall treatment time and thrombocytopenia does not increase with G -CSF. If successful to implement checklist on CWP. Gynaecological clinical oncology away day, Apr 2018 SE17/1866 Assessment of time from biopsy to surgery histology result and commencement of 3. Partial Time from surgery to commencing radiotherapy improved over the two time periods audited. In 2014 Continue to work towards reducing the time from surgery to treatment to < 6 weeks for the majority Head and Neck QA meeting 147Quality Report radiotherapy treatment started an average of 6.8 weeks after surgery, by 2016 this has fallen to 6.3 weeks. The reduction was achieved largely through shorter times from in itial oncology review to starting RT, falling from an average of 25.9 days to 22.3 days. The period of time from surgery to clinical oncology consultation remained relatively static at 21.5 and 21.7 days respectively. The time from surgical specimen being available until review also remained static at 10 and 10.7 days over the two periods. In 2014 25% of patients commenced radiotherapy within 6 weeks of surgery, as recommended by NICE compared with 42% in 2016. The figure commencing radiotherapy within 8 w eeks also rose, from 85% to 92%. of patients.

H&N QA meeting, Dec 2018 SE18/2217 Audit of the use of Radiotherapy in Manchester lymphoma practice 3. Partial Overall 94% of patients with bulk>10cm were correctly attributed an X -modifier. At the MDT 82% were recommended or considered for radiotherapy and 67% of patients with bulk disease received radiotherapy. In addition 94% of all patients with DLBCL were given radiotherapy within 4 weeks of the treatment recommendation. Actions are being confirmed re adoption of the Lugano classification system as the use of the X - modifier to record bulk disease is outdated. Instead a single dimension and site should be recorded and those with bulk >7.5cm should be considered for radiotherapy. If bulk disease is documented and radiotherapy is not proposed, then the reason for not doing so should be recorde d at MDT. Lymphoma DG, planned 2018 SE18/2225 Knowledge of e -cigarettes in Lung cancer patients 7. Not Applicable Overall e -cigarette usage was low in this group of Lung cancer patients. Their knowledge was also poor but this may have been due to the age and frailty of this group of patients and the small number of patients (7) who had tried e- cigarettes. This was in big contrast to young people (year 7/8 and year 11) whose knowledge was much better in our other survey. No action identified. Lung DG, 2018 SE18/2281 Audit of local recurrence following partial breast radiotherapy 4.

No action required. National meeting (unnamed), Nov 2018 SE18/2303 Re -audit blood transfusions for patients with an anal cancer diagnosis undergoing chemo- radiotherapy 4. Significant Fewer patients required a blood transfusion during their radical chemo- radiotherapy compared to the previous audit. Patients who required transfusion did not have abnormal HCT levels prior to commencing radical chemo -radiotherapy, as compared with the previous data. It can be inferred that there has been a significant reduction in the patient's requiring transfusion during radical treatment for anal cancer, since the implementation of VMAT radiotherapy. In the future consider studying whether changes in the provision of treatment has any further effect on the myelosuppressive nature of concurrent chemo- radiotherapy. Colorectal clinical oncology group, Nov 2018 148 SE18/2349 Identify incidence of disease recurrence after radiotherapy and residual disease in the cohort of patients treated with anal VMAT 3.

Haematology Quality meeting, Jul 2018 18/2260 Haematology Capacity re -audit 2018: Chemotherapy peer review measure 14- 3S-408 4. Significant The number of new cases for higher intensity treatment has increased from 70 to 81 (16%). The number of emergency admissions has decreased from 46 to 24 (48%). No deaths are attributable to infection or complication of treatment. All admissions to the Christie were appropriate and the numbers have reduced from two thirds to less than a third of patients. The hotline plays an essential role in the management of this patient group providing the opportunity for early ass essment and management of symptoms which on some occasions could be managed in the community with the assistance of the GP. Further analysis of the 5 patients admitted for nausea & vomiting is required to assess if these admissions resulted from omission of anti -emetics on discharge and could have been managed in the community.

Data shows dose reductions and treatment deferrals were most commonly seen during those receiving carboplatin chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant patients had more dose reductions and consequently had a dose intensity of <85%. Unable to assess all standards. No actions available yet; auditor now on mat leave. Breast DG, 2018 17/2009 HATRCA 2017/18 4. Significant 52 instances of Hospital Acquired Thrombosis were identified for the year to Mar 2018. Root cause analysis was carried out for 78% of them by Oct 2018. For all but two, the root cause was considered to be disease or treatment related. There were no deaths related to the VTE and only 3 said more could have been done to prevent the VTE. An audit of line related thrombosis is planned. Improving communication about the risks and benefits of having LWMH to be considered at Thrombosis committee. Thrombosis Committee, Oct 2018 17/2088 Enhanced Supportive Care Outcomes Project - extension 3. Partial This Masters disse rtation reported a statistically significant increase in symptom burden between baseline and follow up. The most common symptom was pain, and this was the most common reason for referral to the SCT. Patients reported a significantly higher symptom burden than clinicians at both baseline and follow up. There was no statistically significant difference in change in symptom burden from baseline to follow up between patients who were and weren't referred to the SCT. Use of the IPOS form to facilitate a proactiv e referral pattern to the SCT for patients entering a phase I trial is feasible. Both clinician and patient reported symptoms may be useful in assessing adverse event burden of phase I patients. Future work with a larger cohort of patients may better demon strate the benefit of ESC for phase I trial patients, or help identify subgroups of patients who benefit in particular. MSc presentation, 2019 18/2045 Factors governing mortality from Febrile neutropenia in cancer patients re- audit 3. Partial The study found that factors that could predict mortality from febrile neutropenia at the start of a line of chemotherapy were: age, Charlson comorbidity score These results should be validated in a larger study and could form the basis of a prognostic tool for predicting mortality from febrile neutropenia in APEP presentations, Jul 2018 150 >5, presence of liver metastases, pre -existing renal impairment, ECOG PS >0, steroid use >2weeks and use of topoisomerase inhibitors. Biomarkers that could be predictive at the start of a line of chemotherapy or at each cycle were raised levels of ALP and LDH. It also found that risk factors for developing febrile neutropenia included early cycles of the patients first line chemotherapy and lymphopenia at the start of treatment. cancer patients at the s tart of treatment. 18/2161 Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP): Audit of management and outcomes since introduction of CUP MDT at The Christie Hospital 4. Significant 66 new patients were referred in the financial year, an 24% increase of CUP referrals. The number of patients seen by the CUP CNS at their first consultation remains stable; this would have been appropriate for 4 patients, but there is a lack of cover for the post. Where patients are not seen on their initial visit they are reviewed by the CNS on subsequent visits. The percentage of patients referred to palliative care services has reduced slightly to 78% of applicable patients. The number of patients seen within in 2 weeks of referral has improved however increasing demand on the service may make this standard more difficult to attain in the future. The number of patients receiving chemotherapy or other treatment modalities has increased with a reduction in the number of patients receiving best supportive care than in the previous 12 months. Areas for improvement identified as CNS review at initial consultation, specialist palliative care referral offered and timely patient appointments, ideally by the next clinic available following referral. Feedback will be provided to the network to emphasise the need for early referral to ensure that patients are well enough for treatment and that patients whose performance score is >3 would not be suitable candidates for systemic anti -cancer therapy. Annual audit to be carried out. CUP team, 2018 18/2173 Impact on prognosis and management of bone metastases in patients diagnosed with neuroendocrine neoplasms. 3. Partial Rate of bone metastases in patients with NENs seems to be lower than previously expected with just over half at the time of diagnosis of other distant metastases. Most patients will develop some degree of symptomatology from bone metastases (pain 61%). Radiotherapy use was adequate, despite being reported to be below standards (limited to use in patients with refractory pain). Use of bisphosphonates was below standards for other tumour types with a longer prognosis probably due to lack of guidelines for patients with NENs. Guidelines to standardise practice and management of bone metastases in patients with neuroendocrine tumours being developed. Re- audit in 2 years. NCRI (poster presentation), abstract to European Society of Neuroendocrine Tumours (ENETS) a nd UK and Ireland (UKINETS). 18/2191 30 day mortality following SACT 2018 3.

Patien t Safety Committee OCT 2018 SACT Delivery Group OCT 2018 151Quality Report 18/2224 The Management of Nausea and Vomiting in Patients with Advanced Cancer 3. Partial Good compliance with nausea and vomiting symptom response to antiemetic medication, follow -up with supportiv e care team and appropriate health professional. However only a third of patients' symptoms resolved with antiemetic medication. The audit data highlight the complex nature of nausea and vomiting in cancer patients and its management and the need for future research in this area. The supportive care team provide excellent support for symptomatic patients but are limited by available antiemetics. No changes recommended based on this data. APEP student presentations, Jun 2018 18/2282 Re -audit of The Neuroe ndocrine (NET) service - your views 3. Partial Communication between health professionals considered adequate for majority of patients. The number of patients feeling they had enough time with the health care professional has fallen slightly. Around a quarter of patients indicated partial understanding of information given. Patients who are attending for scan results only will have blood test performed on the day of the scan, rather than when they attend clinic.

HPB business meeting, Oct 2018 CE16/1784 Outcomes following docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophagogastric cancer 3. Partial 97 patients identified with OG cancers who received docetaxel in the general oncology setting 2012-17 had an OS comparable to that in randomised trials, but experienced significant toxicity. Grade 3 or worse toxicity was experienced by half the patients. D ose reduction was required for more than a third, and a quarter stopped therapy due to toxicity. The median OS for all patients was 5.8months. No action identified. Oesophageal cancer team, Mar 2019 S18/2299 Homecare pilot scheme re -audit 2018 5. Full 100% patients completing the survey rated the standard of care received as excellent. All patients preferred Christie at Home location for care, were adequately informed of treatment times and felt staff dealt with their anxieties. Expansion of the service to include medications for patients treated for renal, lung and melanoma in 2019. Further drugs being reviewed to check those that are suitable for delivery at home.

SACT delivery Group, Jan 2019 SE17/1857 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced inoperable colorectal cancers 7. Not Applicable Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) achieves a high resectability rate in patients with locally advanced colon adenocarci noma (LACA) deemed unresectable at diagnosis. However, this patient group still has a relatively poor prognosis; median OS was 42 months. Mature data will be presented at the meeting. No action identified. Abstract submitted, ESMO, 2019 SE17/2065 Effect of nodal status and yield on survival after curative resection of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 3. Partial Removal of LNs (Lymph Nodes) is associated with greater risk of relapse in G1 & G2 GEP NETs; localisation also has a significant association with RFS (relapse- free survival), necessitating stricter surveillance. Median follow up times for all patients were 41 months and 71 months for RFS and Overall Survival respectively. Larger prospective studies are required to vali date these findings. No further action identified. Submitted to ESMO, 2018 SE17/2108 Assessment of weight change after one cycle of palliative chemotherapy as a predictive marker of survival in metastatic Oesophagogastric patients. 3. Partial Patients who had a weight reduction of =3% of baseline had statistically significant shorter median OS compared to those who did not have such weight reduction (7.2 vs. 14.2 months, log -rank p=0.011). A multivariate Cox proportional regression model including age, gender, histology, weight loss, PS and radiological response indicated that a weight loss of =3% were independently and statistically associated To ensure staff are aware of the results and reminded to assess and document nutritional parameters at the initial consultation and each subsequent outpatient attendance. To increase the cohort and validity of results and consider prospective intervention study to examine if early nutrition interventions to support weight maintenance from cycle 1 to cycle 4 and beyond. UGI team meeting, Nov 2018; dietetic team, 2018; ESMO Oct 2018. 152 with OS. 47% (n=54) of patients completed six cycles of first line palliative chemotherapy. Of the 68 patients who had stable disease or a treatment response after cycle 3, 38% (n=26) had weight loss of =3% from baseline and are a target for nutrition interventions at the start of chemotherapy. SE18/2124 Survival and clinical impact of pembrolizumab for pretreated advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 4. Significant Our c ohort demonstrated similar survival outcomes to KEYNOTE- 010. Baseline Derived Elevated neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio dNLR <3 and good/intermediate Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) score was associated with significantly improved OS (overall survival) comp ared to dNLR =3 and poor LIPI score significantly prognostic of PFS (progression free survival). No action identified Poster, European Society of Medi cal Oncology, Dec 2018 SE18/2160 Second primary malignancies in patients with non- pulmonary Non-pulmonary well -differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (wdNETs) are associated with high rates of Second primary malignancies (SPMs). Most SPMs are diagnosed pre- NET, potentially indicating treatment - induced selection of neuroendocrine differentiation clones. A high proportion of NETs are diagnosed incidentally. The association between colorectal cancer and SB -NETs supports previous propositions of colonoscopy use in the work up to NET diagnosis, and association of breast cancer and pNET diagnosis may suggest a possible common pathway alteration in phosphoinositide-3- kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase- B (AkT)/mTOR pathway. Tumourigenic peptides secreted by functional NETs do not appear to have an impact on SPM development. No action identified. Submitted to the NCRI conference, Glasgow 2018 SE18/2234 The use of 2nd generation ALK inhibitors in lung cancer 4. Significant As part of this active project and expanding network, a multicentre retrospective analysis across 23 active NHS trusts was conducted. The ALK+ UK Patient Group has been supporting the expansion of thi s network. Median overall survival from diagnosis of advanced/metastatic disease was 6.2 years. A nationwide collaboration is possible and should be promoted, particularly with rare cancer subtypes. The involvement of patient groups helps shaping projects' aims and identify further unmet needs. The remarkable survival of ALK+ patients mirrors the revolution in the treatment landscape. All efforts should be done to exclude ALK rearrangement, particularly in never smokers due to the significant prognostic implications. Poster presented, Jan 2019 SE18/2245 Identification of risk factors for Malignant bowel obstruction in ovarian cancer and validation of the Manchester bowel obstructions 7. Not Applicable In this QEPEP project cohort, the MBOS was unable to stratify patients with MBO according to prognosis.

SE18/2256 Acute Kidney Injury risk and prevention in patients undergoing treatment for lung cancer 3. Partial The tool had a low sensitivity of 14.52% and a high specificity of 96.39%. However, it does identify that patients with higher body mass, poorer performance status and diabetes represent a high proportion of AKI cases and special care is warranted when starting these patients on therapy for lung cancer. The high incidence of diabetes in the AKI population would infer greater case should be given in the treatment of patients in this population. Dehydration was identified to be the cause of AKI in majority of the population. This study also identified hypertension, COPD, osteoarthritis and PPI use as factors with high incidence. Once changes are made to the tool and the sensitivity is increased, to implement pre- emptive hydration of high risk patients. In the meantime, to take special care when starting patients with the higher risk factors on therapy for lung cancer. Lung Cancer breakfast meeting, Jun 2018 SE18/2312 Survival and clinical impact of pembrolizumab in first line NSCLC 4. Significant 80% received treatment within 62 days of diagnosis. There were 7 (13%) grade 3- 5 adverse events considered treatment -related and 7% pneumonitis overall. The results are positive and in line with trial data, with a good chance that patients will tolerate and benefit from Pembrolizumab; no action r equired. Lung DG, June 2018 SE18/2331 The first 12 months of PD -L1 testing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 5. Full Results from 2017 showed that 70% of the PD -L1 test results were positive (1% positivity or above) and therefore patients would be eligible for treatment with pembrolizumab. However only 35% had PD -L1 =50% and therefore eligible for pembrolizumab in the 1st line of treatment for advanced/metastatic NSCLC. The remaining were only eligible for pembrolizumab in subsequent treatment lines. There were 12% of inappropriate samples for PD- L1 testing at the first round and therefore 20% had to be repeated (new biopsies for PD -L1 testing). Results shared with the lung cancer pathway in order to promote all peripheral centres to request this new test (PD -L1) to all patients as part of standard of care, particularly before any systemic treatment considering that in 35% of cases such result may have a positive impact in the first line treatment options. Results shared with Lung cancer pathway in Greater Manchester and lung DG, Jan 2018 Nursing - NS 5 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations 17/2061 Upper GI Cancer Nurse Specialist Service - Patient Survey re- audit 3. Partial The re -audit has shown some improvement, however it is clear from patient responses that the demand for the GI specialist nurse is ever increasing. VOH is part time, and the need for the service is full time at least. There are plans in place to appoint another CNS and this is expected to occur in July 2018. The audit will be repeated in 2019/20 to show whether this additional resources has enhanced the patient experience further.

Partial Patients receiving BCON radiotherapy with Nicotinamide for muscle invasive bladder cancer need close monitoring during treatment with bloods and clinical review regarding tolerability of Nicotinamide and radiotherapy toxicity. Early detection of worsening renal function can be proactively investigated and managed with the discontinuation of Nicotinamide if necessary, allowing the patient to continue with Carbogen alone. Patients with an eGFR of <40 mL/min should not receive Nicotinamide. Patients to have th eir U&Es checked in the 4 weeks prior to prescription of Nicotinamide and to have these repeated weekly during treatment in order to assess for any deterioration.

GU team, Mar 2019 Radiotherapy 4 Summary of Findings Core Recommendations SE18/2130 The knowledge of therapy radiographers on sepsis and its management 2. Weak The audit results demonstrated staff in the radiotherapy department had minimal and inconsistent knowledge regarding sepsis recognition and management; suggesting additional training is required. The preferred format was classroom based. Mandatory E -lite bite learning has been developed for all clinical staff and will be linked to the acute oncology module. Classroom based training will be offered to radiotherapy staff adapting information for the radiotherapy referral pathway. Survey learners after using the initial questionnaire at the end of each classroom session. Education and training committee, Mar 2018 SE18/2135 An audit of Radiotherapy related calls received by The Hotline: Are we meeting the information needs of our patients? 3. Partial Overall, the Trust generally is meeting the information needs of the Radiotherapy patients. Some of the calls received by the Hotline were unavoidable due to the patient becoming acutely unwell and requiring a clinician review and/or admission to hospital. However some of the calls may have been avoided with greater information provision, particularly calls during the post Radiotherapy period. Reiterate the importance of the treatment review and reminding patients about side effects on the first day to radiographers. Encourage staff to ensure the patient has enough medication. Discuss the need for written Radiotherapy information. Address the accuracy of the data completed by the hotline staff if possible to allow accuracy in the number of calls affecting radiotherapy.

Haemat ology team, 2018 SE18/2364 Analysis of Inappropriate SFLC Requests and Cost Implications 1. Poor This review found that 1 in 3 of the 1538 Serum Free Light Chain (SFLC) tests requested in 2017 were inappropriate (cost over \u00a311,000). Inappropriate use was defined as requests in non- myeloma patients (non- PCD) or requests outside the defined time frame. Change the timing of the lab not carrying out the request from 4 to 3 weeks. Change the timing of tests to Serum Paraprotein estimation as well (to 3 weeks). To consider an outcome column for test at next clinic and HTDU visits. Re- audit in 6 months to evaluate the impact of current change in policy on the appropriateness of SFLC ordering, timing and missed or asynchronous test results on patient management. Haematology/TYA QMM, Dec 2018 SE18/2366 Results of Auto -PBSCT in patients above the age of 70 yr. 4. Significant Engraftment times are within expected range. Lymphoma patients take longer for platelet recovery. Treatment Related Mortality is within quoted range for AutoPBSCT. Probability of ICU transfer, serious complications leading to prolonged convalescence and longer hospital stay is higher in lymphoma patients above the age of 70yr. Re- admission rates are similar. Rate of second AutoPBSCT is similar for both groups and the outcomes are comparable. Continue the current practice of individual case selection in pati ents above 70yr age. Safe to increase the age limit to 75yr in select group of cases if the transplant physicians perceive that the benefit outweighs the individualized risks, risk of morbidity and expected survival benefit. Haematology/TYA QMM, Dec 2018 SE18/2367 Retrospective analysis of Autograft for GCT 3. Partial The numbers in this study over nearly 7 years are too small to identify valid predictors of response. However, it is possible to use Sirolimus without toxicity. Hypertriglyceridemia is common but rarely requires discontinuation of therapy. Responses observed with any organ involvement and also with established scleroderma. Flare ups and need for steroid escalation is common (67%). Steroids could be discontinued in a minority of cases (3/18 cases, 17%). Results are comparable to published studies. Re-analyse after extended recruitment of patients. To use Statins for prevention of hypertriglyceridemia. Consider use early in the therapy of GVHD in combination with steroids and possibly CNI.

Partial Patients on T therapy are usually monitored frequently enough to be safe. Patients are often monitored more frequently than is necessary because clinical staff are ordering extra monitoring investigations every time they come to the Endocrinology Departme nt. When patients were not investigated often enough this was usually because they missed an appointment. When patients have abnormal results for their T therapy monitoring, these are noticed and acted upon appropriately by clinicians. Consider process for patients who miss appointments.

Biochemistry and endocrinology teams, Aug 2018 SE18/2174 Monitoring of Patients with Multiple Myeloma on treatment with Daratumumab by Protein Electrophoresis 3. Partial Daratumumab can be detected on an electrophoresis trace from 1 month of commencing on the drug. Unless the laboratory is informed that a patient had been commenced on daratumumab, the appearance of a second band will be reported by the laboratory as a second paraprotein band. This band will be quantified by densitometry. This may impact upon assessment of remission status of patients. C linical use will increase following NICE approval via Cancer Drugs Fund. Patients may also be referred to The Christie having been treated with daratumumab at other hospitals. Therefore, it is really important that in conjunction with Haematology the labor atory works to improve the reporting of electrophoresis results of patients on daratumumab Notifications are now being sent to the Specialist Biochemistry department. Maintain records of patients on daratumumab to ensure the electrophoresis reports on these patients adds value and are not detrimental to the patient's clinical assessment. Formalise a set of comments from the audit findings based on the different presentations of suspected daratumumab interference. This list will evolve over time depending of the electrophoresis patterns observed. Send the reports and costing information to Haematology for consideration of implementing the Sebia Daratumumab assay into the patient pathway for myeloma patients.

SE17/2011 Qualitative analysis of the Macmillan Cancer Improvement Partnership (MCIP) project: Improving care coordination for patients with advanced breast cancer 3. Partial Semi -structured interviews were conducted with 19 patients who had advanced breast cancer, and 13 health professionals (7 Christie and 6 Pennine Acute Health Trust. The main benefits noted by staff were improved communication, joined- up working and coordination of care across primary, secondary and tertiary care. There was a lack of consensus regarding HNAs and uncertainty about handing over the key worker role across care boundaries and the 'Support for You' cards. Patients generally felt involved in their care and well supported, although highlighted so me gaps in communication at the outset, including difficulties in obtaining appointments. Some patients were not familiar with the terminology, but confirmed that they had a HNA after it was explained to them; others did not think they had a HNA assessment . Christie staff demonstrated a high level of engagement and joint working across the multidisciplinary team, with commitment to improve the pathway for people with SBC. It is early to evaluate sustainability, particularly for Pennine who were later to implement the pathway. No action identified in report. MCIP committee meeting, Feb 2018 SE19/2436 Evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of PSA monitoring in primary care after discharge from hospital based follow -up following prostate cancer treatment 2. Weak This project was funded by Manchester University and The Urology Foundation. In 39% of 300 cases, no PSA re-referral level was provided to GPs; and in those letters where the information was provided there was huge disparity in discharge letter instructions. 36% of patients were monitored as the oncologists' discharge letter instructed leaving 46% not tested frequently enough and 19% with no PSA testing recorded post - discharge. Time between treatment completion and discharge into primary care differs greatly across both geographic areas (4months to 16 years). Findings denote disparity between oncologists, GPs and patients regarding approach, procedure and quality of PSA monitoring. Instructions are unclear and arbitrary and testing is inconsistent. Service improvement is required.

Patient Experience Committee, Aug 2018 162The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 The role of our b oard of d irectors is to govern The Christie NHS Foundation Trust effectively so that our patients, public and stakeholders have confidence that their care is in safe hands. Our board is collectivel y responsible for ensuring the T rust is compli ant with its terms of authorisation, its constitution, mandatory guidance, relevant statutory requirements and contractual obligations. The quality and safety of our services are of paramount importance; the b oard ensures that it applies all the relevant principles and standards of clinical governance. All members of the b oard meet the 'fit and proper' person test as described in the provider licence. Our authorisation from our regulator and constitution govern the operation of the Trus t. The schedule of reservation and delegation of powers sets out the types of decisions that must be taken by the b oard of d irectors and those which can be delegated to management. As required under Schedule A of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance (A.1.1) , the Trust's constitution (Annex 7, 10.3) defines which decisions must be taken by the council of governors and how disagreements between the board and the council should be resolved. Annex 6 paragraph 2 describes how the chairman or a non-executive director may be terminated. Further detail can be obtained from our Constitution which is accessible via our website. Our b oard considers that it has complied with the requirements of the constitution relating to board composition. The b oard is satisfied that it has acted appropriately , been balanced and Directors' Report Our board of directors' 163Directors' Report c omplete and has contained a suitable range of appropriate and complementary skills and experience.

K athryn Riddle is the senior non -executive director and the designated link to the governor s in case they have concerns they feel they can not raise with t he chairman or any of the executive directors. She also leads the appraisal process for the Chairman. D uring 201 8/19 there were no ch anges to the membership of the board of directors. P rocess for evaluation of performance In line with the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance (provision B. 6), all directors have an annual performance appraisal and a personal development plan. The Chief Executive is responsible for the performance appraisal of the executive directors. The performance of the Chief Execut ive is reviewed by the Chairman. The results of these appraisals are reported to the remuneration committee. Th e performance of the non -executive directors is reviewed by the Chairman and reported to the council of governors, using a process agreed by the council of governors. The performance of the Chairman is reviewed by the non -executive directors led by the senior independent director in a process agreed by the council of governors. T he board of directors and the audit and quality assurance committees undertake an annual self-assessment exercise to ascertain their effectiveness. The responses are collated and discussion is held on the key points arising from the review. The focus of the discussion is on those areas which clearly need improvement or where there is great variation in answers. B oard appointments All non-executive director appointments made since 1st April 2007 , including the Chairman , were made by the nominations committee and were approved by the council of governors. T he Chairman and non -executive directors are appointed for an initial period of 3 years and may be removed by the council of governors in accordance with Annex 6, paragraph 2, of our constitution. O ur executive directors are appointed through an open competition pa nel; their contracts of employment do not contain an expiry date.

The b oard met in public and in private eight times during 2018- 19. It also held four informal board time outs one of which was a joint board and governor time out; this afforded the opportunity for our governors to input into discussions around the Trust's future plan s. Th e board delegates some of its work to sub committees and t here is a standing item at each board meeting to receive a copy of the full minutes of these meetings .

Remuneration committee The Remuneration Committee determines the pay of the executive directors. The committee is a non -executive committee of the board of directors comprising the independent non - executive directors. The committee is chaired by Neil Large who is also the chair of the audit committee. The remuneration committee ensures that appropriate procedures are in place for the nom ination, selection, training, development, monitoring, evaluation and remuneration of the chief executive and executive directors, having proper regard to the financial and commercial health of the organisation and for the provision of any national arrangements for such staff. The committee evaluates and considers the recommendations of the chairman on the performance of the chief executive and evaluates and considers the recommendations of the chief executive on the performance of the executive directors. The committee determines the appropriate remuneration and terms of service for the chief executive and executive directors including all aspects of salary, provisions for other benefits (including pensions) and arrangements for the termination of employm ent and other contractual terms. Any decision must be based on individual contributions to the trust, having proper regard to the trust's circumstances and performance and to the provisions of any national arrangements for such staff (where appropriate). The committee advises on and oversees appropriate contractual arrangements for executive directors including the proper calculation and scrutiny of termination payments taking into account such national guidance as is appropriate. The committee evaluates its own membership and performance on a regular basis and is authorised to obtain reasonable external legal or other independent professional advice if it considers this to be necessary. Management board The role of the management board is to formulate recommendations on strategic and operational matters for referral to the board of directors for approval. The committee also monitors the effective and efficient financial, performance, risk, quality and safety management of The Christie. Meetings are h eld monthly and are chaired by the Chief Executive and comprise the executive directors, divisional directors , divisional medical directors, clinical 174The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 directors and general managers. The terms of reference including its membership were reviewed during the y ear. Board members attendance at meetings * With the exception of the Chairman, there is no requirement for board members to attend council meetings unless governors' request attendance to gain information about the Trust's performance o r t he directors' performance of their duties.

Importantly, governors hold the non- executive directors to account for the performance of the board. The council of governors is made up of both elected and partner governors who act on behalf of their members or partner organisations, working closely with us to support future plans and ensuring we keep pushing our standards for the benefit of our patients . Our council is made up of 2 8 governors: 15 representing the p ublic, patients and carers; 4 representing our staff and voluntee rs and 9 appointed by partner organisations (we currently have vacancies in this group) . Elections in 201 8 There were 4 consti tuencies up for election in 2018; the results of the election are as follow : Public constituencies: Cheshire Maurice Gubbins Rochdale Craig uncontested ) Wigan Nick Coghlan (re-elected uncontested) We would like to thank two of our outgoing governors, Alex Davidson and Christine Mathewson , for their considerable contribution to The Christie over many years. Alex was public governor for Cheshire and Christine for Rochdale and both stepped down after completing the maximum 9 years of service . Alex and Christine were both members of the governor quality committee and played a valuable role in helping to promote the work of The Christie. We would also like to extend our thank s to Damian Her on. Damian had been our public governor for the Remainder of England & Wales since 2013 but stepped down from this role in September 2018 . We would also like to welcome our two new governors, Maurice Gubbins and Craig Wellens , to The Christie. Staff c onstituencies During the year there were no changes to our staff governors . Partner governor s During the year t here were no changes to our partner governors . Working with our governors Our governors have a number of statutory responsibilities which a re reflected in the Trust's Constitution. These responsibilities include , but are not limited to: the appointment or removal of Non- Executive Directors deciding the remunerat ion for Non - Executive Directors the appointment or removal of the Trust's extern al auditor receiving the annual report, accounts and auditors report In addition, t he Health and Social Care Act 2012 introduced two new legal duties : Hold the Non -Executive Directors , individually and collectively, to account for the performance of the B oard Represent the interests of the members of the Trust and public in general Our council of governors 176Council of governors In order for Governors to fulfil their statutory duties and responsibilities, it is important to ensure that they can connect with the Board of Directors . Therefore the chair of the board is also the chair of the council of governors. It is the chair's responsibility to ensure that the board and council work effectively together and that they receive the information they need to undertake their respective duties. To this en d, the Council of Governors meeting is attended by Executive Directors. The Senior Independent Director (who is the designated link between the Council of Governors and the Board of Directors) also attends. The other non -executive directors are invited to the meetings but attendance is not mandatory unless requested to do so by the council of governors ; this power has not been exercised during the course of this financial year. Non -executive directors are also assigned to sit on one of the governor sub-committees. Governors have a rota for attendance at board meetings where they can observe the Non - Executive Directors carrying out their duties . The rota is a guide only with governors able to attend as many board meetings as they wish. Governors receive a copy of the agenda prior to the meeting and also receive copies of the Chief Executive's report and summary performance report following each Board meeting; they also have access to all boar d minutes . We hold an annual joint time out session with the full council of governors and the board of directors. This half day event focuses on the strategy of the organisation and is a great opportunity for both groups to work together on the future direction of the Trust. This interaction is invaluable and enables the governors to review how well the board is working, challenge the board in respect to its effectiveness and ask the board to demonstrate that it has sufficient quality assurance in respect of the overall performance of the trust. During t he year we held an externally led development session which was attended by both our existing and new governors. The session included an introduction to The Christie, how we fit into the wider health system and a section on governor statutory responsibilities . The g overnors also receive regular newsletters which keep them informed and update d on items of interest. The Chairman also hosts a number of Chairman's lunches which are attended by our non-executive directors to offer governors a more informal opportunity for interaction. In situations where any conflict arises between the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the Trust's internal processes will be followed (Annex 7 paragraph 10 of the Trust's Constitution ). The constitution stat es that the council of governors has three main roles: Strategic - to use the breadth of experience of the governors to help determine the trust's future direction and support it in delivering its plans. Advisory - to act as a critical friend providing support, feedback and advice. Representative - to use the views of their electorate or organisation to enhance and inform the work of the trust. The board of directors, however, has overall responsibility for running the affairs of the trust. In circumstance s where a conflict cannot be resolved the Chair can initiate an independent review (normally led by the Senior Independent Director) to investigate the concerns and make any recommendations. 177The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Go vernors have an important role to play in making an NHS foun dation trust publicly accountable for the services it provides. It is their responsibility to maintain and review membership numbers and the member ship strategy . The board of directors consult s with governors when the annual plan is being prepared and also on other issues such as revisions to our constitution and our declaration for the Care Quality Commission's ' essential standards of quality and safety'. O ur governors canvass the opinion of our members via newsletters and events and welcome any feed back . The Christie membership team also holds a series of focus groups each year to help gather members' views. The council met formally 5 time s during 201 8/19 (one of these was a joint time out session with the Board of Directors ). The council of governors has four subcommittees focusing support into the areas of nominations, membership & community engagement, quality and development & sustainability. O ur governors have supported the board as well as providing an appropriate degree of challenge. They have contributed to our strategic plans via their involvement in council meetings, subcommittees , time -out sessions and working groups . G overnors are not paid but the Trust ensures that they are appropriately reimbursed for reasonable expenses incur red in the course of their duties. I n 2017/18 5 governors submitted trave l c laims and for the year ended 31st March 2018 the total amount claimed was\u00a31,491.70. I n 2018/19 5 governors submitted trave l c laims and for the year ended 31st March2019, the total amount claimed was \u00a31783.12. Governor sub -committees Nominations committee The nominations committee makes recommendations to the council of governors on the appointment and remuneration of the chairman and non -executive directors. The committee may work with an external organisation recognis ed as an expert at appointments to identify the skills and experience required ; they will also take into account the views of the Board of Directors . Th e nominations committee comprises the chairman of the fou ndation trust (or when the chairman is being appointed by another non - executive director), two elected governors and one appointed governor. The chair of another foundation trust will be invited to act as an independent assessor to the nominations committ ee. Th e committee is chaired by the t rust's Chairman and the following governors are members: Richard Hubner (staff governor fo r r egistered medical practitioners) David Makin ( patient representativ e p artner governor) Lisa Wylie (public governor for Bolt on and lead governor) Th e Director of Workforce may also be asked to attend as an advisor to the committee. Th e committee met once during 2018-19 to discuss the remuneration of the chairman and the non -executive directors . The committee reviewed all available benchmarking data and concluded that non-executive director pay is in 178Council of governors line with comparative data and recommended to the council of governors that there should be no increase to non -executive pay and that they should remain on their current pay leve l. In regard to the chairman, the benchmarking data showed that our rate of pay fell below the national and peer average . The committee proposed an increase of 3% to bring the rate of pay of the chair man in line with that of similar size trusts . The c ouncil of governors approved these recommendations at its meeting on 14 th February 2019. Membership and community engagement committee This committee directs and monitors recruitment and engagement activity, manages communication with members through news letters and letters and has overseen the organisation of a governor led programme of community engagement. The committee also advises on our target membership level and have supported the process to comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation in respect of the membership database. Members are invited to regular supporters' seminars and major events such as Trust open days. Through the membership and community engagement committee, we are encouraging and developing increased participation of mem bers by building a ' data bank' of people who are readily available to give their views on our services and offering additi onal engagement opportunities. In particular, this group of members are invited to take part in our programme of patient focus groups which are run by the membersh ip and voluntary services team. Quality committee The Council of Governors' Quality Committee monitors, reports and comments on patient experience and quality and standards of service. This involves both formal feedback reports and a range of presentations to the committee meetings combined with direct engagement with patients, carers and front line staff. Priorities this year have been : understanding and learning from complaints, surveys and incidents; monitoring progress on the implementation of The Christie quality accreditation schemes (The Christie Quality M ark and The Christie CODE ) including being actively involved in the Christie Quality Mark accreditation; s peaking directly with patients and carers in outpatient and i npatient areas about their experiences. Development and sustainability committee This committee reviews the Trust's annual plan and strategy on behalf of the council of governors and makes suggestions and recommendations to the Board. It also receives pre sentations from senior executives on major capital projects and provides input into these on behalf of the council of governors.

We are committed to attracting, retaining and developing our staff and aim to support them by engaging with them and valuing their individual contributions to the work that we deliver. Our approach to staff engagement At The Christie, we recognise the link between staff engagement and the quality of services we provide to our patients. Our principles, behaviours and staff pledges assure our patients, carers and families that the treatment and care they receive will be high quality and compassionate, but they also reflect the way in which we commit to treat and care for our workforce. We frequently seek staff feedback and use a number of different approaches, including the NHS Staff Survey, the quarterly Friends and Family Test and executive team walkabouts. Our Christie staff pled ges demonstrate our commitment to communicating and engaging with our staff to support their learning and development, to recognise their contribution and to provide a healthy working environment. Healthy Workplace As a result of staff feedback, in 201819 we have developed our health and wellbeing plan to support staff to maintain their health and well being and encourage th em to lead healthy lifestyles. We have invested in initiatives to support health and wellbeing including the introduction of Mental Health First Aid Champions and mindfulness sessions. The organisation has participated in national campaigns linked to health and wellbeing such as mental health awareness week which has enabled staff to be signposted to a range of support. We continue to provide our staff with support mechanisms through occupational health, staff physiotherapy services and employee assistance programmes which provide advice, guidance and counselling for those who require it. Communication & Engagement A significant focus this year has been to promote a positive working environment. We have launched our positive working relations policy and introduced a staff mediation service. We have also held a number of listening events to gather feedback from staff about their experience of working at the Christie. This feedback will help us develop further action plans in 201920 to improve staff experience. Learning & Development In 201819 we have conti nued to invest in learning and development opportunities for staff. We have introduced staff mentors and promoted coaching opportunities. We continue to ensure that we equip our managers, team leaders and supervisors with the skills needed to enable our staff to be the best the y can be and to support them to promote a positive working environment. Staff Report 182Staff report Achievement & Recognition We continue to recognise the efforts and achievement of our staff. Our monthly staff recognition scheme 'You m ade a difference' has continued. In J une 2018 we held our annual staff awards where we celebrated the outstanding achievements of staff and recognised the long and valued service of some of our long standing employees. NHS Staff Survey The NHS staff survey is co nducted annually. From 2018 onwards the results from questions are grouped to give scores i n ten indicators. The indicator scores are bas ed on a score out of 10 for certain questions with the indicator score being the average of those. The response rate to the 2018 survey among our staff was 46% (2017: 47%). Scores for each indicator together with that of the survey benchmarking group (Acute Specialist Trusts) are presented below. In 2018 our key findings continued to be extremely positive. When compared with other Acute Specialist Trusts we performed best in 2 thematic areas and better than average in 7, with only the quality of appraisals lower than the national average. Howev er, our improvement in this area since last year is significant. There is strong evidence to show that employee engagement is intrinsically linked to high performance and good quality care, so it is particularly pleasing that the Trust's staff engagement score remains significantly better than the national average. There was a significant improvement in this year's scores in relation to relationships with immediate managers with the scores being the best in the benchmarking group. Actions to address the key development areas will now be drawn up.

In addition, we have a number of policies in operation that support our workforce. The equality and diversity policy provides our commitment to treat everyone with compassion, dignity and respect, a nd to ensure that we promote a fair culture. Each person is an individual, whether they are a patient, a visitor or a colleague, and each has their own different needs from the services we provide or from their employment. This includes employment, training, promotion, and general treatment. All policies are assessed to establish the equality impact, to ensure all groups are treated fairly and consistently, and where appropriate reasonable adjustments are consider ed. For example, our recruitment and selection policy is underpinned by the achievement of the Disability Confident Scheme (Level 2) which provides our commitment to employing a nd retaining disabled people and ensuring this commitment is reflected in all recruitment practices. We work in collaboration with our staff and consult where decisions are likely to have an impact on individuals. Our organisational change policy, in particular, provides mechanisms for consultation with recognised trade union and professional association representatives as well as our staff. We work in partnership with our staffside representatives which include a number of recognised trade unions. Regular staff forums are held to engage with our union partners to share informat ion about the direction of the organisation and to gain feedback and support. If there is a concern in relation to an employee who has potentially undertaken a fraudulent act this would be investigated through the Trust disciplinary policy. Concerns can also be dealt with by our c ounter fraud team. Our sickness absence data Figures Converted by DH to Best Estimates of Required Data Items Average full time equivalent (FTE) 2018 Adjusted FTE days lost to Cabinet Office definitions Average Sick Days per FTE 2650 21,349 8.1 To ensure our staff feel able and confident to raise concerns they can access the Trust's Freedom To Speak Up Guardian. The Freedom to Speak Up Guardian provid es confidential support and advice to any member of staff thinking about raising a concern. In addition, we have a network of staff advisers, who are independent sources of advice and support for any employee who wishes to raise a concern about the manner in which they have been treated. We encourage our workfor ce to be involved in our performance, and frequently gain their opinion and feedback through our annual staff survey, through regular engagement events and our quarterly friends and family test which indicated on average in 201819 that 72% of our workforce would recommend The Christie to their friends and family as a place to work and 97% would recommend it as a place for care and treatment. Also, our monthly board of directors and council of governors meetings are public, and staff are welcome to attend. Our staff quarterly magazine and our monthly team brief, which is delivered face to face by the Chief Executive, cascade key information and messages about the Trust's performance, plans 184Staff report and developments, changes to services and information that is of interest to our staff. Our process for welcoming staff in cludes a trust induction, which provides the opportunity to meet our Chief Executive and learn more about the Trust. In addition to the trust induction, nursing colleagues have t he opportunity to meet with the Chief Nurse during their first six weeks within the organisation. The trust recognises its legal duty to protect patients, staff and visitors from the risk of injury or workrelated ill health. There is an effective executiveled approach to managing health and safety with close cooperation between management and staff side representatives. Managers have access to specialist trained advisers in health and safety, moving and handling, fire and security. In addition, advice and support are available from radiation protection, infection cont rol, occupational health and waste management.

Our approach to equality and dive rsity is to ensure our care is individual and patient -centred, and that patients, visitors and colleagues are treated with d ignity and respect at all times. We are determined to ensure that we offer equal access to health care and employment opportunities to everyone in the communities we serve. We are committed to actively promoting equality across all our activities with the intention of achieving and maintaining a fully inclusive organisation. Recognising our responsibilities, there is an effective executive- led approach to promoting inclusion activities in respect of service delivery and the workforce. We regularly discuss workforce equality issues with trade union colleagues through our staff forum and our senior managers through workforce committee. Key achievements in 201 8-19 include: We were proud to maintain our Disability Confident Status level 1 meaning that we are committed to making a difference for disabled people from a workforce and patient perspective. In line with the Equality Act duties, w e published our annual patient and workforce equality monit oring reports. Our published patient services equality objectives (to continue to enhance the experience of vulnerable patients with the provision of accessible information) have been progressed. Similarly, o ur plans to progress our published workforce equality objectives ( to continue to embed mechanisms for staff to confidently raise concerns at work, to continue to demonstrate progress against indicators within Workforce Race Equality Standard and to develop plans to implement Workforce Disability Equality Standard and to commit to decreasing the gender pay gap) have been achieved. Our equality performance was assessed using the NHS Equality Delivery System 2. We published this assessment following engagement with key stakeholders , including patients . We continue to use this as a platform to develop and promote inclusion. Our fourth published NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard annual report indicated some improvements on the previous year, including a percentage difference in our black and minority ethnic members of staff being appointed from shortlist ing across all posts . We continue to use the standard as a platform to take further action on the causes of ethnic disparities. In the NHS Staff Survey 2018 , our male/female, disabled / not disabled, white/black and minority ethnic staff all consistently scored 72% recommending the Trust as a place to work and 97% recommending the Trust as a place to receive treatment. As a result of our first published gender pay gap report as mandated by national government, we are progressing plans to decrease our gen der pay gap within the organisation. We have developed an equality, diversity and inclusion interest group in partnership with members of staff and staff side colleagues to develop a programme of events and activity which will be developed in the coming years. Equality and diversity: a n inclusive culture 191Equality and diversity Workforce statistics - diversity We have a predominantly female workforce (approximately 72% female). With regard to ethnicity, approximately 12% of our workforce comprises staff from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. In 201 8-19 we have continued to encourage the reporting of equality data in respect of protected characteristics, although disclosure remains at the individual's discretion.

In line with national developments, we will be implementing the Workforce Disability Equality Standard and roll out the capturing of sexual orientation monitoring information to ensure that we are meeting the needs of all of our patients, staff and volunteers. We will continue to develop opportunities for work experience within our organisation for individuals with additional needs or requirements and will continue to develop plans, activities and events in partnership with our staff th rough the equality, diversity and inclusion group. Our approach to equa lity, diversity and inclusion is in partnership and through effective engagement with our stakeholders including patients, staff and staff side representatives which wi ll continue into 2019- 20.

Annual st atement on remuneration The remuneration committee is a non -executive committee of the board of directors comprising all of the independent non -executive directors . It has no executive powers other than those specifically delegated in its terms of referen ce. The role of the Committee is to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place for the nomination, selection, training, development, monitoring, evaluation and remuneration of the chief executive, executive directors and other senior employees, havin g proper regard to the financial and commercial health of the organisation and for the provision of any national arrangements for such staff where appropriate. The committee c an call on advisors to support their decisions such as the Director of Workforce and the Chief Executive. The chair of the Audit Committee also chairs the remuneration committee. The remuneration committee met twice during 2018- 19 to discuss executive director pay. At its December 2018 meeting, the committee deferred a decision until further guidance was available. The committee met again in February 2019 and looked at national benchmarking information for executive pay. They agreed a 2% pay award for eligible executive directors and agreed to an increase in the pay scale for o ne executive director to bring the salary for the post in line with the median national benchmarking. Non- executive directors The chair of the foundation trust is expected to devote 3 days a week to his/her duties which may include some time commitment during the evening or weekend. Non -executive directors are expected to devote sufficient time to ensure satisfactory discharge of his/her duties. This will be no less than 2.5 days per month and will comprise a mixture of set commitments with more flexib le arrangements for ad -hoc events. Non -executive directors are not entitled to any payment for loss of office. Non -Executive Directors are not employees of the Trust. They receive no additional benefits or entitlements other than reasonable expenses whic h are paid in accordance with the approach set out initially by the Trust Development Authority (TDA) a nd then endorsed by the then 'Monitor ' for foundation trusts. Non -executive directors are not entitled to any termination payments. In 2016- 17 four non-executive directors received expenses. The aggregate sum of expenses paid was \u00a33,730.30. In 2017- 18 four non-executive directors received expenses. The aggregate sum of expenses paid was \u00a33,757.99. In 2018- 19 four non-executive directors received expen ses. The aggregate sum of expenses paid was \u00a34,015.89 Terms of Office The term of office for Non- Executive Directors at the Trust is 3 years (to a maximum of 9 consecutive years). Non -Executive Director re- appointments are managed in accordance with NHS Improvement 's Code of Governance, i.e. any term beyond six years (two three- year terms) will be subject to rigorous review and subject to annual reappointment. The term of each non - executive director is included in the table below. Remuneration report 194Remuneration report Termination The proc ess for the removal of the chairman or non-executive director will be in accordance with the trust's constitution. A ny proposal for removal must be proposed by a governor and seconded by not less than ten governors including at least two elected governo rs and two appointed governors. If any proposal to remove the chair or other non -executive director is not approved at a meeting of the Council of Governors (failing to achieve the support required pursuant to paragraph 25.2 of the constitution), no further proposal can be put forward to remove the chair or such non-executive director based upon the same reasons within 12 months of the meeting. Remuneration The Trust does not make any contribution to the pension arrangements of Non -Executive Directors. The governor nominations committee met on the 22 nd January 2019 to discuss the remuneration of the chairman and the non - executive directors. Please see page 178 for further details.

The Christie is committed to the over arching principles of value for money and high performance. In making its decisions on remuneration the Committee considers the responsibilities and requirements of each of the executive director roles, how long individuals have been in post and the perfo rmance of the Trust. We do not have a separate senior managers ' remuneration policy. All Executive Directors work within the NHS National Terms and Conditions. All service contracts have a 6 month notice period set within them. Executive Directors are only entitled to payment for loss of office if a redundancy situation has arisen. Redundancy is calculated within clearly defined parameters as per legislative and NHS terms and conditions. Any overpayments will be managed in accordance with the Standi ng Financial Instructions. There is no additional benefit that will become receivable by a director in the event that that senior manager retires early. No exit packages or non -compulsory departure payments were agreed for any of the senior managers in year. Executive Directors are expected to devote sufficient time to ensure satisfactory discharge of their duties in accordance with agreed responsibilities and rotas as determined by their manager. The performance of the executive directors is assessed th rough regular appraisal against pre-determined objectives. Comparative remuneration data is used to determine market rates of similar acute NHS Foundation Trusts. The executive directors are all employe d on a permanent contract basis with set salaries th at do not include any other components. We have reviewed our policies in relation to executive remuneration and they ensure that we have all the necessary governance in place and use appropriate benchmarking to ensure that our pay levels are reasonable and publicly justifiable. Where executive directors are paid more than \u00a3150 ,000 this is a reflection of market rates. 196Remuneration report Details of senior employees' remuneration and pension benefits can be found in the two tables in this remuneration report and are subject to audit 2018/19 2017/18 Name and title Salary and fees (bands of \u00a35,000) Taxable benefits (total to nearest \u00a3100) Annual performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Long term performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Pension related benefit s (bands of \u00a32,500) Total (bands of \u00a35,000) Salary and fees (bands of \u00a35,000) Taxable benefits (total to nearest \u00a3100) Annual performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Long term performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Pension related benefits (bands of \u00a32,500) Total (bands of \u00a35,000) R Spencer Chief Executive 190 - 195 0 0 0 17.5 - 20 205 - 210 185-190 0 0 0 25 - 27.5 210-215 J Fitzpatrick Director of Finance & Business Development 135 - 140 0 0 0 105 - 107.5 240 - 245 125 - 130 0 0 0 0 125 - 130 J Bird Chief Nurse & Executive Director of Quality 125 - 130 0 0 0 5 - 7.5 130 - 135 125-130 0 0 0 17.5 - 20 140 - 145 W Makin * Medical Director (Internal) 180 - 185 0 0 0 0 180- 185 180 - 185 0 0 0 310- 312.5 490-495 Prof C Harrison** Medical Director (External) 190 - 195 0 0 0 0 190 - 195 140-145 0 0 0 0 140-145 F Noden Chief Operating Officer 130 - 135 0 0 0 7 - 7.25 140 - 145 130 - 135 0 0 0 0 130-135 197The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 2018/19 2017/18 Name and title Salary and fees (bands of \u00a35,000) Taxable benefits (total to nearest \u00a3100) Annual performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Long term performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Pension related benefit s (bands of \u00a32,500) Total (bands of \u00a35,000) Salary and fees (bands of \u00a35,000) Taxable benefits (total to nearest \u00a3100) Annual performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Long term performance related bonuses (bands of \u00a35,000) Pension related benefits (bands of \u00a32,500) Total (bands of \u00a35,000) C Outram Chairman 40 - 45 0 0 0 0 40 - 45 40 - 45 0 0 0 0 40 - 45 K Riddle Non-Executive 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 N Large Non-Executive 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 K Walshe Non-Executive 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 E Maher Non-Executive 10 - 15 0 0 0 0 10 -1 5 10 - 15 0 0 0 0 10 - 15 R Ainsworth*** Non-Executive 15 - 20 0 0 0 0 15 - 20 10 - 15 0 0 0 0 10 - 15 T Kapur Non-Executive 10 - 15 0 0 0 0 10 - 15 10 - 15 0 0 0 0 10 - 15 Band of highest paid director's total remuneration (\u00a3'000) 190 - 95 185-190 Median total remuneration 29,177 28,747 Ratio 6.5 6.5 198Remuneration report * The remuneration for Dr Makin disclosed above is the total remuneration package. **The remuneration for Professor Chris Harrison disclosed above is the total remuneration package for his role as Executive M edical Director (Strategy) at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. *** Mr Ainsworth receives \u00a33,000 per annum for his role as Chair of The Christie Pharmacy Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. Remuneration for the year end ing 31st March 2019 was \u00a33,000 (period ending 31st March 2018 - \u00a3920).

As Non -Execut ive members do not receive pensionable remuneration, there will be no entries in respect of pensions for Non -Executive members. 200Remuneration report Ca sh Equivalent Transfer Values A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the actuarially assessed capital value of th e pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member's accumulated benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme, or arrangeme nt to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which the disclosure applies. The CETV figures and the other pension details include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the NHS pension scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Last year there was a calculation error in the CETV factors used by N HS Pensions for individuals w ith b enefits i n the 2 015 s cheme. The CETV a s at 1 A pril 2018 have b een amended p rior to this e xercise to r eflect the transfer value at 31 M arch 2 018 using t he correct C ETV fac tor. Rea l Increase in CETV This reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement) and uses common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period . Rog er Spencer Chief Executive 23rd May 2019 201The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2018 -19 N HS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for identifying the potential support needs of healthcare providers . The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic c hange Leadership and improvement capability (well- led) Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or su spected breach of its licence. Segmentation We have been segmented as a 1 (maximum autonomy) . This is the best possible assessment and reflects high performance across the 5 themes. T his segmentation information is the Trust's position as at 31st March 201 9. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Finance and use of resources The fin ance and use of resources them e is based on the assessment of five appropriate financial performance measures. These are given a 'score' from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest perfo rmance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finan ce and use of resources is o nly one of the fiv e theme s feeding into the Single Oversig ht Framew ork, the segmenta tion of the Trust disclosed above might not be the same as the ov erall fin ance score here.

This score represents the strongest performance possible. A s recorded in the finance score calculation, agency spend against the \u00a3997k ceiling set by NHSI stands at \u00a3 1,031k for 2019- 20, which includes \u00a343k of agency spend on services hosted by The Christie. Single Oversight Framework 202The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Corporate governance is the means by which a board of directors leads and direct s their organisation so that decision- making is effective and the right outcomes are delivered. In the NHS this means delivering safe, effective services in a caring and compassionate environment in a way that is responsive to the changing needs of patients and service users. T he NHS Foundation Trust code of governance sets out best practice principles and processes to assist NHS foundation trusts to achieve this goal. The main areas are: L eadership Every NHS foundation trust should be headed by an effective board of directors. The board is collectively responsible for the performance of the NHS foundation trust. T he general duty of the board of directors, and of each director individually, is to act with a view to promoting the success of the organisation so as to maximise the benefits for the members of the trust as a whole and for the public. E ffectiveness The board of directors and its committees should have the a ppropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the NHS foundation trust to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. A ccountability The board of directors should present a fair, balanced an d understandable assessment of the NHS foundation trust's position and prospects. T he board of directors is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The board should maintain sound risk management systems. R elations with stakeholders The board of directors should appropriately consult and involve members, patients and the local community and t he council of governors must represent the interests of trust members and the public. De tails regarding how the Trust has applied the Code principles and complied with its provisions are set out throughout the annual report. The disclosures required by the NHS FT Code of Governance in relation to the Board of Directors , Council of Governors, Membership, Nominations Committee, Risk and Audit Committee are also included with in the Annual Report. The disclosures required by the Code in relation to the Remuneration Committee are contained in the remuneration report on page 194 . D uring 2018 -19 The Christie NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance on a comply or explain basis. The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on th e principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. Statement of compliance: NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance 203The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 T he NHS Act 2006 states that the Chief Executive is the accounting officer of the NHS foundation trust.

R oger Spencer Chief Executive Date: 23rd May 20 19 Statement of the Chief Executive's responsibilities as the accounting officer of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust 204The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS foundation trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS foundation trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied effi ciently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in The Christie NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 st March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle risk The Board of Directors pay close attention to the risk management processes of the Trust. The Board has approved a three year Risk Management Strategy and Policy and annually in September they receive an outcome report against the achievement of the milestones within the strategy. On a monthly basis, the Board of Directors reviews the corporate risk register and the Board Assurance Framework in the public meeting. At each of the formal Board sub committees, which are the Audit and Quality assurance Committees and whi ch are wholly Non-Executive Director led, they carry out a review of the Board Assurance Framework and they escalate any concerns directly to the Board of Directors. The reporting of incidents and near misses is encouraged and the Trust is viewed as being a high reporting low harm organisation. The Trust has a training needs analysis that is reviewed annually and sets out the training requirements for risk management training. All staff during corporate induction have an introduction to risk m anagement and health and safety. With regards to more advanced training in Root Cause Analysis following incidents, the clinical staff trained include, for example, medical consultants, senior nursing staff from ward managers and above and for non-clinical staff th e training is for service managers and above. The training to all staff is delivered in a range of ways from face to face training to specific e-learning modules. Annual governance statement 205Annual Governance Statement Learnings from incidents, complaints and claims are shared throughout the Trust through the action plans developed following root cause analyses. Lessons learned are also discussed at the monthly Risk and Quality Governance Committee, through patient safety newsletters and at Grand R ounds. A quarterly report on patient safety and experience pul ls through all the themes for learning and is discussed in detail at the patient safety and the patient experience committees. The outcomes and recommendations from Serious Incidents are presented to an impartial panel chaired by a Non -executive director and two executive directors before being presented to the Board of Directors and submitted to our commissioners and the Care Quality Commission. In the last CQC inspection in 2018 the risk management and governance systems in the well led domain were tes ted and the Trust was rated as Outstanding. As accounting officer, I have overall responsibility for risk management processes across the organisation. I have delegated responsibility for the coordination of risk management systems and processes to the chief nurse & executive director of quality. She discharges her responsibilities through the quality & standards team, which includes lead officers for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) rating for cl aims , the corporate risk register and the incident reporting management system. She coordinates the governance and risk management arrangements undertaken within the organisation through performance review meetings with all operational divisions and through the risk & quality governance committee. The board assurance framework is delegated to the c ompany secretary thereby ensuring impartiality from the operational management of the Trust. The Board assurance framework is reviewed at all of the Audit and Quality Assurance committee meetings and at all of the Board of Directors meetings. Internal Audit presented the annual assurance framework opinion in February and concluded that 'the organisation's Assurance Framework is structured to meet the NHS requirements, is visibly used by the Board and clearly reflects the risks discussed by the Board' Risks associated with information systems and processes are the responsibility of the executive director of finance & business development who acts as the senior information risk owner. The risk management strategy & policy (2017-2020) provides a framework for managing risks across the organisation, which is consistent with best practice and Department of Health guidance. The strategy provides a clear, structured an d systematic approach to the management of risks to ensure that risk assessment is an integral part of clinical, managerial and financial processes at all levels across the organisation. The strategy sets out the role of the board of directors' and standin g committees together with individual 206The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 responsibilities of the Chief Executive, executive directors, managers and all staff in managing risk. In particular, the risk and quality governance committee through its sub-committees of patient safety, patient experience and clinical & research effectiveness, provides the mechanism for managing and monitoring risk throughout the Trust and reporting through to the board of directors'. The risk management system was thoroughly tested during the CQC comprehensive ins pection in May 2016. The board receives its assurances on the risk management and governance arrangements in place through its quality assurance and audit committees. Both of these are non - executive board committees and each is chaired by a non -executive director. All non- executive directors have independent access to internal and external auditors. Our staff are well trained and equipped to manage risk in a number of ways appropriate to their authority and duties. Risk management training is provided for all staff through our comprehensive induction programme. In addition, there is specifically tailored training for individual roles and these are agreed with staff through personal development plans. Regular risk management awareness training continu es for all staff through our corporate essential training programme. This includes key risk areas such as incident reporting and investigation, Root Cause Analysis training, human factors training, complaints handling, infection prevention & control, healt h and safety , moving and handling and counter fraud and prevention. The organisation aims to ensure that it learns from internal and external incidents and shares good practice through a range of mechanisms including governance meetings, team briefings, action plans arising from external reviews such as National Inquiries , publications of the Royal Colleges, peer review and PLACE inspections. The board of directors also reviews the outcomes and action plans of relevant corporate reports . The risk and control framework The 2017-2020 Risk Management Strategy has five elements, based on the Health Foundation 2014 Policy for monitoring and measuring safety. Each element has key milestones in place in order to: a) Ascertain whether it has been safe for patients, staff and others in the past b) Identify whether our systems and processes are reliable c) Ensure sensitivity to operations so that we are safe in the present d) Anticipate and prepare to ensure that we will be safe in the future e) Integrati on and learning to ensure we are responding and learning as appropriate The work is prioritised over the three years of the strategy and links with and is complementary to the quality improvement plan, the operational plan and the Trust's five year strat egy. The operational delivery of the incident reporting and risk register system, electronic patient record and prescribing systems across the in-patient and outpatient 207Annual Governance Statement setting will all assist and support the delivery of safer care and practice. The high level committee structure for the management of safety and risk is effective in ensuring that the Trust's systems and processes are as safe as possible. Membership of these committees is multi-disciplinary and is chaired by medical leaders and includes representation by other key members of Trust staff. There is an annual review of the effectiveness of the terms of reference and any issues are managed at that point. There are mature risk management policies and procedures in place, with an underpinning process to ensure that these policies consider all aspects of risk when in development or review. These policies and procedures were tested by the CQC during their comprehensive inspection in 2018. There is a mature system of clinical audit across the Tr ust, on occasion the learning identified following these audits is not always acted upon and there are audits that do not progress to completion. This is being addressed in the clinical audit and improvement plan for 2019 -20. The Board on an annual basis reviews its Risk appetite and this is shown in the public board papers. The risk appetite statement is taken into account when considering strategic decisions, business cases and quality matters. The Board , In order to be assure d that it is meeting the o utcomes required by the Care Quality C ommission, has engaged the internal auditors to carry out quality spot checks and also to review elements of the well led outcomes. The outcome of the audits and compliance reviews are presented to the Board on an annu al basis in April to show adherence with the CQC standards and the 2018 CQC inspection outcome showed the Trust to be Outstanding in the key lines of enquiry and well led for the well led domain. The information below sets out the current top corporate r isks to the organisation and their risk score. The Trust top risk relates to the challenges in meeting the 24/62 day national cancer waiting time standards. If the standards are not met this could impact patients by causing delays to their care and treat ment. There could also be a potential reputational risk of non-compliance with national cancer standards at Trust and Cancer Network level. This risk is currently scored at a 20 on our risk register and there are a range of mitigating actions with a small number of clinical service lines within the organisation and also work on cancer pathways across Greater Manchester to ensure delivery of these key cancer standards. The Trust like most other organisations in the NHS has an overarching risk with regard s to staffing gaps due to national shortages in some occupations such as nursing, radiology, rotational junior medical staff and radiotherapy staff. We have identified this could lead to a negative impact on engagement levels and the delivery of services. The risk is currently scored as a 16 on our risk register and there are a range of actions in place to ensure recruitment and 208The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 retention work programmes are in place. The Trust is also part of the NHSI recruitment and retention collaborative. There has b een a significant increase in chemotherapy referrals and activity over the last few months which has seen a potential risk to delays in receiving and delivery of chemotherapy treatment. The risk is currently scored at 15. There are many mitigating actions in place including looking to open extra capacity away from the main Withington site, increasing capacity on the Withington site outside of the dedicated chemotherapy unit and looking to further extend hours at the weekend. The Trust has identified a pot ential risk of cyber -attack due to not modernising our IT system and being compliant with NHS digital standards. Not meeting the NHS digital standards could mean the Trust incurs significant financial penalties (>\u00a31m) and reputational damage to the trust. The risk is currently scored as a 15 on our risk register. There are a number of mitigations in place and the Trust has just agreed a \u00a31.295m investment to move the organisation to Windows 10 and these upgrades will be in place by January 2020. The Trus t has not identified any principal risks to compliance with the NHS Provider licence and throughout the 2018 -19 financial year, the Trust has achieved a score of 1 for use of resources and 1 for Governance , the best scores possible. The Trust has a mature risk and quality management system as tested by the CQC in the 2018 inspection where outstanding was the outcome for both the core standards reviewed and the well led domain. Board sub committees of Audit an d Quality Assurance are wholly non -executive di rector led and have an annual work plan which also includes a review of the committee's effectiveness . There are strong reporting lines and the minutes of the meeting and any escalations are formally reviewed at the Board of Director s meeting. Executives are only in attendance at these Board subcommittees. The reports provided to the audit and quality assurance committees are in the main audits that have been carried out by the internal audit function and this provides the Board with independent assurance. The Board of Directors on a monthly basis receive at the public meeting the integrated performance and quality report and this is discussed in detail. Through the r isk management systems, all business cases and policies have an equality impact assessm ent (EIA) and will not be approved without the EIA being reviewed by the approving committee. The Trust has a workforce plan that is updated annually and is signed off by the Board of Directors. Our workforce planning process has been developed in accorda nce with 209Annual Governance Statement 'Developing workforce safeguards.' The approach includes: Undertaking a baseline assessment, to collect up to date workforce intelligence using a specifically designed workforce planning template and supported through engagement events Aligning this assessment with the annual planning round to ensure workforce planning is integrated with service and financial planning Analysing returns to identify workforce availability and key workforce challenges Developing short and medium term strategies Monitoring implementation through the Workforce Committee The Board of Directors receives and approves every six months a review of the nurse and allied health professional safe staffing levels. The report meets the recommendations of the 'Developing Workforce Safeguards' recommendations. The safe staffing levels are published monthly in the integrated performance and quality report and where staffing levels fall below the accepted level an exception report is provided to the board members. The Board has engaged with NHS Improvement on their nursing retention improvement initiative and has developed an improvement plan to ensure that best practice on recruitment and retention are adopted. The Trust's risk management strategy aims to control, manage and mitigate risk. It sets out a system for continuous improvement via risk management which extends to all areas of the organisation. It aims to reduce clinical and non-clinical risks. Risk management is integral to Trust business and is embedded in the culture of the Trust. Individual and organisational learning from incidents, mistakes, accidents and near misses is a key component of the Trust's risk management strategy to ensure continual improvement. Risks are quantified based on the risk management standard ISO 31000:2009 which measures risk using a combination of consequence (also described as impact or severity) and the likelihood (or probability or frequency) of an event occurring. During 2018-19 there have been 12 high scoring corporate risks ; all risks have been appropriately managed during the financial year using the Trust's risk management systems. The Trust uses Datix to support its risk management and risk register processes. This database encompasses incidents, forma l and informal complaints, litigation details and risks. All staff have a role in identifying risks and helping to reduce their impact. Key risks for the organisation, corporate and divisional, are reported in the integrated performance and quality repo rt and are reviewed formally by the risk and quality governance committee, management board and the board of directors at each of their meetings . Identified risks are reported using the Trust's integrated performance and quality reporting structures and a re reviewed at divisional, management and board 210The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 meetings. Managers systematically assess risk in their areas of responsibility. All risk assessments are documented and risks recorded on the risk register. Once analysed the higher scoring risks are manag ed by higher level committees in the organisation. Risk control measures are identified and where resources may be required to control the risk a business case is developed; these are treated as a priority. The risk and control framework is based on a board reporting process which ensures that information is presented to the board in a timely manner and in an appropriate format. The board assurance framework provides an immediate means of alerting the board to areas of concern or failures of control, enabling the board to ensure that the appropriate management resource is committed to resolving such issues. The reporting process includes the corporate plan which identifies the strategic objectives of The Christie. Progress towards their achievement is presented to the board twice a year. The board assurance framework is regularly reviewed and updated using the corporate risk register and corporate plan and is presented to the board at the start of the year and reviewed by the audit committee , quality assurance committee and the board of directors at each of their meetings. Each objective is allocated to either the audit or quality assurance committee. The presentation of the assurance framework has been improved to assist the board to judge the effectiv eness of control measures intended to reduce the risks to the organisation in achieving its principal objectives. The audit and quality assurance committees examine issues at random and in depth to ensure that the system accurately describes risk and contr ols. The board has an agreed risk appetite statement which was reviewed and agreed during the development of the 2017-20 risk management strategy . The Christie works with a number of partner organisations as shown below, to ensure that risks to The Christ ie are identified, assessed and appropriate action is taken ; these organisations include: NHS England specialised commissioning team (North) and Greater Manchester CCG s The University of Manchester and The University of Salford and a number of other acade mic institutes and professional bodies to ensure training and education is delivered in line with national standards and the academic expectations of relevant bodies Manchester Academic Health Science Centre (MAHSC), a partnership between The University of Manchester and six NHS organisations, uniting leading healthcare providers with world -class academics and researchers. Other acute trusts and CCGs as part of Greater Manchester Cancer Board Our private patient joint venture partner Health Corporation of America to continually develop private patient services at The Christie; Our wholly owned subsidiary pharmacy service - the trust took the decision to create its own wholly owned subsidiary non-hospital pharmacy company which 211Annual Governance Statement replaced Alcura Healthcare Ltd at the end of its five year contract. The new pharmacy company commenced on 11th December 2017 and offers both outpatient and inpatient dispensing services. Our pathology services partner Synlab UK Ltd to improve turnaround times for our patients and mai ntain delivery of high quality results. Our contract partners Alliance Medical Limited in the delivery of PET -CT services which includes clinical leadership, training & education and research co -ordination The organisation's response to national alerts and governance action is managed through the patient safety committee and management board and reported to the board of directors. The Christie also engages with the public and NHS stakeholders in the following way: public: council of governors and commi ttees of governors, members' meetings, local public engagement meetings, and p atient surveys (both internal and external), suggestion schemes and the patient comment system NHS: The Christie Commissioning Group Board (currently led by NHS England specialis ed commissioning team (North) and Greater Manchester CCG's), Greater Manchester Cancer Board, CCG representation on the drugs management committee Local Authority: The Christie Neighbourhood forum which includes a representative from MCC and local residents for input into trust developments and our Green Travel Plan. Greater Manchester Combined Health Authority through the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership. The foundation trust i s fully co mpliant with the registration requirements of t he Care Quality Commission. The foundation trust has published an up -to- date register of interests for decision-making staff within the past twelve months, as required by the 'Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS' guidance. As an employer with st aff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The foundation trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and 212The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources As accounting officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control to ensure that resources are used economically, efficiently and effectively. My review is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive directors wit hin the NHS Foundation Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. Divisional and corporate departments are responsible for the delivery of financial and other performance targets via our performanc e management framework which includes monthly performance reviews with each service. Evidence is also shown in the strong track record we have of transforming our services to deliver service improvements and operational efficiencies. To ensure the patien t is at the centre of our planning, we have configured our transformation programme to reflect the end to end clinical pathways for our patients. These Cost Improvement Plans are only approved once the Executive Medical Director and Chief Nurse and Execut ive Director of Quality sign off the proposals as having no detrimental impact upon the quality of care provided to our patients. The accepted transformational schemes are reported and monitored within the Integrated Quality and Performance Report and presented at the public Board of Directors meeting. We continue to work with Model Hospital initiatives, noting that the information is increasingly available to enable improved benchmarking and target areas of improvement. We are working closely with other specialist oncology centres (Clatterbridge and The Royal Marsden) to identify and implement best practice across all Trusts to deliver efficiencies and commercial opportunities. We continue to collaborate through the Costing Transformation Programme so that we have access to improved patient level data from other providers which we use to assess our use of resources and address any areas of variation. We are highly engaged in the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership transformation programme which has key work -streams aiming to deliver cost improvements across the health economy. GM has a larg e and varied programme of works and as these workstreams progress over the subsequent years, we will benefit from scheme implementation. Specific a reas of opportunity include pharmacy and back-office functions. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, audit, quality assurance, risk and clinical governance 213Annual Governance Statement committees and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. Information governance Our curren t top 3 data security risks, as advised by an external specialist, are managed through compliance with the data security and protection toolkit which is mandated by NHS Digital. In addition to the toolkit, w e are also working towards Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation and this is recorded in the corporate risk register. Data security and information governance incidents are managed in accordance with internal and external reporting requirements; for the year 2018-2019 the trust had one reportable data breach . This breach related to the loss of a small number of patient notes and was reported to the Information Commissioner 's Office (ICO). The ICO's decision relating to this case was that no further action from them was required. Information governance ri sks are managed as part of the risk management systems and processes and assessed using the Information Governance Toolkit. The Trust's risk register is updated with currently identified information risks including data quality and data security which are reviewed by the Risk and Quality Governance Committee. We have been actively working on the implications of the new GDPR legislation which c ame into effect on 25 th May 2018. A Data Protection Officer (DPO) was appointed and an independent review was undertaken to assess our preparedness. Progress has been monitored through our risk management systems. In addition, independent assurance is provided as part of the NHS Improvement coding and costing assurance audit process, and the Information Governanc e Toolkit self - assessment review undertaken by internal audit which gained significant assurance. Annual Quality Report The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual. The Board of Directors has engaged the external auditors to provide assurance that the accuracy of the data provided in the quality report is stated accurately and that there are appropriate systems of internal control. The external auditors have reviewed data sets as prescribed by NHS Improvement. This data is reviewed by the Board throughout the financial year in the integrated performance and quality report. The quality report presents a b alanced view and is based on accurate data. The board of directors' is assured of this through the Trust's governance processes and leadership by the executive team. Systems are in place to collect, validate and analyse all data using the appropriately s killed team. This may be the information or performance team, infection 214The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 201 8-19 control team, internal audit team, the quality & standards team or the NHS England cancer waiting times team . Our annual quality reports are a bringing together of reports on the qua lity of care contained in the quality accounts section of our monthly integrated performance and quality report. The monthly reports are considered by the senior clinicians and managers of the organisation at monthly management board meetings and by the board of directors. The quality report has been received by the quality assurance committee and has been approved by the management board. The preparation of the quality accounts has been led by the chief nurse & executive director of quality. Review of ef fectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit , the executive and clinical leads within the NHS foundation trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the quality report attached to this Annual report and other perf ormance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, audit committee, quality assurance committee and the risk & quality governance committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Board Assurance Framework provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls to manage risks to the organisation achieving its principal objectives have been reviewed. My review is also informed by: Assessment of financial reports submitted to NHS Improvement, the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts The CQC comprehensive inspection in May 2016 Opinions and reports made by external auditors Opinions and reports made by internal auditors NHS Litigation Authority claims profile and other external inspections, accreditation s and reviews. The process that has been applied in maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control has been reviewed by: The Board; through consideration of key objectives and the management of principal risks to those objectives within the Assurance Framework, which is presented at board meetings The Audit Committee by reviewing and monitoring the opinions and reports provided by both internal and external audit The Quality Committee; by reviewing and monitoring the opinions and reports provided by both internal and external audit 215Annual Governance Statement The Risk and Quality Governance Committee by implementing and reviewing clinical governance and risk management arrangements and receiving reports from the sub risk committees External assessments of services The Modern Slavery Act 2015 The Modern Slavery Act 2015 establishes a duty for commercial organisations to prepare an annual slavery and human trafficking statement. This is a board approved statement of the steps the organisation has taken during the financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or in any part of its own business. Our statement can be found in the trust publications section of our website. NHS Emergency Prepar edness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) assurance process The trust participates in an annual self - assessment process against the NHS Core Standards for EPRR. The outcome of the self - assessment for 2018 -19 was that the trust declared substantial compliance with the Core Standards. Evidence of compliance, supported by a Board -approved Statement of EPRR Conformity, was submitted to the commissioners. Conclusion As accounting officer and based on the information provided above I am assured that no signi ficant internal control issues have been identified. Roger Spencer Chief Executive 23rd May 201 9 216Independent auditor 's report to the Council of Governors of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements Opinion Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust (the 'Trust ') and its subsidiaries (the ' group' ) for the year ended 31 March 2019 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, the Group Statement of Changes in Taxpayers ' Equity, the Trust Statement of Changes in Taxpayers' Equity, the Cash Flow Statement and notes to the financial statements, including the accounting policies. The financial reporting framewor k that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and as interpreted and adapted by the Accounts Directions issued under the National Health Service Act 2006, the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018 /19 and the Department of Health and Social Care group accounting manual 2018/19. In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and of the Trust as at 31 March 201 9 and of the group' s expenditure and income and the Trust 's expenditure and income for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, as interpreted and adapted by the Department of Health and Social Care g roup accounting manual 2018-19; and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor 's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC 's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: the Accounting Officer 's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or the Accounting Officer has not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group 's or the Trust 's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Overview of our audit approach Financial statements audit Overall materiality: \u00a3 6,081,000 which represents 2% of the group's operating expenses 217 Key audit matters were identified as: Occurrence and accuracy of patient care income from contract variations and other operating revenue s and existence of associated receivable balances Valuation of land and buildings Implementation of IFRS 15 to research contracts The group consists of six components - the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, two wholly owned subsidiaries and three joint ventures. We performed a full scope audit of the Christie NHS Foundation Trust and audit testing on classes of transactions, account balances, or disclosures relating to the subsidiaries and joint ventures which were material to the group position or included a likely significant risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements . We did not issue group instructions to the auditor of The Christie Clinic as we did in 2017/18 Conclusion on the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources W e identified two significant risks in respect of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and eff ectiveness in its use of resources relating to use of The Christie Pharmacy Company Ltd to improve dispensary services and achievement of the 62- day cancer waiting time from GP referral target (see Report on other legal and regulatory requirements section) . Key audit matters The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement impact and the extent of management judgement Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those High Potential financial statement impact High Low Extent of management judgement Management override Occurrence and accuracy of income and receivables Valuation of property Implementation of IFRS 15 to research contracts 218that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key audit matter - Group and Trust How the matter was addressed in the audit Occurrence and accuracy of patient care income from contract variations and other operating revenues and existence of associated receivable balances Trusts are facing significant external pressure to restrain budget overspends and meet externally set financial targets, coupled with increasing patient demand and cost pressures. All the group's income from activities is derived from contracts with NHS commissioners. These contracts include the rates for, and level of, patient care activity to be undertaken by the Trust. The Trust recognises income from activities during the year based on the completion of these activities. This includes the block contract, which is agreed in advance at a fixed price, and patient care income from contract variations. Any patient care activities that are additional to those incorporated in these block contracts with commissioners (contract variations) are subject to verification and agreement by commissioners. As such, there is the risk that income is recognised in the accounts for these additional services that is not subsequently agreed to by the commissioners . Due to the nature of block contracts we have not identified a significant ri sk of material misstatement in relation to block contracts. 20% of the group's income is recorded as other operating revenues (excluding Education & Training income, and Provider Sustainability Funding income (PSF ). The risk around other operating revenues is related to the improper recognition of revenues including contract liabilities (deferred income) . Education & Training income and PSF income are income s treams that are principally derived from contracts that are agreed in advance at a fixed price, or in the case of PSF agreed by NHS Improvement (NHSI) . We have not identified a significant risk of material misstatement in relation to these elements of other operating revenue. We therefore identified the occurrence and accuracy of patient care income from contract variations and other operating revenues , and the existence of associated receivable balances as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement . . Our audit work included, but was not restrict ed to: E valuating the group and Trust's accounting policy for recognition of income from activities and other operating revenues for appropriateness and compliance with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) group accounting manual 2018- 19; Updating our understanding of the Group and Trust's system for accounting for income from activities and other operating revenues and evaluating the design of the associated controls . In respect of income from activities : Using the DHSC mismatch report , investigating unmatched revenue and receivable balances over \u00a3300,000, corroborating the unmatched balances used by the Trust to supporting evidence; Agreeing, on a sample basis, income from contract variations and year end receivables to supporting evidence ; Evaluating the judgements made by management in order to determine recognition of income from contract variations . In respect of other operating revenues: Agreeing, on a sample basis, income and year end receivables from the group's other operating revenues to supporting evidence ; Testing, on a sample basis, additions to and releases from deferred research and development income in the current year to supporting evidence. The group' s accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in note 1.2 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 3. Key observations We obtained sufficient audit evidence to conclude that: the group and Trust's accounting policy for recognition of income from activities and other operating revenues complies with the DHSC g roup accounting manual 2018-9 and has been properly applied; and Income from patient care activities and other operating revenues and the associated receivable balances, are not materially misstated. Key Audit Matter -Trust How the matter was addressed in the audit Valuation of property The Trust revalues its land and buildings on a five- yearly basis to ensure the carrying value in the financial statements is not materially different from current value in use at the year-end date. In the intervening years, such as in 2018/19, the Trust requests a desktop valuation from its valuation expert. In addition, when a significant new build ing is brought Our audit work included, but was not res tricted to: Evaluating management's processes and assumptions for the estimation of the value of property , the instructions issued to the valuation expert and the scope of their work ; Evaluating the competence, capabilities and 219Key Audit Matter -Trust How the matter was addressed in the audit into use , as in the new proton beam and outpatient's department in 2018/19, the Trust requests a full valuation of that property from its valuation expert. The valuation of land and buildings is a key accounting estimate which is sensitive to changes in assumptions and market conditions. These valuations represent signifi cant estimates by management in the financial statements. We therefore identified valuation of land and buildings as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement . objectivity of the valuation expert ; Discuss ing with the valuer the basis on which the valuation was carried out ; Challenging the information and assumptions used by the valuer to assess completeness and consistency with our understanding; Testing revaluations made during the year t o see if they had been input correctly into the Trust's asset register; The group's accounting policy on valuation of property , including land and buildings, is shown in note 1.4.2 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 10. The Audit Committee identified valuation of property as a significant issue in its report dated April 2019 referred to in the section of the Annual Report headed Committees of the Board. We obtained sufficient audit assurance to conclude that: the basis of the valuation of land and buildings was appropriate, and the assumptions and processes used by management in determining the estimate of valuation of property were reasonable; the valuation of land and buildings disclosed in the financial statements is reasonable. Implementation of IFRS 15 to research contracts In 2018/19, a new accounting standard on accounting for revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15) was introduced. The standard requires entities to recognise such revenue as and when it has met the performance obligations in the contract. As at 31 March 2019 the Trust has deferred income of \u00a314.592m. Of this, \u00a37.207 m relates to revenue from contracts with research and development customers (contract liabilities). The Trust manages research and development income and expenditure at a disease group level rather than on a contract by contract basis. It is therefore not possible to directly match contract liabilities at the year end with outstanding performance obligations on individual contracts. During the audit we identified this as a significant risk , which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement. Our audit work included but was not restricted to: evaluating the group and Trust's accounting policy for recognition of revenue from contracts with research customers, including the recognition of contract liabilities. obtaining an understanding of the process for assessing the impact of the new standard and evaluated the design of the associated controls. challenging the assumptions made by management in relation to research contract liabilities . The Trust's accounting policy on recognition of income is shown in note 1.2.2 to the financial statements and related disclosures are at notes 15.2 and 15.3. We obtained sufficient audit assurance to conclude that: the Trust has applied IFRS 15 appropriately to revenue from research contracts ; the assumptions used by management are reasonable Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 220Materiality was determined as follows: Materiality Measure Group Trust Financial statements as a whole \u00a3 6,081,000 which is 2% of the group 's operating expenses . This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because we consider users of the financial statements to be most interested in how the group has expended its revenue and other funding. Materiality for the current year is at the same percentage level of operating expenses as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2018 as we did not identify any significant changes in the group or the environment in which it operates . \u00a3 6,080,000 which is 2% of the Trust 's operating expenses . This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because we consider users of the financial statements to be most interested in how the Trust has expended its revenue and other funding. Materiality for the current year is at the same percentage level of operating expenses as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2018 as we did not identify any significant changes in the Trust or the environment in which it operates . Performance materiality used to drive the extent of our testing 75% of financial statement materiality 75% of financial statement materiality Specific materiality \u00a320,000 for disclosure of senior manager remuneration in the Remuneration Report based on our view of the level of misstatement that would influence the views of the users of the accounts. Communication of misstatements to the Audit Committee \u00a3300,000 and misstatements below that threshold that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds \u00a3300,000 and misstatements below that threshold that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. The graph below illustrates how performance materiality interacts with our overall materiality and the tolerance for potential uncorrected misstatements. Overall materiality - Group and Trust An overview of the scope of our audit Our audit approach was a risk -based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group' s business, its environment and risk profile and in particular included: Evaluation of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality. We determined a component to be individually significan t if it represents 15% of the group' s operating expenditure. This is a change in our audit approach from previous years where we used 5% of the Group's income, expenditure, gross or net assets ; Identifi cation of the Chri stie NHS Foundation Trust as the only significant component in the group. The Christie NHS Foundation Trust represents 96% of the g roup's operating income, 89 % of its operating expenses and 83% of the group's total assets . We carried out a full scope audit in relation to the Trust . Identif ication of a further five non-significant components of the group - the Christie Charitable Fund, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Christie Pharmacy Ltd and three joint ventures, the Christie Clinic LLP, Christie Pathology Partnership LLP and CPP Facilities LLP. 25% 75% 221 An interim visit in February 2019 to evaluat e the group's internal control e nvironment including its IT systems and controls over key financial systems and processes and a final visit in May 2019 to perform substantive tests on transactions and balances ; For the Christie Charitable Fund performing analytical techniques on the fig ures consolidated into the group financial statements and substantive tests on donated income and the bank balance. The Christie Charitable Fund represents 4% of the g roup's operating income, less than 1% of its expenditure and 11% of the group's total assets ; For the Christie Pharmacy Ltd performing analytical techniques on the figures consolidated into the group financial statements and tests of control and substantive tests on its operating expenses . The Christie Pharmacy Ltd represents 1 0% of the group's expenditure and less than 1% of the group's total assets ; For the Christie Clinic LLP carrying out specific procedures on the Trust's share of the joint venture's profit. The Christie Clinic LLP represents 20% of the group's surplus for the year and 5 % of the group's total assets . We performed analytical procedures on the group's share of the profits of its other two joint ventures. These bodies represent less than 1% of the group's surplus for the year and less than 1% of the group's total assets. Other information The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report , other than the financial statements and our auditor 's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of th e other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions: Fair, balanced and understandable in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance - the statement given by the directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the Trust's performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Trust obtained in the audit ; or The Audit Committee reporting in accordance with provision C.3.9 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance - the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. Other information we are required to report on by exception under the Code of Audit Practice Under the Code of Audit Practice published by the National Audit Office on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General (the Code of Audit Practice) we are required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement does not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018 /19 or is misleading or inconsistent with the information of which we are aware from our audit. We are not required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement addresses all risks and controls or that risks are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. We have nothing to report in this regard. 222Our opinion on other matters required by the Code of Audit Practice is unmodified In our opinion: the parts of the Remuneration Report and the Staff Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, as interpreted and adapted by the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 201 8/19 and the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006; and based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and our knowledge of the Trust gained through our work in relation to the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources , the other information published together with the financial statements in the Annual Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters o n which we are required to report by exception Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if: we issue a report in the public interest under Schedule 10 (3) of the National Health Service Act 2006 in the course of, or at the conclusion of the audit; or we refer a matter to the regulator under Schedule 10 (6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we have reason to believe that the Trust, or a director or officer of the Trust, i s about to make, or has made, a decision which involve s or would involve the incurring of expenditure that was unlawful, or i s about to take, or has begun to take a course of action which, if followed to its conclusion, would be unlawful and likely to cause a loss or deficiency . We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters. Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and Those Charged with Governance for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of the Chief Executive's responsibilities as the accounting officer , the Chief Executive, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in the form and on the basis set out in the Accounts Directions included in the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018 /19, for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Accounting Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the group' s and the Trust 's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Accounting Officer ha s been informed by the relevant national body of the intention to dissolve the Trust and the group without the transfer of the Trust's services to another public sector entity. The Audit Committee is Those Charged with Gov ernance. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Trust's financial reporting process. Auditor 's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor 's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council 's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditor 's report. 223Report on other legal and regulatory requirements - Conclusion on the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Matter on which we are required to report by exception - Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2019 . We have nothing to report in respect of the above matter. Significant risks Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report on how our work addressed the significant risks we identified in forming our conclusion on the adequacy of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. Significant risks are those risks that in our view had the potential to cause us to reach an inappropriate conclusion on the audited body's arrangements . The table below sets out the significant risks we have identified. These significant risks were addressed in the context of our conclusion on the Trust's arrangements as a whole, and in forming our conclusion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these risks. Significant risks How the matter was addressed in the audit Risk 1 Use of The Christie Pharmacy Company Ltd to improve dispensary services In October 2017 the Christie NHS Foundation Trust set up a wholly owned subsidiary company, The Christie Pharmacy Company Ltd (TCP) to run its pharmacy dispensing services when the contract with the previous provider ended. In planning our 2017/18 audit we identified significant inherent risks in the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in its use of resources associated with any such significant new ventures. On the basis of the work we carried out as part of our 2017/18 audit , we were satisfied that the Trust had put adequate arrangements in place to secure economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in relation to the creation of TCP. However, we also noted that , at that time , it was too soon to assess the arrangements for improv ement of dispensing times , one of the key objectives for setting up the company. The risk is whether the Trust has adequate arrangements in place to ensure sustainable resource deployment in that TCP delivers the improvements in dispens ing times it was set up to achieve. Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: Evaluating key monitoring documentation and discussions with key staff to assess the arrangements in place to improve dispensing times following the creation of TCP Key findings The Trust's arrangements for improving dispensing times includ e: setting and monitoring key performance indicator s for TCP, and requiring TCP to report on progress to the Trust's Risk and Governance Committee. These arrangements have led to an overall improvement in the number of months the dispensing time target has been met in 2018/19. Risk 2 Achievement of the 62- day cancer waiting time from GP referral target As a specialist cancer centre, the national cancer targets are of particular relevance to The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. Because it is a tertiary centre, patients referred by GPs are seen by one or two other trusts before being referred on to The Christie. In 2018/19 the method for apportioning any breach of the target across trusts in the pathway was changed. The Trust expected that the new approach would mean its reported performance would fall below target . The potential adverse impact on patient experience and the Trust's reputation from non- achievement of the target following implementation of the new breach allocation policy led to the Trust assessing this one of its biggest risks for 2018 /19. The risk is whether the Trust has adequate arrangements in place to ensure sustainable resource Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: Evaluating key monitoring documentation and discussions with key staff to assess the arrangements in place to improve achievement of the 62- day cancer waiting time target Key findings The Trust has put a number of arrangements in place to improve its reported performance against the 62- day cancer wait ing time target including: setting up focused task and finish groups on various aspects of the pro cess extending radiotherapy times The Trust's reported performance for the year was 79.1% against a target of 85%. However, statistics published by NHS England show that the Trust's 224Significant risks How the matter was addressed in the audit deployment in the achievement of its 62-day cancer waiting time target. performance was equal to the national average. R esponsibilities of the Accounting Officer The Accounting Officer is responsible for putting in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the Trust 's resources. Auditor 's responsibilities for the review of the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources We are required under paragraph 1 of Schedule 10 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to be satisfied that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources and to report where we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that it has done so. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether all aspects of the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources are operating effectively. We have undertaken our review in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice, having regard to the guidance on the specified criterion issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in November 2017, as to whether in all significant respects, the Trust had proper arrangements to ensure it took properly informed decisions and deployed resources to achieve planned and sustainable outcomes for taxpayers and local people. The Comptroller and Auditor General determined this criterion as that necessary for us to consider under the Code of Audit Practice in satisfying ourselves whether the Trust put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2019 , and to report by exception where we are not satisfied. We planned our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice. Based on our risk assessment, we undertook such work as we considered necessary to be satisfied that the Trust has put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources.

Accounting Policies NHS Improvement, inexercising the statutory conventions conferred on Monitor has directed that thefinancial statements of NHS foundation trusts shall meet theaccounting requirements of theDepartment of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (DH GAM) which shall be agreed with HMTreasury. Consequently, thefollowing financial statements have been prepared inaccordance with theDHGAM 2018-19 issued by theDepartment of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained intheGAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to the extent that they aremeaningful and appropriate toNHS foundation trusts, as determined by HMTreasury, which isadvised by theFinancial Reporting Advisory Board. Where theDHGAM permits achoice of accounting policy, theaccounting policy that isjudged tobemost appropriate to the particular circumstances oftheNHS foundation trust for the purpose of giving a true andfairview has been selected. Theparticular policies adopted aredescribed below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. 1.1 Accounting Conventions These accounts have been prepared on agoing concern basis, under thehistorical cost convention modified toaccount for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.1.1 Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations Activities areconsidered tobe 'acquired' only ifthey areacquired from considered tobe ifthey cease entirely. They arenot considered tobe ifthey transfer from one NHS body to another. 1.1.2.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies Thefollowing arethejudgements, apart from those involving estimates (see below) that management has made inthe process of applying accounting policies and that have themost significant effect ontheamounts recognised inthe financial statements. (a)Foreach Research and Development contract, theTrust transfers control of goods and services over time and therefore, satisfies performance obligations and recognises revenue over time. This may be over several financial years. Research and Development income recognised is in equal value to the cost inthefinancial year of satisfying the performance obligations. See note 15. (b) As part of our critical assessment oftheimpact of theIFRS 15 revenue recognition standard theTrust has determined that there areoverarching implicit promises inrelation toour contracted agreements with strategic partners which require us tohave adequate and sufficient infrastructure inplace which isappropriately maintained throughout the fulllength of contractual agreements. As a result of these promises and mutual understandings, theTrust has not absorbed all of theincome inrelation tothese contracts but created acontract liability which is in place tocover the overall maintenance and sustainability of all requi red infrastructure. 1.1.2.2 Sources of estimation uncertainty Thefollowing areassumptions about the future and other major sources of estimation uncertainty that have asignificant risk of resulting in material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. (a)Non-current Property, Plant and Equipment asset valuation relating toland and buildings arebased on theDistrict Valuers valuation - see note 10. The uncertainty over future changes toestimations of thecarrying amount of land and buildings ismitigated by the annual independent valuation of these assets. Theestimation methods used by theindependent valuer draw upon, but arenotlimited to,industry recognised building construction indices and relevant or comparable transactions inthe market place. Asimple sensitivity analysis indicates that a3% movement inthese estimations would increase or decrease the valuation of assets by \u00a37.4m. (b) Calculation of provisions - see note 1.12 and 17.(c) In 2017-18, the basis upon which the Modern Equivalent Asset Valuation was assessed for land by the external valuer was changed from the existing site to an alternative theoretical site. 2321.1.3 Consolidation The Consolidated Accounts of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust show both the NHS Foundation Trust and the Group balances. The Group balances comprise The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, The Christie Charitable Fund and The Christie Pharmacy Limited which are consolidated on a line-by-line basis. The Group balances in 2017-18 also included The Christie Charity Trading Company (TCCTC). TCCTC was dissolved in 2017-18 and is therefore not part of the 2018-19 Consolidated Accounts. The Christie Charitable Fund and The Christie Charity Trading Company TheFoundation Trust isthecorporate trustee to TheChristie Charitable Fund. TheFoundation Trust hasassessed its relationship toThe Christie Charitable Fund and determined ittobeasubsidiary because theFoundation Trust is exposed to,or has rights tovariable returns and other benefits for itself, patients and staff from itsinvolvement with the charitable fund and has the ability to affect those returns and other benefits through its power over the fund. TheChristie Charity Trading Company (TCCTC) isconsolidated intoTheChristie Charitable Fund accounts as TCCTC isdeemed tobeasubsidiary of The Christie Charitable Fund as itspurpose was tocarry on business as ageneral commercial company toprocure profits and gains for the purpose of paying them toTheChristie Charitable Fund. The Christie Charitable Fund holds 10 ordinary \u00a31 shares in TCCTC which is 100% of the available shares. TCCTC was incorporated on 27 April 2009 and ceased trading on 31August 2017. Anapplication tostrike off the company was made to Companies House in February 2018 and the company was struck off in May 2018. The Charitable Fund's statutory accounts areprepared to31March inaccordance with theUKCharities Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) which is based on Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) 102. On consolidation, necessary adjustments are made to the charity's assets, liabilities and transactions to: - recognise and measure them in accordance with the Foundation Trust's accounting policies; and - eliminate intra-group transactions, balances, gains and losses. The Charitable Reserves are comprised of the following Fund types: (a)Restricted Funds -where there isalegal restriction onthepurpose towhich afund may be put, thefund is classified in the accounts as a restricted fund. (b)Endowment Funds -Funds where thecapital isheld togenerate income forcharitable purposes, and which cannot be spent, areaccounted foras endowment funds. Income credited toendowment funds istransferred todesignated funds to be utilised in line with the terms of the endowment. (c)Unrestricted Funds -These include those funds which the trustee isfreetouseforany purpose infurtherance of the charitable objects. Unrestricted funds include designated funds which the trustee has chosen toearmark forset purposes. The major funds held within these categories are disclosed in Note 27.2 The Christie Pharmacy Limited The Trust has one wholly owned subsidiary -TheChristie Pharmacy Limited (company number: 11-27496). TheChristie Pharmacy was incorporated on 23 October 2017 and TheChristie NHS Foundation Trust holds 1ordinary \u00a31 share in The Christie Pharmacy Limited which is 100% of the available shares. Subsidiary entities arethose over which theTrust isexposed to,or has rights tovariable returns from itsinvolvement with the entity and has theability to affect those returns through itspower over the entity. The income, expenses, assets, liabilities, equity and reserves of thesubsidiary areconsolidated infull into the appropriate financial statement lines. On consolidation, necessary adjustments are made to the company's assets, liabilities and transactions to: - recognise and measure them in accordance with the Foundation Trusts' accounting policies; and - eliminate intra-group transactions, balances, gains and losses. 233TheChristie Pharmacy Limited's statutory accounts willbe prepared for the period from 23 October 2017 to31March 2019 inaccordance with Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) 102. Forconsolidation at 31 March 2019, accounts will be prepared for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. The Christie Pharmacy Limited is accounted for using the cost method in the Trust accounts. 1.1.4 Consolidation - Joint ventures Joint ventures areseparate entities over which theTrust has joint control withone or more other parties and where ithas therights to the net assets of thearrangement. Themeaning of control istoexercise control or power toinfluence soas to gain economic or other benefits. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Valuation of theinvestment intheJoint Venture isrecognised at cost andthecarrying amount increased or decreased to recognise The Christie's share of its profit or loss. The Trust has the following joint ventures: - The Christie Clinic LLP - trading as The Christie Private Care (TCPC) - The Christie Pathology Partnership LLP (CPP) - CPP Facilities LLP (CPPFAC) Thefigures intheaccounts as disclosed innote 11 for the above arebased on audited accounts to31 December 2018 and management accounts for the period to 31 March 2019. 1.2 Income 1.2.1 Trust Income Themain source of revenue for the Trust iscontracts withcommissioners inrespect of healthcare services. Revenue in respect of services provided isrecognised inaccordance with IFRS 15 when (oras) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised services to the customer, and ismeasured at theamount of thetransaction price allocated tothat performance obligation. Attheyear end, theTrust accrues income relating toperformance obligations satisfied in that year. DHSC has mandated that NHS bodies must adopt IFRS 15 using thepartial retrospective or cumulative catch-up approach. This means that the effect of applying thenew standard at thedate of initial application isrecognised within theopening income and expenditure reserve. The 2017-18 comparatives aretherefore not restated. The 2017-18 accounting policy, prior to the introduction of IFRS 15, is stated below: Income inrespect of services provided isrecognised when and to the extent that performance occurs, andismeasured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. Where income isreceived foraspecific performance obligation (treating Research &Development as one activity) that is to be satisfied in the following year, that income is deferred. 1.2.2 Revenue from Research Contracts Where research contracts fallunder IFRS 15, revenue isrecognised as and when performance obligations aresatisfied. Forresearch trialcontracts, it is assessed that therevenue project constitutes one performance obligation over the course of themulti-year contract. Inthese cases it isassessed thattheTrust's interim performance does not create an asset with alternative use for the Trust, and theTrust has an enforceable right topayment for the performance completed todate. Itistherefore considered that theperformance obligation issatisfied over time, and theTrust recognises revenue each year over the course of the contract. 1.2.3 Income from the sale of non-current assets Income from thesale of non-current assets isrecognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. 2341.2.4 Charitable Income a) Legacies - Pecuniary legacies are recognised as they are received or where the receipt of the legacy is probable. - Residuary legacies are included in the accounts at the earlier of receipt or agreement of the estate accounts.- Finalisation of the estate accounts is assumed when notification of this is received from the personal representatives.- Reversionary interests, involving a life tenant, are not recognised in the accounts due to the inherent uncertainties involved. - Legacies to which the charity is entitled and for which notification has been received but uncertainty over measurement remains, are disclosed, if material, as contingent income. b) Gifts in Kind The amount at which gifts inkind arerecognised iseither areasonable estimate of their value to the funds or the amount actually realised. Where applicable the basis of valuation would be disclosed in the Notes to the Accounts. Donations of investments listed ontheAlternative Investments Market (AIM) and other secondary markets arenot recognised until theshares aresold. This isdueto the AIM donated shares typically having atime restriction placed upon them which prevents their sale foraminimum period after the donation ismade and the difficulty of attributing a value in advance of the sale of the shares listed on such exchanges. c) Intangible Income Assistance intheform of donated facilities, beneficial loan arrangements, donated services or services from volunteers isonly recorded when they areprovided at afinancial cost toa third party and thebenefit isquantifiable and measurable. Volunteers do bear costs however these are regarded as personal and are not quantified. 1.2.5 The Christie Pharmacy Limited Income Income inrespect of services provided isrecognised when and to the extent that performance obligations aresatisfied by transferring promised services to the customer and ismeasured at theamount of thetransactions prices allocated to that performance obligation. Themain source of income forTheChristie Pharmacy Limited isthedispensing of drugs to The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. 1.3 Expenditure on employee benefits 1.3.1 Short-term Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employment-related payments arerecognised intheperiod inwhich theservice isreceived from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at theend of theperiod is recognised inthefinancial accounts to the extent that employees arepermitted tocarry-forward leave into the following period. 1.3.2 Pension costs - NHS Pension scheme Past and present employees arecovered by theprovisions of thetwoNHS Pension Schemes. Details of thebenefits payable and rules of theSchemes can be found on theNHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions . Both areunf unded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GPpractices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of theSecretary ofState inEngland and Wales. They arenot designed toberuninaway that would enable NHS bodies toidentify their share of theunderlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme isaccounted forasif itwere adefined contribution scheme: of participating ineach scheme istaken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. Inorder that thedefined benefit obligations recognised inthefinancial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at thereporting date by aformal actuarial valuation, theHMTreasury's Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) requires that 'the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years'. 235 An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation Avaluation of scheme liability is carried out annually by thescheme actuary (currently theGovernment Actuary's Department (GAD) ) as at theend of thereporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period inconjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures forfinancial reporting purposes. Thevaluation of thescheme liability as at 31March 2019, isbased on valuation data as at 31 March 2018, updated to31March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. Inundertaking thisactuarial assessment, themethodology prescribed inIAS19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. Thelatest assessment oftheliabilities ofthescheme iscontained inthereport of thescheme actuary, which forms part oftheannual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on theNHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copi es can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation Thepurpose of thisvaluation istoassess thelevel of liability in respect of thebenefits due under theschemes (taking intoaccount their recent demographic experience), and torecommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of thisvaluation set theemployer contribution ratepayable from April 2019. TheDepartment of Health and Social Care have recently laidScheme Regulations confirming that theemployer contribution rate willincrease to20.6% of pensionable pay from this date. The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to test the cost oftheScheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the2012 valuation. Following ajudgement from theCourt of Appeal inDecember 2018 Government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process pending conclusion of the continuing legal process. c) Scheme provisions Early payment of apension, with enhancement, isavailable tomembers of thescheme who arepermanently incapable offulfilling their duties effectively through illness orinfirmity. Adeath gratuity of twice final year's pensionable pay for death in service, and five times their annual pension for death after retirement is payable. Forearly retirements other than those due toillhealth theadditional pension liabilities arenot funded by thescheme. Thefullamount of theliability for the additional costs ischarged toexpenditure at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. Members can purchase additional service intheNHS Scheme and contribute tomoney purchase Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) run bytheScheme's approved providers or by other Free Standing Additional Voluntary Contributions (FSAVC) providers. 1.3.3 Pension costs - other schemes The employees of The Christie Pharmacy Limited have access totwopension schemes. These are a Legal and General defined contribution scheme, and theNational Employment Savings Trust (NEST) defined contribution pension scheme. 2361.3.4 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services isrecognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure isrecognised inoperating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as Property, Plant and Equipment. 1.4 Property, Plant and Equipment 1.4.1 Recognition Property, Plant and Equipment is capitalised where: - it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; - it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; - it is expected to be used for more than one financial year; - the cost of the item can be measured reliably; and either - individually has a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or - form a group of assets which individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, collectively have a cost of at least \u00a35,000, where the assets are functionally interdependent, they had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or - form part of the initial setting-up cost of a new building or refurbishment of a ward or unit, irrespective of their individual or collective cost. 1.4.2 Valuation Property, Plant and Equipment assets arestated atthelower of replacement cost and recoverable amount. Oninitial recognition theassets aremeasured at cost (forleased assets, fairvalue) including any costs such as installation directly attributable tobringing them intoworking condition. Thecarrying values of Property, Plant and Equipment assets arereviewed forimpairment inperiods ifevents or changes incircumstances indicate thecarrying not be recoverable. Allland and buildings arerestated tocurrent value using professional valuations inaccordance with IAS16 every five years, with an interim valuation every three years. The Trust may also value itsland and buildings annually by an independent professional valuer. If the fair value of arevalued asset differs materially from itscarrying amount, an independent valuation is carried out for that class of asset. Valuations are carried out by professionally qualified valuers inaccordance with theRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Manual. This year's valuation was undertaken by MrsSHall (MRICS) ofthe Valuation Office Agency. Afullvaluation Depreciated Replacement Cost ofaModern Equivalent Asset for specialised operational property and Market Value forExisting Use fornon-specialised operational property. Thevalue of land forexisting use purposes isassessed onthealternative sitebasis. Fornon-operational properties including surplus land, the valuations are carried out at Open Market Value. Plant and equipment assets inthecourse of construction arevalued at cost. The Trust does not revalue thisclass of assets. Costs include borrowing costs where capitalised under circumstances as defined under IAS 23. Operational equipment is valued at depreciated historic cost. Anitem ofProperty, Plant and Equipment which issurplus with no plan tobring itback intouseisvalued at fairvalue under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. 2371.4.3 Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating toanitem ofProperty, Plant and Equipment isrecognised as an increase inthe carrying amount of theasset when it isprobable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from thecost incurred toreplace acomponent of such item willflow to the enterprise and thecost ofthe item can be determined reliably. Where acomponent of an asset isreplaced, thecost ofthereplacement iscapitalised if itmeets the criteria forrecognition above. The carrying amount of thepart replaced isde-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, ischarged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. 1.4.4 Depreciation Property, Plant and Equipment assets aredepreciated at rates calculated towrite them down toestimated residual value onastraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives and residual values arereviewed each year end, withthe effect of any changes recognised on aprospective basis. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or, where shorter, the lease term. No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets surplus to requirements. Assets inthecourse of construction arenot depreciated until theasset isbrought into operational use. Residual interests inon-Statement of Financial Position PFIcontract assets arenot depreciated until theasset reverts to the Trust. Equipment isdepreciated on historic cost forlow value and/or short lifeassets and on current cost forother equipment assets evenly over the estimated life of the asset. 1.4.5 Revaluation and impairment Increases inasset values arising from revaluations arerecognised intherevaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse an impairment previously recognised inoperating expenses, inwhich case they arereversed in operating expenditure. Revaluation losses arecharged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there isan available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Inaccordance withtheDHGAM, impairments that areduetoaloss of economic benefit arecharged tooperating expenses. Acompensating transfer ismade from therevaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i)theimpairment charged tooperating expenses: and (ii)the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. Gains and losses recognised intherevaluation reserve are reported intheStatement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income'. Animpairment arising from a loss of economic benefit or service potential isreversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave riseto the loss isreversed. Reversals arerecognised inoperating expenditure to the extent thattheasset isrestored to the carrying amount itwould have had iftheimpairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal isrecognised intherevaluation reserve. Where, at the time oftheoriginal impairment, atransfer was made from therevaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount istransferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. 2381.4.6 De-recognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'Held for Sale' once all of the following criteria are met; - the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales; - the sale must be highly probable i.e.: management are committed to a plan to sell the asset; an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale; the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price; the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'Held for Sale'; and the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will be dropped or significant changes made to it. Following reclassification, theassets aremeasured at thelower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fairvalue less costs tosell'. Depreciation ceases tobe charged and theassets arenot revalued, except where the'fairvalue less costs tosell' falls below thecarrying amount. Assets arede-recognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, Plant and Equipment which istobe scrapped or demolished does not qualify forrecognition as 'Held forSale' and instead isretained as an operational asset and theasset's economic life is adjusted. The asset isde-recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. 1.4.7 Investment Properties Investment properties are measured at fairvalue. Changes infairvalue are recognised as gains or losses income/expenditure. Only those assets which areheld solely togenerate acommercial return are considered tobe investment properties. Where an asset isheld, inpart, forsupport service delivery objectives, then it is considered tobe an item of plant, property and equipment. Properties occupied by employees, whether or not they pay rent at market rates, arenot classified as investment properties. 1.5 Intangible Assets 1.5.1 Recognition Intangible assets arenon-monetary assets without physical substance which arecapable of being sold separately from therestoftheTrust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They arerecognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits willflow to, orservice potential be provided to, the Trust and where thecost of theasset can be measured reliably. Where internally generated assets areheld forservice potential, thisinvolves a direct contribution to the delivery of services to the public. Intangible assets arecapitalised when they arecapable of being used inaTrust's activities formore than one year; they can be valued; and they have a cost of at least \u00a35,000. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an operating expense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists andsimilar items arenot capitalised as intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at historical cost. Internally-generated assets are recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use it; the ability to use the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the intangible asset and use it; the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 239Software which isintegral to the operation of hardware e.g. an operating system, iscapitalised as part of therelevant item ofProperty, Plant and Equipment. Software which isnot integral to the operation of hardware e.g. application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. 1.5.2 Measurement Intangible non-current assets held foroperational use arevalued at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. The carrying value of intangible assets isreviewed forimpairment at theend of thefirstfullyear following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where no active market exists, intangible assets arevalued at thelower of depreciated replacement cost andthevalue in use where the asset is income generating. Theamount initially recognised forinternally-generated intangible assets isthesum of theexpenditure incurred from the date when thecriteria above areinitially met. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, the expenditure is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income (SOCI) in the period in which it is incurred. 1.5.3 Amortisation Intangible assets areamortised on astraight linebasis over their expected useful economic lives or,inthecase of software licences, over the term of the licence where this is shorter. 1.6 Donated assets Donated and grant funded Property, Plant and Equipment assets arecapitalised at their fairvalue on receipt. The donation/grant iscredited toincome at thesame time, unless thedonor has imposed acondition that the future economic benefits embodied inthegrant aretobe consumed inamanner specified by thedonor, inwhich case, the donation/grant isdeferred within liabilities andiscarried forward to future financial years to the extent that thecondition has not yet been met. Thedonated and grant funded assets aresubsequently accounted forinthesame manner as other items ofProperty, Plant and Equipment. 1.7 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) transactions PFItransactions which meet the IFRIC 12 definition of aservice concession, as interpreted inHMTreasury's FReM, are accounted foras 'on-Statement of Financial Position' by theTrust. The underlying assets arerecognised as PPE at their fair value. An equivalent financial liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 17. Theannual contract payments areapportioned between therepayment of theliability, afinance cost andthecharges for services. The finance cost is calculated using the effective interest rate for the scheme. The service charge is recognised in operating expenses and the finance cost is charged to Finance Costs in the SOCI. Where thebalance of therisks and rewards of ownership of thePFIproperty areborne by thePFIoperator, thePFI payments arerecorded as an operating expense. Where theTrust has contributed land and buildings, aprepayment for their fairvalue isrecognised and amortised over thelifeofthePFIcontract by to the SOCI. Where, at theend of thePFIcontract, aproperty reverts to the Trust, thedifference between theexpected fairvalue of theresidual on reversion and any agreed payment on reversion isbuilt up over thelifeofthecontract by capitalising part of theunitary charge each year, as a tangible non current asset. 1.8 Government grants Government grants aregrants from Government bodies other than income from commissioners orNHS trusts for the provision of services. Where agrant isused tofund revenue expenditure it istaken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. 2401.9 Research The revenue cost of personnel, consumables, etc.engaged inresearch and development activities is shown as direct expenditure of theTrust. Some of these activities arefunded through charitable sources and therefore an amount corresponding to the expenditure charged to the SOCI isincluded inoperating income from charitable and other contributions to expenditure. Research and development expenditure ischarged against income intheyear inwhich it isincurred, except insofar as development expenditure relates toaclearly defined project and thebenefits of itcan reasonably be regarded as assured. Expenditure sodeferred is limited to the value of future benefits expected and isamortised through theincome and expenditure account on asystematic basis over theperiod expected tobenefit from theproject. Itisrevalued on the basis of current cost. The amortisation is calculated on the same basis as depreciation, on a monthly basis. Expenditure which does not meet thecriteria forcapitalisation istreated as an operating cost intheyear inwhich it is incurred. Where possible NHS foundation trusts disclose the total amount of research and development expenditure charged intheSOCI separately. However, where research and development activity cannot be separated from patient care activity it cannot be identified and is therefore not separately disclosed. 1.10 Leases Leases areclassified as finance leases when substantially all therisks and rewards of ownership aretransferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 1.10.1 The Trust as lessee Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of aleased asset areborne by theTrust, theasset isrecorded as Property, Plant and Equipment and acorresponding liability is recorded. Thevalue at which both arerecognised isthe lower of the fair value of theasset or thepresent value of theminimum lease payments, discounted using theinterest rate implicit in thelease. The implicit interest rate isthat which produces aconstant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Theasset and liability arerecognised at theinception of thelease. Thereafter theasset isaccounted foras an item of property, plant or equipment. Thelease liability is de-recognised when theliability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Theannual rental is split between therepayment of theliability andafinance cost. Theannual finance cost iscalculated by applying the implicit interest rate to the outstanding liability and is charged to Finance Costs in the SOCI. Operating leases Other leases areregarded as operating leases and therentals arecharged tooperating expenses on astraight-line basis over theterm ofthelease. Operating lease incentives received areadded to the lease rentals and charged to operating expenses over the life of the lease. Leases of land and buildings Where alease isforland and buildings, theland component isseparated from thebuilding component and the classification for each is assessed separately. 1.10.2 The Trust as lessor Amounts due from lessees under finance leases arerecorded as receivables at theamount of theTrust's net investment intheleases. lease income periods soastoreflect aconstant periodic rateofreturn on the Trust's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. Rental income from operating leases isrecognised on astraight-line basis over theterm ofthelease. Initial direct costs incurred innegotiating and arranging an operating lease areadded to the carrying amount of theleased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2411.11 Financial Instruments and Financial Liabilities 1.11.1 Financial Assets Financial assets arerecognised when theTrust becomes party to the contractual provision of thefinancial instrument or, inthecase of trade receivables, when thegoods or services have been delivered. Financial assets arederecognised when thecontractual rights have expired or when theasset has been transferred and theTrust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership or has not retained control of the asset. Financial assets areinitially recognised at fairvalue plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs forfinancial assets not measured at fairvalue through profit or loss. Fair value istaken as thetransaction price, or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices, where possible, or by valuation techniques. Financial assets areclassified into the following categories: financial assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets at fairvalue through profit and loss. Theclassification isdetermined by thecash flow and business model characteristics of thefinancial assets, as set out inIFRS 9, and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets measured at amortised cost arethose held within abusiness model whose objective istohold financial assets inorder tocollect contractual cash flows and where thecash flows aresolely payments of principal and interest. This includes most trade receivables, loans receivable, and other simple debt instruments. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets measured at fairvalue through other comprehensive income arethose held within abusiness model whose objective isachieved by both collecting contractual cash flows andselling financial assets and where thecash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Financial assets measured at fairvalue through profit or loss arethose that arenot otherwise measured at amortised cost orfairvalue through other comprehensive income. This includes derivatives and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. DHSC has mandated that NHS bodies must adopt IFRS 9using thepartial retrospective or cumulative catch-up approach. This means that the effect of applying thenew standard at thedate of initial application isrecognised within theopening income and expenditure. The2017-18 comparatives aretherefore not restated. The 2017-18 accounting policy, prior to the introduction of IFRS 9, is stated below: Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arising from contracts for the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which areentered intoinaccordance with theTrust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements, arerecognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs i.e.when receipt or delivery of thegoods or services is made. Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. Allother financial assets and financial liabilities arerecognised when theNHS Foundation Trust becomes aparty to the contractual provisions of the instrument. De-recognition Allfinancial assets arede-recognised when therights toreceive cash flows from theassets have expired or theTrust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 242Classification and Measurement Financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables. 1.11.2 Impairment Forall financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fairvalue through other comprehensive income (except equity instruments designated at fairvalue through other comprehensive income), lease receivables and contract assets, the Trust recognises a loss allowance representing expected credit losses on the financial instrument. The Trust adopts thesimplified approach toimpairment, inaccordance with IFRS 9, and measures theloss allowance fortrade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables at an amount equal tolifetime expected credit losses. For other financial assets, theloss allowance ismeasured at an amount equal tolifetime expected credit losses ifthecredit riskonthefinancial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition (stage 2),and otherwise at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). HMTreasury has ruled that central government bodies may not recognise stage 1or stage 2impairments against other government departments, their executive agencies, theBank of England, Exchequer Funds, and Exchequer Funds' assets where repayment isensured by primary legislation. The Trust therefore does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1or stage 2impairments against these bodies. Additionally, theDepartment of Health and Social Care provides a guarantee of last resort against thedebts of itsarm's length bodies and NHS bodies (excluding NHS charities) and the Trust does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. Forfinancial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3),expected credit losses at the reporting date aremeasured as thedifference between theasset's gross carrying amount and thepresent value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at thefinancial asset's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss. 1.11.3 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities arerecognised when theTrust becomes party to the contractual provisions of thefinancial instrument or,inthecase of trade payables, when thegoods or services have been received. Financial liabilities arede-recognised when the liability has been extinguished - that is, the obligation has been discharged or cancelled or has expired. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Derivatives that areliabilities aresubsequently measured at fairvalue through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives that arenot part of ahybrid contract containing ahost that isan asset within thescope of IFRS 9 are separately accounted foras derivatives only iftheir economic characteristics and risks arenot closely related tothose of their host contracts, a separate instrument with thesame terms would meet thedefinition of aderivative, and thehybrid contract isnotitself measured at fair value through profit or loss. Other Financial Liabilities After initial recognition, all other financial liabilities aremeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Theeffective interest rateistheratethat exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through thelifeoftheasset, to the amortised cost ofthefinancial liability. In the case ofDHSC loans that would be thenominal ratecharged on the loan. 1.12 Provisions The NHS foundation trust recognises aprovision where ithasapresent legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; forwhich it isprobable that there willbeafuture outflow of cash or other resources; and areliable estimate can be made of theamount. Theamount recognised intheStatement of Financial Position isthebest estimate oftheresources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect ofthe time value of money issignificant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows arediscounted using thediscount rates published and mandated by HMTreasury. Early retirement provisions arediscounted using HMTreasury's pension discount rate of positive 0.29% (2017-18: 0.10%) in real terms. 243Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution (formerly NHS Litigation Authority) operates a risk pooling scheme under which theTrust pays an annual contribution toNHS Resolution, which, inreturn, settles allclinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution isadministratively responsible forallclinical negligence cases, thelegal liability remains with theTrust. The total value ofclinical negligence provisions carried byNHS Resolution on behalf of theTrust isdisclosed at note 17 but isnot recognised in the NHS foundation trust's accounts. Non-clinical risk pooling The Trust participates intheProperty Expenses Scheme and theLiabilities toThird Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which theTrust pays an annual contribution toNHS Resolution and, inreturn, receives assistance with thecosts ofclaims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any 'excesses' payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. 1.13 Inventories Inventories arevalued at thelower of cost and net realisable value. Thecost of inventories ismeasured using thefirstin, first out (FIFO) method. 1.14 Cash and cash equivalents Cash iscash inhand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents areinvestments that mature in3months or less from thedate of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. 1.15 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) isatype of public sector equity finance based on theexcess of assets over liabilities atthe time of establishment of thepredecessor NHS trust andwhich represents theDepartment of Health and investment intheTrust. HMTreasury has determined that PDC isnotafinancial instrument within themeaning of IAS 32. Anannual thecost of capital utilised bytheTrust, ispayable as PDC dividend. The charge is calculated therate set by theSecretary ofState with theconsent of HMTreasury (currently on theaverage relevant net assets of theTrust during thefinancial year. The average relevant net assets iscalculated as asimple average of opening and closing relevant net assets. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for: (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets), (ii)plus thevalue of any deferred income balance that funds adonated asset (toavoid thepotential todouble count donated assets as net where adonated asset isassociated with adeferred income balance), (iii)average daily cash balances held with theGovernment Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short-term working capital facility, (iv) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable, and (v) Provider Sustainability Funding (PSF) incentive and bonus elements. Inaccordance withtherequirements laiddown by theDepartment of Health and Social Care (astheissuer of PDC), the dividend for the year iscalculated on theactual average relevant net assets as set out inthe'pre-audit' version of the annual accounts. Thedividend thus calculated isnot revised should any adjustment tonet assets occur as aresult of the audit of the annual accounts. 2441.16 Non Current Asset Investments 1.16.1 Recognition and Measurement Non current asset investments are stated at fair value at the balance sheet date. 1.16.2 Realised and unrealised gains and losses All gains and losses are taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise. Realised gains and losses on investments are calculated as the difference between sales proceeds and opening fair value (or cost if purchased since the previous period end). Unrealised gains and losses are calculated as the difference between fair value at the year end and the opening fair value (or cost if purchased since the previous period end). 1.17 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is,assets arising from past events whose existence willonly be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) arenot recognised as assets, butaredisclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities arenot recognised, but aredisclosed innote 18, unless theprobability of atransfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: possible obligations arising from past events whose existence willbe confirmed only by theoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or present obligations arising from past events but forwhich it isnot probable that atransfer of economic benefit willarise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.18 Corporation tax Under s519A ICTA 1988 theTrust isregarded as aHealth Service body and is,therefore, exempt from taxation on its income and capital gains. Section 148 of the2004 Finance Actprovided theHMTreasury with powers todisapply this exemption. Accordingly theTrust ispotentially within thescope of corporation taxinrespect of activities which arenot related to,or ancillary to, the provision of healthcare and where the profits exceed \u00a350,000 per annum. Activities such asstaff and patient car parking and sales of food areconsidered tobe ancillary to the core healthcare objectives of the Trust (and not entrepreneurial) and therefore not subject tocorporation tax. Anytaxliability will be accounted forwithin the relevant tax year. The Christie Pharmacy Limited, asubsidiary of theTrust, issubject tocorporation taxoncommercial activities. Corporation tax and deferred tax liabilities have arisen in the period to 31 March 2019. 1.19 Value Added Tax (VAT) Most oftheactivities oftheTrust areoutside thescope of VAT and, ingeneral, output taxdoes not apply and input tax on purchases isnot recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT ischarged to the relevant expenditure category or included inthe capitalised purchase cost of non-current assets. Where output taxischarged or input VAT isrecoverable, theamounts are stated net of VAT. 1.20 Foreign exchange The functional and presentational currencies of the Trust are sterling. Atransaction which isdenominated inaforeign currency istranslated into the functional currency at thespot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Where the Trust has assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at the Statement of Financial Position date: monetary items (other than financial instruments measured at 'fair value through income and expenditure') are translated at the spot exchange rate on 31 March; non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost aretranslated using thespot exchange rateatthedate of the transaction; and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fairvalue aretranslated using thespot exchange rateatthedate fair value was determined. 245Exchange gains or losses on monetary items (arising on settlement of thetransaction or on re-translation at the Statement of Financial Position date) are recognised in income or expense in the period in which they arise. Exchange gains or losses on non-monetary assets and liabilities arerecognised inthesame manner as other gains and losses on these items. 1.21 Losses and Special Payments Losses and special payments areitems that Parliament would not have contemplated when itagreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. Bytheir nature they areitems that ideally should not arise. They aretherefore subject tospecial control procedures compared with thegenerality of payments. They aredivided into different categories, which govern the way each individual case is handled. Losses and Special Payments arecharged to the relevant functional headings intheSOCI on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had theTrust not been bearing itsown risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). Note 21iscompiled directly from thelosses and compensations register which isprepared on an accrual basis with theexception of provisions for future losses. 1.22 Third party assets Assets belong tothird parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) arenot recognised intheaccounts since the Trust has no beneficial interest in them. Details of third party assets are given in note 14.3 to the accounts. 1.23 Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted The DHSC GAM does not require thefollowing IFRS Standards in2018-19. These FReM adoption, with IFRS 16 being forimplementation in2019-20, and the government implementation date for IFRS 17 still subject to HM Treasury consideration. (a) IFRS 16 Leases -Application required foraccounting periods beginning on or after 1January 2019, but not yet adopted by FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted. (b) IFRS17 Insurance Contracts -Application required foraccounting periods beginning on or after 1January 2021 but not yet adopted by FReM; early adoption is not therefore permitted. (c) IFRS 23 U ncertainty over Income TaxTreatments -Application required foraccounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. No accounting standards in issue have been adopted early. Theimplementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 23willhave no impact on theTrust. The impact of IFRS 16willbeassessed following the publication of DHSC guidance on the implementation of the accounting standard. 246Consolidated Accounts of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust 2018-2019 2. Operating segments 3. O perating income Group Therapy 4,012 the Trust is required to disclose financial information across significant operating segments which reflect the way the management runs the Trust. The Trust has applied the aggregation criteria from IFRS 8 Operating Segments because the clinical divisions provide similar services, have homogenous customers, common production processes and a common regulatory environment. The overlapping activities and interrelation between the divisions also suggests that aggregation is appropriate. The divisions report to the CODM, and it is the CODM that ultimately makes decisions about the allocation of budgets, capital funding and other financial decisions.The Trust's core activities fall under the remit of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', which has been determined to be the Management Board, a sub-committee of the Board of Directors. These core activities are primarily the provision of specialist NHS healthcare, the income for which is received through contracts with commissioners. The planned level of activity is agreed with our main commissioners for the year, and are listed in the related party disclosure (see Note 22). The Trust manages the delivery of healthcare services across clinical divisions. Certain aspects of performance are reported at a divisional level to the Management Board, although this is not the primary way in which financial matters are considered. Income from activities relates toincome arising from mandatory services. Growth inactivity relates toincreased patient treatments. Due to the specialist nature of the Trust, increased income also relates to the complexity of patient treatments undertaken during the year. ** Other includes income from CQUIN, Multi disciplinary temas (MDTs) and any other clinical activity.* Outpatient income includes radiotherapy and chemotherapy ambulatory treatments and diagnostic imaging and tests. 247Consolidated Accounts of The Christie NHS Foundation Trust 2018-2019 3.1.2 Income from activities by source 238,324 238,324 217,681 217,681 * Department of Health and Social Care funding for the Agenda for Change (AfC) pay award. 3.2 Other Operating Income Group NHS Foundation Research and development 17,983 17,983 21,459 21,459 Education and training 6,000 6,000 5,054 5,054 Non-patient care services to other bodies 643 810 635 627 Christie Medical Physics & Engineering 7,897 7,897 7,579 7,579 6,803 6,803 6,093 6,093 Joint LLP* 1,187 1,187 1,237 1,237 Joint venture - CPP Facilities LLP* 770 770 687 687 Provider sustainability fund General distribution 961 961 481 481 Income Creche services 737 737 739 739 Property rentals 255 255 759 760 Car parking 362 362 366 366 Pharmacy sales (3) (3) 11 12 Other contract income 2,025 2,025 2,142 2,176 Other non-contract operating income:Charitable and other contributions to capital expenditure 0 4,416 0 2,986 Charitable and other contributions to revenue expenditure 0 7,984 0 10,259 Donations, legacies and grants 13,552 0 Pathology Partnership LLP and TheChristie Pathology Partnership Facilities LLP via Service Level Agreements, property rental income and other contractual payments. **The Trust receives core, incentive and bonus funding from NHS England inrelation to the Provider sustainability fund Income (2017-18: Sustainability and Transformation Fund).

Investment properties are measured at their fair value as at the balance sheet date. The first professional valuation of investment properties took place in April 2019 and the fair value of the assets is reflected in these statements. The purchase price of the investment property reflected the value of the building and surrounding land, as well as the going concern value of the business operating on the premises prior to the purchase. This business ceased operating once the property was purchased and so the property has been valued solely on the fair value of the building and land in its current condition and without taking into account any future income flows arising from the use of the asset. As such, an impairment of \u00a31.85m appears as an item of expenditure in these statements. 26012.
