What's most upsetting, however, is, the fact that, too often, most doctors don't recognize or acknowledge these side effects or withdrawal symptoms as having been caused by the very drug they prescribed to treat and/or cure their patients in the first place. Instead, they tend to blame genes, age, lifestyle or just about anything else, whether scientifically sound or not. After all, who wants to admit they caused a new pathology with their last \"expertly chosen\" prescription? If the doctor asked his drug rep if this or that drug could cause an entirely new disease, what do you suppose the drug rep's response would be? That's where you come in. Where it's absolutely critical that you do your homework. Let's face it. No one else in your life has the power you have to do this. No one else has the time and devotion to put in this type of effort. That is, no one else but you (and perhaps, maybe, your mother). This is also where homeopathy comes in. Not only because it is the medicine we all thought we were getting in the first place (you know, the one we expected to actually cure what ails us), but because homeopathy can set us on a track that not only resolves our original complaint but also addresses any new issues caused by previously unsuccessful treatments. Pardon me, as I realize I am beginning to ramble here. Let's get back to the subject of anti-doting. Given that each illness, each person, and each reaction to a drug is different, it seems a daunting expectation that a chemical reaction can be halted with a homeopathic medicine, but to a certain degree, it often can. Take [Sulphur 30 or 200](https://www.boironusa.com/product/sulphur/), for example. When Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, the Father of Homeopathy, was practicing in Germany during the late 1700s, he opened nearly every case with Sulphur in homeopathic potency. He did this in order to antidote the myriad of drugs people were taking at the time. Yes, people took plenty of drugs back then, too, because their doctors were doing the same then as they are now. Morphine for simple headaches. Cocaine for teething. Laudanum, mercury, and the list went on. Though to my knowledge, I don't know of anything to help antidote bloodletting. However, there is also the ill use of a homeopathic remedy as well. Most folks who use homeopathy understand that the use of the wrong homeopathic remedy, especially if used too frequently, can actually cause what the medicine was intended to correct. For the zealous beginner, this can sometimes become a problem. The solution? Several good sniffs of mint, camphor or other aromatics can occasionally antidote the action. I've seen it antidote a reaction within minutes, while other times it can take a period of a few days, with repeated inhalations. But one of the most universal antidotes is [Camphor 200](https://www.homeopathyworks.com/camphora-pills/). The way I use this remedy is the way I observed the Drs. Banerji using it. That is, one dose for one day only, as an opening to nearly every case. There is a general assumption that drugs used in the past need to be reckoned with before the new, hopefully well-chosen remedy is administered. With this in mind, a case of eczema related to allergies might look like this: Day 1: [ Camphor 200](https://www.homeopathyworks.com/camphora-pills/), 1 dose, one day only. Then stop (to help clear the slate). Day 2: [Antimonium crud 6](https://www.boironusa.com/product/antimonium-crudum/), twice daily for 6-8 weeks, then assess (for itchy eczematous skin). Day 2: [Bovista 200](https://www.homeopathyworks.com/bovista-pills/), every other day for 6-8 weeks, then assess (for allergies in general). *Interested in learning more about steroid withdrawal syndrome? Check out the not-for-profit website [www.Itsan.org](http://www.itsan.org), started by a dermatologist and patient who noted the connection between worsening of skin conditions over time when steroids were used. I agree with their premise, but not necessarily their methods. I suffered from this condition myself after having steroid ointments on my skin from the time I was 6 weeks old until 13 years old because of eczema. I might add that my parents were warned to use it sparingly, yet it was used nonetheless. It did what it promised; it made the itching and unsightly appearance seemingly disappear; at least in the short-haul. But no matter how little was used, as long as it \"worked\" it caused damage that took me decades to undo. I must add that homeopaths have known this for over two centuries, which is why I expound each week to find an alternative to synthetic drugs whenever possible. Please accept my apologies if I seem to carry on about this, but once again, homeopathy is the answer to this devastating drug reaction. I'd love to report that a simple dose of Sulphur 30 or Camphor 200 will right all the wrongs, but it's not quite that easy when the damage is extensive. The way I laid out the remedies above is an example of how this can be done. For a more in-depth explanation of how steroid dependency can be uprooted, you might be interested in my online course, [Skin: The Ugly Truth.](http://courses.joettecalabrese.com/7-skins) __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Will you promise me this going forward? The free information I offer here every week comes with a caveat which is, I kindly ask that you help others with it. That you share this with those who will benefit and that you cure relatives, friends, pets, livestock and wildlife...all who are in need. Together, let's cure the ills of the world, one homeopathic remedy at a time. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The reason I don't indicate how many pills constitute a dose is because different pharmacies manufacture different sizes and the number of pills is appropriate to those pill sizes. The number of pills to be taken as a dose is indicated on the outside of your bottle. I am a homeopath with a worldwide practice working with families and individuals via Zoom. I'm also a teacher and most importantly, a mom who raised my now-adult children depending on homeopathy over the last 31 years. I lived decades of my life with food intolerances, allergies, and chemical sensitivities until I was cured with homeopathy, so I understand pain, anxiety, and suffering. You may feel that your issues are more severe or different than anyone else's, but I have seen it all in my practice and in my work in India. My opinion is that nothing has come close to the reproducible, safe and effective results that my clients, students and I have achieved with homeopathy.
