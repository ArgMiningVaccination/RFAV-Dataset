They also recognize the special, mission-driven nature of public media as distinguished from commercial media. The parties embrace KUOW's specific mission: to create and serve a more informed public, one challenged and invigorated by an understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures. The parties also recognize that creating good wages, benefits, and working conditions is critical to attracting and retaining high-quality employees who can build sustainable careers serving the communities of Seattle and beyond.

If the issue is not resolved informally, the Union may file a written grievance to the supervisor or designee, the Human Resources Consultant, and the Labor Relations office (laborrel@uw.edu). The Employer will designate a supervisor, manager or designee who will meet in person or confer by telephone with a union steward and/or staff representative and the grievant. The date of the meeting will be mutually agreed upon within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the grievance and when possible the meeting will take place within the aforementioned fifteen (15) calendar days. The format (face to face or by telephone) for the meeting will be by mutual agreement. The employer will respond in writing to the Union within fifteen (15) calendar days after the meeting. The Human Resources Consultant may also attend, if desired by the University. If the grievance is directed against the employee's immediate supervisor, the grievance may be presented to the next higher level of supervision. In the event the employee's immediate supervisor does not have authority to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be presented at the level having authority to act as determined by the Employer. Step Two: If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step One, said grievance may be moved to the Step Two by filing the written grievance, including a copy of the Step One decision to department head, designee, or to the next appropriate level of management and the Office of Labor Relations within fifteen (15) calendar days after the decision from Step One. The date of the meeting will be mutually agreed upon within fifteen (15) calendar days after notice of the filing at Step Two and when possible the meeting will take place within the aforementioned fifteen (15) calendar days. The grievant may be represented by a steward and a Union staff representative. The University will be represented by the appropriate management official(s) or designee(s), a representative from the Office of Labor Relations, and a Human Resources Consultant, if desired by the University. The University will respond in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the meeting. Step Three: Grievance Mediation. If the grievance is not resolved at the Step Two, the Union may file a request for mediation with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) in accordance with WAC 391-55-020, with a copy to the Labor Relations Office within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Step Two decision. In addition to all other filing requirements, the request must include a copy of the grievance and all previous responses. The Employer will inform the Union, in writing, and PERC within thirty (30) days of receipt of Mediation request if they are not in agreement. If those services are unavailable on a timely basis, the parties may request a list of grievance mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) or other agreed upon mediation provider. The cost of the mediation shall be borne equally by both parties. Step Four: Arbitration. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached at the prior step, or the step was skipped, either of the signatory parties to this Agreement may submit the grievance to binding arbitration. Such submittal must be made within thirty (30) calendar days following the written notice that the employer does not agree to Step Three (3) Mediation or the conclusion of the prior step. The Employer and the Union shall attempt to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator.

These conferences shall not delay the arbitration process, and may be held with or without the presence of the arbitrator, at the option of the moving party. In the event that an arbitrator is present, the cost of the arbitrator's participation shall be borne equally by the parties. 6.12.

If that party purchases a transcript, a copy will be provided to the arbitrator free of charge. If the other party desires a copy of the transcript, it will pay for half of the costs of the fee for the court reporter, the original transcript and a copy. - Each party is responsible for all fees and costs of its staff representatives, attorneys, experts, witnesses -and all other costs related to the development and presentation of their case.

If the employee fails to choose one (1) of the four (4) options described above, within twenty (20) days of written notice of overpayment, the Employer will deduct the overpayment owed from the employee's wages or the amount due may be placed with a collection agency.

Neither A nor B above are required for employee reported overpayments and/or employee corrected time including leave submittal corrections. All employee initiated overpayment corrections may be collected from the next available pay check. D. Appeal Rights: Any dispute concerning the occurrence or amount of the overpayment will be resolved through the grievance procedure in Article 6 of this Agreement. The Employer will suspend attempts to collect an alleged overpayment until the grievance process has concluded. E. Employees who have separated from the University or are on long-term leave must repay the University by check, which requires the ISC Payroll team to calculate the total amount owed. An overpayment cannot be considered paid in full unless it is for the amount that has been calculated by the ISC.
