Some cat breeds have a greater incidence of allergies that can affect their skin, which may decrease with age. But for some cats, skin allergies are a constant condition, and for others it may be seasonal or occasional. Skin conditions due to allergies are an increasingly common disorder in felines and are one of the most frequent causes for visits to the veterinarian. The allergen (the substance that induces the allergy) is introduced into the body in one of four ways: - It may be something your cat has come into physical contact with - It may be in your cat's diet - It may be something that has been inhaled (airborne) - It may be from a flea bite (usually from flea saliva) - If the body is sensitized to that particular allergen, it will react as if it is under attack and an allergic reaction will ensue. Allergies that affect the skin may appear as: - Increased and sometimes incessant itching and scratching and/or licking - Redness - Moist skin, dry/flaky skin or scabbing - Itchy ears (and possible ear infections) - Swollen and itchy paws The itching may be all over the body or localized in one area. Your cat's behavior may also change, since a constant state of itchy discomfort can quickly lead to irritability, disrupted sleep, exhaustion and snapping. If repeated scratching causes the skin to break, this can create an opportunity for an infection. At this point your cat needs fast relief from the inside out to address the root cause of their allergic itching. An herbal supplement can help naturally balance your cat's system and return the skin to a normal state of comfort. What is Itch Support Gold? Itch Support Gold is a combination of nine herbal ingredients for skin-related symptoms when your cat comes into contact with a substance that triggers an allergic reaction. Itch Support Gold is a drug-free alternative that addresses the root causes of uncomfortable, red, and sometimes unbearably itchy skin (including on the paws). This formula works with the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine to target the underlying imbalance and restore health from the inside out. It works without the harmful side effects commonly associated with long-term use of prescription medications. What is Itch Support Gold used for? Use this product for hot spots, itching, scratching and itchy paws caused by a known or unknown allergy. For felines, the primary way an allergy manifests is through the skin. Flare-ups are often chronic and/or recurring, and despite many efforts, become a condition that must be managed. Finding out the cause of the allergy can be a long but necessary process. Rather than mask or temporarily suppress the symptoms, Itch Support Gold helps to support a healthy immune response to allergens. The herbal combination also works to decrease itchiness, whether it is pervasive or only in certain areas. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the name for this type of treatment is termed an External Wind formula. The element of \"wind\" can refer to symptoms that appear suddenly, change quickly and affect the surface (like the skin). "}
