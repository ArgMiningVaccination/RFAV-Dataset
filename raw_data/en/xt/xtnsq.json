Rooted in the ancient wisdom of the Five Elements and traditional Taoism, the curriculum teaches students to see people not only as they present themselves in illness, but more importantly as they would be when in health and balance. She has observed that when she starts out by treating on the spirit level, the physical symptoms also alleviate themselves. There is a deep connection between our physical and emotional state. She works to treat body mind and spirit believing that once we get to the root cause of an issue, we begin to see other issues dissipate and resolve themselves. She works with the individual as a whole human being, taking into account who they are and their life story, not just signs and symptoms. She says, \"This is the way I practice. And I have seen amazing, life changing results! My mission is to create a sanctuary in which melting into self, deep raw unhinged transformation, authentic personal growth and a renewal into ones highest virtue and truth can occur through Chinese Medicine therapies, Herbal Medicine, Sacred Dance and Ceremony. I do this while vibrantly upholding the values of warmth, spirit, intimacy, depth, truth, connection and integrity. Through myself as a vessel of healing, I will inspire each client to go beyond where they believed their own fullness and potential had ended. I will create a sanctuary of vulnerability and aid my clients to move deeper and deeper into one's own unique virtue and truth. I will aid as as a healing vessel in which ones spirit can move authentically and freely within themselves and eventually, throughout the world at large.\" She is available to help patients learn and experience ancient Chinese Traditional Medicine healing techniques such as cupping, moxibustion, gua sha and more.
