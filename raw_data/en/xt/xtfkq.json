FAQS A: Berberine Complex contains goldenseal, an herb with a long history of safe use, particularly in Native American cultures. Alkaloids from goldenseal, particularly berberine, support the body's immune response. Goldenseal is widely considered safe for short-term use; however, standard references differ on its long-term safety. The ABC Clinical Guide to Herbs does not give any caution for long-term use of goldenseal, stating that it is considered non-toxic at recommended doses (.5 - 1.0 gm/day).1 On the other hand, the PDR for Herbal Medicines concludes that goldenseal should not be taken over an extended period of time. It does not state what constitutes an extended period or the dosage amount needed to provoke adverse reactions.2 Other references point out that goldenseal has not been subject to long-term study as their reason for discouraging long-term use. Many dietary supplements containing low levels of goldenseal (less than 500 mg/day) have been safely used without adverse effects. However, goldenseal is best suited to those conditions that require a temporary immune boost. We would recommend that consumers using a goldenseal product for over eight weeks consult with their licensed healthcare practitioner.
