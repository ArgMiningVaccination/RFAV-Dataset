What Nuvaxovid is and what it is used for Nuvaxovid is a vaccine used to prevent COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV-2 virus. Nuvaxovid is given to individuals 12 years of age and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, to give protection against COVID -19. None of the ingredients in th is vaccine can cause COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you receive Nuvaxovid Nuvaxovid should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) .

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart musc le) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Nuvaxovid (see section 4) . These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmaci st, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid. As with any vaccine, the 2 -dose vaccination course of Nuvaxovid may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.
