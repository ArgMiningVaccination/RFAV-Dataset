Truthfully, if you are interested in EMDR therapy for traumatic events in your life, then it is best to stay close to home and work with a trust certified EMDR therapist. It is an incredibly powerful tool that is backed by science and should not really be done in a retreat setting. Plus, EMDR works better when it is done over the course of several sessions. Some people even need a dozen or more sessions before healing the brain in a way that allows optimum health.

For these reasons, it is our responsibility to urge you to work with a licensed EMDR therapist that you can easily access from home. This kind of work is long term. "}
