Premature ejaculation (PE), as already mentioned, belongs to male sexual disorders, affecting a large percentage of men of all ages (but more often in men under the age of 40). However, the use of medicines is not always possible or desired by many persons. For this reason, biotechnology companies have created a series of non-medicinal products to fight premature ejaculation, with natural means and without any risk. The nutritional supplements against premature ejaculation as well as the other products (such as creams, gels, and wipes) mentioned in this article are tried and tested products, found safe and preferred as they are. Therefore, the reasons for being preferred by many men today are: - safe - all-natural - non-toxic elements - not interacting with other drugs - not causing side effects - easy to use - very affordable price - used without prescription - easily purchased online with complete confidentiality - delivered to the address of your choice in a discreet package Risks you may run into when not dealing with this condition using the Premature Ejaculation Pills As a dysfunction of the ejaculatory mechanism, premature ejaculation (PE) is often referred to as sexual dysfunction in combination with erectile dysfunction. The reasons leading a man to premature ejaculation are many and various, sometimes pathological (medical examination and treatment required) and other times psychogenic. In fact, the psychological side of this disease (since it is a disease) is quite common in the modern age we live in, where the commitments and psychological demands of everyday life are almost unbearable. Premature ejaculation, whether it is a consequence of pathological conditions or psychological conditions, requires treatment and preferably immediately (without delays). A great danger created from the delayed treatment of the situation is the creation of a \"habit.\" The body can become accustomed to functioning with this dysfunction, thus acquiring a \"negative habit\" that, even if it was temporary, risks becoming pathological and permanent. The earlier the condition is treated, the easier and faster it will be for the man to return to a normal sexual function. Another very high risk from \"perpetuating\" the problem is the psychological factor of the individual. Incomplete and often embarrassing sexual experiences can have serious psychological consequences on the man, including the following: - low self-esteem - increased performance stress (becoming increasingly bigger) - questioning its attractiveness - avoid sexual intercourse - problems in interpersonal relationships - depression - isolation By dealing promptly and effectively with any sexual dysfunction (in this case currently concerned with premature ejaculation), you prevent its development into a chronic disease. How do Premature Ejaculation Pills elevate libido and prevent \"failures?\" Low libido is often associated with a variety of sexual disorders, such as erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, a situation in which the man shows a markedly (and in fact continuous) reduced interest in any sexual activity. Nowadays, low libido is a common phenomenon due to intense daily stress, poor lifestyle, poor diet, and lack of essential care for our health. The modern man, as statistical studies show, has to face many difficulties complicating his sex life and producing obstacles to good sexual performance. One the reasons often leading men to low libido and then to a number of other sexual dysfunctions (including premature ejaculation) is low testosterone production. As the dominant male hormone, testosterone plays a catalytic role in male sexual performance, produced in the male genitals (specifically in the testicles) and determining the sexual desire of the man, as well as his sexual performance during sexual intercourse. Low testosterone production, if treated properly and in a timely manner, can also help fight a variety of sexual dysfunctions. The ideal choice for this case is not local application products (such as wipes, gels, or creams). Special nutritional supplements \"loaded\" with nutrients and vitamins are recommended to naturally strengthen the male body and stimulate the natural production of testosterone. Our Proposal The [Performer 8](https://healthsocialaccountability.org/recommends/performer-8/), as well as the ProSolution + supplements, are ideal options for treating any sexual dysfunction and enhancing libido in a 100% natural way. Are Premature Ejaculation Pills aimed at the third age? Not at all. As already shown, premature ejaculation (PE) seems to be a form of sexual dysfunction, primarily occurring at younger ages and specifically in those under 40. Research shows that almost one in three men under the age of 50 has problems with premature ejaculation. Therefore, we would say that from the beginning we are referring to supplements mostly aimed at young men. Specifically, the man may show one of the following four variants of premature ejaculation (PE): - premature ejaculation in every sexual encounter for the rest of his life - premature ejaculation suddenly occurring at some point in his life (while there was no pre-existing problem) - premature ejaculation not occurring at every sexual encounter - premature ejaculation not accompanied by orgasm problems Tip: A specialist andrologist/urologist is the most suitable to help you clarify the form of your specific problem and follow the optimal treatment method. In non-pathological conditions, over-the-counter premature ejaculation pills are the best method of treating the problem. Why should I prefer a Premature Ejaculation Product in the form of cream, gel, or wipe? The absorption of their hyperactive ingredients does not pass through the stomach, but transdermally, greatly reducing their response time. A dietary supplement taken orally requires sufficient time (at least two to three months of intensive treatment) to build in the system and reap remarkable benefits. The logic is the same as taking multivitamins or boosting supplements. It takes time. On the contrary, a product applied locally to the penis provides immediate results, significantly enhancing the psychology and self-confidence of the man. Therefore, if you want immediate results, then products like VigRX Delay Wipes or ProSolution Gel are the best choice. Note on the Use of Transdermal vs. Nutritional Supplements Let us emphasize, however, that a dietary supplement ensures a much broader and more substantial stimulation, working by attacking the cause of the problem in any sexual dysfunction or strain on the male body. Ideally, I recommend the use of such nutritional supplements for assisting in the elimination of sexual problems and not just avoiding them on a temporary basis. Do pills against Premature Ejaculation interfere with male hormonal balance? No. Neither all-natural dietary nor all-natural transdermal supplements are capable of upsetting the organic hormonal balance or causing any form of hormonal disorder. This is also a very important reason they are preferred (where possible) by their respective medications or hormone therapies for treating sexual dysfunction. Certainly, this does not apply in case the medical doctor diagnoses a pathological condition and deems it necessary to take medication. However\u2014and since most cases of premature ejaculation are non-pathological in nature\u2014the use of over-the-counter natural remedies is a safe way to fight dysfunction without taking synthetic hormones seriously affecting the organic hormonal balance. A warning on synthetic hormone use It should be noted that the use of synthetic hormones is also associated with a number of serious health problems such as prostate hypertrophy or prostate cancer. For this reason, they are administered when deemed as necessary via a medical prescription, by a competent doctor. Systematic medical monitoring is also required throughout the treatment to avoid serious side effects. Are there any other methods that work in combination with Premature Ejaculation Pills? Some methods and tips for assisting in the prevention and treatment of premature ejaculation (as a transient condition but also a potentially chronic disease) are shown below: - Improvement of lifestyle (diet, sleep, physical activity) - Management of stress and anxiety in everyday life - Systematic health control - Sex education Administration of the appropriate pills to fight premature ejaculation is recommended in combination with an improvement of the man's lifestyle, especially if the causes of the dysfunction are not severely pathological. The change of lifestyle contributes to the internal and substantial strengthening of the body, and not to a temporary solution or \"cover up\" of the problem. Conclusion on Supplements against Premature Ejaculation The natural herbal extracts, vitamins, and various nutrients providing the body with non-prescription all-natural pills against premature ejaculation are extremely beneficial for every man. In fact, the use of these supplements is often recommended and encouraged by competent doctors, if there is no reason for prescription medication. The (4) premature ejaculation supplements being presented to you are excellent quality natural products, easily purchased online.
