Accepted 23 September, 2013 One million new breast cancer (BC) cases diagnosed yearly yielded over 400,000 annual deaths . About 4.4 million women are living with BC worldwide , while 15 million new cases yearly are estimated by 2020. About 12.15% of women born today would be diagnosed with BC at some time during their lifetime. Nigerian women's BC lifetime risk of 10% account ed for about 16% of all cancer -related deaths. Nigeria was ill-equipped in dealing with BC complexities. This paper present ed an ethnobotanical survey and digitization of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) -based foods for effective BC treatment. BC 's risk factors were gathered from General Practitioners. Semi -structured questionnaires were randomly administered, in which 70 Physicians and 500 Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM ) practitioners were interviewed . Internet searches were performed on the NCCAM, EBSCO, and PubMed databases using BC -related k eywords . Specific ethnobotanical data of MAPs having anticancer properties were documented through guided fieldworks , local markets, and CAM practitioners' homes. A total of 10% of the studied MAPs yielded Adzuki bean, Asparagus, Broccoli, Burdock, Cabbage , Chinese yam, Dandelion, Tomato, Watercress, and Watermelon in effectively treating BC menace. A Populated Multimedia -based Medicinal Plants Sustainability Management System was used to address MAPs ' extinction challenge with the BC -related MAPs. Orthodox BC treatments have devastating effects including temporary infertility. However, eating fruits and vegetables daily significantly reduces BC' s risk. Key words: Breast cancer, complementary and alternative medicine, fruits, medicinal plants, vegetables . INTRODUCTION Information and communication technology (ICT) has become the transformative tool for a new style of global development while playing an increasingly important role in addressing the g lobal challenges of healthcare. Healthcare is an informa tion intensive industry, in which reliable and timely information is a critical resource for the planning and monitoring of service provision at all levels of analysis: (i) organizational, (ii) regional, (iii) national and international. Healthcare Informa tion Systems (HCISs) have been defined as powerful ICT -based tools able to make health care delivery more effective and efficient (Locatelli et al. , 2012). Health and healthcare researches are needed in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with the d iagnosis, treatment and delivery of health care to all of the people in our society who are in need of it (Dieppe, 2005). Healthcare aims to achieve the best health outcomes in the most efficient manner . Today's health delivery systems ' challenge is to inc rease productivity and quality of care without increasing the economic costs (de Leiva et al. , 2008). Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), is a group of diverse med ical and health care systems, practices and products that are not presently considered part of conventional medicine. NCCAM, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), designates five major domains of CAM practices: alternative medical systems , mind -body interventions , biologically -based treatments , manipulative and body -based methods , and energy therapies. Each domain comprises numerous individual systems and treatments for which the NIH provides research support (Heimall and Bielory, 2008; brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by Covenant University RepositoryOmogbadegun 138 Wisneski and Anderson, 2009; Kelvin and Tyson, 2011). Patients require treatment and care that work, good relationship with practitioner, provision of information, and remaining in control of treatment. CAM continually attracts pa tronage due to patients' dissatisfaction with conventional health care, a desire for greater control over one's health, and a desire for cultural and philosophical congruence with personal beliefs about health and illness (Omogbadegun et al. , 2011). Medic inal and aromatic plants (MAPs) Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) belong to the biologically -based treatments domain of CAM. Industrial uses of MAPs include galenicals, health, herbal teas, industrial / pharmaceutical auxiliary, intermediates for drug manufacture, new drugs, phyto -pharmaceuticals, and traditional medicines (Tewari, 2000). MAPs provide the raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry where drugs derived are made by isolating the active chemicals and concentrating them to the medicatio n. Over 80% in each of the US public, people in d eveloping countries, and Africa' s population use nonconventional practices and complementary medicines adjunctive to conventional medical care (Kasirajan et al. , and Bielory, et al., 2010; Li et al. , 2011). MAPs are increasingly recognized worldwide as an alternative source of efficacious and inexpensive medications to synthetic chemo -therapeutic compound. MAPs are used in treatment and prevention of various health problems from simple to complex disease situations among rural populations globally, thereby improving the quality of life (Elufioye et al. , 2012). In Nigeria, a country stepped in the use of and belief in traditional medicines, the CAM practitioners claim that MAPs' parts possess various phytochemicals which exhi - bit diverse pharmacological and biological responses and diversities (Idu and Onyibe, and -associated Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Breast Confidence interval; CM, Complementary Medicine; HIV/AIDS, Human Immu nodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; HRT, Hormone Replacement Therapy; ICT, Information and Communications Technology; MAPs, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants; MMPSMS, Multimedia - based Medicinal Plants Sustainability Management System; NCC AM, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine; NIH, National Institutes of Health; OR, Odds et al. , 2011). Cancer morbidity Cancer is a common disease with a devastating impact on the physical and psychological well being of patients. The diagnosis of cancer brings upon many clinical challenges and questions for which clear and simple answers are not always provided by modern medicine. To date, only limited therapeutic options are available for patients with advanced cancer. Cancer, an unrestrained proliferation and migration of cells, is a scourge that has afflicted mankind since time immemorial. In spite of the spectacular advances made by medi cal science during the past century, the treatment of cancer remains an enigma. Cancer represents the single largest cause of death in both men and women, and is a growing public health menace. Each year, about seven million new cases are diagnosed, and ab out five million people die as a result of cancer. Prevalence data indicate that currently, about 14 million people are suffering from cancer. Bearing in mind the level of morbidity that is often affiliated with this disease, comprehension of such a high incidence is horrifying. The recent shift toward targeted therapies has improved substantially patient's survival, however, relapses are frequent and cure remains rare. This led patients and many health care managers to shift attention to the holistic appro ach of traditional medicine particularly preparations from herbal products to manage and alleviate the disease ( Baldi et al ., 2007; Alaoui - Jamali, 2010 ). Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide with millions of new cancer patients diagnosed each year and many deaths resulting from this disease. Chemotherapy remains the principal mode of treatment for various cancers . Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in the tissue of the breast. The use of plants or plant products for cancer treatment could be due to several reasons such as availability of the materials, affordability, relatively cheap and little or no side effects. For these reasons, World Health Organization (WHO) supports the use of traditional medicines provided they are proven to be effica cious and non toxic. It is well established that plants have been a useful source of clinically relevant antitumor compounds. However, traditional Nigerian medicinal herbs have been used in the treatment of different diseases in the country for centuries. There have been claims that some traditional healers in Nigeria can successfully treat cancer using herbal preparations (Engel et al. 2011). Cancer is obviously one of the most common areas where demand for alternative treatment is overwhelming (Leung, 20 07). Cancer arises when cells become abnormal and start to multiply out of control. They are cells behaving badly. Cells are becoming abnormal all the time but in most cases are detected and destroyed by the body's immune system. Occasionally, our defences fail and a cancer results (Matthews et al. , 2011). Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. In recent years, efforts have been made to synthesize potential anticancer drugs; consequently, hundreds of chemical variants of known classes o f anticancer therapeutic agents have been synthesized. It has been recognized that a successful anticancer drug should be one, which kills or incapacitates cancer cells without causing excessive damage to the normal cells. This criterion is difficult, or p erhaps, impossible to attain, and that is why cancer patients suffer from unpleasant side effects while undergoing treatments. Although great advancements have been made in the treatment and control of cancer progression, significant deficiencies and room for improvement remain. A number of undesired side effects sometimes occur during chemotherapy. While vast amounts of synthetic chemistry have provided relatively small improvements over the prototype drugs, the synthesis of modified forms of known drugs c ontinues as an important aspect of research. Natural therapies, such as the use of plant -derived products in cancer treatment, may reduce adverse side effects. Currently, a few plant products are being used to treat cancer. However, a myriad of many plant products exist that have shown very promising anti -cancer properties in vitro , but are yet to be evaluated in humans. There exists a need for new prototypes and new templates for use in the design of potential chemotherapeutic agents. Natural products are capable of providing such templates. Some of the well -recognized anticancer plants are listed in Table 1. Further study is required to determine the efficacy of these plant products in treating cancers in humans ( Baldi et al ., 2007; Desai et al. , 2011). BREAST CANCER MENACE Breast cancer is the term used to describe the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the breast tissue, most commonly in the lobules (milk producing glands) and ducts (the passages that carry milk to the nipples), leading to the fo rmation of a solid lump or tumour. Breast cancer is a systemic disease in that cancer cells may start to be disseminated into blood and lymphatic systems even in early stages or when the tumor size is still small. Active angiogenesis may occur in breast tu mor nodules as small as 2 mm in diameter. Cancers originating from ducts are known as ductal carcinomas and those originating from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas (Hayat, 2008; Ingelheim, 2011). Breast cancer (BC) constitutes a major public health issue globally with over 1 million new cases diagnosed annually, resulting in over 400,000 annual deaths and about 4.4 million women living with the disease. BC remains the most feared disease of all women worldwide. The causes of breast cancer remain a my stery, with a few exceptions. About 70% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no known risk factors. This implies that there are risk factors that have not yet been Int. J. Med. Plant Altern. Med. 139 identified. Doctors ar e beginning to identify lifestyle choices that can influence our cancer risk. These lifestyle choices include diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol, and many other factors (Tabor, 2009). BC affects 12.5% of women during their lives. I n Nigeria, BC and hypertens ion are two of the commonest degenerative diseases responsible for about 16% of all cancer related deaths. Out of 89,000 cancer deaths in 2005; 54,000 of these were younger than 70 years ( Gunduz and Gunduz, 2011; Omolara, 2011) . BC accounts for 12.5% of deaths worldwide, more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria deaths combined. Estimated 207,090 women were diagnosed with and 39,840 women die d of BC in 2010. By 2020, 15 million new BC cases are expected yearly, and 70% of new BC cases (~10.5 million) wil l occur in developing countries. A total of 1 million BC cases is expected yearly in African countries by 2020 with 500,000 cases expected in Nigeria alone. Late presentation of patients at advanced stages when little or no benefit can be derived from any form of therapy is the hallmark of BC and other cancers among African adults resulting in ineffective treatment. 5 -year cancer survival rate is 10% for Africa against 70% in developed countries. In Nigeria alone, average life expectancy for women is 48 yea rs and death rate is 16.31/1,000 deaths (6th highest in the world). Strong dependence on traditional medicine is partly due to ethics but mainly due to poverty (70% of population live below poverty guidelines) ( Okobia et al. , 2006; Courage -to-dare- foundati on, 2012). In Okobia et al. 's (2006 ) study of one thousand community -dwelling women from a semi -urban neighborhood in Nigeria recruited in January and February 2000 using interviewer -administered questionnaires designed to elicit sociodemographic informati on and knowledge, attitude and practices of these women towards breast cancer, results showed that study participants had poor knowledge of breast cancer. Mean knowledge score was 42.3% and only 214 participants (21.4%) knew that breast cancer presents commonly as a painless breast lump. Practice of breast self-examination (BSE) was low; only 432 participants (43.2%) admitted to carrying out the procedure in the past year. Only 91 study participants (9.1%) had clinical breast examination (CBE) in the past y ear. Women with higher level of education (X2 = 80.66, p < 0.0001) and those employed in professional jobs (X2 = 47.11, p < 0.0001) were significantly more knowledgeable about breast cancer. Participants with higher level of education were 3.6 times more l ikely to practice BSE (Odds ratio [OR] = 3.56, 95 % Confidence interval [CI] 2.58 -4.92) (Okobia et al. , 2006) .

Over the course of the last decade, the treatment of breast ca ncer has evolved quite rapidly. New scientific and clinical advances have modified the standard of care and led to improved patient outcomes. At the same time, the treatment of breast cancer has become increasingly complex, requiring the comprehensive revi ew and assessment of multiple issues, genetics, radiology, surgery, recon struction, fertility radiation, chemotherapy, and more. As a result , the harmony and open communication between these specialties facilitated by a multidisciplinary team approach are crucial in providing the best care to patients and ensuring successful treatment ( Taghian et al. , 2009) . Complementary therapies Complementary therapies are increasingly sought by cancer patients to control treatment -related symptoms. Unprov en methods that do not actually treat cancer are often promoted falsely as cancer cures. These are termed alternative therapies. Typically expensive and potentially harmful, they can interact with chemotherapy drugs and other medication. Complementary th erapies such as music, massage, acupuncture and meditation are noninvasive, gentle techniques applied to control physical and emotional symptoms commonly experienced by cancer patients. Plants are the most exclusive source of drugs for the majority of the world's Table 2. Concentrations of antitumor compounds present in higher plants (Baldi et al., 2007). Antitumor compound -3 population, and plant products constitute about 25% of prescribed medicines. The impac t of natural products upon anticancer drug discovery and design can be gauged by the fact that approximately 60% of all drugs, now in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, are either natural products, compounds derived from natural products, or cont ain pharmacophores derived from natural products. These therapies are used as adjuncts to mainstream cancer treatment. Some important antitumor compounds isolated from different parts of higher plants are listed in Table 2. Patients and physicians should b e aware of the distinction between questionable methods that are not helpful, and complementary therapies that successfully reduce symptoms and enhance quality of life. Easy access to information and misinformation about these therapies via the Internet an d print media compounds this problem ( Baldi et al ., 2007; Cassileth et al., 2007). As shown in Table 3 , biologically -based practices were noted as the types of CAM most used by women with breast cancer, followed by mind -body medicine, whole medical systems , and energy medicine. Sources of information about CAM use for women with breast cancer vary widely, including family, friends, mass media, healthcare providers, CAM providers, and self -help groups. Sociodemographic factors that appear to be related to CA M use were younger age, higher education, higher income, married status, involvement in a support group, and health insurance. The reasons for CAM use reported by women with breast cancer were to help healing, to promote emotional health, and to cure cance r. Oncology nurses should obtain detailed information about CAM use by their patients and explore why women with breast cancer do not discuss the use of CAM with healthcare providers ( Wanchai et al. , 2010). Diagnosis and treatment One of the main causes of failure in the treatment of breast cancer is the intrinsic presence of, or development Int. J. Med. Plant Altern. Med. 143 of, drug resistance by the cancer cells. Recent studies on the mechanisms of cancer drug resistance have yielded impo rtant information highlighting both how tumour cells may escape these therapeutic constraints and how drug resistance may further impinge on tumour cell functions that may ultimately promote an adverse cell phenotype. New targets have been identified with potential therapeutic applications in resistant breast cancer leading to the subsequent evaluation of inhibitors of these targets in preclinical studies. Importantly, there is increasing evidence from such studies demonstrating the benefit of novel combina tion strategies as potential avenues for future drug regimens (Hiscox et al. , 2009 ). Cancer can be treated in a number of ways: (i) By surgery, to remove the tumor, sometimes with surrounding tissue and local lymph nodes. Surgery can also be done to remov e part of a tumor or to relieve symptoms caused by the tumor. (ii) By chemotherapy, treatment with drugs that destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. (iii) By biologic therapy, treatment with immune substances that destroy cancer cells or strengthe n the ability of the immune system to destroy cancer cells . (iv) By hormonal therapy, treatment that alters specific hormone levels in the body by stopping the production of the hormone, blocking the hormone, or adding hormone, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. (v) By radiation therapy, the use of high -energy radiation to destroy cancer cells. The mode of action of some promising chemo - therapeutics from natural origin and their derivatives is indicated in Table 4 (Baldi et al. , 2007) . Surgery and radiation therapy are local treatments, directed to a particular part of the body. Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, and hormonal therapy are systemic treatments, which travel through the bloodstream to all parts of the body. Cancer treatments a re constantly evolving as doctors better understand the biology of how cancers start and grow and as they develop new ways to perform less invasive surgery and to more precisely deliver radiation therapy. For many cancers, doctors use combined modality the rapy, that is, a combination of treatments. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in the treatment of cancer, can recommend the type of treatment that is best for you. The treatment depends on the type of cancer, the stage of disease, and your general state of health. Depending on your situation, the goal of the treatment may be to cure the disease, to control the growth of the cancer, or to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life ( that is, palliation) (Hiscox et al. , 2009). Surgery, radiation treatment, and new advanced therapies available in the developed worl d contribute to good prognosis. Nigeria remains ill -equipped to deal with the complexities of BC.

Most of the patients need radiation treatment, chemotherapy, and hormonal replacement therapy because of heavy disease load on the breast and metastasis. Treatment cost is prohibitive (Nigeria's annual GDP is about 7% ). Healthcare spending has not been a priority of our government. Surgery for advanced BC in Nigeria features mastectomies predominance and cases with small volume of breas ( or post neoadjuvant) and Ez eome, 2008 ; Globalpressinstitute, 2012). It is complacent to continue subjecting at least 70% of women with breast cancer to surgery, a futile mutilating procedure. There is no evidence that early mastectomy affects survival; if patients knew this, they would most likely refuse surgery . Basically, all types and combinations of conventional breast cancer treatment appear to result in the same low long -term survival rates (Last, 2010). Treatment cost In Nigeria, the cost of BC treatment is minimally put at : (i) Histology - 10,000 ($90.00) per month 25,000 ($225.00) per week, for 4 weeks . Int. J. Med. Plant Altern.

Prevalence rates of comp lementary therapy use by women with breast cancer have been estimated to range from 31.5 to 73%. The most common complementary therapies used by women with breast cancer include vitamin/mineral supplements, meditation/relaxation therapies, natural -health p roducts, and spiritual therapies (Balneaves et al. , 2006). An alternative and comprehensive approach is distinct in that the evaluation of each woman lends a great deal of attention not only to individual symptoms, but also to her individual risks for future diseases (Hudson, 2008). Approximately 41% of women are utilizing CAM forms of medicine to manage their BC, including products from the Morinda citrifolia (Noni) plant (Clafshenkel et al., 2012). Complementary and Holistic Medicine using MAPs have become significant in BC treatment and prevention. Numerous studies (128 out of 135 dietary studies) indicated that increased vegetable and fruit consumption by humans significan tly reduced the risk of BC (Borek, 2010) . Vegetables and fruits Vegetable and fruits have a high content of healthy components as vitamins, minerals, and fibers. Epidemiological evidence supports a diet rich in whole fruits and vegetables in the prevention of fibrocyst ic breast conditions . An international review estimated that increased fruit and vegetable consumption could prevent 5-12% of worldwide cancer burden (Table 5) (Hudson, 2008; Irimie et al. , 2010) . Although a systematic review of fruit and vegetable consump tion interventions has shown that face -to-face methods are most effective, telephone counselling is seen as an effective alternative and behaviour change tool for fruit and vegetable consumption in both healthy and ill people, with reported long -term succe ss (up to 4 years) in a randomized trial of BC survivors (Yeh et al. , 2010). In China, kiwifruit' is widely used for plants in the genus Actinidia Lindl ., and the fruit they produce. In Actinidia species, mihoutao are used to treat BC and Omogba degun 152 Table 5.

The leaves and other morphological parts of P. americana possess medicinal propert ies, and are widely used in traditional medicines of many African countries. In Nigeria, the leaves of P. americana have been used as an effective antitussive, antidiabetic, antihypertensive; and as analgesic and anti -inflammatory remedies. The root bark of P. americana (RPA) extract includes chemical compounds with estrogen -like activity and validates its potential use as anticancer agent, partic ularly against breast carcinoma, provided important information is potentially helpful in drug designing and dis covery. RPA demonstrated a significant (P < 0.05) anti -proliferative activity against estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF -7) (Engel et al. , 2011). Vinblastine and vincristine are primarily used in combination with other cancer chemothe rapeutic drugs for treat ing breast and lung cancers (Shoeb, 2006 ). Malak et al. (2009 ) reported in their study that 87.2% (n: 48) patients practiced CAM. 72.7% of the patients practicing CAM applied alternative therapy and 65.5% applied complementary thera py. CAM practice had been determined in all patients with BC (n: 13) as reflected in Table 6. Wearing a bra less than 12 h per day improved the risk to one out of 152, a rate reasonably close to women who wear bras rarely or never; they have a one out of 1 68 chance of BC. A tight bra blocks the lymph circulation in the breasts and is much worse than a loose -fitting bra (Last, 2010). This paper presents an ethnobotanical survey of MAPs -based foods for effective BC treatment. METHODS The m ajor risk factors for BC were gathered and codified from 70 orthodox medical practitioners and textbooks . Questionnaires followed by face -to-face interviews were randomly administered to the 70 physicians from February 2009 to June 2012. Specific e thnobotanical data on medi cinal plants having anticancer properties were randomly collected, recorded, and discussed through personal contacts in the field, local markets (elewe -omo), CAM pr actitioners , and community leaders. 500 CAM practitioners in Akure, Idanre, Ondo, Owo, and Supare towns in Ondo State of Nigeria who know and use MAP s for treating various diseases were interviewed using randomly administered semi -structured interview technique. The interviewers were taken on guided Int. J. Med. Plant Altern. Med. 153 Figure 2. Guided field -work on MAP data collection. fieldworks through the areas where informants collected MAP s. MAP uses were discussed in detail with informants, after seeking prior informed consent from each respondent as exemplif ied in Figure 2 . Similar questionnaire method had been used by Mosch\u00e8n et al. (2001 ), Patterson et al. (2002 ), Rakovitch et al. (2005 ), Hann et al. (2006 ) and Fasching et al. (2007 ) cited by Wanchai et al. (2010 ). Odug bemi (20 10) shown in Figure 3 had also employed a similar method. Additional d ata on MAP s were also collected from other published literature sources including Amusan (2010 ), Christian (2009 ), Dama et al. (2010 ), Dog (2010 ), Hywood Idu et al. ), NNMDA (2010 ), Olowokudejo et al. (2008), Rao et al. (2011 ) and WHO (2009 ); phytochemical databases; r eputably cognate internet -based MAP s' sources and internet peer- reviewed articles from NCCAM, EBSCO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, SCIELO, Medline, Google scholar, and PubMed databases using BC -related keywords . BC - related search keywords included breast cancer, women's health and cancer, cancer -related morbidity, cancer treatment with phytotherapy, CAM and breast cancer, alternative treatment/therapies and breast cancer, and compleme ntary and breast cancer , etc. To ensure that studies focused specifically on women with breast cancer, the authors retrieved documents that contained the words breast cancer patients or women with breast cancer within their titles or abstracts as adopted by Wanchai et al. (2010 ). Adverse reactions of each MAP for BC treatment were documented. RESULTS BC's major risk factors include earlier menarche, woman's age, overweight, hormone replacement therapy , eating high -fat diet, wearing a tight bra always, infertility, having the first child after age 35, and having dense breasts. The assembled MAPs' species belonged to 102 families where Leguminosae family topped the frequency table with 22 entries as shown in Table 7 and Figures 4 and 5. It was ob served that 10% of the surveyed MAPs yielded Adzuki bean lanatus ) were listed to stop the menace of BC and hypertension. Anticancer compounds found in vegetables include lycopene in tomatoes; lutein and beta -carotene in carrots, Omogbadegun 154 al. 2007 cited by Wanchai et al. 2010 .

BC constituted 10% of the prevalent diseases treated with MAPs (Figure 6). The database of a previously developed software by this author (Mu ltimedia -based Medicinal Plants Sustainability Management System - MMPSMS) to address MAPs' extinction challenge was populated with the discovered vegetables and fruits using the interfaces shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows the video of the salient details of a retrieved plant, Zingiber officinale Rosc (Common Ginger) for treating asthma, stimulant, piles, hepatitis, liver diseases, obesity, typhoid, anaemia, cancer, dysentery, dysmenorrhoea , etc., which could be viewed, and its audio feature played . Morinda citrifolia 's fruits, roots, bark, stems, flowers and leaves (in fact, all parts) have become renowned for handling breast cancer, infection, arthritis, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and pain. Little wonder as when approximately 41% of women utili zing CAM forms of medicine to manage their BC includ e products from the Morinda citrifolia (Noni) plant . Morinda citrifolia 's efficacious distinction has made it being planted by several people around their residence as shown in Figure 9. Omogbadegun 158 Figure 5.

Multimedia -based medicinal plants sustainability management system (MMPSMS) interface. Figure 8. Enquiry from MMPSMS sho wing diseases treated with a plant. Conclusion BC, an important and potentially fatal condition, is associated with both genetic and non -genetic risk factors . Wearing a tight bra always blocks the lymph circulation in the breasts thereby increasing BC risk. Orthodox BC treatments have devastating effects including temporary infertility. Women with breast cancer seek CAM more Omogbadegun 160 Figure 9. Morinda citrifolia (Noni) around residence. than other patient populations with cancer. BC patients should take several portions of macrobiotic diet daily , while n utritional antioxidant effects on immune functions in relation to the pathogenesis of cancer and atherosclerosis deserve increased research effort, given their effect on mortality and morbidit y. Although botanical gardens used to ensure sustainable availability of efficacious medicinal and aromatic plants in treating ailments and diseases are established, other barriers impeding acceptance of CAM into conventional healthcare delivery system sho uld be identified and overcome. A Board of Traditional Medicine Practitioners (BTMP) under each State's Ministry of Health should be established to regulate the practice of biologically -based phytomedicine by CAM practitioners. Researches for a paradigmati c approach to CAM integration that could create a common basis for scientific dialogue, encourage exchanges between medical communities, and establish policies for the development of a true multidisciplinary health care cooperative that is consistent with the current public health model should be encouraged and funded by governments . Digitization of the MAPs achieved in this project would help health care providers and decision -makers make informed clinical and management decisions based on evidence, so the y could choose care appropriate to the individual, and share knowledge and experience. Data mining and data warehousing capabilities that would give health managers new knowledge and insights into a wide range of health trends and enable them to manage resources better would be facilitated by this research effort . Health care professionals would have access to more data on prevention, health hazards and diseases, and be better equipped to understand the impact of lifestyle, environmental hazards and socioec onomic status on the health of the population. More h ealth and healthcare researches would be needed in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with the diagnosis, treatment and delivery of health care to all of the people in our society who are in need of it.
