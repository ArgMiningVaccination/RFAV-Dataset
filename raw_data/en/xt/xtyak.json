Tuberculosis Screening Student Requirements: All incoming students are required to complete the online Tuberculosis Screening Questionnaire. This involves answering questions related to your risk for TB infection. Enrolled students can access the online questionnaire through their [Student Health Portal](https://portal.hartshorn.colostate.edu/ExternalAuth?returnUrl=%2F). After logging in, click on the \"pending forms\" on the landing page or \"My Forms\" in the top navigation. If a student answers \"Yes\" to any of the screening questions, a TB skin test or TB blood test will be recommended. (Students with a history of BCG vaccination should have a TB blood test instead of a TB skin test.). These tests are typically a covered benefit under most health insurance plans including the CSU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan. This means that your health insurance will most likely pay the full cost for you to get this test and there will be no out-of-pocket cost to you. Since benefits can vary among insurance plans, it is always good idea to check with your health insurance plan in advance and confirm your coverage for these tests.
