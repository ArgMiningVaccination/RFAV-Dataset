The two most common types of sensation associated with pain include soreness and numbness. Chinese Medicine surrounds its theory of pain on obstructed channels or 'internal organ' system deficiencies that interfere with meridian channels and nerve impulse signalling. Obstruction usually occurs as blood stasis and phlegm. These pathological matters often form from the internalisation of external factors such as trauma, wind, heat, cold and dry elements, and the strength of our constitution. The intricate balance between the pathological elements and our immune system can be achieved with TCM treatments, not only relieving the current condition but also strengthening soft tissue, preventing frequent occurrence of injuries and pain. The main efficacy experienced by the patient can be immediate pain relief and eradication of system deficiencies and blockage in the long run. Common treatment methods include acupuncture, cupping and/or natural herbal medication. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recognised the efficacy of acupuncture for more than 70 types of conditions. They include conditions relating to pain, such as neck and back pain, tennis elbow, knee pain, rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica and temporo-mandibular joint dysfunction. The wondrous effects of acupuncture in pain and injury management are to ease pain via the downplay of nociceptors, reduce inflammation and heal and manage chronic conditions. Scientific acupuncture is the use of acupuncture along both meridian channels and muscle groups based on the anatomy of the body to further its efficacy. Other scientific researches on acupuncture identify heightened electrical fields around acupoints, which translates to increased immune system responses, expediting the healing mechanisms of the body. Most importantly, a TCM physician focuses on an all natural and well-targeted approach to nurse any injury. Stretching exercises, as well as maintaining a recommended diet by the physician is essential to pain and injury management. [Article by "}
