Saari, MD, Physician Educator, IHS Clinical Support Center, Phoenix, Arizona The acceptance or use of commercial support for continuing education in the Indian health system is rare. There are severalreasons for this. First, the Federal Standards for Ethical Conductmake it difficult, if not impossible for federal employees to acceptsuch support from prohibited sources, such as pharmaceuticalcompanies. Certainly any facility or individual wanting toattempt to use commercial support following these FederalStandards should do so in consultation with the Program Integrityand Ethics Office (PIES; telephone (301) 443-4137). Second, the requirements imposed by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) on thosewho wish to pursue commercial support make the practicecomplicated, at best, in the federal setting. Among theserequirements are the following: 1) the funds from thepharmaceutical company must go to the coordinator or facilityhosting the activity, and not directly to the presenter, 2) there mustbe a written, signed contract between the recipient of thecommercial support and the pharmaceutical company, and 3) thecoordinator, and not the drug company, must control the choiceof the topic and speaker. Most pharmaceutical companies do notwant to abide by the requirements that they give up this control. Finally, most service units have found that the practice is not very useful or rewarding. Public opinion, clinicianattitudes, recent medical literature, and the lay press have allswung to the opinion that the practice is costly to the consumerand leads to poor prescribing decisions by physicians (see,most recently, \"Drug Makers Pay for Lunch as They Pitch\" inthe July 28, 2006 issue of The New Y ork Times,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/28/business/28lunch.html ). Even though commercial support isn't used much, nevertheless, we are obligated to complete the \"disclosureprocess.\" This is a process required by the ACCME, theorganization that accredits the Clinical Support Center (CSC)to sponsor continuing medical education (CME), wherebysteps are taken to find out if there are any potential \"conflictsof interest.\" For the most part, since there is little commercialsupport in Indian Country, and since most of our speakers donot have any conflicts of interest, things have been simple. Byletting those attending know that the speakers have completedthe disclosure process and that they have no conflicts ofinterest to disclose, the requirements have been met. There are two new requirements, now, that make this a little more complex. The New Rules About Who Must Complete the Disclosure Process In the past, only faculty members had to complete the disclosure process. The new ACCME requirements state that In this Issue... 193 Changes in the ACCME Standards for Commercial Support 195 Providers Best Practices & GPRA Measures Conference 196 OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest 205 IHS Child Health Notes 208 Indian Health Service History Project209 Postgraduate Course on Obstetric, Neonatal and Gynecologic Care 210 NICE Evidence-Based Medicine Resource 211 Meetings of Interest 214 Position Vacancies\"everyone who is in a position to control the content of an educational activity\" must complete the process. This means that all course coordinators and planning committeemembers must also do so. Those who are unable or unwilling to do so must be excluded from participating. Aneasy way to meet this requirement is for all planningcommittee member complete and sign a CSC DisclosureForm at the beginning of the planning process (go tohttp://www.ihs.gov/MedicalPrograms/ClinicalSupportCenter/continuingEducation.cfm for forms and detailed instructions). The New Rules about Resolution of Conflict of Interest The new ACCME standard requires that we 1) identify all relevant financial relationships with any commercial interest;2) have a mechanism to determine whether these relationshipscreate a conflict of interest with the individual' s control of thecontent; and 3) have a mechanism to resolve all conflicts of interest before the activity occurs. For a number of years, wehave been meeting the first requirement. What Needs to be Done with the Information Learned from the Disclosure Process? If the person states that he or she has nothing to disclose, then nothing more needs to be done other than letting the audience know that the process has taken place and that thereis nothing to disclose, using the prescribed disclosurestatements on the preconference publicity and on the coursematerials distributed at the meeting (see below). If, however,there is something significant to disclose, then the newrequirements state that not only must the audience be informed,but that there must be \"resolution of the conflict of interest.\" How Does One Determine if There is a Conflict of Interest? The ACCME has listed on its website and other educational materials the various types of relationships that might constitute a conflict of interest, such as receipt of anhonorarium, service on a speakers bureau, acceptance ofresearch funds, ownership of equity on the company, and so on.The Standards for Commercial Support have always requiredthat these relationships be disclosed to the audience. Now,however, we have to examine those relationships in the contextof the role that the person plays in the design and execution ofthe activity, and the scope of the educational content of theactivity. An easy way to do this is to contact the CSC wheneverthere is any potential conflict of interest to discuss the matterand what needs to be done. What is Resolution of Conflict of Interest? The ACCME doesn't often spell out exactly how things must be done, so this permits a great deal of flexibility. Some examples of how this might be accomplished are as follows:1) prior review of the content of a presentation with specialattention to the best available evidence, and requirements forrevision as need be; 2) asking a speaker or a planningcommittee member to recuse him- or herself from this activity;3) asking the person in question to divest themselves of thefinancial relationship; or 4) assigning the speaker a differenttopic. There are obviously many other ways to resolveconflicts of interest. ACCME has made it clear, however, thatsimply monitoring the activity will not suffice, and someconcrete action must be taken before the activity takes place. As with anything else, it is critical to document what was done,for the file. What Must be Disclosed? This has not changed. The disclosure must include the name of the individual, the name of the commercial interest, and the nature of the relationship. Such relationships mightinclude grant or research support, being a consultant or on thespeaker' s bureau, being a stock shareholder, or anything elsethat seems relevant. Relationships with government or non-profit organizations are not considered relevant. How Does One Complete the Disclosure Process? All coordinators, planning committee members, and speakers should complete and sign the \"Disclosure of Conflict of Interest\" Form that can be found at our website athttp://www.ihs.gov/MedicalPrograms/ClinicalSupportCenter/ceChecklist.cfm. The form must be filled out before the activitytakes place. If no conflicts of interest are found, then thisinformation should be included on the preconference publicityand on the course materials handed out at the activity (usuallyon the faculty list) using the prescribed statements, as follows: The course coordinator, all planning committee members,and all speakers have completed the disclosure process andhave indicated that they have no financial relationshipswith any company or product that may be discussed in thisactivity. The completed forms must then be sent to CSC for inclusion in the permanent records for the activity. Please be sure that the file number for the activity in on each form so thatthey may be kept with the appropriate file. Summary Two new, important steps have been added to the disclosure process. First, in addition to all speakers, now all course coordinators and planning committee members mustcomplete and sign a Disclosure Form. Second, if any financialrelationship is discovered, steps must be taken to resolve anyconflict of interest. Since there are few instances if financialconflicts for speakers or planners in the Indian health system,there will likely be few situations when such steps to resolveconflicts of interest will need to be taken.

OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest Abstract of the Month Point/CounterpointRefusals by pharmacists to dispense emergencycontraception I wanted to take the opportunity to respond to one of the articles in the June 2006 issue of CCC Corner. The article \"Refusals by pharmacists to dispense emergencycontraception: a critique\" addresses an issue that has been inthe news off and on for the last couple of years. Many of theleading pharmacy organizations issued a response to theObstetrics and Gynecology article (see references). Over the past 30 years, the IHS Pharmacy Program has worked with physicians and other providers to assure that ourpatients receive the medications they need. On April 8, 2005,an e-mail was sent out on the pharmacist and physicianlistservs discussing this issue. The e-mail is provided below. Subject: Dispensing Birth Control and EmergencyContraception Many of you may have read the articles this week (see below) about the Governor of Illinois directingpharmacists to fill prescriptions for birth control andemergency contraception. This issue was alsodiscussed this week at the American PharmacistsAssociation Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida. Over the years, the IHS has tried whenever possible to accommodate pharmacists who do notfeel they can ethically dispense birth control oremergency contraception while still meeting ourmission of providing needed pharmaceutical servicesto our patients. At most sites, this issue is resolved by having another pharmacist who is willing to dispense themedication fill the prescription and counsel thepatient. This solution is acceptable if the workloadvolume does not place an undue burden on thedispensing pharmacist. In clinics with only onepharmacist, the pharmacist can discuss this issue withthe Clinical Director and see if there is a physician orother prescriber who would be available to dispensethese medications. Policies and procedures need to bein place for when the pharmacist or prescriber is onvacation or unavailable so that patients can receivemedications without delay. Other sites have looked at how they can assure that these medications are available 24/7 without violatingany employee' s ethical concerns nor causing anyembarrassment for the patient (especially at sites thatdo not have 24 hour pharmacy coverage). Some sitesprovide pre-packed, pre-labeled emergencycontraception in a controlled (for example Omnicell)location for providers who might be prescribing thismedication. This allows the 24/7 option, allows firstdose administration by the provider in the clinic or ERif desired, and automatically provides a work aroundfor any pharmacist with ethical concerns. Mostproviders were very willing to work with us on thisissue, and patients are getting the care they are seeking. Please discuss this issue at your site and if needed come up with a workable solution. If you have anyquestions, please contact me at the address below. RADM Robert E. Pittman PHS Chief Pharmacist Officer OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment This is another in our series of Point/Counterpoint topics that allows our readers to fully explore various sides ofcomplex issues. I want to thank James Bresette, HQE, forhelping facilitate this Point/Counterpoint. The June 2006 CCC Corner noted increasingly numerous instances reported in the national media of pharmacistsrefusing to fill prescriptions written for emergency postcoitalcontraceptives. These pharmacists have asserted a\"professional right of conscience\" not to participate in whatthey interpret as an immoral act. Above, the PHS ChiefPharmacist Officer in a simple, yet elegantly worded responsemakes it clear that policies and procedures need to be in placefor when the pharmacist or prescriber is on vacation orunavailable so that the patients can receive medicationswithout delay. The PHS Chief Pharmacist Officer' s commentsare especially important because some of our AI/AN patientsmay be a thousand miles by airplane away from the nearestalternative pharmacy provider. The American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the national professional society of pharmacists, has been a strong advocate for women. The APhA has been active in facilitatingpharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception directly towomen in need in a number of states. Please see the APhASpecial Report below. It may not only be the individual provider or pharmacist' s approach that creates barriers to our patients. In some casesthere can be system issues that also lead to impaired access.Another article posted in the CCC Corner on this topic was co-authored by two former Indian health staff who are now on thefaculty of the University of New Mexico. Espey et al reportedthat Plan B and Preven were not in stock at the majority ofpharmacies in a moderately sized metropolitan area. Lack ofavailability at the pharmacy constitutes a major barrier toemergency contraception access. Lastly, it is my experience that pharmacists tend to be much more organized than most providers, and hence are muchmore likely to have an effective policy and procedure forsomething like this. I think an individual patient is much morelikely to have her choices limited by a provider. The IndianHealth Primary Care Discussion Forum referenced belowprovides a variety of views on this topic. If a provider does notfeel she/he can offer the full range of services to a patient, thenthey should make similar arrangements to those described byour pharmacy colleagues. Just like our pharmacy colleagues,we should honor that provider' s opinion while we continue toprovide the highest level of care to our patients. I encourage continued dialogue on this and other topics. I find we can learn best if we can truly listen to those we thinkwe disagree with the most. Please consider the \"walk a mile inmy shoes\" concept before you begin to you make any finaldecision. Once we completely understand all the variables,then we can better serve our patients.

One story of success\u2014 Whiteriver, Arizona We recently published our influenza vaccination rates, showing how Whiteriver bridged the disparity often seen in influenza vaccination rates on reservations. The rates quotedare from 2002 - 2003; since then we have increased our ratesanother 10% or so (see abstract below). Objectives: The Whiteriver Service Unit (WRSU) used proven effective methods to conduct an influenza vaccinationcampaign during the 2002 - 2003 influenza season to bridgethe vaccination gap between American Indians and AlaskaNatives and the US population as a whole. Methods: In our vaccination program, we used a multidisciplinary approach that included staff and communityeducation, standing orders, vaccination of hospitalizedpatients, and employee, outpatient, community, and homevaccinations without financial barriers. Results: WRSU influenza vaccination coverage rates among persons age 65 years and older, those age 50 to 64years, and those with diabetes were 71.8%, 49.6%, and 70.2%,respectively, during the 2002 - 2003 influenza season. Weadministered most vaccinations to persons age 65 years andolder through the outpatient clinics (63.6%) and public healthnurses (30.0%). The WRSU employee influenza vaccinationrate was 72.8%. Conclusions: We achieved influenza vaccination rates in targeted groups of an American Indian population that arecomparable to or higher than rates in other US populations.Our system may be a useful model for other facilitiesattempting to bridge disparity for influenza vaccination.

Hot Topics: Obstetrics The return of the vaginal breech delivery Abstract : In light of recent studies that further clarify the long-term risks of vaginal breech delivery, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends thatthe decision regarding mode of delivery should depend on theexperience of the health care provider. Cesarean delivery willbe the preferred mode for most physicians because of thediminishing expertise in vaginal breech delivery. Plannedvaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may bereasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for botheligibility and labor management. Before a vaginal breechdelivery is planned, women should be informed that the risk of August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 197August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 198perinatal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned,and the patient' s informed consent should be documented. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: This is a significant shift in opinion, based on the increasing literature supporting the return to vaginal breech delivery in those centers with providers who can displaycurrent competence and in which the facility has hospital-specific protocol guidelines. Oxytocin induction oraugmentation was not offered. Here are some of the criteriaused in the studies analyzed: gestational age greater than 37 weeks frank or complete breech presentation no fetal anomalies on ultrasound examination adequate maternal pelvis estimated fetal weight between 2,500 g and 4,000 g. fetal head flexion adequate amniotic fluid volume, defined as a 3-cm vertical pocket normal labor progress ACOG has issued the following recommendations The decision regarding the mode of delivery should depend on the experience of the health careprovider. Cesarean delivery will be the preferredmode of delivery for most physicians because ofthe diminishing expertise in vaginal breechdelivery. Obstetricians should offer and perform external cephalic version whenever possible. Planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specificprotocol guidelines for both eligibility and labormanagement. In those instances in which breech vaginal deliveries are pursued, great caution should be exercised, anddetailed patient informed consent should bedocumented. Before embarking on a plan for a vaginal breech delivery, women should be informed that the risk ofperinatal or neonatal mortality or short-term seriousneonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesareandelivery is planned. There are no recent data to support the recommendation of cesarean delivery to patientswhose second twin is in a nonvertex presentation,although a large multicenter randomized controlledtrial is in progress Mode of term singleton breech delivery. ACOG Committee Opinion No. 340. American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists. Obstet Gynecol2006;108:235-7. Gynecology CDC's Advisory Committee recommends humanpapillomavirus vaccination Vaccine considered highly effective in preventing infections that are the cause of most cervical cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend that a newly licensed vaccine designed to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV) beroutinely given to girls when they are 11 - 12 years old. TheACIP recommendation also allows for vaccination of girlsbeginning at nine years old as well as vaccination of girls andwomen 13 - 26 years old. HPV is the leading cause of cervicalcancer in women. According to the ACIP' s recommendation, three doses of the new vaccine should be routinely given to girls when they are11 or 12 years old. The advisory committee, however, noted thatthe vaccination series can be started as early as nine years old atthe discretion of the physician or health care provider. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment ACIPs recommendations: Some of the final steps beforeroll out of this HPV vaccine Each Indian Health Service, tribal, and urban facility should be making active plans now on how best to implement this vaccine for their clientele. In general most states will makethe quadravalent vaccine available to our AI/AN patients at nocost in January 2007. There are many major issues toanticipate while we maintain a highly effective screeningprogram in the meantime. Here are just a few: how to implement this as a cancer vaccine while addressing the sexually transmitted infection issueshead on how to address \"catch up\" vaccination for those patients over the age of 19 years who will not qualifyfor Vaccines For Children coverage how to monitor the quadravalent vaccine effectiveness (patients may be infected with more than one HPVsub-type), and possible adverse vaccine reactions. Child Health Boyfriends, girlfriends, and adolescents' risk of sexualinvolvement We have found that having had a boyfriend or girlfriend by seventh grade is both a predictor of having sex in the ninth grade and a marker of prior risks for sex. Males who reported a girlfriend by seventh grade were more likely than those who had not to besexually active in ninth grade. Females who reported a same-age boyfriend in seventh grade were more likely than those reporting noboyfriend in seventh grade to be sexually active in ninthgrade, and those reporting an older boyfriend in seventhgrade were more likely than those reporting a same-ageboyfriend to be sexually active in ninth grade. For males, sixth-grade peer norms favoring sex, Hispanic ethnicity, and eighth-grade situations that could lead to sex predicted ninth-grade reports ofsexual activity. For females, menarche in sixth grade was associated with ninth-grade reports of sexual activity, as werepeer norms favoring sex and situations that could leadto sex in eighth grade. Helping girls to handle the social changes related to early pubertal development, deemphasizing socialactivities that may pave the way for risky behavior andencouraging parental supervision may help reduceearly involvement with a boyfriend or girlfriend.

American Journal of Obstetrics andGynecology. 195(1):78-84.Chronic disease and Illness Driving, other erratic behaviors reported after takingzolpidem (Ambien) Zolpidem (Ambien), a nonbenzodiazepine, sedative- hypnotic prescribed for the short-term treatment of insomnia, has been associated with increased numbers of impaireddriving incidents in Wisconsin during the past several years.Although the label directs patients to take zolpidem only whenable to devote a full eight hours to sleep, and cautions againstoperating heavy machinery or motor vehicles, the patientsinvolved in these incidents have driven while under theinfluence of zolpidem. Some of these drivers have expressedtheir belief that they were \"sleep-driving,\" saying they have nomemory of the driving incident. A \"typical\" Ambien driver will demonstrate erratic, unsafe driving, often with wide lane deviations, many crashes or near-head on collisions, or unpredictable, bizarre driving maneuversaccording to staff at the Toxicology Section at the WisconsinState Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) in Madison. Erratic behaviors reported after taking zolpidem are not limited to impaired driving, but have included sleepwalking,eating, drinking alcohol, belligerent outbursts, urinating ininappropriate places, agitation, confusion, dazed appearance,slurred speech, incoordination, and poor balance. Usuallypatients have no memory of these incidents and are at a loss toexplain subsequent events, such as why food is missing fromthe refrigerator or why alcohol bottles are half empty. Factors associated with zolpidem-impaired driving include not going to bed immediately after taking the drug, attemptingto drive too soon after taking it, high blood levels, or ingestionwith other drugs and/or alcohol. Special concerns that patientsshould be aware of include memory loss or amnesia. Patientsare advised to take Ambien only when they are able to get a fullnight' s sleep (7 - 8 hours) before they need to be active again. Features: ACOG William H. J. Haffner American Indian/Alaska NativeWomen's Health Award The ACOG Committee on American Indian Affairs would like to establish the William H. J. Haffner American Indian/Alaska Native Women' s Health Award. This awardrecognizes an individual who has made a major contribution toraising the level of health and/or improving AI/AN women' shealth care. In the Committee' s role of visiting IHS Areas and providing on-site reviews, it has a first hand look at the manydedicated clinicians working in the field in the IHS. These aremen and women who have found innovative ways to provideexcellent maternal and child health care with exceedinglylimited resources and often in isolated and remote areas. Theycontinue to show incredible fortitude and hope in tryingcircumstances. The committee felt that it should becommending these heroic efforts and shining a light on themany ways in which the IHS is succeeding. August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 199The Committee wanted to name the award after someone who has been the living example of what the award stands for. The committee felt that Dr. William Haffner epitomizes thisdedication and exceptional service to AI/AN women' s healthcare. Dr. Haffner had a long career in the IHS and also hasbeen involved with the ACOG Indian health programs from thebeginning. In many cases, he has been the link between ACOGand the IHS in the long history of cooperative efforts toimprove the health and welfare of AI/AN woman. While Dr.Haffner enjoys recognition and service within the Collegethrough his years of service on many committees, he alsobrings recognition and legitimacy to the role that ACOG hasplayed within the IHS. He is someone who has and does movebetween both worlds with ease. He therefore brings a certainprestige to the award for the IHS as well. The committeeforesees the honoree being recognized at ACOG' s ACM andalso being recognized at the IHS' s Annual National CombinedCouncils awards banquet. This increases the awareness of therole ACOG continues to play in increasing access and qualityof health care for AI/AN women within the Indian healthsystem. The criteria are as follows: A clinician who has been outstanding in AI/AN women' s health care. The clinician could be but does not have to be an obsetrician/gynecologist. Any health careprofessional such as family physicians, certified nursemidwives, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, etc.could be eligible for the award. Awardees must demonstrate a commitment and dedication to providing exceptional health care toAI/AN women. They must be currently working within an IHS or tribal position or recently retired.

Breastfeeding Suzan Murphy, PIMCPain is one of the reasons that moms quit breastfeeding inthe first two weeks For common sore nipples, there are quick fixes that can help reverse the problem. For early sore nipples, look for the root problem. Check positioning points The baby is \"belly to belly\" so the baby' s face and body face the mom' s body. The baby' s mouth is open wide, on the breast, and snuggled close. The baby' s nose can be squished upagainst the mom' s breast - it is okay, the baby will pullback or let go if breathing is hard. Latch Check that both lips are out and at least 1 /2 inch past the nipple onto the areola (more is better). Check the internal mouth and nipple connection:o Is the baby' s lower lip folded under?o Does the mom feel the baby' s lower gum bumping her when the baby sucks? o Is the sucking rhythm jerky, snappy, not smooth? o \"Y es\" to any of these usually means the nipple isn't deep enough in the mouth and the baby' stongue isn't out far enough to cover the gums andeffectively milk the nipple. So, show the mom how to gently push the chin down through a couple suck cycles. The baby' s mouth will open a little more, the lower lip pops out, and the tongue will dropdown to cover the gums - viola! Less pain and the baby getsmore milk \u2014 and it usually takes just a couple \"fixed\" feedingsfor the baby to automatically latch appropriately. Sometimes in the first couple days, as the baby is learning how to suck effectively, the baby will chomp on mom enough to cause tender nipples. Momsusually describe it as pain at the beginning of thefeeding that goes away after the first 15 - 30 seconds.It usually helps for the mom to know that thediscomfort will get better each day. If the mom is compressing or pushing down on the breast \u2014 so she can see the baby breath - it candisrupt latching and lead to sore nipples. It can helpto reassure her that the baby instinctively knows thatbreathing is important and will pull away if breathingis hard. If the baby is using a pacifier often, it can alter the sucking process and lead to sore nipples. Encouragethe mom to use the pacifier carefully - less (and later)is better. To help the mom while the nipples are healing, encouragement is magic. She will feel better soon -a day or two, sometimes less. Also considersuggesting: o Let the nipple air dry before putting the bra flap or breast pad on. o If the nipple sticks to clothing or a breast pad, wet it first so it peels off gently without new skin. o Topical treatments like lanolin ointment, gel pads, and tea bags. Moms often say they help.Effective positioning/latch and time help too. If the mom says that it hurts all the time and nothing seems to help, check with a breastfeeding consultant. If the pain starts after the first couple weeks, thrush is likely. Both mom and baby need to be treated. August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 200References: Schanler R et al.

Medical Mystery Tour Copious post operative mucous secretions: The rest of thestoryLet's review last month's case history . . .. A 60 year-old female, a heavy smoker, underwent a staging laparotomy that ultimately revealed bilateral hydrosalpinges without complication. The patient developed aleft lung collapse due to tenacious secretions and had asuccessful re-inflation of the lung by bronchoscopy. Theafebrile patient was then noted to have several dry, small, fattynodules between her midline staples, but she was otherwisetolerating an advancing diet, voiding, and had bowelmovements. The patient was encouraged to stop smoking andthe nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary was discussedwith the patient. On the day of discharge, the provider beganto replace the slightly prolapsed subcutaneous fat and to placeSteristrips over the otherwise clean and dry incision. Did you think of any further discharge/wound care instructions you would give this patient? If you said somethingalong the lines of \"take two hydrocodone and call me in themorning,\" then you would have been half correct. If you hadsaid \"take a little general anesthesia and call me in themorning,\" then you would have been closer. Let me explain. The provider removed the lower one half of the staples at the bedside and was surprised to find that the adiposeprotruding through the staples for the last three days hadactually been the omentum. The patient was taken to theoperating room and received general anesthesia. Thesubcutaneous tissue was opened. There was omentum in thesubcutaneous tissue with some omentum that was dried,indicating that it had been there for a while. Most of the tissuewas fresh in appearance and moist. There was no odor,discharge, or purulent material. There was no devitalizedtissue. The skin edges and the subcutaneous tissues lookednormal and without significant need for debridement. At thefascial edge, the suture was identified and was in place, but hadpulled through the fascia in the upper 1 /2 of the wound, allowing the omentum to herniate through. The total area of dried omentum is less than 2 square inches. This was immediately moved away from the incisionand a small partial omentectomy was performed bysequentially clamping, dividing, and ligating the omentumaway from the bowel. There was no bowel extravasated fromthe abdominal cavity. The prolapsed omentum was excised andthe abdomen explored without further findings. The fascia wasclosed with a mass closure technique. The patient did well andwas discharged five days later without further complication.The patient was re-admitted two weeks later with a partialsmall bowel obstruction that resolved with conservativetherapy. Of note, the patient went home with inhalers, an incentive spirometer, and a pulmonary appointment, butshe did stop smoking. What can we learn from this case? There are a number of facets to this case, but let' s start with incidence, risk factors, and signs/symptoms. Please review what UpToDate says about \"Surgical incisions: prevention andtreatment of complications\" for complete details. The incidence of fascial disruption is 1 percent overall and 0.4 percent in gynecologic surgery. By comparison, incisionalhernia develops in approximately 1 percent of uncomplicatedsurgical cases, 10 percent of patients with wound infection, and30 percent of patients who underwent repair of dehiscence.More than one-half of hernias appear within six months of theoriginal operation, approximately three-quarters are present bytwo years, and 97 percent are present by five years. Wound disruption results from increased intraabdominal pressure or abdominal wall muscle tension overcoming suturestrength, knot security, and tissue strength or holding power.Factors that enable mature collagen to stretch and allowincisional hernia after apparently adequate healing remainobscure. Often no obvious cause or precipitating factors areidentified. Problems with slow or delayed healing are rare inyoung and healthy patients, while a number of factorscontribute to the problem of fascial failure in other patients. August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 201Underlying conditions and risk factors for fascial disruption are numerous, but excessive coughing is listed along with poornutrition, advanced age, pulmonary disease, obesity, andseveral others. Signs and symptoms of a complete dehiscence include profuse serosanguinous drainage, often preceded by a poppingsensation and an incisional bulge exacerbated by Valsalvamaneuvers. The absence of a healing ridge in a laparotomyincision by postoperative day five can be a sign of impairedhealing and impending disruption. In one series, none of 17patients with dehiscence had a palpable ridge prior to rupture,whereas 1,240 of 1,249 patients without dehiscence had apalpable ridge. Most dehiscences occur four to 14 days aftersurgery, with a mean of eight days. The diagnosis can be madebased upon clinical grounds in the majority of cases. Imagingstudies, such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging,or computed tomography, have been used when the diagnosiswas unclear. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment Appropriate wound reclosure will improve the care of ourAI/AN patients While the above wound dehiscence is a relatively uncommon event, superficial wound disruption is much more common. The American Board of Obstetricians andGynecologists Annual Board Certification materials recentlyreferenced a systematic reviewed on the reclosure of thedisrupted laparotomy wound by Wechter et al 2005. The review found that reclosure of disrupted laparotomy wounds was successful in over 80% of patients. Failedreclosure resulted in no life-threatening complications.Reclosure of disrupted laparotomy wounds is safe anddecreases healing times. Compared with healing by secondaryintention, reclosure resulted in faster healing times (16 - 23days versus 61 - 72 days), and in the one study that evaluatedit, 6.4 fewer office visits. The optimal timing and technique forreclosure and the utility of antibiotics were inconclusive. Wechter ME, et al. Reclosure of the disrupted laparotomy wound: a systematic review. Lisa Allee, CNM, somersaults, and the value of a pulsingcord: nuchal cord management Abstract : Nuchal cord, or cord around the neck of an infant at birth, is a common finding that has implications for labor, management at birth, and subsequent neonatal status. A nuchalcord occurs in 20% to 30% of births. All obstetric providersneed to learn management techniques to handle the birth of aninfant with a nuchal cord. Management of a nuchal cord canvary from clamping the cord immediately after the birth of thehead and before the shoulders to not clamping at all, dependingon the provider' s learned practices. Evidence for specificmanagement techniques is lacking. Cutting the umbilical cordbefore birth is an intervention that has been associated withhypovolemia, anemia, shock, hypoxic-ischemicencephalopathy, and cerebral palsy. This article proposes useof the somersault maneuver followed by delayed cord clampingfor management of nuchal cord at birth and presents a newrationale based on the available current evidence. Mercer J, Skovgaard R, Peareara-Eaves J, Bowman T. Nuchal cord management and nurse-midwifery practice.Journal of Midwifery & Women' s Health. 2005;50(5):373-379. Editorial Comment by Lisa Allee, CNM Judith Mercer, et al, present excellent evidence that leaving a nuchal cord alone and delivering the baby by the somersault maneuver is preferred over clamping and cuttingthe cord before the shoulders deliver. They also provide nicedrawings showing how to do the somersault. I first learned thesomersault many years ago from a locum tenens midwife while I was working as an RN. Soon after, on a very, very busy shift,I walked into a room where two nurses were busily gettinggloves on, but the head was crowning, so I stepped in andcaught the baby, noting a nuchal cord as he came out. I pointedhim toward his mother' s thigh and out he somersaulted! Firstbaby I ever caught. I have used the somersault ever since, except once when I mistakenly thought that a baby was slow to deliver due to thenuchal cord and clamped and cut it \u2014 it wasn't the cord, it wasthe shoulders. Needless to say the seconds it took to get thatbaby out were long and the baby needed some help gettinggoing. Lesson learned \u2014 the baby needs the cord intact. August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 202Mercer, et al, present research that shows cutting a nuchal cord can lead to problems (see above) and that in a survey of nurse-midwives, 40% selected somersaulting as their bestoption for nuchal cords, and 96% avoid immediate clampingand cutting of nuchal cords. They also provide a clearly stateddescription of cord anatomy and physiology and the \"bloodvolume model of neonatal transition\" that not only supports thesuggested management of nuchal cords, but also the benefits ofdelayed cord clamping in general. Judith Mercer has written elsewhere about delayed cord clamping and its beneficial role in neonatal resuscitation. Thisis based on the blood volume the baby gets from the placenta,preventing hypovolemia, and this thinking is consistent withthe new changes in CPR that emphasize circulation. Sheproposes letting the cord pulse while giving PPV with the babybetween mom' s legs. I know this is very different than the rushto the warmer, and change is hard, but read and think about it\u2014 it makes sense. I highly recommend her chapter, \"Fetal toNeonatal Transition: First, do no Harm,\" in Normal Childbirth: Evidence and Debate, edited by Su Downe. Actually, read thewhole book. Navajo News Kathleen Harner, Tuba CityMethamphetamine abuse on the \"drop-in\" gravida A 24 year-old G3A2 presents to labor and delivery at 34 weeks gestation having received no prenatal care. She is contracting every 5 - 6 minutes and is complaining ofexcruciating pain. She is very dramatic. She denies healthproblems or surgeries; she has had one elective and onespontaneous abortion. She denies drug or alcohol use and doesnot use any medications regularly. Her fetal monitoring strip isreactive and without decelerations. Y ou order routine prenatallabs and a urine toxicology screen, which is positive formethamphetamine. Her fetal fibronectin test is negative,ultrasound confirms her dating, and her contractions stop withhydration. Now what are you to do with her? This is the \"drop-in\" gravida, positive for methamphetamine, and having had no prenatal care. Y ou arefar more likely to see a gravida positive for meth in labor anddelivery than in your prenatal care clinic. She comes in notbecause she is concerned about her pregnancy, but because sheis in excruciating pain. Meth abusers do not perceive pain, joy,or sadness the same way non abusers do. At TCRHCC thispatient would be immediately identified as being at risk fordrug or alcohol abuse, and she would be informed that a urinetoxicology screen would be performed. Our clinical guideline on drug screening in labor and delivery includes the following conditions: Positive substance abuse questionnaire No prenatal care Late prenatal care Scant prenatal care Multiple missed appointments Abruptio placenta Intrauterine fetal demise Prior history of substance abuse Preterm labor Intrauterine growth restriction Unexplained congenital abnormalities Current signs and symptoms of acute intoxication Domestic violence Patients should be informed that screening will be performed based on clinical guidelines. Written consent is notrequired. Providers should strive to protect the integrity of theprovider-patient relationship, treating patients with dignity andrespect. Providers should communicate honestly and directlyabout what information can and cannot be protected. Positivescreens are reported to child protective services and the staffpediatricians are notified. The patients are offered counseling services prior to discharge from the hospital. If the patient is undelivered atdischarge, she is offered the same combination of regular drugscreening, continuity of prenatal care, and mental healthcounseling that drug dependant mothers identified in the clinicsetting are offered. If the patient is delivered and either she orthe baby have a positive urine drug screen, child protectiveservices are notified, and they determine the appropriatedisposition of the infant. The mother is still offered counselingservices and close follow-up. Unfortunately, we often don't see these moms until late in their prenatal course, as with the gravida in the example.Ideally, these patients should receive extra support from theirprenatal care providers, but this is impossible when they are notidentified until late in pregnancy. However and whenever theyare identified, they must be offered comfort, hope, and support. References: see the online version of the Ob/Gyn CCCC newsletter.

August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 203Perinatology Picks George level A: goodand consistent evidence Results: The 55 practice bulletins contained 438 recommendations of which 29% are level A, 33% level B, and 38% level C. The 55 bulletins cite 3953 references, of which17% are level I, 46% level II, 34% level III, and 3% others.Level A recommendations were significantly more likelyamong the 23 gynecologic than 32 obstetric bulletins (37%versus 23%, odds ratios 1.95, 95% confidence intervals 1.28,2.96). The study types referenced in obstetric and gynecologicbulletins were similar (P > .05 for comparison of levels I, II,and III and meta-analysis references). Conclusion: Only 29% of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations are level A,based on good and consistent scientific evidence. Chauhan SP et al.

Escaping the tyranny of the urgent by delivering planned care Bottom Line: Planned care is a powerful vehicle to help us close the gaps and improve patient care in the US. In addition,it makes the practice of medicine feel more organized and moresatisfying. Rather than feeling caught in the tyranny of theurgent, we can feel confident that we have provided high-quality care that meets the needs of our patients and ultimatelymakes our work more rewarding.

IHS Child Health Notes Quote of the month \"Of course, it is important to be a good listener - but it also pays sometimes to be a little deaf. \" Yiddish Proverb for newlyweds Articles of Interest Outcomes among newborns with total serum bilirubin levels of 25 mg per deciliter or more. Engl J Med. 2006 May4;354(18):1889-900. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/ Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia \u2014 what are the risks? N Engl J Med. 2006 May 4;354(18):1947-9.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pubmed An assessment of neurodevelopmental outcome in 140 infants at term or near term with total serum bilirubin levels >25mg/dl; 130 patients had bilirubin levels > 25 mg/dl and <30mg/dl while 10 infants had bilirubin levels > 30 mg/dl. Onehundred and thirty-five patients were treated with phototherapyalone, and five patients received exchange transfusions. No patient had kernicterus. There was no increase in the number of patients with abnormal neurological findings onexam, or documented diagnoses of neurological abnormalitiescompared to control infants. Patients with positive directantiglobulin tests had lower scores on cognitive tests but nomore neurologic or behavioral problems. Editorial Comment This study is reassuring that bilirubin levels of < 30 mg/dl are unlikely to put an infant at risk for kernicterus or adverse neurologic outcome. The one subgroup at higher risk are thosewith hemolytic disease, and these patients should be treatedmore aggressively with phototherapy and exchange transfusionif indicated. This is consistent with the newest AAP guidelineson hyperbilirubinemia from 2004. The editorial also notes that the biological risk for hyperbilirubinemia is genetically based. It is already knownthat the risk is higher in Asians and also in American Indiansof the southwest. American Indian/Alaskan Native infants ingeneral may be at higher risk than the general population forhyperbilirubinemia and deserve our extra attention.

Menactra\u00ae (meningococcal conjugate) vaccine was in the news because of a vaccine shortage. The ACIPrecommends deferring the doses in 11 - 12 year oldsand concentrating on the 15 year olds and collegefreshmen entering dorms.http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm55d520a1.htm?s_cid=mm55d520a1_e . We are changing the RPMS forecasting in late summer sothat it only forecasts for 15 year olds. 2. RotaTeq\u00ae (rotavirus) vaccine provisional recommendations have been published:http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/provisional_recs/rotavirus-child.pdf. RotaTeq is recommended as a three doseoral vaccine for children 6 - 32 weeks. The first dosemust be given before 13 weeks of age, or you don'tstart the series, and the last dose must be given by 32weeks of age. The unique forecasting for this vaccinewill be included in the late summer RPMS patch. 3. Gardasil\u00ae (Human papillomavirus - HPV) vaccine is licensed for 9 - 26 year old females, and the ACIP hasrecommended HPV vaccine for routine vaccination of11 - 12 year olds with catch-up for older ages.http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r060629.htm. Gardasil will eventually be covered under Vaccinefor Children Program; however, we are still waiting for news of a federal contract for this vaccine(anticipated in fall, 2006), and ACIPrecommendations have not yet been published. 4. V aricella vaccine - the ACIP just voted for a routine second dose of Varicella to be given at school entry(4 - 6 years of age). This recommendation will beincluded in the RPMS forecasting in the latesummer RPMS Immunization patch.http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r060629-b.htm. Recent literature on American Indian/Alaskan Native HealthDoug Esposito, MD Mental disorders among parents/caretakers of American Indian early adolescents in the northern midwest. Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol . 2006 Jun 15; [Epub ahead of print] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16779502&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_DocSum This study employed a culturally modified version of the University of Michigan Composite International DiagnosticInterview (UM-CIDI) to investigate the 12-month and lifetimeprevalence of five DSM-III-R diagnoses among 861 northernmidwest American Indian and Canada First Nations parentsand caretakers of 10 - 12 year-old children. The five conditionsassessed were alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse,major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.Prevalence rates were then compared to rates reported fromstudies of a northern plains and a southwest American Indianculture, and to the general U.S. adult population. The authorsdiscuss their findings in the context of the inherent difficultiesfaced when studying small, culturally distinct, and oftengeographically isolated Native populations in the U.S. andCanada. They scrutinize method variance as a possible sourcefor divergent prevalence rates for some psychiatric disordersreported in studies of different cultural groups. Study subjects were from four American Indian reservations in the northern midwest and five Canada FirstNation reserves, all of whom share a common cultural traditionand language. The authors report a lifetime prevalence of74.6% of at least one of the five conditions assessed, withmales being more likely than females to meet these criteria.Nearly 32% of the adult parents and caretakers satisfied criteriafor two or more of the surveyed conditions. Females werealmost twice as likely as males to be without any of the fivesurveyed conditions over their lifetimes in this study. As expected, substance abuse disorder rates were high, with 49.6% of respondents meeting criteria for alcohol abuse,20.9% for alcohol dependence, and 22.4% for drug abuse.Statistically significant male to female differences wereidentified for alcohol dependence and drug abuse only, withthe prevalence in males exceeding females. A lifetime prevalence of 17.1% for major depressive disorder and 4.5% for generalized anxiety disorder was found.Both conditions were more prevalent in females than males inthis study. Comparisons were made to the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and the American Indian Service Utilization,Psychiatric Epidemiology, Risk and Protective Factors Project(AI-SUPERPFP). These assessment tools were similar, but notidentical, to the methodology used to survey the studypopulation. Suffice it to say that there were inter-studydifferences in prevalence rates for four of the five DSM-III-Rdiagnoses surveyed. A thorough review of the methodologicalissues that might account for these inter-study differences isoffered, but is beyond the scope of this review. The interestedreader is encouraged to review the paper in its entirety. Editorial Comment The findings reported by the authors of this study are concerning. The high lifetime prevalence rates for the five diagnoses surveyed reflect the distress of our American Indianand Canada First Nations families. What' s more, these are onlyfive out of the total universe of diagnoses that might have beeninvestigated. Correctly, the authors state, \"These findings have serious implications for effective parenting and family functioning. August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 206The prevalence rates also call attention to the need to improve access, identify and eliminate cultural barriers, and improvefunding for mental health service among northern midwest andCanadian First Nations people.\" I suggest this is true foressentially all AI/AN and Canada First Nations populations,both rural and urban. Last month, I reviewed an article authored by researchers from The National Center for American Indian and AlaskaNative Mental Health Research, University of Colorado HealthSciences Center. This institution continues to offer animportant body of information regarding the mental healthstatus of American Indian groups. Though not the authors ofthe article currently under review, they are the originators ofthe AI-SUPERPFP and the litany of related reports and articlesthat are extensively referenced. The authors of this month' s article pay homage to the originators of the AI-SUPERPFP by stating, \"The firstpublications from the AI-SUPERPFP data are radicallychanging the landscape of American Indian psychiatricepidemiology by providing the first population sample that canbe compared to national psychiatric epidemiological surveys.This important study will become the benchmark for futureresearch on psychiatric disorders in American Indianpopulations . . .. Researchers are now in a position to replicateAI-SUPERPFP work with other Native cultures to providecumulative and comparable information that will inform policymakers and service providers regarding potential systematicdifferences in prevalence rates across cultures.\" The importance of this comment cannot be overstated. There is a cumulative value for each and every published reportrelated to the health of AI/AN and Canada First Nationspeoples. One-by-one, greater light is shed on thesocioeconomic and health issues and disparities burdeningthese populations, bringing into crisper focus exactly whatneeds to be done. Someday, we will find a way to use thisknowledge to achieve equity in health status for NorthAmerican Native populations and once and for all end theinjustice.

August 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 207Indian Health Service History Project The Indian Health Service has initiated a project to document the 50 years of work since the federal health responsibilities for American Indians and Alaska Natives wastransferred to the US Public Health Service. The projectincludes collecting historic documents, photos, and oralhistories relating to the history of the Indian Health Service.We are researching records at the National Archives, Library ofCongress, National Library of Medicine, and universityarchives with Indian health related records. The records tell a fascinating, but at times incomplete story. Much of the work of the Indian Health Service wascarried out in distant, rural locations by government and tribalprograms whose work may not have reached the official recordsystem. We are interested in finding people who would be willing to share photos, documents, and memories of their time in theIndian Health Service. Do you have old photos, reports, ordocuments that you have been saving for years, and are youunsure what to do with them? This is your opportunity. If youare willing to share items from your time in the Indian HealthService, we would like to hear from you.

It' s the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a newevidence-based medicine resource. NICE guidelines aredeveloped by independent advisory groups made up of healthprofessionals, patients, their caregivers, and the public. NICE supports England' s National Health System, and provides guidance in the promotion of good health and patientcare. The guidelines they produce are based on the \"bestavailable evidence of medical effectiveness and costeffectiveness.\" NICE produces guidance in three areas of health, as follows: Public health: the promotion of good health and the prevention of ill health Health technologies: the use of new and existing medicines, treatments, and procedures Clinical practice: the appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions Up-to-date and to-the-point guidelines are a NICE specialty. The \"Postnatal Care Quick Reference Guide\" was posted July 2006, and is a colorful, well-organized, and easy-to-use web pamphlet with tips for nurses, doctors, and thepublic. Another July 2006 guideline deals with the use ofetanercept (Enbrel) and infliximab (Remicade) for psoriaticarthritis. The guidelines are crisp and focused. For example,use Enbrel if the patient has three or more involved joints, andat least two other DMARDs have not worked. For hypertension treatment, a June 2006 guideline suggests starting with an ACE inhibitor in patients youngerthan 55, but start with either a thiazide diuretic or calciumchannel blocker for those over 55, and for black patients of anyage. A brief discussion of the use of beta blockers follows theflow diagram. The database is very easy to use. To search, go to the homepage at http://www.nice.org.uk.
