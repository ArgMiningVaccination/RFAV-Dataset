Fatty plaques can build up in your bloodstream over time and can put you at risk of heart attacks, and along with stroke, are the two leading causes of death in both men and women in the United States. Other heart conditions include coronary artery disease, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias), heart infections, and congenital heart defects. At Tao of Wellness, our primary goal is to help you address your current condition, minimize your risk factors, and help you achieve a healthy lifestyle to prevent future complications. Tao of Wellness is a group of doctors of acupuncture and Chinese medicine who practice heart-healing therapies including [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), [nutritional therapy](/nutrition), [meditation](/tai-chi-qi-gong), among others. How We Successfully Treat Heart Disease Some risk factors for heart disease include family history, [high blood pressure](https://taoofwellness.com/blood-pressure/), [diabetes](/diabetes), smoking, [obesity](/weight-wellness), intense stress and physical inactivity. As an integrative medical clinic, practitioners at Tao of Wellness work collaboratively with other healthcare practitioners as a team to address health issues that often coexist alongside heart disease. Our patients get the best of both worlds when the medicines of East and West are combined. We have helped many individuals with heart disease in the last 40 years. The nerves and muscles of the heart can be strengthened to provide a stronger cardiovascular system, the metabolic system optimized to reduce the accumulation of plaque congestion in the arteries, and the free flow of blood can be restored through reduction of physical and emotional stressors. Our doctors are committed to utilizing the range of natural therapies of Chinese medicine to help heal your heart. Your visit to Tao of Wellness begins with an initial consultation. We will look at your current condition in addition to all the physical and emotional factors that may have helped create your particular heart disorder. You may also be experiencing shortness of breath, [respiratory conditions](/cough-asthma), [anxiety](/anxiety-depression), [insomnia](/sleep), palpitations, fainting, or chest [pain](/pain). As a truly holistic system, Chinese medicine requires that we devise a treatment plan only after evaluating all the other aspects of your history, uncovering the unique underlying causes. Your treatment protocol will likely include [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), [nutritional therapy](/nutrition), and [meditation](/tai-chi-qi-gong) as methods to improve blood circulation, relax the nervous system, and reduce inflammatory products from inside and outside the blood vessels. Our Customized Therapies for Overcoming Heart Disease Acupuncture Acupuncture is the essential Chinese medical physical therapy. It has been found to increase nitric oxide production to relax and dilate muscles of the blood vessel, allowing more oxygen and nutrient delivery, and aid in strengthening the heart muscles by eliminating plaque and other inflammatory waste products. [Learn more about acupuncture](/acupuncture). Chinese Herbal Medicine A customized herbal formula will be constructed to target your individual heart disease concerns. Herbs have many therapeutic functions and are organized into dozens of categories based on these functions. Numerous traditional herbal combinations as well as many individual herbs are available to choose from that have been used for heart health. For example, the herb astragalus has been found to restore the strength of injured heart muscle and blood vessel tissue. Red sage root helps relieve chest pain and promote circulation and healing of blood vessels. Our practitioner will address both your heart disease and the underlying causes simultaneously by designing an herbal formula that is aimed at healing your unique body. [Learn more about Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine). Nutritional Therapy Nutritional Consultations A proper diet plan can play a big role in reducing the amount of pressure on your heart and its blood vessels. Eating whole grains, fibrous vegetables, and nuts and seeds containing manganese and chromium like hazelnuts, pine nuts, and brazil nuts can help prevent hardening of the arteries, or arteriosclerosis. Overindulgence in rich, greasy and sweet foods can contribute to inflammation and tax your digestive system. Each patient receives nutritional guidance but a Nutritional Consultation will more comprehensively provide a customized eating plan complete with meals and snacks that have been put together for your body's specific needs. Learn more about Nutritional Counseling. Nutritional Supplements The plaques that can build up in the vessels of the heart are indicative of any number of inflammatory processes. Omega fatty acids inherent to fish oil supplements are well studied for their anti-inflammatory properties, enhancing blood flow and making plaques less likely to stick to the blood vessel walls. CoQ10, niacin, and the anti-inflammatory enzymes papain and bromelain in our Inflammation Fighter supplement can all be beneficial for the right patient as well. Our expert practitioners will work with you in devising a targeted supplement plan that is right for your unique body and specific heart condition. [Learn more about nutritional therapy](/nutrition). Mind Body Exercise Exercise is essential to promote a strong cardiovascular system. A lifestyle without regular movement will lead to a slowing of the movement of blood as well as reduced oxygen and nutrient delivery to sustain your tissues. Moderate cardiovascular exercise 30 minutes daily is recommended for a healthy cardiovascular system. Our practitioners will help you choose a safe exercise regimen while strengthening your heart. At Tao of Wellness we recommend the fluid, meditative arts of tai chi and qi gong. These gentle movement systems relax the body and mind, while also providing a gentle and effective workout of the muscles. They are beneficial for any age, fitness level, or physical ability. [Learn more about tai chi and chi gong](/tai-chi-qi-gong). Natural Healthcare for Heart Disease Tao of Wellness was established in 1976 as a resource to address heart disease. We strive to support you in mind and body, and invite you to make an appointment for your health and wellbeing. It would be our pleasure to serve you. High Blood Pressure High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a condition that affects about one third of adults and can lead to heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure. One can have elevated blood pressure for years before exhibiting symptoms such as [anxiety](/anxiety-depression), headaches, palpitations, dizziness, or tinnitus (ringing in the ear). This is why hypertension has been called the silent killer. Western Medicine combats hypertension with drug medications to control the blood pressure instead of curing the condition. It is important to identify the underlying cause and resolve it at the source while at the same time relieve the symptoms and signs of hypertension. At Tao of Wellness we seek comprehensive measures, integrating Western medical care when necessary, along with [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal therapy](/herbal-medicine), [nutritional therapy](/nutrition), [meditation](/tai-chi-qi-gong), and the avoidance of high-risk behaviors. In this fashion, we can help you focus on both the blood pressure and the underlying factors of your hypertension to give you back a life of true health. How We Successfully Treat High Blood Pressure Your blood pressure is the force of the flowing blood against the walls of the arteries. When the body is under stress, whether emotional or physical, it puts your heart in a position of working much harder than it should. Sustained overwork of the heart can cause damage to the blood vessels. Advanced age, African-Americans, women, emotional stress, [pregnancy](/fertility), [obesity](/weight-wellness), smoking, excessive salt intake and a family history of hypertension are all risk factors. Blood pressure is measured in two numbers. The first number is systolic pressure which represents the pressure generated when the heart contracts and pumps the blood through the artery. The second number is diastolic pressure, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest between heartbeats. Ideal blood pressure would be below 120/80. If you have a reading of 140/90 on three separate occasions, a diagnosis of hypertension can be made. At Tao of Wellness we have helped many individuals with high blood pressure and its associated symptoms with acupuncture and Chinese medicine. Beginning with an initial evaluation, one of our experienced doctors will investigate all aspects of your history to uncover the underlying causes of your problem. A customized treatment plan will be devised that seeks to not only treat your hypertension but also the underlying causes of your unique blood pressure problem. If you're also dealing with headaches, [fatigue](/cfs-fibromyalgia), muscle tremors, or chest [pain](/pain) your treatment plan will include therapies designed to address your circulatory and nervous systems, while teaching you to relax your mind and body therefore helping to restore balance and optimal health. Your high blood pressure treatment may include [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), [nutritional therapy](/nutrition), and [meditation](/tai-chi-qi-gong). Our Customized Therapies for Overcoming Hypertension Acupuncture Many studies have illustrated the efficacy of acupuncture for hypertension. In fact, it is one of the most researched aspects of acupuncture, showing that it significantly reduces hypertension and can have long lasting effects. Many of our patients have noticed a 10-20 point drop in their systolic pressure (the upper number) after just one acupuncture treatment. Of course results vary from patient to patient depending on severity and cause of hypertension. Acupuncture helps relieve the symptoms of hypertension such as headache, dizziness and shortness of breath, leaving you calmer, less inflamed, and with less stress on your nervous system. Your heart will be less stressed too. [Learn more about acupuncture](/acupuncture). Chinese Herbal Medicine A customized herbal formula may be given to support your body during the healing process. Chinese herbal medicine has been used for thousands of years to help patients with hypertension to subdue symptoms and support your body's natural circulatory functions. Scutellaria, gardenia and salvia are just a few of the herbs that may be chosen to address your blood pressure. Our expert practitioners will work with you closely to formulate an herbal combination suited to your particular blood pressure condition. [Learn more about Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine). Nutritional Therapy Nutritional Consultations A proper diet plan can play a big role in reducing the amount of pressure on your heart and blood vessels. Every patient receives nutritional guidance but a Nutritional Consultation goes much further. Our doctors are certified in Chinese clinical nutrition and will provide you a customized eating plan, complete with meals and snacks geared toward reversing your unique blood pressure condition. Eating quality whole grains, lean proteins, a large variety of vegetables, and limiting salt intake are a few ways you can help heal yourself. Overindulgence in rich, greasy and sweet foods can affect your metabolism to the point that excessive cholesterol is deposited into your arteries, causing inflammation in the arterial walls, narrowing the channel through which your blood can travel, and rapidly elevating your blood pressure. Anti-inflammatory foods such as cucumber, dark leafy greens, and high-fiber fruits like prunes and apples are recommended to regulate your internal temperature and prevent symptoms of hypertension. And by losing excessive weight your cardiovascular system will become stronger. Nutritional Supplements There are a host of supplements available to consumers to help reduce blood pressure. It's always advised that you work with an acupuncturist or other health care professional to ensure your regimen is right for you. Fish oil has been found to thin the blood, thus reducing the pressure on the vessels. CoQ10, besides helping to reduce side effects of the statin drugs for high cholesterol, has been found to lower blood pressure naturally. Our Tao of Wellness doctors will work with you in creating a customized supplement plan that's right for you. [Learn more about Nutritional Counseling](/nutrition). Mind Body Exercise Exercise is key to developing a strong cardiovascular system. No matter the type of exercise you choose to follow, you will be advised a safe program designed to strengthen your heart and calm your mind. At Tao of Wellness, we often recommend the fluid, meditative practices of tai chi and qi gong. These gentle movement systems relax the body, while also gently and effectively working the muscles and cardiovascular system. They are beneficial for any age, fitness level, or physical ability. Often, they are a combination of postures and dance-like movements with breathing, meditations and visualizations. A relaxed nervous system is paramount to an equally calm heart and healthy blood pressure. [Learn more about tai chi and chi gong](/tai-chi-qi-gong).

High Cholesterol High cholesterol or hypercholesterolemia is the accumulation of abnormally high levels of bad cholesterol within the blood. This can lead to inhibited blood flow and the deposit of fatty plaques on the walls of your arteries, leading to atherosclerosis. Over time, this can cause a narrowing of arteries, slowing the flow of blood and sometimes completely obstructing, causing coronary blockage or heart attack. High cholesterol can put you at risk for heart disease and stroke, the two leading causes of death in both men and women in the United States. While Western medicine frequently uses pharmaceutical drugs such as statins, which block the liver's release of excessive cholesterol, this often leads to side effects such as muscle pain and weakness, elevated liver enzymes and other symptoms. At Tao of Wellness we employ natural approaches to treating high cholesterol, integrating [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), [nutritional therapy](/nutrition), and [mind body exercise](/tai-chi-qi-gong), among other therapies. Risk factors associated with hypercholesterolemia such as smoking, [high blood pressure](https://taoofwellness.com/blood-pressure/), [excess weight](/weight-wellness), and [diabetes](/diabetes) can all be addressed with acupuncture and Chinese medicine. In addition, a healthy lifestyle is the ultimate goal so that you can enjoy proper circulation and a long life. How We Successfully Treat High Cholesterol It is important to know your levels of cholesterol because there are no outward symptoms to alert you of your condition. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as the \"bad\" cholesterol, contributes to hypercholesterolemia and can lead to narrowing of the arteries especially with the presence of inflammation. High-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"good\" cholesterol, helps rid the body of bad cholesterol by cleaning up the excess LDL and sending it to the liver, where it is broken down. Your total cholesterol levels should be less than 200 mg/dl, with your LDL cholesterol levels ideally below 100mg/dl and HDL cholesterol levels above 60 mg/dl to give you protection from heart disease. Beginning with an initial consultation, one of our Tao of Wellness doctors will evaluate both your current cholesterol levels and the physical and lifestyle factors that may have led your body to its current state of imbalance. Chinese medicine is a holistic practice that considers all aspects of your history in order to determine a customized treatment plan, which may include [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), and [nutritional therapy](/nutrition). Our [detoxification protocol](/cleansing-detox) has been very effective to rid the body of its excessive toxins, including bad cholesterol and inflammatory waste products that get in the way of proper function. We have successfully helped many individuals work toward reducing their high cholesterol. Excessive cholesterol is viewed in Chinese medicine as a result of impairments within the digestive system and the metabolism. Our team of licensed practitioners brings you time-tested therapies as a way to strengthen your metabolic and digestive systems, naturally lowering your cholesterol back into a healthy range. Our Customized Therapies for Overcoming High Cholesterol Acupuncture Acupuncture has been shown in studies to improve the digestion and metabolism of fats, enhance liver function and lower cholesterol. Acupuncture, in conjunction with Chinese herbal medicine and proper nutrition, can be even more powerful to address high cholesterol. [Learn more about acupuncture](/acupuncture). Chinese Herbal Medicine A customized herbal formula will be given to support your healthy digestive, metabolic and circulatory functions. For example, Hawthorn berry and green tea are two of the most well-studied herbs that are found to assist in breaking down excessive cholesterol in the body. Your practitioner will design an herbal combination suited specifically for your condition, including addressing any other health issues complicating your efforts in maintaining healthy cholesterol. [Learn more about Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine). Nutritional Therapy Nutritional Consultations A proper diet plan can play an essential role in reducing the amount of waste in your blood. Be sure to eat quality whole grains, lean proteins, and a variety of vegetables. Overindulgence in rich, greasy and sweet foods can cause accumulation of bad cholesterol. This contributes to inflammation and makes your digestive system work harder, enabling the deposition of excessive bad cholesterol as plaque onto your arteries. Common kitchen spices including fennel, oregano, basil and tarragon have been found to be beneficial in reducing cholesterol. Even just by losing a few pounds, your digestive and cardiovascular system will be less stressed and perform better. Each patient receives nutritional guidance but a Nutritional Consultation is more comprehensive in providing a customized eating plan for the whole week, complete with meals and snacks consisting of high-fiber, cholesterol-busting foods. Nutritional Supplements Fiber supplementation is one of the most popular remedies when combating excess cholesterol. Metamucil, psillium, and acacia fiber supplements can be used to literally sweep away wastes from the intestines as well as prevent absorption of excess cholesterol into the blood. This, of course, is only supported by the high-fiber fruits and vegetables eaten each day. When conditions are critical, statin drugs may be used and often require the supplemental use of CoQ10 to avoid the common symptoms of muscle aches and pains. Other supplements include fish oil and niacin. Our expert practitioners will work with you in devising a targeted supplement plan that is right for your unique body and condition. [Learn more about nutritional therapy](/nutrition). Cleansing & Detoxification Our proprietary protocol utilizes the best of time-tested Chinese medical therapies, together with modern far-infrared heat therapy to provide a whole-body cleanse. Environmental toxins impede circulation and gets in the way of optimal health and proper function of the bodily systems. Just like our homes, our bodies require periodic cleaning. The body's natural filtering mechanisms including the liver, kidneys, lymphatic and circulatory systems often retain toxins, uric acid, old medications, inflammatory waste products, and blockages such as cholesterol. A short-term cleanse may be just what's needed to kick-start a patient's body into reducing excess cholesterol. This protocol consists of [acupuncture](/acupuncture), skin more about the cleanse and detox protocol](/cleansing-detox). High Cholesterol Patient Success Stories Cholesterol Dropped Over 50% Tricia is 48 years old and arrived at our office with a total cholesterol reading of 405, over double the normal limit. She showed signs of insulin resistance and had gained weight around her belly. Tricia was also experiencing menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, and an irregular menstrual cycle. She was initially put on statin drugs by her cardiologist for two months. Tricia's cholesterol began to drop but her liver enzymes became elevated, a side effect of the statin drugs and a sign of liver inflammation, so she was taken off the statin. Her treatment consisted of high-fiber, low-cholesterol diet, daily cardiovascular exercise, and acupuncture and Chinese herbal therapies to strengthen Tricia's digestive, metabolic and hormonal functions. We continued her treatment course for another three months without the statin medication and Tricia's cholesterol dropped to 178, well under the maximum of 200. As a bonus, her period came back and she lost 23 pounds over the course of 3-4 months. Detox program lowered cholesterol by 50 points in a month Nancy is a 55 year-old philanthropist who traverses the globe regularly. As a result of her extensive travels and inconsistent diet she is often tired, feels bloated and overweight and her total cholesterol had shot up to 230 and her LDL was at 160, which was abnormally high for her historically. She refused to take medication and turned to Tao of Wellness to help her lower her cholesterol. Her doctor was pressuring her into taking statin drug and gave her a month to lower her LDL naturally so she opted for our Cleansing and Detox program that involved diet and nutrition, acupuncture and herbal therapies and regularly exercise. At the end of one month she returned to her internist and her blood test results showed total cholesterol had dropped a whopping 50 points and her LDL had gone from 160 to 125, within normal rage. Additionally, Nancy lost 10 lbs within that month and has managed to keep the weight off and her cholesterol normal.
