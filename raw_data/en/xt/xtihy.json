Our healthcare team will work closely with you to achieve a functional level of comfort while keeping you safe. When evaluating your pain control, we will have regular conversations about your ability to rest, perform daily activities and whether your comfort level is improving. Your input in developing daily goals is valued. T o learn more about your rights regarding your pain, please review the patient rights packet you received when admitted to the hospital. We use a variety of techniques and medications in order to decrease the risk of opioid abuse and addiction. Please share any concerns regarding the risk of opioid abuse or addiction with your healthcare team. Pain Scale Please use a number from the scale to help describe your pain. No Pain T olerable Moderate WorstThings Y ou Can Do to Ensure Medication Safety Share with your healthcare provider a list of all your current medicines, vitamins, herbs and supplements. Know what medications you are receiving in the hospital and why you are receiving them. Ask your healthcare provider how a new medicine will help. Ask about possible side effects. Ask for written information about the medicine, including its brand and generic names. T ell your healthcare provider if you don't feel well after receiving a medicine. If you think you are having a reaction or experiencing side effects, ask for help immediately. Don't be afraid to tell your healthcare provider if you think you are about to get the wrong medicine. Remind your healthcare provider about allergies that you have or negative reactions you have had to other medicines. Be aware that your healthcare providers will be checking your wristband and asking your name and date of birth prior to procedures or administering medications. Before you leave the hospital, make sure that you understand all of the instructions for the medicines you will need to keep taking and the medicines you will no longer need to take. Ask any questions you may have about any of your medications. Read the label on your prescription medicine. Make sure that it has your name on it and the correct medicine name and dosage. Some medicines have similar names and can be easily confused with each other . Make sure that your medication looks the same as it normally does. If something doesn't match, ask your healthcare provider immediately. T ake your medicine as prescribed, and do not stop taking it without first speaking with your healthcare provider . If you receive a prescription for antibiotics, use all the medication as prescribed until it is finished. Never use antibiotics prescribed for someone else or give someone else your medications.14 Stony Brook University HospitalIsolation Precautions Infection Control: Hand Hygiene We can't say it enough. Hand washing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infection. This is particularly important during hospitalization, when patients are at their most vulnerable and may have low immunity. For your safety and the safety of your visitors, we request that you help spread the word to perform hand hygiene before and after: every patient contact; entering a patient's room/area; eating; and using the bathroom. This means either using antibacterial foam or washing hands thoroughly at the sink. Here's how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend you wash your hands. Lather your hands with soap and water for as long as it takes to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice. Use a paper towel when turning off the water . Then dry hands thoroughly. Disease-Specific Precautions In the hospital, certain infections may require isolation to keep them from spreading to other patients. If this is the case with you, do not be alarmed. It is a standard safety procedure that involves taking precautions. This may include changing your room and limiting visitors. During your hospitalization, one or more of your laboratory cultures may show that you are carrying or are infected with bacteria or an organism that is resistant to usual antibiotics. When this occurs, you will be placed on disease- specific precautions. These protective measures are required for all healthcare workers to prevent or limit the spread to other patients. Your room may be changed. You will also be placed on disease-specific precautions at each of your subsequent admissions until it is proven that you are not carrying or infected with the identified bacteria. Your family members and visitors do not have to follow special precautions unless instructed to do so by a healthcare provider . Before entering the room, they should ask your nurse for specific instructions. They should wash their hands with soap and water or foam when entering and leaving the room, and should not go into other patient rooms and common areas in the unit. While in the room, if they need to sneeze or cough, they should do so into their elbow, not their hand. If they are using a tissue, they should discard it and wash hands. Family members and visitors should take as few personal items as possible into the room and store them away from you. They should not touch items used for your care, including medical devices, tubes or dressings. The doctor , nurse and the infection control practitioner assigned to your area can provide you with specific and additional information regarding the isolation. For additional information or to speak with one of the practitioners, call the Healthcare Epidemiology Department at 4-7430, Monday through Friday, 8 am to 4:30 pm. SUPPORT SERVICES Patient Advocacy If you have any questions or concerns that have not been answered to your satisfaction, or if you have a special need, contact a member of the Patient Advocacy staff. Patient advocates can help you understand your rights as a patient. They will address concerns you might have about your care, the hospital or any of its policies and procedures. Patient Advocacy is located in Room 540 on Level 5 (near the main lobby) and is open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 4:30 pm. You may ask your nurse to contact a patient advocate or you may call directly at 4-2880. If you wish to speak to a patient advocate during evenings or weekends, please ask your nurse for assistance. Additionally, you can mail in your concerns related to your experience to: Stony Brook University Hospital Department of Patient Advocacy Stony Brook, NY 11794-7522 Your concerns will be reviewed and every effort will be made to resolve them. You will be notified of the review and any follow-up that is done. If your concerns have not been addressed to your satisfaction, or if you prefer , you may contact The Joint Commission at (800) 994-6610 or via email at complaint@jointcommission.org. You also may report concerns to the New York State Department of Health, (800) 804-5447, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as outlined in the booklet, \"Your Rights as a Hospital Patient in New York State.\"15 Patient Information GuideCare Management In order to help ensure that your stay at Stony Brook goes smoothly, shortly after you are admitted an RN case manager or a social worker will meet with you and possibly with your family to coordinate your care and plan for your safe discharge. A stay in the hospital is much shorter than in the past. Improved treatments, the use of home care and rehabilitation services, and stricter insurance rules have all played a part in reducing the time you stay in the hospital. Although discharge times will vary, our goal is to have patients discharged by 11 am. We will work with you and/or your family to make sure that when you leave, your after-hospital care needs are addressed. Depending on your needs, we can help to: Give your insurance company the information needed to access your covered benefits Facilitate admission to rehabilitation centers, adult homes, assisted living centers, skilled nursing facilities, psychiatric centers and group homes Arrange for home care, medical equipment, dialysis and home IV therapy Provide emotional support to help you deal with an illness, loss or a crisis while in the hospital Refer you to community agencies and services Provide referrals to community agencies for benefits and entitlements Provide assistance with advance directives Arrange hospice and palliative care services Provide information and support if you are involved in an abuse or maltreatment situation Provide you with information regarding treatment if you have substance abuse problems Case managers and social workers are available seven days a week. T o speak with someone from the Care Management Department, call 4-2552, Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm, and Saturday, 8 am to 4 pm. On Sunday and after hours, please leave a voicemail message, and a staff member will return your call the following business day. If you need to speak to a case manager or social worker urgently, please ask your nurse to assist you. HIV T esting Services Stony Brook provides voluntary HIV testing, based on patient request and/or medical recommendation. In addition, we follow the New York State mandate to offer HIV testing to all patients age 13 and older who seek care through the Emergency Department, inpatient hospital units and outpatient primary care areas. New York State law requires patients be provided with basic information about HIV / AIDS prior to testing. Patients may refuse the test. The Emergency Department and some outpatient primary care areas offer rapid HIV testing, where results are obtained in less than 60 minutes. All tests are confidential and performed by Stony Brook in-house labs. All patients testing positive for HIV are provided an appointment for medical services within our adult, maternity or pediatric HIV departments. For patients who want to seek care at another location, the initial appointment can be arranged, as well as linkage to care services. Any patient seeking further information or interested in an HIV test can call 4-3592 or visit stonybrookmedicine.edu/hiv. If you are interested in reducing your risk of getting HIV , Stony Brook offers HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill that can help keep you from getting HIV . For more information, call (631) 559-6138 or visit stonybrookmedicine.edu/PrEP . The Blood Bank Stony Brook has a fully equipped Blood Bank. Blood is a free gift from a community of donors; however , there are charges to the patient for processing and testing. Our Blood Bank collects many different types of blood donations. An autologous (self) donation is when a patient pre-deposits his or her own blood for scheduled surgery. Directed donations, where friends and family donate blood for a specific patient, can also be arranged. Voluntary blood donations are always welcome and help the Blood Bank to maintain an adequate blood supply. Please note that screening tests are performed on donated blood to ensure blood safety. It may take up to a week from the day of donation before it can be used for transfusion. For more information about transfusion and for anyone wishing to donate the precious, lifesaving gift of blood, please call the Blood Bank at 4-2634 or 4-DONA TE (4-3662).16 Stony Brook University HospitalMedical Records While you are a patient at Stony Brook, you can have access to information contained in your medical records from a physician or a patient advocate. If you are transferred to another facility, a copy of your medical record accompanies you. All other requests for release of information need to include a signed authorization from the patient or his or her legal guardian and are handled by the Health Information Management Department. Patient Portal Stony Brook has a patient portal, \"MyHealtheLife,\" which is a secure, online tool for patients to view their health information, message doctors and request appointments. It also contains medical information and patient education tools. Parents can access their child's medical records only if their child is under age 12. Parents of children ages 12 and over can create a parent proxy portal that allows them limited access to their child's medical record. This is to protect the privacy of medical information of children over the age of 12 \u2014 especially important when adolescents seek care independent of their parents. Please ask any member of your healthcare team for more information and to create an account. Ethics Consultation Service Ethics consultation is a service offered to patients, their families and those who play a key role in decisions about patient care. Stony Brook University Hospital is committed to shared decision-making and honoring patients' wishes concerning medical treatment. Ethics consultants are available 24 hours a day to offer supportive counsel to help clarify and resolve ethical problems that might arise. Dial \"0\" for the hospital switchboard to request a consultant. Advance Directives What is an advance directive? Advance directives are written instructions about healthcare treatment made by adult patients before they lose their decision-making capacity. In New York State, the best way to protect your treatment wishes and concerns is to appoint someone you trust to decide about treatment if you become unable to decide for yourself. This person can be a family member , close friend or same-sex partner . By filling out a form called a healthcare proxy, this person becomes your \"healthcare agent.\" Before appointing a healthcare agent, make sure the person is willing to act as your agent. Discuss with your agent what types of treatments you would or would not want if you were in the hospital and had a life-threatening illness or injury. Make sure your healthcare agent knows your wishes. Some patients also express specific instructions and choices about medical treatments in writing. A written statement can be included in a healthcare proxy, or it can be in a separate document such as a living will. If you are interested in completing a healthcare proxy or would like to have a discussion about healthcare proxies, please request to see a social worker or case manager . Spiritual Care Services/ Chaplaincy Services/Chapel The Chaplaincy Department recognizes the importance of an individual's emotional and spiritual needs, as well as their impact on well-being. Often in times of uncertainty, worry, crisis, illness or grief, many turn to their faith and/or belief systems as a method of coping and strength. Chaplains are clinically trained to care for the human spirit and engage those they encounter by assessing their spiritual and emotional needs, serving as advocates, listeners and counselors, among other roles. Chaplains are available to assist patients and their families to access their own inner sources of strength, find meaning and assist with ethical decision-making. They also provide sacramental and sacred services upon request. Stony Brook University Hospital Spiritual Care providers are a diverse group: Catholic, Jewish, Islamic and Protestant chaplains who are available and able to assist in connecting individuals with other faiths and traditions. T o reach a chaplain, call the hospital operator or ask a member of your healthcare team to page the chaplain. The team can also arrange a visit for you. The Interfaith Chapel is located on Level 5 near the main entrance, and all are welcome. A schedule of services can also be obtained from the hospital operator or the announcement board directly outside the Chapel.17 Patient Information GuidePalliative Care Information Act New York State requires that healthcare practitioners offer information and counseling to patients and their families with serious illness. This includes information about prognosis, the range of options appropriate to the treatment, the risks and benefits associated with those options, and comprehensive pain and symptom management related to a serious illness. The Palliative Care Service The Palliative Care team is a supportive service that can help you and your family by assisting with pain management and other difficult symptoms and challenging decision-making related to serious illness, even when first diagnosed. The palliative care team works closely with your primary care team to address the specific palliative needs that can arise when being treated for a serious illness. A team of specialists from medicine, social work, nursing and chaplaincy services provide compassionate care and guidance for physical, emotional and spiritual needs. The Palliative Care team is available for inpatient consultation for patients facing serious illness. Patients and families can contact the Palliative Care team through any member of the primary treatment team.

Our physicians, nurses and entire healthcare team know that a good idea can result in exceptional care and a real difference in our patients' lives. So we strive to deliver the best ideas in medicine to our patients and their families. Whether that's in a new treatment protocol, the convenience of an outpatient clinic or simply a more user-friendly way to access our medical care. Ideas drive us, they thrive here and we are committed to bringing more of them to our patients than anyone else. stonybrookmedicine.edu Stony Brook University/SUNY is an affirmative action, equal "}
