By assisting the body in fostering a coherent and balanced energy field, healing touch helps create the ideal conditions for the body to activate its innate ability to heal itself. Studies have shown promising associations between healing touch and reduced anxiety, stress, depression, nausea, and pain. Healing touch is similar to Reiki and other forms of energy healing. We have a network of providers trained in healing touch and other energy systems, including nursing, acupuncture, physical therapy, spiritual care, and occupational therapy.
