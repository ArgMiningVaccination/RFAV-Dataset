Dennis Hastert SpeakerU.S. House of Representatives Honorable Nancy Pelosi Minority LeaderU.S. House of RepresentativesA Potential Influenza Pandemic: An Update on Possible Macroeconomic Effects and Policy Issues May 22, 2006; revised July 27, 2006 The Congress of the United States Congressional Budget OfficeThis revision incorporates corrected estimates of the overall impact of a potential flu pandemic on gross domestic product:about 4-1/4 percent in the severe scenario and about 1 percent in the mild scenario.In December 2005, at the request of the Senate Majority Leader, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prepared an assessment of the possiblemacroeconomic effects of an avian flu pandemic. 1In its assessment, CBO also described the nation's preparedness for a pandemic and options for increasing preparedness. At the request of the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, CBO has under taken this update to its earlier work, focusing on changes in the budgetary and economic aspects of the nation's preparedness. Although a pandemic could be caused by a ny of several influenza strains, scientists are particularly worried about H5N1, a strain that has caused repeated epidemics with high mortality among poultry in Asia; has spread from Southeast Asia to flocks in Central Asia, Europe, and Africa; and has made the jump frombirds to humans, causing the deaths of ove r 120 people. Infectious diseases are unpredictable, so it is impossible to say for sure whether a new pandemic will arise; whether it will involve the H5N1 virus; and, if it does, when it will happenand whether it will be mild or severe. The H5N1 virus could mutate in a way that causes a severe pandemic next year or a mild epidemic in a decade or two. Or itcould evolve in a way that renders it har mless. Or a pandemic could arise from an entirely different virus subtype. Since CBO's earlier assessment in December 2005, a number of developments have occurred: \u0083Several studies of the macroeconomic impact of an influenza pandemic have been released, providing estimates that span a wide range and thereby highlight the considerable uncertainty involved. In December, CBO estimated that a severe influenza pandemic (similar to the one that began in 1918) mightcause a decline in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of about 4-1/4 percent and that a milder pandemic (similar to those that occurred in 1957 and 1968)might reduce GDP by about 1 percent, relative to what would have happened otherwise. One recent study, notable in that it analyzes economic data from past pandemics, suggests that the imp act of a 1918-style pandemic would be milder than what CBO and others have estimated. \u0083The Congress provided $3.8 billion i n funding for pandemic influenza preparedness for fiscal year 2006 through an emergency supplemental appropriation added to the defense a ppropriation bill in December 2005. Of that amount, $3.3 billion was provided to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). For the most part, those funds have been allocated inline with the Administration's reque st, although more than the amounts 1. See Congressional Budget Office, A Potential Influenza Pandemic: Possible Macroeconomic Effects and Policy Issues (December 8, 2005).2requested have been provided to stat e and local governments to plan their responses to an outbreak of a pandemic influenza. The Congress has not yet made decisions about an additiona l $3.5 billion requested by the Administration for 2007 and 2008. \u0083The Administration's policy continues t o emphasize efforts to produce enough vaccine within six months of a pandemic outbreak to inoculate the entire U.S. population. By May 2006, HHS had taken the first steps to meet that goal by 2011 by contracting with six vaccine ma nufacturers to plan and develop new production capability. \u0083The Administration's National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza: Implementation Plan , issued in May 2006, reaffirms plans to stockpile vaccines sufficient to inoculate 20 millio n people against pandemic influenza.2 At the current time, 4 million courses of H5N1 prepandemic vaccines have been ordered. Preparedness activities also include steps to increase thedomestic production capacity of vaccines, i ncrease the availability of antiviral and other drugs, and improve the response of state and local governments and the health system. \u0083The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, enacted in December 2005, provides broad liability protectio n for manufacturers and others with regard to products to combat pandemic influenza and extends those protections to other medical countermeasures. Macroeconomic Effects In December, CBO estimated that a severe influenza pandemic (similar to the one that began in 1918) might cause a decline in U.S. GDP of about 4-1/4 percent and that a milder pandemic (similar to those that occurred in 1957 and 1968) might reduce GDP by about 1 percent, in comparison to what it would have been in the absence of a pandemic. In each case, economic activity would probably snap backonce the pandemic ended, as consumers i ncreased spending and businesses increased production to meet pent-up demand. Several estimates of the macroeconomic impact of an influenza pandemic have been released since CBO's assessment was published. Some find effects that are larger than CBO's. For example, a study by Steven Kennedy, Jim Thompson, andPetar Vujanovic estimates t hat a pandemic with total m ortality of roughly one- third of what occurred in 1918 would reduce Australian GDP by nearly 6 percent, 2. Homeland Security Council, National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza: Implementation Plan (May 2006).3relative to a base case without a pandemic.3Moreover, some medical experts, stressing the uncertainty about the exact characteristics of the potential virus, suggest that the worst-case scenario could be much worse than the severe scenario that CBO considered, especially if the H5N1 virus acquires the ability to spread efficiently among humans without losing its extreme virulence. Other studies estimate effects on the ec onomy that are roughly the same size as CBO's. For example, Warwick McKibbon and Alexandra Sidorenko, using an econometric model of the world economy, estimate that a severe influenza pandemic might reduce GDP in the United States by 5.5 percent, relative to a basecase without a pandemic. 4Another study, by Sherry Cooper of the investment firm BMO Nesbitt-Burns, adopted CBO's estimate of the impact under a severe scenario but boosted it to account for greater disruption in international trade (and the resulting effect on global supply chains), which resulted in an estimate of a 6 percent decline in GDP.5 One recent study, however, estimates effects that are much milder than those reported by CBO and the others. Steven J ames and Timothy Sargent estimate that a severe pandemic, with mortality similar to that seen in 1918, would reduce Canadian GDP by an amount that ranged from 0.3 percent to 1.1 percent in the year of the pandemic.6The authors note that those effects would be typical of other advanced economies, such as that of the United States. The James-Sargent study is notable for its use of economic data from the three 20th century pandemics and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)episode in 2003. For example, on the basis of monthly data on industrialproduction in the United States, the aut hors estimate that real GDP declined by roughly 0.5 percent during 1918 as a result of the pandemic. In addition, though retail sales declined during the month o f the pandemic, that decline was not unusual given the normal monthly variatio n in the data series. The authors found no evidence that international trade flows were disrupted or that financial markets were affected. Moreover, information gleaned from other sources reveal only mild 3. See Steven Kennedy, Jim Thompson, and Petar Vujanovic, A Primer on the Macroeconomic Effects of an Influenza Pandemic , Working Paper 2006-01 (Parkes, Australia: Treasury of Australia, February 2006). Similarly, a study by the New Zealand Treasury estimated that a severe pandemic would reduce GDP in New Zealand by between 5 percent and 10 percent in the year that it occurred.

The authors c onclude that the 1918 pandemic caused a mild reduction in supply due to illness and a very small reduction in demand andthat the economic effects of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics were even smaller. James and Sargent also conclude that the SARS outbreak did not cause a significant disruption in supply in the affected areas (primarily Hong Kong,Singapore, and Toronto). Economic activity slipped, but that was largely becauseof a temporary reduction in international travel to the affected areas, along with adecline in the lodging and restaurant industries. The authors found little evidenceof wider impacts on retail sales, shipping tonnage, or airfreight\u2014leading them to conclude that supply chains were largely unaffected. Preparedness Policy Current policy and options to mitigate the human and economic costs of an avian flu pandemic continue to evolve in thre e critical areas: developing vaccines and vaccine production capacity, developing tr eatments with antiviral drugs and other medications that would play a key role i n reducing the impacts of a pandemic, and preparing state and local government and public health responses to the problems presented by an outbreak (see Table 1). \u0083As part of its plan, the Department of Health and Human Services is taking steps for sufficient capacity to exist by 2011 to produce vaccine for the entire U.S. population within six months of an outbreak. \u0083Clinical trials are being conducted to s ee if the industry's limited capability to produce vaccine in the next several year s can be stretched by \"dose-sparing\" techniques. Information from those trials is expected to be available by late 2006 or early 2007. \u0083Since December 2005, plans have been put in effect to expand federal and state stockpiles of antiviral drugs. Ma nufacturers have taken the first steps toward increasing their capacity. If all goes as planned, the national supply of antiviral drugs should be about 80 million doses by the end of 2008. Public health officials are also looking to other existing medicines that might beeffective in treating people who are sick with the flu\u2014for example, statins andother drugs that address the inflammatory symptoms that accompany an influenza infection. \u0083The national response to a pandemic infl uenza would rely on state and local governments and the private sector as well as the federal government. For 2006, the Congress appropriated $680 million to improve response, including funding for state and local planning, state purchases of antiviral drugs for stockpiles, and purchases of medical supplies.5Table 1.

Leavitt (March 13, 2006), p. 2. a. Includes activities related to surveillance, quarantine, lab capacity, and rapid tests. b. Includes activities related to international preparedness, surveillance, and response. Vaccine Supply One challenge in providing vaccine fo r a pandemic is that the production of a vaccine specifically matched to the pandemic strain requires a sample of that strain itself. Therefore, production could begin only after the outbreak. Withcurrent egg-based technology, a pandemic vaccine would require at least six6months to produce. Current domestic production capacity might provide enough pandemic vaccine for only about 3 percent of the population.7 Production Lag. The Administration's implementation plan directs HHS to \"establish and maintain stockpiles of p repandemic vaccine s adequate to immunize 20 million persons against influenza strains that present a pandemic threat, as soon as possible within the constraints of industrial capacity.\"8The vaccine produced before a pandemic would not be a perfect match with the strain of virus causing the outbreak, but the hope is that it would offer at least some protection for first responders, at-risk populati ons, and military personnel before a vaccine specific to the pandemic could be produced . Furthermore, producing prepandemic vaccines increases manufacturers' experience in producing vaccines with potential against a pandemic. Clinical trials are under way now to determine how much cross-protection an H5N1 vaccine ba sed on one strain will provide against different H5N1 strains, with results expected at the end of 2006. HHS has awarded about $240 million in contracts to two manufactures, Sanofi Pasteur and Chiron, to produce nearl y 8 million doses of H5N1 prepandemic vaccine for strategic stockpiling.9About $80 million of the funds are from the $3.3 billion appropriated to HHS for 2006. Recently published results of clinical trials indicate that a person will require two doses of that vaccine to induce an effective immune response against the H5N1 virus.10The initial stockpile would thus be sufficient to fully vaccinate a bout 4 million individuals. But some experts argue that to provide the greatest protection for a population, giving a lower doseto each person may be better in order to vaccinate more people. 11 The vaccine counted in the Strategic Nati onal Stockpile is stored in bulk form by the companies that produced it until the gove rnment requests that it be formulated (the vaccine is stored at Sanofi Pasteur's facility in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, and Chiron's facility in Liverpool, England) . The rate of stockpiling will be slow, 7. The estimate assumes that each person requires two doses of 90 micrograms of antigen (the raw material from which vaccines are made) and that yields for a pandemic strain are 20 percent to 50 percent lower than yields for seasonal strains. See Congressional Budget Office, A Potential Influenza Pandemic , pp. 22-23. 8. See Homeland Security Council, National Strategy ,p .1 2 0 . 9. A dose is 90 micrograms of antigen, and a treatment course is two doses per person. See Department of Health and Human Services, Pandemic Planning Update: A Report from Secretary Michael O. Leavitt (March 13, 2006), p. 5. 10. See John J. Treanor and others, \"Safety and Immunogenicity of an Inactivated Subviron Influenza A (H5N1) Vaccine,\" New England Journal of Medicine , vol. 354, no. 13 (2006), pp. 1343-1351. 11. See David S. Fedson, \"The Global Pandemic Vaccine Challenge\" (presentation at the WHO Consultation for the Development of a Global Action Plan for Increasing Pandemic Vaccine Supply, May 2 and 3, 2006), to be posted at www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/ vaccinesconsult2006/en/index.html.7however, because the companies can produce prepandemic vaccines only in the \"off-season\" (that is, the time of the year when they are not producing vaccine forseasonal influenza). Moreover, the vaccine stockpile will have to be restockedbecause the shelf life for influenza vaccine stored in bulk is about 12 to 18months. As the vaccine approaches the end of its shelf life, it could be destroyed.Alternatively, it could be used to vacci nate volunteers under the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Investiga tional New Drug provisions, even though a pandemic outbreak has not yet occurred. 12However, as discussed in CBO's December 2005 assessment, the experience with the swine flu in 1976 suggests that such a mass immunization campaign for a potential pandemic is an enterprise not without challenges and risks.13 Capacity Limitation. The Administration's implementation plan directs HHS to work with the pharmaceutical industry toward the goal of developing, within 60 months, domestic production capacity sufficient to provide vaccine for the entire U.S. population within six months of a pandemic outbreak.14According to the Secretary of Health and Human Services , 20 percent of the production capacity would come from traditional egg-based vaccine manufacturing facilities and 80percent would come from new cell-based vaccine manufacturing facilities. 15 Egg-Based Vaccine Production. Domestic production capacity of egg-based vaccine would have to increase sevenfold from the current level in order to produce an H5N1 vaccine for 20 percent of the U.S. population. Sanofi Pasteur (which recently broke ground on a new f acility in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) anticipates doubling the current domestic cap acity for seasonal influenza vaccine, from 60 million doses to 120 million doses, by the 2009 influenza season.16 However, the company's current domestic production capacity for H5N1 vaccine is only about 8 million to 10 million courses (or 16 million to 20 million doses) ina six month period, because much more H5N1 vaccine is needed per dose and because yield for the H5N1 strain is 20 percent to 50 percent lower than it is for seasonal flu strains. 17Therefore, doubling Sanofi Pasteur's current capacity would 12. Those provisions include strict requirements for inventory control, recordkeeping, and informed consent.

The department expects t o issue requests for proposals soon. Cell-Based Vaccine Production. As part of an effort to develop domestic production capacity of cell-based vaccine sufficient to cover 80 percent of theU.S. population, HHS has awarded contra cts totaling about $1.1 billion over five years to six companies. 19In addition to facilitating development leading to licensing by FDA, the contracts include commitments to U.S. manufacturing facilities and may be used to scale up development and to design manufacturing facilities but not to cons truct them. Most of those funds come from the $3.3 billion that the Congress appropria ted to HHS for 2006 for influenza preparedness. The remaining funds were awarded in March 2005 from previous appropriations. Some observers estimate that a facility to manufacture cell-based flu vaccine would require four years to build and qualify for FDA approval.20That estimate is for the design and construction of the plant alone. Because the contracts to develop cell-based influenza vaccines have just been signed, several years of development and clinical trials will pr obably be required before ground is broken. HHS believes that timeline can be expedited by performing many steps in parallel. The department expects that, w ith the current awards and private funds, at least some of the six companies will prove successful in accelerating the 18. Since September 2004, HHS has also had a contract with Sanofi Pasteur (for $41 million through 2008) to ensure a year-round supply of eggs and other essential v accine production supplies. Before 2004, flocks were killed at the end of the flu season. The contract would make producing a pandemic influenza vaccine in the off-season possible if an outbreak were to occur. Under thecontract, Sanofi Pasteur also supplies investigational lots of pandemic influenza vaccine for clinicalstudy. See Sanofi Pasteur, \"Aventis and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Enter into Third Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Agreement\" (press release, November 9, 2004). 19. The first contract, for $97 million, was awarded in March 2005 to Sanofi Pasteur. The other five, totaling about $1 billion, were awarded in May 2006 and went to GlaxoSmithKline ($274.75 million), MedImmune ($169.46 million), Novartis Vaccines ($40.97 million), and Solvay Pharmaceuticals ( $298.59 million). See Department of Health and Human Services, \"HHS Awards Contracts Totaling More Than $1 Billion to Develop Cell-Based Influenza Vaccine\" (press release, May 4, 2006), available at www.hhs.gov/news/press/2006press/20060504.html), and \"HHS Awards $97 Million Contract to Develop Cell Culture- Based Influenza Vaccine\" (press release, April 1, 2005), available at www.hhs.gov/news/press/ 2005pres/20050401.html. 20. See Etienne Malhaize, GlaxoSmithKline, \"Cell Culture Based Vaccine Production: Engineering Bottlenecks\" (presentation at the National Academ y of Engineering/Institute of Medicine meeting \"Vaccine Production: Potential Engineering Approaches to a Pandemic,\" Cleveland, Ohio, April 10and 11, 2006), available at www.vaccine 2006.org/program.html.9development of their cell- based influenza vaccines. Presumably, for the companies that are successful in the f irst round, HHS plans additional awards from anticipated funding in 2007 and 2008\u2014leading to enough cell-based vaccine production capacity to cover 80 percent of the population by 2011. Other stakeholders have argued that the regulatory process to approve manufacturing methods that are not egg- based is long and involved and would require large clinical trials to demonstrate a vaccine's safety and efficacy.21The Administration's implementation plan notes \"that certain issues must be addressed by extensive testing and characterization prior to the banking and use of mammalian cells for v accine production.\"22 The Administration's motivation to shift from egg-based to cell-based production capacity results primarily from the fact that egg-based production capacity can notbe scaled up in times of emergency, mostly because of its reliance on specially prepared and treated eggs . In fact, according to some estimates, the supply of eggs would have to increase from the roughly 100 million currently required to meet the U.S. demand for seasonal influenza vaccine to almost 2 billion to produceenough vaccine for the entire U.S. population during a pandemic. 23 By contrast, cells can be frozen in advance and large numbers grown quickly. In addition, capacity can be increased in a modular fashion by adding fermentingequipment. Cell-based influenza vaccines would also provide an option for people who are allergic to eggs and therefore unable to receive the currently licensed vaccines. Some proponents of cell culture technology also argue that it providessecurity against the risks associated with egg-based production, such as the potential for the supply of eggs to be contaminated by various poultry-based diseases. However, others argue that cell lines can easily become contaminated by viruses or bacteria. The Administration's implementation plan notes that \"cellsm a yb ea tr i s ko fc o n t a m i n a t i o nw i t hv a r i o u sd i s e a s e - c a u s i n go r g a n i s m s ,...a n dthere may be tumorigenicity concerns with cells that may be useful for high-yieldmanufacturing.\" 24 Alternative Vaccines and Production Technologies. Production of a cell-based vaccine, although readily scalable, would still require about the same amount of 21. E-mail correspondence with Vical, May 12, 2006. Vical is a biopharm aceutical company working on a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) v accine that could provide protection against all influenza viruses. 22. See Homeland Security Council, National Strategy , p. 105, footnote 16. 23. For requirements for seasonal influenza, see Michael Osterholm, \"Preparing for the Next Pandemic,\" New England Journal of Medicine , vol. 352, no. 18 (2005), pp. 1839-1843; for requirements for pandemic influenza, see Department of Health and Human Services, \"Vaccine Production in Cells,\" available at www.pandemicflu.gov/vaccine/vproductioncells.html. 24. See Homeland Security Council, National Strategy , p. 105, footnote 16.10time as that of an egg-based vaccine. Thus, although cell-based production addresses the capacity limitation, it does not address the production lag. Vaccines that confer immunity to a broader range of influenza strains and other novelvaccine technologies have the potential to increase the industry's capacity toproduce sufficient quantities and to a ddress the lag in production during a pandemic. If more people receive vaccine s with broader powers of protection, then the need for a speedy production response may be lessened. Moreover,people vaccinated in previous years m ay retain some level of protection. One vaccine delivered by nasal spray, r ather than injection, may provide some immunity across influenza strains. 25And because the production process is different, it may also offer the opportuni ty for large numbers of doses from much smaller numbers of eggs. Although the nasal vaccine for protection against seasonal influenza is already on the market, most alternative vaccines are still in clinical trials or even at the research stage. A recent survey of clinical trials of fluvaccines offering broader protection found seven such trials occurring in 2006and 2007. 26 Recombinant genetic techniques may also produce vaccines that can be manufactured in much greater quantities than those using egg- or cell-basedproduction. Because such technologies are already widely used in industry, tapping into them could moderniz e the production of flu vaccines. 27In HHS's first round of technology development cont racts, none of the candidates using recombinant genetic techniques was awarded a contract, although some haveother contracts for technology development or testing with other government agencies. However, HHS is preparing t o issue requests for proposals to develop flu vaccines relying on recombinant genetic techniques, just as it did for cell-based technology. Ongoing Government Support. The current level of market demand for the seasonal influenza vaccine is not sufficien t to attract private investors to finance the development and design, construction, and ongoing operation of a domestic industry that can provide 300 million courses within six months of an outbreak.The federal funds currently appropriated will add to private investment in thedevelopment of new production technology and the design of new plants. TheAdministration's request for 2007, and its likely plans for 2008, would provide 25. The broadened immunity may come because the vaccine uses a weakened live virus, rather than component parts, as other seasonal flu v accines do. 26. See Jocelyn Kaiser, \"A One-Size-Fits-All Flu Vaccine?\" Science (April 21, 2006). 27. See David Estell, Genencor International, \"Adapting Industry Practice for Rapid Large Scale Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Proteins,\" and Lada Rasochova, \"A Microbial Expression System as a Possible Route to Antigen Production for Use as V accines\" (presentations at the National Academy of Engineering/Institute of Medicine meeting \"Vaccine Production: Potential Engineering Approaches to a Pandemic,\" Cleveland, Ohio, April 10 and 11, 2006), available at www.vaccine2006.org/program.html.11public funds to complement private finan cing of new construction and renovation of existing plants. But even when the c onstruction and renovation are completed sometime after 2010, maintaining the su rge capability to meet the potential demands of an influenza pandemic and c ontinuing to develop new production technologies and vaccines may require public support. Success in increasing the egg-based and cell-based pr oduction of currently availa ble vaccines will probably diminish the incentive for the private sector to invest in more-advanced processesand products, so a possible policy optio n could be additional government support for those technologies. Currently, the federal government creates demand for seasonal influenza vaccines by recommending vaccination for certain groups\u2014the elderly, for example\u2014andby providing funds for many people receivi ng vaccinations each year\u2014largely, Medicare and Medicaid recipients. One approach to building and maintaining thecapability to produce large amounts of a pandemic vaccin e is to encourage demand for the seasonal vaccines. In February 2006, the Centers for DiseaseControl's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices added children ages 24months to 59 months and their healthy household contacts to the list of peopleencouraged to get a flu shot. 28Some observers have called for a universal recommendation for everyone to receive a seasonal flu shot. The movement toward such a recommendation and concer ns about the seasonal flu that have been created by the threat of a pandemic virus have led to predictions that manufacturers will deliver 120 million doses of vaccine for the 2006-2007 season,which is well above last year's level of 85 million doses. 29The Administration's implementation plan also calls fo r HHS to support the industry through purchasing and maintaining stockpile s of 20 million courses of vaccine against each circulating influenza virus with pandemic potential. In the future, support oftwo or three manufacturers with the cap acity to produce, collectively, enough pandemic vaccine for the entire U.S. popula tion could require even larger direct purchases than those now provided for by Medicare and Medicaid and the currently planned stockpiles, dependi ng on the global market for influenza vaccine. Dose-Sparing Efforts. To address the immediate pr oduction capacity limitation, researchers are looking for ways to make the current vaccine more effective at lower doses, stretching the available supply to serve more people and thusincreasing the value of stockpiling. Adding an adjuvant to the pandemic vaccineis one dose-sparing technology currently under investigation. 30However, clinical 28. \"Flu Vaccine Production Soars, Setting up Debate on Universal Recommendation,\" Pink Sheet (April 24, 2006), p. 18. 29. Ibid. 30. Adjuvants are substances used to enhance the ability of antigens to stimulate the immune system. Adjuvants may also provide cross-protection; th at is, they may enhance the ability of a vaccine to offer protection against influenza viruses of a dif ferent strain than that used to make the vaccine.12trials of adjuvanted vaccines against av ian influenza have generally shown mixed results. Most recently, Sanofi Pasteur completed a clinical trial of a prepandemic H5N1 vaccine using adjuvants.31In the trial, an adjuvant was able to reduce the amount of vaccine by two-thirds and s till achieve requisite levels of immune response. The formulation of stockpiled vaccine and the production capacity necessary to provide vaccine for the e ntire population will depend in part upon how successful adjuvants are in reducing the amount of vaccine required toprovide immunity. To assess the safety of adjuvants and ot her dose-sparing techniques and their ability to improve the immune response, HHS and the National Institutes of Health are supporting several manufacturers to produce dose-sparing vaccines forclinical testing. Results are expected to be available by the end of the year. HHSalso plans to spend $150 million from 2006 funds on contracts to supportadvanced-stage development of dose-sparing strategies. Liability Protection. Legislation enacted in December 2005 provides broad liability protection for manufacturers and others with regard to products to combat pandemic influenza and extends thos e protections to other medical countermeasures. 32That legislation, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, prohibits su its under federal and state law against manufacturers and health care workers fo r injuries caused by certain medical products used to counter pandemic influe nza, other epidemics, and diseases caused by acts of terrorism. The liability protections apply only to products used during a period that the Secretary of Health and Human Services declares a publichealth emergency. The law provides an exception to immunity if a manufacturer engaged in willful misconduct. The PREP Act also authorizes the Secretary to develop a compensation program for individuals injured by those produc ts that will be similar to a program for individuals injured by the smallpox v accine. Funding compensation under that program depends upon future appropriations. Antiviral Drugs and Other Medicines to Treat the Sick HHS plans to spend $731 million appropriate d for 2006 on currently available antiviral drugs and research to develop new antiviral agents. The funds are allocated for both federal and state initiatives. Specifically, the federalgovernment will spend $361 million to purchase approximately 20 million dosesof Tamiflu and Relenza for the Strategi c National Stockpile. Those doses are 31. \"Influenza: Prepandemic Flu Vaccine Candidate with Adjuvant Shows Good Immune Res ponse in Trial,\" Vaccine Weekly (January 18, 2006), p. 59. 32. The Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-148), was enacted on December 30, 2005. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act is included as division C of that legislation.13expected to be delivered by the first quarter of 2007. States will be given $170 million in matching funds to use toward the purchase of 31 million doses ofantiviral drugs for their stockpiles. And finally, HHS plans to spend $200 millionon the development of additional antiviral drugs aimed at combating the effects ofpandemic and seasonal influenza. Stockpiles. To date, the Strategic Nationa l Stockpile includes about 5.1 million courses of Tamiflu and 84,000 courses of Relenza. 33HHS has ordered another 16.2 million courses of Tamiflu and 3.9 millio n courses of Relenza, which will raise the total national stockpile to a bout 25 million courses of those drugs by the first quarter of 2007, if deliveries are made on time.34HHS intends to purchase an additional 24 million courses of Tamiflu and Relenza with funds requested for 2007 and 2008.35As noted above, HHS has also allocated $170 million of 2006 funds to cover 25 percent of the cost of s tates' purchases of an additional 31 million courses. State governors have been asked to notify HHS if they plan to purchase their allocated antivirals by July 1, 2006.36Ultimately, the department's goal is to have 81 million courses of antiviral drugs in the Strategic National Stockpile (50 million from federal spending and 31 million from a combination of federal and state funds) by the end of 2008.37 Effectiveness. When effective, an antiviral drug reduces the severity, duration, and likelihood of death associated with a viral infection. But there are not solid data about how effective currently availa ble antiviral drugs are against the H5N1 virus. It is commonly believed that viral resistance to the older and less expensive class of antiviral drugs called adamantanes would limit their usefulness during apandemic. 38(The Strategic National Stockpile includes 5 million courses of 33. For Tamiflu, a course of treatment consists of 10 capsules; for Relenza, 20 inhalations of 5 milligrams each.

However, a study expected to appear in a coming issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases suggests the possibility that adamantanes can be used selectively alongside Tamiflu to treat people infected with14rimantadine, which is a drug of that type.) Accordingly, HHS has focused its recent antiviral stockpiling efforts on purchasing Tamiflu and Relenza eventhough recent reports have surfaced that some strains of the H5N1 virus arebecoming resistant to Tamiflu. 39In response, HHS has changed its stockpiling strategy to decrease the target share of Tamiflu held in reserve from 90 percent to 80 percent and increase the share of Relenza from 10 percent to 20 percent. Production of Existing Antiviral Drugs. In 2003, the production capacity for Tamiflu was 6 million courses. Roche, the patent holder and manufacturer of the drug, said it will be capable of produc ing 400 million courses in 2007\u2014the result of contracts that it has recently signed with more than 15 companies, each of which will help carry out a step in the production process.40The firm has also granted sublicenses to Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group and HEC group, both in China, and to Hetero Drugs in India to produce generic versions of Tamiflu for use in China, India, and other developing countries. In addition, other companies are producing generic versions of Tamif lu without sublicenses from Roche in India, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Algeria.41In the United States, Roche is currently producing 80 million courses of Ta miflu per year in six facilities.42 In response to the growing demand, Gl axoSmithKline has also increased production of Relenza from less than 1 million courses in 2005 to 15 million courses in 2006.43Currently, Relenza is not produced in the United States; however, the company says that it will begin production in North Carolina in2007. 44 New Antiviral Drugs. HHS plans to spend $200 million of its 2006 funds on the development of additional antiviral drugs and has recently issued a presolicitationnotice describing its intent to awar d one or more contracts to support the advanced-stage development of new antiviral compounds for the treatment and some strains of the H5N1 virus.

Other Medicines to Treat the Sick. Public health officials are looking to other existing medicines that might be effective in treating people who are sick with the flu. Recent studies suggest that an exagge rated immune response (referred to as a \"cytokine storm\") to the influenza virus infection may have been the cause of thehigh lethality seen in the 1918 pandemic. S ome scientists have suggested testing the use of statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) for treating the cytokine storm. 46 Statins are more widely available and cheaper than the newer antiviral agents and vaccines which would make them particularly useful during a pandemic if theywere found to reduce flu symptoms from the H5N1 virus. State and Local Governments' and P ublic Health Systems' Readiness The preparedness of state and local governments and public health systems will be important in minimizing the human and economic cost of a pandemic outbreakeven if the goal of providing vaccine for the entire U.S. population within six months is met by 2011. In the interim, when only a small percentage of the population could be vaccinate d, controlling the spread of the disease and treating sick people would be essential before the combination of vaccination andsurvivors' immunity could limit its damage. In December 2005, HHS held a planning summit on pandemic influenza with state and local leaders from across the United States. During that summit, HHS announced its plan to hold individual planning summits in every state. 47To date, summits have been held in over 45 states.48Through those meetings, HHS has emphasized that although the federal g overnment will provide support during a pandemic, the ultimate responsibility for pandemic preparedness lies with the states. To help states with their preparations, HHS released a checklist.49 45.

Yet the critical tasks still focus primarily onassisting states to prepare for a pandemic. In the event of a pandemic, states would rely in part on HHS for public health and medical response, the Department of Homeland Security for dom estic incident management and federal coordination, and several other agencies for various types of support. 51 Of the $3.3 billion appropriated to HHS in 2006 for preparedness, $100 million has been allocated to states and U.S. te rritories, with another $250 million to be disbursed as states meet specific preparedness milestones.52That money is in addition to more than $6 billion that has been invested since 2002 in state andlocal health and medical preparedness for events involving mass casualties such as a natural disaster or act of bioterrorism. 53However, such events are more likely to be geographically concentrated than is pandemic influenza, which could affectalmost all communities in the United States. The extent to which money disbursed for mass casualty events would also help prepare for pandemic influenza is not known. The Health Care System Were an influenza pandemic to occur, local health care systems would not have a sufficient number of beds or enough staff or supplies to meet the demand (andobserve routine standards of care). In the event of even a mild pandemic, localhealth care systems would need to rapidly expand operations and deployinfection-control measures and treatments. Public health officials have expressedconcern that the system's capacity would be inadequate. 54FluSurge, a simulation tool developed by the Centers for Disease Control, has produced estimates that a severe pandemic in an urban area would inc rease the overall demand for hospital 50.

Hospitals would n eed more protective equipment such as surgical masks, gloves, and gowns, and they would need to have the capacity for increased decontamination and waste management. As occurred during the SARS outbreak in Canada, hospitals would especi ally need N95 particulate respirators to protect medical staff against infection.56Widely adopted just-in-time practices for supplies may help to control costs in normal circumstances but leave too small an inventory margin to accommodate the i ncreased demand for supplies that would accompany an influenza pandemic. Certain essential equipment would also be needed. Ventilators would be of particular importance because sick patients with inflamed and fluid-filled lungswould need assistance with breathing. CBO's December assessment noted that theUnited States has approxima tely 100,000 ventilators, with three-quarters of them in use on any given day. 57According to HHS, a severe influenza pandemic like the one in 1918 would require 750,000 ventilators to treat victims.58 Current appropriations for 2006 provide $162 million to increase the supplies that would be needed in a pandemic. Those purchases would be added to the Strategic National Stockpile. Among the supplies stockpiled are 1.2 million N95 respirator masks (with 103.7 million due to be deliver ed by September 2007), 5,000 hospital beds, and 4,000 ventilators (with an additional 486 expected by July 2006). Even with those additions to the national stockpile, the available supplies would be less than what would be necessary to meet the demands of a severe pandemic.Closing the gap would be costly. According to the Center for Biosecurity, a severe pandemic would require a bout $5 billion in hospital spending which translates into a $1 million investment for an average hospital for activities such as the development of plans and training and for personal protective equipment 55.

A simple analytical approach is to balance the cost of current preparedness against the discounted avoidable cost associated with a futur e influenza pandemic, taking account of its uncertainty. Paying the full costs for complete preparation today may not be a sound investment, but paying some of th e costs is prudent, and learning more about pandemic viruses in general and t he H5N1 virus in particular will help inform policymakers' decisions. 59.
