We generated a list of websites by searching Google using the term \"vitamin infusion\" and selected cities with 250,000 citizens from each analyzed country. All search inputs were performed using the native language. Data on the features of services, indications, contraindications, offered parenteral supplements, and social media activity were obtained. We analyzed 317 websites representing 371 active facilities. Only 6 (1.9%) facilities cited the scientific sources on parenteral supplementation, but these reference were highly biased; 17.4% did not provide information regarding their personnel, while 11.9% indicated the different contraindications. The most common indications were fatigue (62.5%), immunity enhancement (58.0%), anti-aging, and physical activity (51.5%). Approximately, 11.6% of facilities claimed that some parenteral supplements can help manage certain malignancies, while 2.2% claimed that they can help manage fertility problems. The most offered intravenous supplements were vitamins C (57.4%), B12 (47.7%), and B6 (42.3%). The parenteral supplementation market offers numerous ingredients as treatment for general health problems and serious health conditions. Many analyzed websites lacked essential information, which creates concerns for regarding the quality and reliability of the services.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-11-25", "cleaned_text": "Characteristics of Websites Presenting Parenteral Supplementation Services in Five European Countries: A Cross-Sectional we used the term \"parenteral supplementation\" [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-03614)]. Firstly, most of the ingredients used in the \"cocktails\" are typical constituents of popular dietary supplements, e.g., minerals, vitamins. Secondly, the mixtures can be provided intravenously as well as subcutaneously. Finally, the companies claim that the intravenous/subcutaneous form of supplementation offers unique advantages over the oral intake [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-03614), [3](#B3-nutrients-12-03614)]. The effects of such interventions were poorly investigated; to date, no study has provided high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of parental supplementation [ [4](#B4-nutrients-12-03614), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-03614)]. At the end of 2019, the NHS medical director warned the public of the potential dangers of these infusions [ [6](#B6-nutrients-12-03614)]. However, it did not stop companies or celebrities from promoting vitamin intravenous infusions as a panacea [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-03614), [7](#B7-nutrients-12-03614)]. Despite the intensive promotion of parenteral supplementation, the phenomenon remains under-researched [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-03614)]. The medical, psychological, and legal aspects of commercial infusions are poorly investigated. Most of the reports, also describing fatalities after the administration of supplement drips, were anecdotal and based on journal investigations [ [8](#B8-nutrients-12-03614), [9](#B9-nutrients-12-03614)]. The scientific reports and recommendations mainly concern the potential efficacy of the intervention using certain substances [ [10](#B10-nutrients-12-03614), [11](#B11-nutrients-12-03614)] or safety of the drips, in general [ [12](#B12-nutrients-12-03614)]. Recently, we published the results of a cross-sectional survey study on the experience of Polish individuals using parenteral supplementation services [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-03614)]. Most of the respondents used parenteral supplementation to boost their immunity and endurance or deal with fatigue. In most cases, the overall experience with the infusions was described as \"good\" or \"very good\". However, the study group was limited to only 17 individuals. [13](#B13-nutrients-12-03614)]. The most popular source of e-data on health issues are search engine statistics, social media [ [14](#B14-nutrients-12-03614)], e-forums [ [15](#B15-nutrients-12-03614)], and websites [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-03614)]. The interest of Google users in various dietary supplements has increased in the last years [ [17](#B17-nutrients-12-03614)]. Several researchers previously investigated the branches of complementary medicine by identifying websites that provide information on alternative treatments [ [18](#B18-nutrients-12-03614), [19](#B19-nutrients-12-03614), [20](#B20-nutrients-12-03614), [21](#B21-nutrients-12-03614)]. To date, no study focused on companies offering parenteral supplementation services. There is no systematic report on a variety of indications of parenteral supplementation as well as ingredients used in cocktails. We hypothesized that careful analysis of the content of the websites representing facilities offering parenteral supplementation might help understand this branch of complementary medicine. The acquired knowledge may pave the way for further research on this new public health phenomenon. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Collection [22](#B22-nutrients-12-03614)]. The cities with at least 250,000 citizens represent urban centers sizes from L to Global city according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and European Commission definitions [ [23](#B23-nutrients-12-03614)]. Finally, we included 3 cities from Czechia (Brno, Ostrava, and Prague), 1 from Ireland (Dublin), 12 from Italy (Bari, Bologna, Catania, Florence, Bologna, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Turin, Venice, 29 from the United Kingdom (Belfast, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Islington, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Luton, Manchester, Newport, Nottingham, Plymouth, Preston, Reading, Sheffield, Southend-on-Sea, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, and Wolverhampton). These countries were chosen arbitrarily: We wanted to include European countries only, but the research team had limited language skills. To our best knowledge, no study focused on companies offering parenteral services in these countries. [Figure S1](#app1-nutrients-12-03614). [Table S1](#app1-nutrients-12-03614). The final version of the form was used to subsequently collect the data from all links generated by Google (including websites used previously for the preparation of the initial and final versions of the form). The final form included data on the general characteristics of the facilities (country, link to the website, name of the company, affiliation to the commercial network, address, phone number, and email), social media activity (information on ratings on Google maps, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter profiles), a feature of the services (experience, information on initial visits, laboratory investigations, location where the service can be performed, and citations of scientific researches), staff, indications and contraindications for parenteral supplementation, offered ingredients, and other services. In this study, the term \"indications\" referred to the recommendations provided in the websites for parenteral supplementations (both single and multi-ingredient) for different conditions as supportive and/or curative treatment. In the study, we presented other services offered in at least 5% of facilities in at least one country. One website provided information on a chain of facilities. For this reason, we multiplied the record by the number of facilities represented by a website and changed the details of the facilities affiliated to the chains that were different such as address or services offered. 2.2. Data Analysis [Supplementary Materials](#app1-nutrients-12-03614). 3. Results 3.1. Number of Facilities [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-03614-f001)). The highest number of facilities per 100,000 citizens were observed in Katowice (Poland) (3.06 facilities/100,000 citizens), Gdask (Poland) (2.57 facilities/100,000 citizens), and Leeds (the United Kingdom) (2.42 facilities/100,000 citizens). Considering the total population of the included towns, the highest number of facilities was reported in Czechia (1.62 facilities/100,000 citizens), followed by the United Kingdom (1.46 facilities/100,000 citizens), Ireland (1.37 facilities/100,000 citizens), Poland (1.35 facilities/100,000 citizens), and Italy (0.72 facilities/100,000 citizens). 3.2. Social Media [Table 1](#nutrients-12-03614-t001). In Czechia, Ireland, and Italy, more than 20% of facilities were affiliated to a commercial chain; in Poland and the United Kingdom, more than 40% were affiliated to a commercial chain. Overall, parenteral supplementation companies obtained a good consumer rating on Google maps with a median between 4 and 5. The analyzed facilities were active on different social media platforms, mostly in Facebook, followed by Instagram and Twitter. 3.3. Features, Staff, and Scientific Information [Table 2](#nutrients-12-03614-t002). Overall, 6 (1.9%) of all facilities support the use of parenteral supplementation by citing scientific evidence on their websites. In one Polish website, in the section describing offered ingredients, several books related to the use of glutathione [ [24](#B24-nutrients-12-03614), [25](#B25-nutrients-12-03614), [26](#B26-nutrients-12-03614)] and review on reactive oxygen species were cited [ [27](#B27-nutrients-12-03614)]. In the second Polish website, in the \"Scientific research\" section (pl. \"Badania naukowe\"), the following references were cited: \"Publications available on the website: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)and on related to parenteral supplementation can be found after typing the names of physicians working in the facility. One facility from Dublin provided links to 22 abstracts from Medline on vitamin C. Among them, there were clinical studies investigating the effects of intravenous vitamin C on the quality of life of individuals with malignancy [ [28](#B28-nutrients-12-03614), [29](#B29-nutrients-12-03614)], cancer markers [ [30](#B30-nutrients-12-03614), [31](#B31-nutrients-12-03614)], sepsis [ [32](#B32-nutrients-12-03614), and C-reactive protein level in hemodialysis patients [ [34](#B34-nutrients-12-03614)]. Most of the other articles were reviews or basic science research. Other websites mostly cited reviews on offered micronutrients and meta-analyses on the effects of zinc lozenges on common cold [ [35](#B35-nutrients-12-03614)]. In two websites from the United Kingdom, we found a reference regarding \"Myers' cocktail\" [ [36](#B36-nutrients-12-03614)]. In one case, the scientific section was inaccessible during the preparation of our manuscript (July 2020), and no citation was found. The substantial number (17.4%) of companies did not provide information regarding their personnel. 3.4. Indications and Contraindications [Table 3](#nutrients-12-03614-t003)). Less than one of the eight companies provided information on contraindications to the procedure; among them, the most commonly described were hypersensitivity, pregnancy, and renal insufficiency ( Supplementation [Table 4](#nutrients-12-03614-t004)). Among intravenously administered supplements, the most commonly offered were vitamin C (57.4%), vitamin B12 supplementation was and the United Kingdom. [Table S2](#app1-nutrients-12-03614). Parenteral supplementation was recommended as treatment for fertility problems in five facilities in Poland and in three facilities in the United Kingdom ( [Table S2](#app1-nutrients-12-03614)). The other services offered in the analyzed facilities are presented in [Table S3](#app1-nutrients-12-03614). Interestingly, the parenteral supplementation and beauty salon services were commonly provided by the same companies. 4. Discussion 4.1. Main Findings [37](#B37-nutrients-12-03614), [38](#B38-nutrients-12-03614), [39](#B39-nutrients-12-03614)]. Interestingly, the reviews on Google maps profile were generally positive, which may suggest that consumers had a positive experience with the facilities. However, personal belief and subjective response to vitamin infusions require further research [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-03614)]. The social media profiles of the facilities offering parenteral supplementation might be a good platform to reach the consumers. [4](#B4-nutrients-12-03614), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-03614)]. A minority of the companies defend their standby citing scientific researches. Most of the references cited popular science books or non-systematic reviews. However, these references lacked the use of a placebo group as a comparator or did not indicate strong clinical outcomes. Interestingly, one webpage cited articles regarding the feasibility of intravenous vitamin C for sepsis\u2014a condition that cannot be treated in ambulatory settings such as vitamin infusion facilities. None of the articles reported parenteral supplementation for common indications such as fatigue, physical endurance, or immunity enhancement. [40](#B40-nutrients-12-03614)]. Indeed, most of the recommended indications were general health problems. In such settings, the placebo effect tends to be more perceptible [ [40](#B40-nutrients-12-03614)]. The promotion via social media and positive comments or good ratings may support the enhanced placebo effects through social proof phenomenon [ [41](#B41-nutrients-12-03614)]. The consumers may perceive that many others were satisfied by the service. For these reasons, parenteral supplement consumers may experience health improvements. Positive attitude and the desire to improve health are essential even for individuals with malignancy [ [42](#B42-nutrients-12-03614)]. However, whether personal funds should be spent on an evidence-based intervention that is not gaining the placebo effect due to the use of vitamin intravenous infusions needs to be explored further. Another concern is the number of consumers that discontinued conventional treatment as they were persuaded by alternative medicine enthusiasts who shared their positive experience after receiving the supplements. [17](#B17-nutrients-12-03614)]. Many of the searched ingredients are used in hospital settings such as electrolytes, vitamin B complex, or glucose. Probably, many of the intravenous formulas used in facilities providing parenteral supplementation were purchased from companies that produce them for clinical practice. Performing a detailed analysis of the ingredients allowed in each country is beyond the scope of this study. However, the very concern is offering solutions that are not commonly used by clinicians. Further studies should focus on the source of parenteral supplements that are not also used in conventional medicine. 4.2. Limitations 5.
