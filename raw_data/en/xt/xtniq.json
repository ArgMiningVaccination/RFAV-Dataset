Pain in knee is a common condition that affects people of all ages. According to a study published on Research Gate, the overall prevalence of knee pain in the population is approximately 19%. The severity of the pain varies depending on the cause. Knee pain can be accompanied by stiffness and swelling, redness and warmth around the joint, weakness or instability, popping or crunching noises or the inability to fully straighten the knee Causes of Knee Pain Knee pain can be caused due to a sudden injury, overuse or by an underlying condition. Let's look at some of the knee pain causes: - Ligament Tear:Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect the bones in our body. There are four ligaments in the knee that are prone to injury. Such injuries are more common among athletes or those with a high degree of physical activity in their routines. The pain in the knee area is often sudden and severe, followed by knee joint swelling in the first 24 hours after the injury. One may feel looseness in the joint and experience an inability to put weight on the joint without pain. It requires immediate medical attention. - Osteoarthritis: Also known as degenerative or wear and tear arthritis, osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It refers to the condition where the cartilage in your knee deteriorates with age and use. It can cause stiff joints and knee pain in the morning. It is a common cause of knee pain after the age of 50. According to Deccan Chronicle, India may become the osteoarthritis capital of the world with over 60 million cases by 2025. - Rheumatoid Arthritis:It is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy tissues in our joints. It generally affects the joints in hands and feet, but it can also affect the knees. It causes pain, stiffness and swelling in joints that can get in the way of everyday life. Untreated rheumatoid arthritis can cause long-term and progressive inflammation that can eventually lead to joint damage. - Gout:This is a painful form of inflammatory arthritis that occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the joint. This acid forms sharp crystals that cause sudden bouts of swelling, pain and tenderness. While gout most commonly causes pain in joint of big toe, it can also occur in the knee. - Infection of the Knee Joint:When bacteria contaminate the synovial fluid that lubricates the knee joint, it can result in an infection called a septic joint. Knee infections sometimes occur as a complication of surgery, inflammation or due to other reasons.
