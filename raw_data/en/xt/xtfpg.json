Recent introduction of pharmaceutical cocrystals in regulatory guidelines of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made them one of the potential alternatives when salt preparation is not feasible. Apart from generally regarded as safe (GRAS) coformers, drugdrug and drugnutraceutical cocrystals are recent additions to pharmaceutical cocrystal family that have additional health benefits. Indeed, preparation of salt forms is a routine practice to deal with inadequacies associated with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and happens to be a potentially reliable method. Amongst them, drug-drug and drug-nutraceutical cocrystals have drawn significant importance in the recent past as they reduce drug load and cost effects during multiple disease diagnosis. However, one has to be prudent in the selection of drug molecules, the presence of complementary hydrogen bond synthon, disease management during multiple disease therapy, etc. that play important roles in their preparation. That is the reason why drug-drug cocrystals are scarce in the literature compared to pharmaceutical cocrystals containing GRAS coformers and salt forms. Herein, we discuss case studies preferably the reported drugdrug, drugnutraceutical cocrystals, and a few salts with an emphasis on their role in physicochemical property modulation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-02-18", "cleaned_text": "Therapy: A Crystal Engineering Approach [https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst8020101](https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst8020101) [Novel Pharmaceutical Introduction [1](#B1-crystals-08-00101), [2](#B2-crystals-08-00101)]. The subject crystal engineering has brought us an opportunity to overcome these issues by translating the idea of new pre-formulations of existing drugs based on intermolecular interactions. Novel formulation with improved pharmacological properties has a vital necessity in this context because most drug molecules have more or less inadequacies relating to their pharmacokinetic and physiological properties such as solubility, dissolution, hygroscopicity, imperative factors that essentially define the overall efficacy of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). One survey says that nearly 80% drugs are in solid formulations and absorbed via passive diffusion from the gastrointestinal tract [ [24](#B24-crystals-08-00101)]. Among them, over 40% of drugs that appear on the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Drug List are known to be insoluble or poorly water-soluble, based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) [ [3](#B3-crystals-08-00101), [25](#B25-crystals-08-00101)]. Preparation of salt formulation made a drug more bio-available; however, more than 50% of drug molecules lack an ionisable group which can make salt formation likely impossible. From these facts, it is essential to develop a new solid state formulation with trusted properties. The brilliancy of the subject of crystal engineering is that it provides a wide-range of possibilities to engineer and/or design various crystalline solid state formulations of a drug that can carry the tailored biopharmaceutical properties\u2014for example polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, cocrystal, etc. They have been demonstrated as alternatives and can easily minimize major obstacles in successfully commercializing the compounds. Among them, cocrystal synthesis is relatively modern technology to modulate drug biopharmaceutical properties, in particular to treat drug resistance issues [ [26](#B26-crystals-08-00101), [27](#B27-crystals-08-00101), [28](#B28-crystals-08-00101), [29](#B29-crystals-08-00101)]. Fortuitously, the importance of cocrystal preparation has recently been realized in the pharmaceutical industry and many of them have started practicing in order to modify an existing API for coveted attributes. This scope continues to develop a new formulation to enhance and/or control bioavailability and essentially the efficacy of a drug. A pharmaceutical cocrystal generally incorporates API with a pharmaceutically-acceptable molecule (cocrystal former or CCF) in their crystal lattice without any structural modification of the parent drug are chosen from the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list prepared by USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which comprises over 3000 substances [ [36](#B36-crystals-08-00101), [37](#B37-crystals-08-00101), [38](#B38-crystals-08-00101), [39](#B39-crystals-08-00101)]. Food additives, preservatives, excipients, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, bio-molecules, and their APIs can be selected as CCF. They are commonly prepared by a variety of techniques such as melt crystallization, grinding, and recrystallization from solvents etc. Thus, pharmaceutical cocrystal stands here as an alternate and interesting pathway to improve efficacy of a drug. [27](#B27-crystals-08-00101), [28](#B28-crystals-08-00101), [29](#B29-crystals-08-00101), [30](#B30-crystals-08-00101), [31](#B31-crystals-08-00101), [32](#B32-crystals-08-00101)]. A typical CCF another drug or a nutraceutical, the resultant cocrystal is known as drug-drug and drug-nutraceutical cocrystal and they are now comprehended as alternate drugs for enhancing well-being. Down the line, we have discussed several examples from the context of pharmaceutical cocrystals that led to significant improvement in drug properties. Entresto is one of the classic examples to receive approval as a new active substance. It is a fixed-dose combination product presented as film-coated tablets containing and valsartan as active substances as a trisodium hemipentahydrate co-crystal. Generally, three strengths are proposed containing 24.3 mg sacubitril and 25.7 mg valsartan (low dose), 48.6 mg sacubitril and 51.4 mg valsartan (medium dose), and 97.2 mg sacubitril and 102.8 mg valsartan (high dose) for the treatment of chronic heart failure [ [40](#B40-crystals-08-00101)]. In 2009, Lexapro\u2014which is an approved cocrystal/salt of Escitalopram and oxalic acid\u2014was mainly used for the treatment of major depressive and anxiety disorders [ [41](#B41-crystals-08-00101)]. Though most pharmaceutical cocrystals remain in 1:1 equivalency, the stoichiometric ratio in product cocrystals is an important parameter to address. Our group studied synthesis of variable stoichiometry drug cocrystals that result with different solubilities and cell membrane permeations behaviour in vitro under physiological pH conditions [ [7](#B7-crystals-08-00101)]. In a few other systems, we further examined the essence of molecular symmetry and conformational behavior of drug in presence of supramolecular entities in altering pharmacokinetic properties [ [5](#B5-crystals-08-00101), [8](#B8-crystals-08-00101), [42](#B42-crystals-08-00101)]. From the plethora of publications in the area of pharmaceutical cocrystals, it has been noticed that most pharmaceutical cocrystals were formed between organic acids or bases and the to remain a scope to explore cocrystal engineering approach using inorganic acid as a cocrystal former. [12](#B12-crystals-08-00101)]. They are widely used to generate supersaturated aqueous solutions and improve drug bioavailability. Generation and maintenance of the metastable supersaturated state (makes the drug more bioavailable) as a strategy to improve intestinal absorption of poorly water soluble drugs, there are two essential steps need to be considered and they are termed as 'spring and parachute approach' [ [12](#B12-crystals-08-00101)]. A thermodynamically unstable, supersaturated solution of a drug can only be generated starting from a high energy form of a drug which is known as the \"spring\" ( [Figure 2](#crystals-08-00101-f002)). A combination of excipients like co-solvent, lipid, or polymer based formulations; coformers etc. can deliver the drug in solution as high energy solid forms that can easily provide an accelerated dissolution or a higher apparent solubility. This phenomenon is known as the 'parachute effect'. The apparent solubility is the apparent equilibrium between drug in solution and a solid whose structure is in the high energy state. A high energy form of the drug (the spring) provides the driving force to solubilize the drug at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility level and a similar effect resulted by the combination of excipients (the parachute) by inhibiting or retarding precipitation. Maintaining a supersaturated state for a time period sufficient for absorption may require a temporary inhibition of precipitation through the use of pharmaceutical excipients or by other components that interfere with nucleation and crystal growth. This are the 'parachutes' gained approval for Entresto\u2014a cocrystal comprised of sacubitril, valsartan, heart failure [ [41](#B41-crystals-08-00101), [55](#B55-crystals-08-00101)]. Cafcit, which is a drug product consisting anhydrous caffeine, citric acid monohydrate, and sodium citrate dehydrate is another cocrystal formulation already available in the market [ [56](#B56-crystals-08-00101), [57](#B57-crystals-08-00101), [58](#B58-crystals-08-00101)]. Sodium valproate is another marketed product with a drug-drug co-crystal [ [59](#B59-crystals-08-00101)]. Dimenhydrinate is another widely used drug for the prevention of motion sickness, including nausea and vomiting which is a cocrystal of two drugs\u2014namely, diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline. The antiemetic effect of the drug for prevention of sickness is due to the presence of diphenhydramine, but associated with the side effect of drowsiness. This cocrystal of dimenhydrinate overcomes side effects as it contains an additional stimulant, 8-chlorotheophylline [ [60](#B60-crystals-08-00101)]. The recent approval of a pharmaceutical cocrystals has attracted additional interest from the pharmaceutical industry as materials for drug formulation. Thus novelty, non-obviousness, and usefulness can make cocrystals patentable from the perspective of intellectual property as well as drug formulation. A novel cocrystal formulation can emerge as viable alternative to the traditional drugs in near future. The patent portfolios of cocrystals as drug substance not drug product infer enhancement of existing commercial value of the product. The FDA perhaps issued revised guidance to technically distinguish between salts and cocrystals based on the ionization of the components. Essentially, it abandons the position that cocrystals are drug product intermediates. Cocrystals are therefore adapted as a special case of solvates, in which the second component is nonvolatile and refers to a conformer, rather than as synthons into homosynthons based on a great opportunity to design pharmaceutical cocrystals. Moreover, the role of molecular arrangement in the crystal lattice which is controlled by intermolecular interactions not only by hydrogen bonds\u2014but also halogen bonds, - interactions [ [62](#B62-crystals-08-00101)], van der Waals interactions, metal-coordination bonding, etc.\u2014on modifying properties of a solid will decide the location of the transferable proton within the continuum. It has been observed that when the pKa is more than 3.75, maximum probability of the proton will reside on the base and the resultant material is a salt, which is an essential criterion while selecting the appropriate counter ions to the preparation of salts of API in order to improve its properties like solubility. Similarly, a neutral cocrystal is expected when the pKa difference is less than 0. The proton will have an intermediate H bond character when the transition range falls between 0 and 3.75. This intermediate situation may lead to salt as well as cocrystal. A linear relationship between pKa and the probability of proton transfer between acid-base pairs was also derived by Aurora from a CSD study of nearly 6500 crystalline complexes. The pKa rule was validated when pKa is between 1 and +4 ( [Scheme 1](#crystals-08-00101-sch001)b) [ [67](#B67-crystals-08-00101)]. The pKa rule of thumb to predict the proton location in a continuum is depicted in [Scheme 1](#crystals-08-00101-sch001)a. The other scale of pKHB which measures the free energy of hydrogen bonded complex (1.364 pKHB = GHB in kcal mol1) also determines the hydrogen bond pairing that could be an appropriate scale compared to pKa values [ [72](#B72-crystals-08-00101)]. The pKHB values are sensitive to etc.\u2014that can Cocrystal 2.1.1. Aspirin Cocrystals [73](#B73-crystals-08-00101)] prepared a 1:1 sildenafil-acetylsalicylic commonly known as aspirin) cocrystal and a 1:1:1 cocrystal salt involving sildenafil cation, acetylsalicylate and salicylic acid. Sildenafil is an active component of the blockbuster drug Viagra\u00ae used for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. Solution crystallization resulted the 1:1 cocrystal along with accidental discovery of the 1:1:1 cocrystal salt. The 1:1 acetylsalicylic acid based cocrystal exhibits 75% improved dissolution rate compared to sildenafil active ingredient of Viagra\u00ae) ( [Figure 3](#crystals-08-00101-f003)). [74](#B74-crystals-08-00101)]. The crystal structure contains a (8) ring motif connecting aspirin and meloxicam molecule as shown in [Figure 4](#crystals-08-00101-f004). The resulting cocrystal exhibits superior kinetic solubility and potentiality to significantly decrease the time required to reach the human therapeutic concentration compared with the parent drug, meloxicam. 2.1.2. Anti-Tuberculosis (Pyz), and 4-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). They were successful in preparing two drug-drug cocrystals\u2014namely, 1:1 molecular complex of INH and PAS; and a monohydrate of 1:1 complex of Pyz and PAS\u2014using liquid assisted grinding as well as solution crystallization. They observed that both the cocrystal system contains the most stable COOH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Npyridine hydrogen bond synthon. In case of INH-PAS cocrystal there are two symmetry independent COOH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Npyridine hydrogen bond present; one with H atom located on the carboxylic group indicative of pure cocrystal, whereas the second one shows a partial proton transfer. 3D crystal packing of INH-PAS cocrystal is shown in [Figure 5](#crystals-08-00101-f005). The two symmetry independent COOH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Npyridine hydrogen bond synthon present in INH-PAS cocrystal is shown in [Figure 6](#crystals-08-00101-f006). On the other hand, crystallizing Pyz with PAS in 1:1 ratio in methanol resulted a monohydrate of Pyz-PAS cocrystal. Various hydrogen bond synthon present in the cocrystal hydrate is shown in [Figure 7](#crystals-08-00101-f007). The water molecule actively takes part in the hydrogen bond connecting the Pyz and PAS molecules in a tetrahedral environment and acts simultaneously as two hydrogen bond donors and two hydrogen bond acceptors. Due to drug resistant TB, multidrug therapy is practiced during treatment of TB. Therefore, cocrystal of PAS with INH and Pyz may be a useful formulation for the treatment of tuberculosis. [76](#B76-crystals-08-00101)] recently designed a drug-bridged-drug ternary cocrystallization strategy to prepare a combination drug utilizing a GRAS coformer fumaric acid to connect a Pyz and INH molecule as shown in [Figure 8](#crystals-08-00101-f008). This is the first ternary dual-drug cocrystal reported in the literature. They highlighted that the ternary cocrystal drug exhibited optimized formulation capacity and in 2.1.3. bicalutamide (Bic), with salicylamide (2OHBZA) using liquid assisted grinding, slurry sonication as well as solution crystallization. Structural analysis showed that two units of each bicalutamide and salicylamide together form two ring synthon motifs with graph set notation\u2014(12) and (10)\u2014as shown in [Figure 9](#crystals-08-00101-f009). From the dissolution profile ( [Figure 10](#crystals-08-00101-f010)), it observed that cocrystal Bic with benzamide (BZA) and salicylamide have higher dissolution demonstrating a 'spring and parachute' behavior compared to the pure drug bicalutamide. 2.1.4. Caffeine Cocrystal System [78](#B78-crystals-08-00101)] prepared cocrystals of caffeine with various substituted hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives and studied their synthon preference. Among them, salicylic (2HBA) and gentisic acid (25DHBA) are two coformers of pharmaceutical importance. Cocrystals were discovered using solution mediated phase transformation and showed three different prepared using freeze-drying. They proposed that formation of cocrystal proceed via an amorphous phase that is generated as solvent sublimes during the freeze-drying process. Also, they studied the relative stability of the two polymorphic forms and solid-solution phase obtained during freeze-drying and is in the order Form I > Form II > solid-solution, based on theoretical calculation and thermodynamic study. Local arrangement of hydrogen bonded dimers of caffeine and theophylline in the two polymorphic forms are shown in [Figure 13](#crystals-08-00101-f013). [81](#B81-crystals-08-00101)] two multidrug cocrystals of sulfacetamide with caffeine and theophylline along with a few other coformers. Both the cocrystals crystallized in 1:1 sulfacetamide and molecule as shown in [Figure 14](#crystals-08-00101-f014). Solubility and intrinsic dissolution profile shows that the cocrystals have lower solubility as well as dissolution compared to the pure drug sulfacetamide ( [Figure 15](#crystals-08-00101-f015)). [82](#B82-crystals-08-00101)] a cocrystal of is known as an aldose reductase inhibitor for treatment in diabetic neuropathy. The cocrystal showed layered structure that was predicted to be responsible for the higher solubility and dissolution rate X-ray diffraction (PXRD) structure solution. PXRD data shows a clear formation of cocrystal during ball mill grinding. Crystal structure analysis shows a heterodimer formation between the carboxylic acid group of indomethacin and amide group of carbamazepine molecule as shown cocrystal of (PAS) two cocrystal solvates in 2:1:1 ratio of CBZ, PAS and solvent (water and methanol) respectively. From structural analysis it was observed that 1:1 cocrystal of CBZ and PAS contain acid-amide heterosynthon; of solvent molecule results trimeric and tetrameric synthon incorporating solvent molecules water and methanol respectively as shown in [Figure 18](#crystals-08-00101-f018). From dissolution study, it was observed that cocrystallization of CBZ with PAS decreased the rate of hydrate formation, resulting in a 1.5 times increase in solubility of CBZ. 2.1.6. dapsone. Dapsone is a generic drug used for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, Kaposi's sarcoma, dermatoses, and AIDS-related pneumonia. Due to the presence of NH2 and SO2 groups, it can form intermolecular hydrogen bond with various coformers. They were able to prepare cocrystals Hydrogen bond cocrystal is shown in [Figure 19](#crystals-08-00101-f019). (GA) both are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used mainly in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of mild to moderate pain. During cocrystallization, they obtained three polymorphic forms listed in [Table 1](#crystals-08-00101-t001). [Figure 20](#crystals-08-00101-f020)). The second symmetry independent GA molecule connects using O-HO hydrogen bond between COOH and 5-OH groups resulting a zipper-like structure. [Figure 21](#crystals-08-00101-f021)a). In form III, the acid-amide heterosynthon between the EA and GA molecules are further connected via O-HO hydrogen bond forming a tetrameric motif as shown in [Figure 21](#crystals-08-00101-f021)b. Dissolution study shows an enhancement in dissolution rate compared to pure drug EA ( [Figure 22](#crystals-08-00101-f022)). Among the three polymorphic forms, metastable polymorphs (form II and form III) have better dissolution compared to form I. 2.1.8. Flufenamic Acid Cocrystals acid and EA are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas CNB is used as a novel potential therapy for immunodeficiency deceases such as an anti-viral and anti-cancer agent. Structural analysis reveals that FFA form acid-acid homosynthon during cocrystallization with CNB, whereas acid-amide heterosynthon was observed in case of FFA-EA two other 2-pyridone and 4,4-pyridine. The crystal structure contains theophylline dimer between the saturated N of the imidazole ring and one of the carbonyl group forming N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bond. Another O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond involving the carboxylic acid group of FFA and unsaturated N of the imidazole group of theophylline resulting in a four component supramolecular unit as shown in [Figure 24](#crystals-08-00101-f024)a. The resultant cocrystal shows a better compared to FFA ( [Figure 24](#crystals-08-00101-f024)b). The hygroscopic stability was also found to be improved during cocrystallization. [89](#B89-crystals-08-00101)] prepared two cocrystals of theophylline with halogen containing APIs named diflunisal and diclofenac having similar hydrogen few pharmaceutical cocrystals. Furosemide (Lasix) is a loop diuretic drug commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and edema. It is a BCS class IV drug with low solubility (6 mg/L in water) and low permeability (logPow 1.4); whereas caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant and one of the most widely consumed psychoactive drugs. On cocrystallizing furosemide-caffeine 1:1 mixture from a MeOH-MeCN solvent mixture resulted cocrystal of the same in 1:1 stoichiometry. The most acidic COOH group of furosemide forms an O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond with imidazole N of caffeine ( [Figure 26](#crystals-08-00101-f026)a). The primary sulfonamide NH donor hydrogen different caffeine C=O acceptor groups ( [Figure 26](#crystals-08-00101-f026)b) and the secondary NH is bonded to the sulfonyl loop furosemide. gefitinib salt hydrate. Carboxylic acid proton of furosemide is transferred to the morpholine ring N of gefitinib molecule. Both APIs interact with each other through strong N-HO hydrogen bond engaging the morpholine group of gefitinib and The order of gefitinib > gefitinib-furosemide salt hydrate > furosemide. Intermediate solubility of molecular salt is due to a stronger hydrogen-bonding synthon, better crystal density, compact crystal packing, and a stable crystal lattice. 2.1.11. Gliclazide-Metformin Salt [92](#B92-crystals-08-00101)] a multidrug crystal of antidiabetic drug gliclazide (GLI) and metformin (MET). Combining these two non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) drug, they have prepared a salt that is more soluble and have higher dissolution rate compared to GLI; and less hygroscopic compared to MET. The crystal structure contains one molecule of each GLI and MET in the asymmetric unit ( [Figure 28](#crystals-08-00101-f028)). A proton from the amide group adjacent to sulfur atom of GLI is transfer to the MET resulting a salt structure. The MET molecules formed a centrosymmetric dimer structure through two NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds. MET also interacted with three molecules of GLI via relatively strong hydrogen bonds, forming a 1D chain along the a-axis ( [Figure 29](#crystals-08-00101-f029)). The hydrophilic MET molecules are sandwiched by hydrophobic GLI molecules, making the salt structure more stable towards hydration. [Figure 30](#crystals-08-00101-f030)) enhanced physicochemical property of the drug-drug salt compared to the pure components GLI and MET. 2.1.12. Hydrochlorothiazide Cocrystal [93](#B93-crystals-08-00101)] a few cocrystals their solubility and membrane diffusivity. During their study, isoniazid an anti-tuberculosis drug was used as a coformer with diuretic drug HCT resulting a cocrystal hydrate in the ratio 1:1:1. Crystal structure contains both sulfonamide dimer as well as amide dimer synthon as shown in [Figure 31](#crystals-08-00101-f031). In addition the cocrystal structure is stabilized by water with N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and bond. lamivudine and zidovudine. A combination of these two drugs is marketed as a physical mixture with trade name Combivir. On crystallizing the two drug in 1:1 stoichiometry from ethanol resulted a hydrated cocrystal in space group P21 containing a trimeric synthon. The crystal structure contains N-HO and O-HO hydrogen between lamivudine and zidovudine molecule along with a water of crystallization resulting a 1D chain motif as shown in [Figure 32](#crystals-08-00101-f032). According to their claim, this cocrystal can be a better drug formulation compared to the exiting physical mixture Combivir. 2.1.14. Myricetin-Piracetam and piracetam using both solvent drop grinding as well as solution crystallization. They found that the piracetam adopt an uncommon conformation not obtained earlier in any of the reported cocrystals. The crystal structure contains N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bond between the amide group of piracetam and hydroxyl group of myricetin, resulting in an infinite chain as shown in [Figure 33](#crystals-08-00101-f033). The resulting cocrystal is stable up to 200 2.1.15. Norfloxacin-Sulfathiazole Salt Hydrate [96](#B96-crystals-08-00101)] antibacterial norfloxacin (NF) and an antimicrobial sulfathiazole (ST) using mechanical grinding. Based on the position of acidic proton of ST the resultant multicomponent solid was confirmed to be a salt hydrate containing a disordered water molecule. From the crystal structure, it was observed that a heterodimer is formed between NF and ST through a proton transfer from the N-H group of ST to the piperazine group of NF. This dimer is further connected via N-HO hydrogen bond between amino group of ST and carboxyl group of NF resulting a sheet-like structure. Successive sheets make channels occupied by disordered water molecules (sustained by OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O showed enhanced solubility in different pH buffer and improved diffusion rate ( [Figure 35](#crystals-08-00101-f035)). [97](#B97-crystals-08-00101)] prepared two and sulfanilamide using whereas comparable solubility with that of ST crystals. 2.1.16. Oxaprozin-Salbutamol Salt [98](#B98-crystals-08-00101)] (4,5-diphenyl-2-2 oxazole propionic acid) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). OXP has been therapeutically used in inflammatory and painful diseases of rheumatic and nonrheumatic origin, whereas salbutamol (SAL) is an antiasthmatic drug used in the treatment of respiratory disease. In the crystal structure, carboxylic acid proton of OXP is transferred to the secondary amine group of SAL. A four-component supramolecular unit containing a tetrameric synthon of O-HO and bond along b-axis ( [Figure 37](#crystals-08-00101-f037)). These ladders are interconnected to each other via C-HO and interaction. Surprisingly, this particular salt has a lower solubility and dissolution rate compared to pure SAL and can be a potential formulation for sustained release alternative of pure SAL. 2.1.17. Paracetamol Cocrystal System [22](#B22-crystals-08-00101)] carried out mechanical property study of a few cocrystals of acetaminophen\u2014more commonly known as paracetamol (pca)\u2014with various coformers including a few drug molecules namely caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, etc. Cocrystals having layered structures such as paracetamol-theophylline (pca)(thp) showed better tabletability compared to the existing paracetamol polymorphs (form I and II) ( [Figure 38](#crystals-08-00101-f038)). In another report, Lin Lee and Tu Lee [ [99](#B99-crystals-08-00101)] prepared caffeine-paracetamol cocrystal by taking p-aminophenol, acetic anhydride, and caffeine on the basis of three component one-pot chemical reaction. 2.1.18. Pyrazinamide-Diflunisal neat, liquid-assisted grinding and annealing at 80 \u00b0C. Although they were unsuccessful to prepare single crystal, however using spectroscopic and theoretical calculation established the formation of acid-pyridine synthon between diflunisal and pyrazinamide molecule ( [Figure 39](#crystals-08-00101-f039)). This particular cocrystal can be used as a combination drug, as pure pyrazinamide has side effects. Moreover, it improves aqueous solubility of diflunisal. 2.1.19. Pyrimethamine-Drug Cocrystals [101](#B101-crystals-08-00101)] carried out bond propensity calculation (HBPC) in order to predict cocrystal/ salt formation considering pyrimethamine as a model compound. They used various drug and GRAS compounds\u2014namely carbamazepine, theophylline, l-isoleucine. HBPC is useful tool which perform a statistical analysis of the occurrence of hydrogen bonds of the relevant structures present in CSD in order to predict cocrystal/ salt formation. The outcome of their analysis can be summarized in [Scheme theophylline and studied their mechanical properties. Among them theophylline-acetazolamide is a drug-drug cocrystal. In the crystal structure, two molecules of each acetazolamide and theophylline form dimers via respective homosynthons. The are further linked with theophylline dimers via N-HO hydrogen bond forming a tape. They are further connected by N-HO and C-HN interactions resulting interlocked 3D network structure 41](#crystals-08-00101-f041)a). Due to 3D interlocked structure, theophylline-acetazolamide cocrystal in nature and D3 (VD3) to improve chemical instability using crystal engineering approach. The two polymorphs, form A (column shaped) and B (plate shaped), were obtained from evaporative crystallization using acetonitrile as solvent. Cocrystal was designed based on hydrogen bond donor-acceptor similarity and to accommodate structural complementarities, selecting -VD2 and -VD3 form as starting materials ( [Figure 42](#crystals-08-00101-f042)). From structural analysis, it was observed that both the two polymorphs (A and B) have similar hydrogen bond chain structure connecting VD2 and VD3 alternatively in a head-to-head fashion. The only difference between the two structure is overall 3D crystal packing; in form A adjacent polymeric chains are slipped parallel to each other, whereas in form B they are columnar in nature ( [Figure 43](#crystals-08-00101-f043)). They have further studied the chemical stability of the two polymorphic cocrystals of VD2 and VD3 stored at 23 \u00b0C an illuminance of 5000 lx and 40 \u00b0C/75% RH, and found that form A shows better stability compared to form B and individual compounds ( [Figure 44](#crystals-08-00101-f044)).

Apart from the examples discussed here, numerous pharmaceutical cocrystals and salts were reported in the literature by some renowned groups\u2014namely flavonoids, various acid, pyridoxine, l-ascorbic acid, folic acid, menadione, etc. Hydrogen bonding functional group attached to all these molecules facilitates formation of cocrystal with drug molecules resulting pharmaceutical cocrystal. Lawrence and coworkers in a recent review [ [133](#B133-crystals-08-00101)] discuss cocrystallization of nutraceuticals as coformers, taking into account physicochemical property modification during drug development. In another review, Caira [ [134](#B134-crystals-08-00101)] discusses sulfa drugs as novel cocrystal former during combination therapy, considering their antibacterial and antimicrobial activity. [Figure 45](#crystals-08-00101-f045)) enhancement. vanilic acid, and caffeic acid during cocrystallization with isoniazid. The summary of their result is QUECAFMeOH are 14 and 8 times greater whereas QUETBR have slightly enhanced solubility compared to quercetin dihydrate. Dissolution profile of all the cocrystals along with quercetin dihydrate are shown in [Figure 48](#crystals-08-00101-f048). 3. Future Prospects [142](#B142-crystals-08-00101)] in Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery, 2006, preparation of multidrug formulation is \"a cost centred, not a profit centred\" process. Also, they can be used only for a specific set of patients with specific sets of multiple disorders but may not be useful for patients having single ailment; therefore, the importance of drug-drug cocrystal is still debatable. It is needless to mention that preparation of salt formation of a drug containing ionisable sites continues with the objective of improving drug properties rather than cocrystal preparation. However, when routine screening efforts fail to provide desirable crystalline free forms or salts, a possible cocrystal formation between API and a coformer may furnish an appropriate dosage provided a crystalline solid form of that API is a preferred formulation. The outlook is the recent approval of a pharmaceutical cocrystals by the FDA which will continue to gain substantial interest from the pharmaceutical industry as materials for drug development. As a result, R&D departments of many pharmaceutical companies have initiated a fairly large investment in plenty of clinical trials to probe the potential benefits of various coformers/nutraceutical/drug in their cocrystals. Therefore drug-drug and drug-nutraceutical cocrystals and/or salt pre-formulations approach is to identify a suitable dosage formulation to treat targeted disease or multiple disorders simultaneously. It is certain that with more research in this field and reviews [ [143](#B143-crystals-08-00101)], they will emerge as a viable alternative to traditional drugs in the near future.
