Transfer Credit Policy When students wish to transfer units into a degree program at SDUIS, all units must be from an accredited or approved school and have not been counted towards a completed degree program, or one to be completed concurrently elsewhere. If a course is evaluated at the University as being equivalent to a course required in the student's program, it may be accepted as such. The amount of transfer credit permitted varies with each program. The following formula is used when changing semester hours to quarter hours: 1 semester hour = 1.5 quarter units 2 semester hours = 3.0 quarter units 3 semester hours = 4.5 quarter units 4 semester hours = 6.0 quarter units 5 semester hours = 7.5 quarter units Credits eligible for transfer must be earned at institutions approved by the BPPE (Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education), public or private schools of higher education that are regionally accredited or foreign institutions recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. In determining how courses are evaluated for acceptance as transfer credits, each course will be compared with the catalog course description from the school previously attended (where transfer credits will come from) to the SDUIS catalog course description. The student will provide a copy of the catalog with course description(s) that was in use during the time the student had attended that school, in order for the evaluation to occur. Courses eligible for transfer at the graduate level must have been completed within the last 10 years, or 6 years for the licensing tract. At the BA level, each case will be evaluated individually. General education requirements may also be met by successful scores on CLEP exams in subjects not previously credited on transcripts. A passing grade of \"B\" or better is required for courses to transfer into SDUIS graduate programs. No more than 30 semester hours, or 45 quarter units, can be transferred into any of the Doctoral programs. These units must be in subjects directly related to the core courses for the degree. The University does not accept undergraduate credit hours, even at 71 advanced levels, as transfer credit in graduate programs. This institution had not entered into an articulation or transfer agreement with any other college or university.
