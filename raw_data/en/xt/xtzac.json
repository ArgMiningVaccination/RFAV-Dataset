Your immune system is one of the most essential parts of your bodily function. Not only does it help protect you against outside infections and viruses, but it also helps protect your existing internal cells against damage. Organs, proteins, and cells all comprise your immune system. They work together as a programming system of sorts. Every time your immune system encounters any germ, it remembers it and stores that microbe in its \"memory.\" If your body defeats the infection or virus, this internal system records the \"data.\" Once that microbe is on file, if it enters your body again, your immune system will recognize precisely what it is and fight it more easily. This means that you're likely to get less sick if you encounter the same virus multiple times, and you're likely to have a faster recovery time. The internal network of your immune system is truly impressive-it's almost like a computer where the different parts work together to identify, record, and fight harmful microbes based on previously stored data. Additionally, the immune system helps protect existing healthy cells. Sometimes, our healthy cells may attempt to attack each other (such as with cancer), and your immune system steps in to try to block the negative impacts. For these reasons, knowing how to boost your immune system is crucial. There are various natural ways to do so, most of which are free, inexpensive, and easy to implement. How to Naturally Strengthen Your Immune System Knowing how to strengthen immune systems is important. We're here to provide six tips that you can start today to get on the right path. 1) Get a Good Night's Sleep The amount and quality of sleep you get at night are closely tied to your immune system. The rest you get while your body resets overnight helps your immune system release a type of protein called cytokines. These proteins help fight infection and decrease inflammation. When you're not getting enough sleep, your body doesn't create enough of these proteins, which can impact your immune system. 2) Get Plenty of Exercise We know that exercise is healthy-it helps fight obesity and aids people in maintaining a healthy body weight. Being significantly overweight or obese may decrease the number of leukocytes in your body. Leukocytes are cells that circulate throughout your body to help counteract any foreign invaders.

Additionally, if you're recovering from an injury and are looking to slowly get back into the game we offer physical therapy services that can help you get better faster. 3) Reduce Stress Levels Stress is a significant contributor to how your immune system reacts under pressure. Stress leads to higher levels of cortisol, a hormone in your body. When your levels of cortisol increase, it suppresses the ability of your immune system to perform its proper duties. Additionally, it lowers the number of lymphocytes in your blood and can interfere with the communication between your white blood cells. White blood cells are the most critical part of your immune system, responsible for fighting infections, viruses, and diseases. 4) Avoid Nicotine and Alcohol Cutting smoking and drinking out of your diet, or consuming the substances as little as possible, can boost your immune system. We know that smoking can lead to cancer, and excessive drinking can impair your body's ability to fight off disease. 5) Maintain a Healthy Diet Your diet plays a more prominent role in strengthening your immune system than you may think. Many foods can naturally boost your immune system and are easy to incorporate into your diet.

Spinach, broccoli, almonds, turmeric, ginger, green tea, and healthy meats like lean poultry. 6) Seek Professional Assistance Whether you're struggling with stress, eating healthy, or coming up with the right exercise plan, some professionals can help you.

Nutritionists can help you create a healthy and realistic diet plan, and personal trainers can help your get your exercise routine down.
