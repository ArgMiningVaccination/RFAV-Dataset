Herbs and TCM formulas contain numerous active molecules. Basically, they are a kind of cocktail therapy. Herb-drug, herb-food, herb-herb, herb-microbiome, and herb-disease interactions are complex. There is potential for both benefit and harm, so only after understanding more of their mechanisms and clinical effects can herbal medicine and TCM be helpful to users. Many pharmacologic studies have been performed to unravel the molecular mechanisms; however, basic and clinical studies of good validity are still not enough to translate experimental results into clinical understanding and to provide tough evidence for better use of herbal medicines. There are still issues regarding the conflicting pharmacologic effects, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, adverse and clinical effects of herbal medicine and TCM. Understanding study validation, pharmacologic effects, drug interactions, indications and clinical effects, adverse effects and limitations, can all help clinicians in providing adequate suggestions to patients. At present, it would be better to use herbs and TCM formulas according to their traditional indications matching the disease pathophysiology and their molecular mechanisms. To unravel the molecular mechanisms and understand the benefits and harms of herbal medicine and TCM, there is still much work to be done.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-09-27", "cleaned_text": "Unraveling the Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Formulas Against Acute Airway Viral Infections as Examples Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [1](#B1-molecules-24-03505)]. In 1997 national survey in the USA, 12.1% of adults had used herbs for health care in the previous year; and almost five-fold increase [ [2](#B2-molecules-24-03505)]. In 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Alternative Medicine Supplement, use of natural products had grown to 17.7% adults in the previous year [ [3](#B3-molecules-24-03505)]. Among them, products of medicinal plants were the most popular, including Echinacea, Ginseng, herb pills, ginkgo, etc. [ [4](#B4-molecules-24-03505)]. Aside from the USA, 65% of Germans used herbs [ [5](#B5-molecules-24-03505)]. In China, people commonly use TCM herbs as dietary supplements. In developing countries, herbs are often less expensive, more accessible, and more popular than orthodox western medicine [ [6](#B6-molecules-24-03505)]. With such popularity, it is common to have herbal therapy concomitantly being taken with orthodox western medicine therapy, intentionally or accidentally. Herbs and TCM formulas (i.e., combination of several herbs) contain numerous active molecules, with each active molecule possessing unique pharmacologic activities. Basically, they are a kind of cocktail therapy. Pharmacological activities of herbs may or may not differ from those of their active molecules, but it is common that pharmacological activities of a TCM formula might differ from those of its ingredients, so there might probably be complex herb-drug, herb-food, herb-herb, herb-microbiome, and herb-disease interactions. 2. Indications of Use of TCM Formulas for Diseases Management [7](#B7-molecules-24-03505)]. 2.1. Indications of R-Physicians' Formulas 2.2. Indications of A-Physicians' Formulas [8](#B8-molecules-24-03505)]. From then on, TCM formulas and their ingredients have been hypothesized to be effective against certain viral infections at different stages, and indeed, several active molecules isolated from herbs show antiviral activities, such as cimicifugin from Cimicifuga foetida against the Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus [ [9](#B9-molecules-24-03505)], and pterodontic acid from Laggera pterodonta against the influenza A virus [ [10](#B10-molecules-24-03505)], etc. 3. Factors and Mechanisms Affecting Clinical Effects and Side Effects of the Formulas of A-Physicians [11](#B11-molecules-24-03505), [12](#B12-molecules-24-03505), [13](#B13-molecules-24-03505), [14](#B14-molecules-24-03505), issue of TCM formula. Natural products and TCM formulas might not be safe; however, some A-physicians suppose that the side effects may come from the misuse of TCM formulas without fulfilling their indications, while R-physicians consider the side effects developing from the misinterpretation of the disharmony. Most TCM physicians do not agree that these side effects come from TCM formulas themselves, although with the same indications or disharmony, it is common to find that some patients respond well while others do not\u2014while some patients develop side effects, some show responses opposite to the in vitro pharmacological effects. For example, Panax quinquefolius prolongs thromboplastin time, prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time in vitro [ [18](#B18-molecules-24-03505)]. However, in combination therapy with warfarin, Panax quinquefolius actually decreases seral concentration of warfarin and has shortened INR in a clinical trial [ [19](#B19-molecules-24-03505)]. With therapy using Panax ginseng, one can develop thrombosis [ [20](#B20-molecules-24-03505)], bleed [ [21](#B21-molecules-24-03505), [22](#B22-molecules-24-03505)], or remain without any particular response [ [23](#B23-molecules-24-03505)]. 3.1. Individual Gene Affecting Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics [24](#B24-molecules-24-03505), [25](#B25-molecules-24-03505)]. Such technologies have been used to investigate the biological mechanisms of different syndromes of patients by studying the functional activities of the human body from a system-wide perspective. For example, the overall biological characterization of the urine of psoriasis patients with TCM blood stasis syndrome was performed to investigate the therapeutic metabolomic mechanism of the Optimized Yinxieling formula [ [26](#B26-molecules-24-03505)]. In addition, metabolomics have been considered a powerful tool in diagnosis and treatment of primary dysmenorrhea by supporting information on changes of metabolites and changes in endocrinal, neural, and immune pathways [ [27](#B27-molecules-24-03505)]. The Xiang-Fu-Si-Wu formula has been demonstrated to affect some significant perturbations in sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism as well as steroid hormone biosynthesis to make the metabolic discrepancy return to the normal level [ [28](#B28-molecules-24-03505)]. 3.2. Complex Active Molecules vary in TCM Formulas commonly caused by drug-drug interactions. TCM formulas are mixtures of several ingredients. Each ingredient has several bioactive compounds, so a TCM formula has numerous bioactive compounds. Thinking of dozens or even hundreds of active molecules in a TCM formula been taken at once implies that the probability of drug interaction could be high. Such interactions may be found between herb and drug, herb and food, herb and herb, herb and microbiome, and even between herb and disease. For example, in herb-drug interaction, Scutellariae baicalensis is a common ingredient in TCM formulas. S. baicalensis contains baicalin, a flavonoid, as one of its major molecules. Interactions between S. baicalensis and drugs are found due to baicalin affecting metabolic enzymes of drugs, displacing plasma protein binding, and regulating various transporters involved in the pharmacokinetics [ [34](#B34-molecules-24-03505)]. Baicalin may inhibit the expression and hydroxylation activity of CYP3A in the liver to change the pharmacokinetics of drugs [ [35](#B35-molecules-24-03505)]. Co-administration of extract of S. baicalensis, and mefenamic acid, a kind of NSAID, can potentiate anti-inflammatory reductase inhibitor commonly used to reduce serum cholesterol level, might find reduced plasma concentration of rosuvastatin in certain patients with certain genomes [ [37](#B37-molecules-24-03505)]. As for herb-food and herb-food-drug interactions, baicalin can potentiate the antioxidant activity of -carotene, which is a terpenoid of red-orange color, abundant in plants and fruits [ [38](#B38-molecules-24-03505)]. The intakes of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages, containing baicalin and rutin, might compete with the binding site of calcium channel blockers on human serum albumin to affect their clinical effects [ [39](#B39-molecules-24-03505), [40](#B40-molecules-24-03505)]. By contrast, baicalin and rutin will increase the binding affinity of curcumin on human serum albumin to change its bioavailability [ [41](#B41-molecules-24-03505)]. Herbs may also interact with each other. For example, baicalin and berberine are important coexisting molecules of the combination of S. baicalensis and Coptidis chinensis. Berberine, but not baicalin, can increase consumption. Co-administration of berberine and baicalin had a synergetic effect on glucose utilization [ [42](#B42-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, TCM herbs are commonly used as food supplements and dietary therapy. Foods have been reported to modify the intestinal microbiome [ [43](#B43-molecules-24-03505)]. Commensal microbiota have been thought to be involved in the development of the innate and adaptive immunity, nutrient metabolism of humans, and protection from the overgrowth of intestinal pathogens [ [44](#B44-molecules-24-03505)]. Herbs can change pharmacokinetics of drugs by intestinal microbiota [ [34](#B34-molecules-24-03505)]. The intestinal microbiome is metabolically active to play an important role in the absorption of certain active molecules and change their bio-availabilities, particularly in those containing glycosidic linkages [ [34](#B34-molecules-24-03505), [45](#B45-molecules-24-03505)]. Therefore, change of intestinal microbiome by herbs-containing foods may affect human health care and drug therapy. As for interactions between disease and herb, more absorption of active molecules of in RSV pneumonia-infected rats vis-\u00e0-vis normal rats by reducing the clearance rates of these active molecules [ [46](#B46-molecules-24-03505)]. There are highly complex interactions between herbs and drugs, foods, herbs, microbiome, and diseases, and most of these complex interactions are not completely discovered or remain unseen, just like the submerged part of an iceberg. Therefore, there are still insufficient data to completely understand the molecular mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and interactions of TCM formulas. 4. Unraveling the Molecular Mechanism of TCM Formulas, Using Airway Viral Infections as Examples [47](#B47-molecules-24-03505), [48](#B48-molecules-24-03505)]. These viruses infect epithelia, produce inflammation, induce immune response, and cause symptoms. From the viewpoint of pathophysiology, TCM formulas used to manage airway viral infections need to have antiviral activity against such viruses listed above, and/or to induce antiviral cytokines, and/or anti-inflammatory effect, and/or to relieve symptoms commonly presented in airway infections ( [Figure 1](#molecules-24-03505-f001)). To simplify the molecular mechanisms and to correlate the pharmacologic activities with their clinical effects, five formulas of A-physicians will be used as examples against airway infections: 1](#molecules-24-03505-t001)) [ [49](#B49-molecules-24-03505)] has been reported to be effective in the treatment of common colds, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and pneumonia. The indication to use GGT is patients with symptoms of headache, fever without sweating, and particularly stiffness of neck and shoulders. GGT can successfully reduce various symptoms of dogs infected with common cold viruses [ [50](#B50-molecules-24-03505)]. GGT has antiviral activities against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [ [51](#B51-molecules-24-03505)] and influenza virus [ [52](#B52-molecules-24-03505)]. GGT can reduce the mortality of influenza virus-infected mice [ [53](#B53-molecules-24-03505)]. Among its active molecules, uralsaponins and procyanidin from Cinnamomum cassia [ [55](#B55-molecules-24-03505)] may effectively inhibit the replication of the influenza virus. Allicin in ginger (Zingiber officinale) and coumarin in Cinnamomum cassia might have the to inhibit neuraminidase [ [56](#B56-molecules-24-03505)]. Paeonol and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl--d-glucopyranose from Paeonia lactiflora rhinovirus [ [57](#B57-molecules-24-03505)]. Of its anti-inflammatory effects, GGT can suppress the interleukin-1 (IL-1) production induced by interferons (IFN) in influenza [ [58](#B58-molecules-24-03505)]. GGT was found to decrease cigarette smoking- (CS-) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced elevated counts of inflammatory cells, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and proteins (IL-6, TNF-, iNOS, can and IFN- to counteract viral infection [ [53](#B53-molecules-24-03505)], and can also enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages [ [50](#B50-molecules-24-03505)]. Among its active molecules, paeoniflorin, a major constituent of Paeonia lactiflora, exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by balancing the function of Th1/Th2 [ [60](#B60-molecules-24-03505)]. Glycyrrhizin, a major constituent of (NF-B) via nitric oxides (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduces the protein and mRNA levels of inducible uralensis, induces NO production and iNOS transcription in peritoneal macrophages [ [62](#B62-molecules-24-03505)]. However, this study design uses intraperitoneal injection to show the induction of NO [ [62](#B62-molecules-24-03505)], instead of the traditional oral route. Polysaccharides will be normally digested in the gastrointestinal tract into monosaccharide, so that polysaccharides can hardly reach intraperitoneal macrophages in the regular oral route, so this pharmacologic activity has been questioned. Isoliquiritigenin, a flavonoid from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, inhibits NF-B activation inflammatory [ from Cinnamomum cassia, inhibits tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and the activation of NF-B to show the [ [64](#B64-molecules-24-03505), e-cinnamaldehyde production to show anti-inflammatory activity [ [67](#B67-molecules-24-03505)]. Although it can mediate antiviral activity, TNF- plays only a minor role in clearance of various airway viruses; rather, it is the major contributor of T-cell-mediated lung injury [ [68](#B68-molecules-24-03505)]. For enhancement of antiviral immunity, puerarin, an increases IFN- and IL-12, but decreases IL-10 and transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) levels [ [70](#B70-molecules-24-03505)]. On the contrary, gingerol was also reported to suppress T cell response and inhibit IFN- synthesis [ [71](#B71-molecules-24-03505)]( [Figure 2](#molecules-24-03505-f002)). These conflicting data may come from different study designs and raise questions about the actual pharmacological activity in humans. 4.2. Ma-Huang-Tang [ [49](#B49-molecules-24-03505)] have been reported to be effective in the treatment of Influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, acute and chronic bronchitis, and asthma [ [72](#B72-molecules-24-03505), [73](#B73-molecules-24-03505)]. The indication to use MHT is patients with chills, fever without sweating, headache, shortness of breath, and joint pain. Clinically, MHT can effectively reduce fever and flu symptoms, including myalgia, headache, arthralgia, fatigue and cough, in patients with seasonal influenza type A [ [74](#B74-molecules-24-03505)]. Among its active molecules, L-ephedrine from Ephedra sinica and amygdalin from Prunus Armeniacae, antitussive co-administration Ephedra sinica and Prunus Armeniacae shows a better antitussive effect than use singly [ [76](#B76-molecules-24-03505)]. MHT clearly shows anti-inflammatory activity via suppressing the NO/PGE2 pathway [ [77](#B77-molecules-24-03505)], reducing inflammatory cells infiltration and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine, including TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6, in lung experiments [ [78](#B78-molecules-24-03505)]. In an acute bronchial asthma mice model, MHT can also mitigate the pathological changes of acute asthma-like syndrome through inhibition of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway [ [79](#B79-molecules-24-03505)]. MHT can modulate Th1/Th2 cytokines via decreasing IL-4 & IL-17 and increasing IFN- levels. MHT can inhibit TH17 [80](#B80-molecules-24-03505)], and IL-4, IL-5, TNF-, CD3+, T (Th2 response), IL-2, IFN-, and CD4+ T cell levels (Th1 response) to increase CD4+/CD8+ ratio [ [81](#B81-molecules-24-03505)]. [82](#B82-molecules-24-03505)] and inhibits complement activation of both classical and alternative pathways [ [83](#B83-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, Ephedra sinica can directly activate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors to reduce bronchial mucosal dilate the bronchus respectively [ [75](#B75-molecules-24-03505), [84](#B84-molecules-24-03505)]. To understand the molecular mechanism, several active molecules have been identified. Ephedrannin A and B, from Ephedra sinica, effectively suppressed the transcription of TNF-, IL-1, and NF-B, and the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated kinase and immunomodulatory effects mentioned in the GGT section. For its antiviral activity, MHT was initially thought to inhibit airway viruses through inducing antiviral IFN. However, herbacetin from ephedrine alkaloid-free extract of Ephedra sinica might have anti-influenza activity similar to its extract containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine [ [86](#B86-molecules-24-03505)]. The study of Ephedra sinica is relative rare owing to it containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are illegal in several countries. Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Cinnamomum cassia also have active antiviral constituents a similar formula to Ma-Huang-Tang, is effective against Influenza virus infection [ [87](#B87-molecules-24-03505)]. MXGST has only one ingredient different from that of MHT, i.e., using gypsum instead of Cinnamomum cassia, so their pharmacologic effects and active molecules are similar, except that gypsum possesses a more powerful anti-pyretic effect by decreasing the PGE2 level in the hypothalamus [ [88](#B88-molecules-24-03505)]. Co-treatment with Ephedra sinica and gypsum can have synergistic effects to manage fever and asthma than single use [ [89](#B89-molecules-24-03505)]. MXGST add-on therapy may improve pulmonary function indicies, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD [ [90](#B90-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, at higher cumulative doses, MXGST might reduce the incidence of pneumonia and protect against admission [ [91](#B91-molecules-24-03505)]. The indication to use MXGST is patients with fever, cough with yellow and sticky sputum, chest pain, and shortness of breath. MXGST has been found to have antitussive and anti-pyretic effects in an LPS-induced hyperthermia rat model [ [92](#B92-molecules-24-03505)]. MXGST has bronchodilation effect mediated by stimulation of 2-adrenoceptors in pigs [ [93](#B93-molecules-24-03505)] and can block acetyl-cholinergic and histaminergic receptor-induced bronchial contraction in rats [ [92](#B92-molecules-24-03505)], reduce neutrophilic inflammation [ [93](#B93-molecules-24-03505)], and in a COPD rat model, can decrease IL-4, IL-8, and TNF-, but increase IFN- [ [94](#B94-molecules-24-03505)]. These effects may be beneficial to manage airway viral infections with cough. The molecular mechanism of MXGST is summarized China) [Table 4](#molecules-24-03505-t004)) [ [49](#B49-molecules-24-03505)] is one of the most common prescriptions used against allergic rhinitis [ [95](#B95-molecules-24-03505)]. XQLT, at higher cumulative doses, might reduce the incidence of pneumonia and protect against admission [ [91](#B91-molecules-24-03505)]. XQLT with/without Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang (MXGST) is the most frequently prescribed TCM formula for COPD [ [96](#B96-molecules-24-03505)], and is also commonly used in the treatment of patients with respiratory diseases, such as common cold, flu, bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, and emphysema. The indication to use XQLT is patients with cough, watery rhinorrhea or watery sputum, but without thirst. To manage airway viral infection, XQLT is effective against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection by preventing viral attachment, internalization, syncytial formation, and by stimulating IFN- secretion [ [97](#B97-molecules-24-03505)], and has been proven beneficial against influenza virus in vivo through the augmentation of antiviral IgA antibody [ [98](#B98-molecules-24-03505), [99](#B99-molecules-24-03505)]. XQLT can reduce the airway inflammation with the decrease of eosinophils count, the ovalbumin (OVA)-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, and release [ [100](#B100-molecules-24-03505), [101](#B101-molecules-24-03505), [102](#B102-molecules-24-03505)], can also modulate Th1/Th2 balance thereby reducing IL-4 and restoring IFN- levels [ [101](#B101-molecules-24-03505), [103](#B103-molecules-24-03505)]. Among its active molecules, schisandrin a bioactive lignin of Schisandra sphenanthera, inhibits kinase (MAPK) and NF-B signal pathways [ inhibit the NF-B, MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, partially mediated by the activation the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway to manage inflammatory disorders caused by over-activation of macrophages another increases the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 and blocks the activation of NF-B induced by LPS to suppress the production of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 TNF-, IL-8 umbilical vein (HUVECs) [ [106](#B106-molecules-24-03505)]. -Cubebenoate, isolated from Schisandra chinensis, can block the increase of IL-1 and IL-6 during inflammation [ [107](#B107-molecules-24-03505)], and inhibit LPS-induced expression of and Oral polysaccharide from Schisandra chinensis showed antitussive effect in a guinea pig model [ [109](#B109-molecules-24-03505)]. The active molecules of common ingredients, including pharmacologic activities mentioned in the above sections. Most of these activities aim at inhibiting inflammation induced by airway infection, however, lectin from Pinellia ternate may activate macrophages, induce neutrophil migration, cytokine release, ROS overproduction and the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway to produce pro-inflammatory activity [ [110](#B110-molecules-24-03505)]( [Figure 5](#molecules-24-03505-f005)). Therefore, interactions, including both synergistic and antagonistic between active molecules in a TCM formula could be so complex as to affect the final effects. 4.5. Ye-Gan-Ma-Huang-Tang (YGMHT; Yakammaoto [ has been used to manage flu-like symptoms. A meta-analysis shows that YGMHT can improve the total effective rate, FEV1, and asthma control test (ACT) score of refractory asthmatic patients [ [111](#B111-molecules-24-03505)]. When combined with salbutamol aerosol, YGMHT can obviously improve their pulmonary functions, including ACT score, PEF, FEV1, and FEV1% predicted value. The indication to use YGMHT is patients with chill and fever, hyperinflation of lung, cough with stridor and rales associated with frothy or whitish sputum [ [112](#B112-molecules-24-03505)]. YGMHT has been reported effective against enterovirus infection, including coxsackievirus [ [113](#B113-molecules-24-03505)] and EV71 [ [114](#B114-molecules-24-03505)]. It can regulate the serum levels of TNF-, IL-10, and IL-13 to show clinical effect in management of cough and variant asthmatic symptoms in children [ [115](#B115-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, a modified YGMHT (also named San-Long-Ping-Chuan-Decoction; SLPCD) can significantly inhibit airway inflammation, reduce inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and decrease the serum total IgE levels [ [116](#B116-molecules-24-03505)]. SLPCD can significantly down-regulate mRNA cytokines and IFN-) in lungs of asthmatic mice [ [116](#B116-molecules-24-03505)]. For this anti-inflammatory activity, Aster tataricus can protect from LPS-induced acute lung injury mainly through inhibiting the release of inflammatory cells (WBC, [117](#B117-molecules-24-03505)]. Among its active molecules, irigenin, a major active constituent of Belamcanda chinensis, can reduce NO and PGE2 production by decreasing the mRNA and protein expression of iNOS and COX-2, respectively, as well as by suppressing NF-B activation [ [118](#B118-molecules-24-03505)]( [Figure 6](#molecules-24-03505-f006)). 5. Limitations of Herbal Medicine and TCM 5.1. Away from Medical Education of Orthodox Medicine 5.2. Lack of Tough Evidence of Clinical Efficacy [119](#B119-molecules-24-03505)], or ginkgo for dementia or mild cognitive impairment [ [120](#B120-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, the amounts of most bioactive compounds in herbs and TCM formulas are very low. Is it possible that the clinical effects of herbs and TCM formulas can be effective with such a small amount of bioactive compounds? One study discussed the clinical effect of Ma-Huang-Tang (MHT) against seasonal influenza [ [121](#B121-molecules-24-03505)]. MHT showed an equivalent clinical effect as neuraminidase inhibitors. However, not every TCM formula can provide such evidence. [122](#B122-molecules-24-03505)]. They are commonly used for URTIs, but more research is required to validate their clinical effects and mechanisms. Without tough clinical evidence and clear molecular mechanisms, physicians tend to avoid herbal therapies. Most clinical claims of herbal therapies are based on bench studies that do not possess external validity to support their conclusions; for example, using animal-derived cancer cell lines to study antiviral effects in humans; using cancer cell lines to study physical changes; using intraperitoneal injection to study oral medications; and using high-dose pharmacological designs to study physiological responses, etc. Therefore, there is still much space for improvement of our understanding of the mechanisms of herbal medicine. 5.3. Safety Issue is not Completely Resolved [123](#B123-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, several adverse effects of commonly used herbs have been reviewed, including hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic effect, hypolipidemic or hyperlipidemic effect, hormonal activities, hypertensive, cardioactive [ [124](#B124-molecules-24-03505)], and hepatotoxic effects [ [125](#B125-molecules-24-03505)]. Some of them are serious even in recommended dosage, such as Ephedra alkaloids (derived from Ephedra sinica or Ma huang) [ [126](#B126-molecules-24-03505), [127](#B127-molecules-24-03505), [128](#B128-molecules-24-03505)]. However, most of the molecular mechanisms causing side effects are unknown. Plants containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids can lead to hepatotoxicity and venoocclusive disease, possibly by the accumulation of toxic metabolites produced via the cytochrome system [ [129](#B129-molecules-24-03505)]. Some herbal treatments containing aristolochic nephropathy requiring renal replacement therapy [ [130](#B130-molecules-24-03505), [131](#B131-molecules-24-03505)]; Additionally, AA is associated with urothelial cancers [ [132](#B132-molecules-24-03505)]. Although most of the above issues have been identified, the unrecognized issues are just the tip of the iceberg. 5.4. Complex Interactions are not Fully Understood [4](#B4-molecules-24-03505)], has about 30 ginsenosides as its major bioactive compounds [ [133](#B133-molecules-24-03505)], although the actual amount of each ginsenoside is small. After oral administration, ginsenosides are metabolized and transformed by intestinal microbiota. Diet can markedly influence the transformation of ginsenosides. They exert pharmacologic effects in animals, and also show various clinical effects in randomized controlled trials, including several side effects and drug interactions [ [133](#B133-molecules-24-03505)], so small amounts of bioactive compounds do have clinical effects and side effects, which might come from the individual pharmacological activity of bioactive compounds or their synergism. The side effects may also come from individual unfavorable bioactivity or from interactions. Additionally, herbal medicine and TCM therapy are commonly used in combination with orthodox medicine by patients, sometimes unknown to their doctors. The complex and unknown interactions, including herb-drug, herb-herb, herb-food, herb-microbiome, and herb-disease interactions, make use of herbal medicine more complicated and requiring frequent monitoring. The mechanisms of these interactions can be divided into molecular mimicry and pharmacologic interactions, such as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. For example, with molecular mimicry, several herbs naturally has coumarin or salicylate analogue that may potentiate the bleeding risk of warfarin and salicylate, respectively. For pharmacodynamic interactions, Ephedra sinica (Ma huang) should not be used with sedative or anti-hypertensive agents. For pharmacokinetic interactions, St John's wort and several TCM formulas have been noted to affect the CYP450 system of liver, which may increase or decrease the effects of other drugs [ [134](#B134-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, the herb-drug interaction may be individualized, e.g., in combination with warfarin, Panax ginseng may cause thrombotic event [ [20](#B20-molecules-24-03505)], bleeding [ [21](#B21-molecules-24-03505), [22](#B22-molecules-24-03505)], or neither [ [23](#B23-molecules-24-03505)]. Currently, most of the molecular mechanisms of these identified interactions are not fully understood, to say nothing of the unrecognized interactions. 5.5. Quality Uncertainty of Commercially Available Natural Products [135](#B135-molecules-24-03505)]. Most of those quality problems can be gradually solved by following the WHO guidelines on good agriculture and collection practices for medicinal plants [ [136](#B136-molecules-24-03505)] and botanical drug development guidance for industry of FDA [ [137](#B137-molecules-24-03505)]. 5.6. Pitfall of Interpretation of Benefits [138](#B138-molecules-24-03505)]. However, ROS/RNS are also signaling molecules for several physiological functions, including regulation of vascular tone, control of ventilation, and erythropoietin production, etc. Actually, ROS-mediated responses may protect against oxidative stress [ [139](#B139-molecules-24-03505)]. Additionally, ROS/RNS may play a dual role in different diseases, i.e., ROS/RNS might contribute to, or counteract, the disease progression. It remains unclear that more dosage of antioxidants is not better and may even worsen a medical condition [ [138](#B138-molecules-24-03505)]. There are insufficient data to establish the ability of TCM to decrease ROS/RNS levels and establish its effects on the disease, and this affects the interpretation of any claims of benefit. To validate such claims of the benefits of herbal medicine and TCM, much work remains to be done. 6.
