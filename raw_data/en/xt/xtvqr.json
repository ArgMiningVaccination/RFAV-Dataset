THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 2000 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:37 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Morella, Ros-Lehtinen, and Staff present: Binger, staff director; Daniel R. Moll, deputy staff director; David A. Kass, deputy counsel and parliamentarian;Mark Corallo, director of communications; S. Elizabeth Clay, NicolePetrosino, and Nat Weinecke, professional staff members; RobertBriggs, deputy chief Robin Butler, manager; and assistant clerks; and Andrew Su, minority research assist-ant. Mr. B URTON . If I could have your attention, please. I know a lot of people have cameras, and I hate to throw a wet blanket on thoseof you who want to take some pictures, but unless you are a mem-ber of the media, I wish you would not take any pictures duringthe hearing. We will try to get the people you want to take picturesof together later; but please do not take a bunch of pictures duringthe meeting because it will probably disrupt what we are trying toaccomplish. Good morning. A quorum being present, the Committee on Gov- ernment Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses open- ing statements be included in the record. Without objection, so or-dered. I also ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits, and ex- traneous or tabular material referred to be included in the record.Without objection, so ordered. We do have some Members who have opening statements, and we will allow those, and if they do not choose to give an opening VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb want to prepare one for the record, that will be fine as well. This morning we are here to talk about autism. As we learned in our August hearing, the rates of autism have escalated dramati-cally in the last few years. What used to be considered a rare dis-order has become a near epidemic. We have received hundreds ofletters from parents across the country. In fact, here are some note-books, and each one of the pages represents a parent who has aproblem with a child with autism. They have shared with us their pain and their challenges. My staff tells me that some of them cried when they read some of theseletters \u2014and I have a pretty hard-nosed staff. I do not have to read a letter to experience the kind of heart- break that is in these letters. I see it in my own family. I am veryproud of this picture. The one on the left is my grand-daughter,who almost died after receiving a hepatitis B shot. Within a shortperiod of time, she quit breathing, and they had to rush her to thehospital. My grandson, Christian, whom you see there with his head on her shoulder, according to the doctors was going to be about 6-foot-10\u2014we anticipated having him support the family by being an NBA star \u2014but unfortunately, after receiving nine shots in 1 day, the MMR and the DTaP shot and the hepatitis B, within a veryshort period of time, he quit speaking, ran around banging hishead against the wall, screaming, hollering, waving his hands, andbecame a totally different child. We found out that he was autistic. He was born healthy. He was beautiful and tall. He was outgoing and talkative. He enjoyed company and going places. Then, he hadthose shots, and our lives and his life changed. I do not want to read all the things that happened to Christian, because I am not sure I could get through it. But unfortunately,what happened to Christian is not a rare, isolated event. ShelleyReynolds will testify today. Her organization, Unlocking Autism,will be displaying thousands of pictures of autistic children at the''Hear Their Silence '' autism rally this Saturday. Forty-seven percent of the parents who provided these pictures feel that their children 's autism is linked to the immunizations \u2014 almost half. We frequently hear about the children with chronic earinfections and children who became autistic after spiking a feverwith their vaccinations. Liz Birt was one of the hundreds of par-ents who contacted us. Her 5-year-old son Matthew has been classi-fied as autistic. He was developing normally. At age 15 months, fol-lowing his MMR vaccine, he began to regress. Since the time of hisvaccination, he has had chronic diarrhea. This is his picture \u2014a good-looking kid. This is very prevalent, this chronic diarrhea, in autistic children. Matthew also did not sleep on a regular basis for over 3 years. Liztook her son to numerous gastroenterologists in prominent medicalfacilities in the United States with no resolution. Finally, this pastNovember, Liz took her son to London, to the Royal Free Hospital.A team of medical experts there examined Matthew. They felt thathe had a bowel obstruction. To the family, this seemed impossiblesince he had constant diarrhea. An x-ray indicated that Matthewhad a fecal mass in his colon the size of a cantaloupe. After the ob- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Matthew underwent an en- doscopy and colonoscopy. The lesions in Matthew 's bowel tested positive for the measles virus. Dr. Andrew Wakefield and Professor John O 'Leary will be testi- fying today. Their research has uncovered a possible connection be-tween inflammatory bowel disorder in children with autism who re-ceive the MMR vaccine and have measles virus in their small intes-tines. Since coming home from England and being treated for chronic inflammatory bowel disorder, Matthew has finally begun to sleepthrough the night. I know that is a welcome relief for his family. Unfortunately, Matthew 's story is not that unusual in children with autism. Our grandson has a similar problem. Unfortunately,it is important that I make two things very clear today. I, and Ibelieve every Member of Congress, am not against vaccinations,and I do not think that every autistic child acquires autism afterreceiving childhood immunizations. I think slide 3 shows a lot of children who have had autism \u2014 is that correct \u2014those are before-and-after pictures of the children. However, there is enough evidence emerging of some kind of con- nection for some children that we cannot close our eyes to it \u2014we have to learn more. Dr. Mary Megson of Richmond, VA will testify about the correla- tion she has seen in children with autism and attention deficit dis-order. She has seen a correlation between Vitamin A depletion andimmune suppression after receiving the MMR vaccination. There are certainly children who are born with autism. They have what can be called ''classical autism. '' There is, however, a growing number of children who are growing normally and then ac-quire autism, or ''atypical autism. '' There most probably is a genetic component to autism, but genet- ics is not the only issue. Many children seem to have severe foodsensitivities, particularly to gluten and casein, ingredients in themost common foods, dairy and wheat. Many of these children showsigns of autism shortly after receiving their immunizations. Someof these children, as we will hear from Jeana Smith, have metaltoxicities, aluminum and mercury. What is the source of these toxicsubstances? Dr. Goldberg will testify that maybe what we are seeing is not autism at all, but a neuro-immunologic dysfunction. I am very concerned about the increased number of childhood vaccines. I am concerned about the ingredients that are put inthese vaccines. I am concerned about the way they are given. Wehave learned that most of the vaccines our children are given con-tain mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde. Last year, the FDAadded up the amount of mercury our babies are being given tolearn that in the first 6 months of life, they receive more mercurythan is considered safe. Think about that \u2014in the first 6 months of life, the FDA has said that children are receiving more mercurythan is considered safe, and most of that is from vaccinations. Whyis it that the FDA licenses vaccines that contain neurotoxins likemercury and aluminum? When asked about the increased rates of autism, many will im- mediately discount that there is even an increase \u2014even though the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 from the Department of Education show increased rate in every, single State. This slide shows you that every Statehas seen a dramatic increase. Others will say the increase is due to better diagnostic skills. Others will say it is because the diagnostic category was expanded.If we look at the slide showing California here, California has re-ported a 273 percent increase in children with autism since 1988.From this increase, 21 percent of all autistic children in Californialive in the 29th District, which is Henry Waxman 's district, who is the ranking Democrat on our committee. Florida has reported a 571 percent increase in autism. Maryland has reported a 513 percent increase between 1993 and 1998. Youcannot attribute all of that to better diagnostic skills. In 1999, there are 2,462 children ages 3 to 21 in Indiana diag- nosed with autism. That is one-fourth of 1 percent of all the schoolchildren in Indiana, or 1 out of every 400; 23 percent of these chil-dren live in my district, the 6th District of Indiana. This increase is not just better counting. If we want to find a cure, we must first look to the cause. We must do this now, beforeour health and education systems are bankrupted, and before moreof our Nation 's children are locked inside themselves with this dis- ease. Kenneth Curtis, part of ''Dave 's Morning Show '' at Oldies 100 FM here in Washington, will set the stage by talking about beingthe parent of an autistic child. He will be followed by JamesSmythe, of Carmel, IN. He will share how, through properly look-ing at autism as an illness and addressing that illness, his son isimproving. Scott Bono, from North Carolina, lives close to one of the finest medical facilities in the world \u2014Duke University. However, he has been unable to find medical experts to properly address his autisticson's needs. He is forced to drive 12 hours every 4 weeks for his son's medical treatments. Dr. William Dankner, the father of a 13-year-old daughter with autism, and a scientist, will testify about the challenges of findingtherapies and treatments that have adequate research. He will alsotalk about the battle of getting adequate education through thepublic school system. I think all of us who have autistic childrenor grandchildren know the problems that it involves. We hear repeatedly that parents are not informed at the time of diagnosis by their school system what educational options an autis-tic child is entitled to. It is only after hiring lawyers and goingthrough the legal process that many children have access to appro-priate educational opportunities. We are learning that the earlierautism is diagnosed and treatments are begun, the better it is forthe child. Indiana is fortunate to have the First Steps Early Inter-vention System, a nationally recognized system that provides earlyintervention services for children up to 2 years of age. Families are forced to spend huge sums of money out-of-pocket even when they have good insurance, because autism is often spe-cifically excluded. We need to talk to State legislators around thiscountry to tell them how important it is, with the explosion of au-tism, that these benefits be mandated by the States and be coveredby insurance. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 to require insurance compa- nies to cover autism. Parents spend $20,000 to $30,000 a year.What medical care is covered is often done after extensive struggleswith insurance companies. We have a long hearing scheduled today with a broad spectrum of ideas presented. We will have a variety of medical approachespresented. We will hear about secretin, which gained a great dealof media attention in the past year and from which many parentshave seen tremendous success. Dr. John Upledger, a former adviser to the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, will testify on theuse of craniosacral therapy. He is the director of the Upledger In-stitute in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. For more than 25 years, Dr.Upledger has been treating autistic children and helping familiesthrough this approach. Craniosacral therapy is a gentle, powerfulform of body work that directly influences the brain and spinalcord. It is used to treat pain, discomfort, or trauma to the head orface, including TMJ dysfunction and headaches. Craniosacral ther-apy can also relieve physical and emotional trauma. In addition to his work with autism, Dr. Upledger has achieved dramatic results in treating post-traumatic stress disorder in Viet-nam veterans. In addition to medical treatments for the physical symptoms of autism, there are numerous therapies that are needed to help au-tistic children. Special educational approaches are needed that caninclude intensive behavior modification, known as ABA, Lovass,music therapy, speech therapy, auditory integration and sensoryintegration, as well as play therapy. We will hear from both the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention and the National Institutes of Health about ongoing re-search and future needs. Of particular interest is the Brick Town-ship study which has been evaluating a cluster of autism in NewJersey. This hearing will raise more questions than we can answer today. We owe it to our children and to our grandchildren to ensurethat we are being diligent in looking for the causes of autism. Wehave to do everything humanly possible to determine if there issomething that can be done to unlock our children from the prisonthat they are in as a result of autism. I think that as a top priority,we have to do much more research on the potential connection be-tween vaccines and autism. We cannot stick our heads in the sandand ignore this possibility. If we do not take action now, 10 years from now, it may be too late, not only for this generation of children, but for our taxpayer-funded health and education systems, which could collapse fromtrying to care for all of these children. The hearing record will remain open for 2 weeks.I now yield to my colleague from California, Mr. Waxman, for his opening statement. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am glad we are having this hearing today on autism. We still have many questions about autism \u2014what causes it; what are the safest and most effective treatments; is there a way to prevent it;how many people in the country suffer from autism? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 know some things about autism. We know there is a ge- netic component to autism. There have been some dramatic discov-eries recently in the genetics of autism like the discovery of theFragile X gene and the gene that causes Rett syndrome. We knowthat autism most likely develops very early during fetal develop-ment. We also know that parents are not to blame for autism. Wehave come a long way from the time when fathers and motherswere led to believe that they had done something to cause theirchildren 's autism, leaving them with needless and destructive guilt. But I also understand that this hearing was called to consider a theory that certain vaccines cause autism. From my discussionswith medical experts, scientists, and the autism community, it isclear that this is only a theory. As the American Medical Associa-tion concluded recently, ''Scientific data does not support a causal association between vaccination and autism. '' I believe that we need to increase our efforts to understand the causes of autism. In this search, no possible cause, including vac-cines, should be off the table. That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R.3301, which would provide additional funding at NIH for researchinto what causes autism, how many people suffer from autism, andhow best to treat those who have autism. But in this process, we must not get ahead of the science or raise false alarms. At every hearing in this Congress that this committeehas held touching on childhood immunizations, I have made a pointof emphasizing the tremendous public health value of immuniza-tion. More Americans have been saved by vaccines than by anyother medical intervention. Across the globe, 2.5 million childrendie every year from childhood diseases; another 750,000 are crip-pled by these diseases. But American children are shielded fromthis death and misery by their vaccinations. During my 25-year career in Congress, my focus has been on im- proving health care, especially for children. When I was chairmanof the Health and Environment Subcommittee of the CommerceCommittee from 1979 to 1994, we worked constantly to expandNIH research into childhood diseases. I have continued to fight formore research, better treatments, and coverage while I have beenin the minority. During countless hearings and many legislativebattles, I have heard over and over again about the pain of parentswhose children suffer from debilitating diseases. So I sympathize with the parents who are here today. I know how painful and how hard it must be for you as parents to havechildren who appear to be developing normally and then, all of asudden, seemingly out of nowhere, stop communicating and stopdeveloping. We need to do everything we can to give these parents here and other parents around the country answers. There is still much tolearn. In medicine the best answers come from research that canwithstand the rigors of the scientific method. These standards havebeen developed in order to find the truth. If research has been con- ducted with control groups, and the results have been independ-ently validated, then that gives parents meaningful informationabout what causes a disease or a condition and what the best treat-ments are. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 doctors need the best possible information so that they can make the best possible decisions regarding their children 's health. There are lots of experts and groups that are knowledgeable about this issue but who were not invited to testify today. Thesegroups include Dr. Louis Sullivan, former Secretary of Health andHuman Services, and current president of the Morehouse School ofMedicine; Dr. Isabelle Rapin, from the Albert Einstein College ofMedicine; the American Public Health Association; the AmericanMedical Association, and the National Network for ImmunizationInformation. At this time I would ask unanimous consent that allof their statements be entered into the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I thank all the witnesses who are here today for appearing. I know how difficult it is for some of them to be here,how hard it is to share their pain, and how much they want theirtestimony to be a way for us to understand that we in the Congressmust do everything we can, consider all theories, get to the truthabout autism, what causes it, what we can do to treat it, and howwe can prevent it. I see that as our job today, and I look forwardto the testimony and learning from the witnesses who are here toshare their perspectives with us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mrs. Morella.Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your ef- fort to hold this important hearing on autism, and I look forwardto hearing the testimony of the witnesses. I come to this hearing today with an open mind, ready to listen carefully to the testimony of the witnesses. Autism and its associ-ated behaviors have been estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 500individuals. Over 500,000 people in the United States today havesome form of autism. The estimated prevalence rate of autism nowplaces it as the third most common developmental disability \u2014more commonly occurring than Down Syndrome. Mr. Chairman, in your opening statements, you mentioned that there was a 513 percent increase in my State of Maryland between1993 and 1998, and I notice that the first witness on our firstpanel, Mr. Curtis, is from Maryland. Unfortunately, there is almost no existing data on causes or links to causes of autism in children. I am very concerned with thesestriking statistics. I am most concerned with the lack of informa-tion and the confusion surrounding the issue of vaccines and theirrelationship to autism. I hope that today we can come closer to discerning what the ap- propriate steps are for this committee and for Government to take.I hope to learn from testimony that will make this committee bet-ter understand where we need to focus research dollars, be itthrough vaccines, genetic or environmental factors, and the ques-tion of why is autism four times more prevalent in boys than ingirls. I hope to get some sense of what further studies are neededso that we can accelerate research on autism. There is no question in my mind that this is an issue of high pri- ority and that more studies are needed. That is why I wrote to ourRepresentative John Porter, who chairs the House Subcommitteeon Appropriations for Labor and Health and Human Services, re-questing an increase in funding for autism epidemiology researchat the National Center for Environmental Health within the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, an appropriation of $1.5million for the CDC to expand its epidemiology activities in autismfrom two isolated studies to a more national scope. An increase in funding for autism epidemiology research in 2001 will enable CDC to expand monitoring efforts to other parts of thecountry. This will allow them to better understand the prevalenceof autism spectrum disorders \u2014information which is necessary to eventually discover prevention, treatment, and a cure for autism. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb that the choice of this ribbon with its puzzle pieces as the symbol of autism, with the heart in the center, is most appropriate. I yield back and look forward to hearing from the witnesses.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage.Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I can hardly begin to thank you enough for holding this hearing. It is astounding to see all of these people who have come from allover the Nation, and I understand, Mr. Chairman, that you havearranged for two overflow rooms, and I noticed that the hall waspacked when I came in. I rarely ask to make an opening statement, but I am unable to overstate the importance of this particular issue, and I look for-ward to hearing the testimony from the witnesses today and learn-ing more. Mr. Chairman, oftentimes, I focus on the larger issues at hand when I address the committee, but I too am the grandparent of anincredibly handsome autistic child \u2014an incredible boy. I cannot overemphasize how much autism affects education and family cohe-siveness in the most loving of families. All of these are irretrievablyaffected when autism is discovered in one 's own family. Mr. Chairman, when Timmy was born, neither my daughter nor my son-in-law knew that he was autistic. They did not have a clue.He was the youngest of four children, so his parents thought theyknew what to expect in raising a baby. It was only later that theyrealized that there was something very different about Timmy.When he was diagnosed with autism, we were all worried and sad-dened. How would our family deal with this? How could he be edu-cated, and how could we best provide for his future? How could,how could how could? And it went on. We had hundreds if not thousands of questions. We were shocked and frightened and worried and relieved to know what it was, allat the same time. At the same time, none of us knew what the fu-ture held, and the questions kept coming. That is why I am so very grateful to you, Mr. Chairman, for your courage and willingness to deal in areas that the Congress usuallyis not willing to open its mind to. Timmy is now 8 and is a beautiful young boy whom we are all immensely proud of. However, I cannot understate the challengesthat our family still faces. Parents are desperate to find an answerto their questions. They want so much for their children to haveintegrative and communicative lives. Oftentimes, they feel at aloss, almost desperate, in trying to find answers to their questions.Many of my family 's questions still remain. Day after day, we still search for answers. It is an overriding concern with all of us. While our questions are not all easily answered, even the begin- ning of the questions, we do somehow manage to look toward abrighter future for Timmy than we ever thought possible after hisinitial diagnosis. He was a gifted child in a number of areas, par- ticularly music. But we still want to learn how to unlock the fullpotential of his future. All too often, people will write off such potential, but it is there. We are all sure of it. You can literally look in his eyes and see it. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb is a very strange disorder. When Timmy was diagnosed, we were told that medical science did not know thecause of it. We were told that Timmy had about a 4 percent chanceof leading a normal life, depending on his IQ. They thought autismwas probably genetic, but they really just were not sure. After much research, we discovered his current schooling pro- gram, which is based on extensive research done by Dr. Iver Lovassof California. At first, quite simply, we encountered a vacuum ofknowledge when it came to autism, and that shocked me. However,what shocked me even more was learning that the rate of autismhas increased over the past several years, and the statistics whichyou show today, Mr. Chairman, are incredibly shocking. I continue to be surprised when I discover that some studies have found preliminary evidence of a link between autism and vac-cines, and evidence linking dietary health to autism. Vaccines anddietary health are issues that I have been very interested in forsome time now, and I look forward to hearing from the witnesseswho will address these links. Mr. Chairman, we understand from the research that was the foundation of Dr. Lovass ' program, ''Ready, Set, Go, '' that the chances of Timmy leading a normal life rose from 4 percent tonearly 20 percent, and this is based on the intensive behavioralintervention program developed after decades of research by Dr.Lovass. You can imagine the impact this program has had oncountless children and their families. Research in this area changes lives, as I am sure research re- garding vaccinations and dietary health has changed the lives ofnumerous others. The astounding results of research into this ter-rible disorder have changed the lives of many families, and as a re-sult of this research, I am aware of families that have literally up-ended their lives to move across the country in search of programslike that of Dr. Lovass. Mr. Chairman, there are some remarkable programs that have developed over the years with regard to autism, in particular someamazing advances in educating autistic children. But we still needmore answers. Mr. Chairman, again, let me thank you and the committee and the hard-working staff of the committee for holding this criticallyimportant hearing. For better or for worse, we must deal with thissubject. This committee is taking a very important first step. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much, Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Mr. Kucinich.Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have to first inform you that I have a markup and votes in an- other committee, so I will not be able to stay. But I did want tocome here specifically to support the cause of this hearing and yourefforts in this regard. While I agree with Mr. Waxman when he says the history of vac- cinations has shown a lot of benefits, it is important for science totake note of the increased reporting with respect to rates of autismin recent years. If we have a higher incidence of autism, this is anappropriate subject for a congressional inquiry, and I think it isalso appropriate for us to ask questions not only of the witnesses VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb but of the industry producing these vaccines. I am par- ticularly interested in what are their production protocols for thevaccines which our children receive; how are the vaccines beingmade; what is in the vaccines; are there any differences in how thevaccines were made years ago and how they are made today; arethere any different products in there? These are questions which could lend themselves to an under- standing of why there is an increased rate today, and it seems tobe different than what it was years ago. So I think that when you see the heartfelt concern which is ex- pressed here, the witnesses who are appearing and are scheduledto appear, and when you see that there are scientists who are will-ing to address the question of a causal link between autism and avaccine, and when you have a scientist who is ready to say maybethere is not a causal link \u2014the fact that this debate has begun here suggests an important moment in this Congress and in this countryon the issue of autism. We need to find out if there is a link, andif there is a link, we need to go right back to the way the vaccineis made and what it is made of \u2014because the problem may not be in our children; the problem may be in what our children are beinggiven. So I thank you very much for your diligence, Mr. Chairman, and for your commitment and for your quality of heart on issues of pub-lic health importance. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Kucinich, and I want to thank you for all the help you have given us on a whole host of issues relatingto the health of the people of this country. Mr. K UCINICH . I want to say I would not be on this committee if it were not for Mr. Waxman inviting me to be on this committee,and I am on it because of my deep respect for Mr. Waxman, whomI revere as not just our leader, but for me, he has been a personalhero. But I think I am on a committee with two of the best peoplein the House, so I am pretty fortunate. Thanks.Mr. B URTON . I hope everybody heard that. That was from the other side of the aisle. [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . Mr. Ose has said he does not have an opening statement. Mr. Hutchinson, do you have an opening statement?Mr. H UTCHINSON . No, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . OK. We will now proceed with our witnesses. As a practice, especially since we are talking about something as important as the variousproblems that have been occurring with you folks with autistic chil-dren, I would like to ask everybody to rise. On our first panel, we have Mr. Kenneth Curtis, Mr. James Smythe, Ms. Shelley Reynolds, Ms. Jeana Smith, Mr. Scott Bono,and Dr. Wayne Dankner. Would all of you raise your right hands, please?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Please be seated. Mr. Curtis, would you like to start? What I would like to ask, be- cause we have 19 witnesses, and this is a very big hearing today,is if you could try to confine your remarks to 5 minutes. Some of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb who have technical expertise that they want to express will be allowed a little latitude, but if you could stick close to 5minutes, we would really appreciate it. Mr. Curtis, would you like to start? STATEMENTS OF KENNETH CURTIS, CATONSVILLE, MD; JAMES BONO, DURHAM, NC; AND DR. WAYNE M. DANKNER, SANDIEGO, CA Mr. C URTIS . Certainly. Mr. Chairman, all of you, first of all, thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of my son \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Would you pull the mic a little closer? The mics do not pick up as well as we hope. Mr. C URTIS . Sure. Leave it to the radio guy to mess up the micro- phone. Thank you again for this opportunity to speak on behalf of my son, my family, and children with autism nationwide; but mostlyI am speaking on behalf of my son, because this is really his story. Autism does not announce itself in the delivery room. When our son Morgan Scott was born, he looked like a Sharpei dog \u2014he was wrinkled from head to toe. Things were sort of storybook for us atthat time. We had a girl and a boy, a mom and a dad, and life waskind of like a picnic. But the clouds were rolling in, as it were. Slowly, little drops of doubt began to fall. We wondered about the way he liked to watch Disney videos over and over, or how hewould spin around and make strange noises and look at things outof the corner of his eye; the way he liked to line up his toys. Dropafter drop \u2014we wondered, and we waited to see what would hap- pen. He did not talk, and most of the time, he did not even seem to hear us. So we worried some more, and we wondered, until all ofthese little drops were like a downpour \u2014and of course, we had to take cover. Our doctor suggested a hearing test, but his ears were fine. He just would not talk. We tried speech therapy, but he still would nottalk. Even with all of these odd behaviors, my son was a happyenough kid. He was loving, affectionate, he was ticklish, stubborn \u2014 just like any kid \u2014but he would not talk. Finally, when Morgan was a little more than 2 years old, we had a word for it, and the word was more terrifying and confusing thanany of the things we were dealing with at the time. Of course, theword was autism. But what did that mean? Of course, we thought of ''Rain Man, '' but we also thought of all the horrible stories you hear about kidswho repeatedly bang their heads against the wall, or bite, scratch,and sit in a corner, rocking and hugging themselves. Is it possiblethat this could be our little boy? It did not seem real \u2014but obvi- ously, it was. Morgan was diagnosed as ''moderately autistic, '' a term I have al- ways thought to be a bit like being ''moderately pregnant. '' So we began to immerse ourselves in information. We were determined tolearn everything possible about autism \u2014and when I say ''we,'' I really mean my wife Kimberly. You have never seen a woman on VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb until you have seen a mother determined to save her child. There is no match for a mother 's love. She read, she re- searched, she investigated, while I tried to come to terms with theidea that I might never be able to shoot hoops with my son. Before long, we had a plan. We opted for the one-to-one intensive ABA therapy program developed by Dr. Lovass at UCLA. We spentthousands of dollars, wrangled with the school system, hired law-yers, lived in my grandmother 's house to save on rent, and we began teaching our son in-home. For 5 years, Morgan had between 30 and 40 hours a week of one- on-one therapy. At age 4, my son had more college friends thanmost fraternity brothers. He learned to read a little, to spell a lit-tle, to use the toilet \u2014and most importantly, he learned how to lis- ten to people, and he even began to talk a little bit. I am a radio guy \u2014I talk for a living \u2014and the irony of having a son who does not know how to communicate with words is not loston me. I know there are things that my son wants to say to me,and as he gets older, I can look into his eyes and see the frustra-tion and the confusion. There is a little boy inside of him some-where, and it is as if he is lost. This is really what it is like. It is like being in the mall with your child, and you look down and discover he is not there anymore \u2014 that sickening feeling you get in the pit of your stomach. Exceptthat every once in a while, I catch a glimpse of the real boy \u2014the way his eyes light up when you bring the Christmas tree home; theway he smiles when he jumps into the pool, or the way he sits per-fectly still, enraptured, when he got to see the symphony. He lovesmusic, he loves animals, he loves trains, books, swings, ice cream,and even his family, of course. But he cannot tell me his favorite color, or how his day at school was, or what hurts when he falls off the swing set. He still has notfigured out how to express or reveal himself. And he does not seemto understand why this is so important to us. I want to know why my son is locked inside himself. Is there a genetic disposition? Is it environmental? Is it something in thewater? Do pesticides cause it \u2014preservatives; antibiotics; immuni- zations; Nutrasweet; the time he fell and hit his head? It soundscrazy, but these are the things we have all heard and thoughtabout, and the truth is we have no idea why our son is autistic,and we have to accept that. But we love our son so much that we can never give up hope that he will 1 day carry on a conversation with us or even just say, ''Hi, Dad, '' when I come home from work. Morgan is a truly beautiful person in his own right just as he is right now. I have never met anyone, and I doubt I ever will, wholives more in the moment than my son. He is affectionate, imagina-tive, and even humorous sometimes. And I have learned more fromhim than I have from any other single person in my entire life. Heis autistic, and that is just the way he is. But not everybody is as lucky as we are. Morgan is not aggres- sive or self-injurious like a lot of individuals with autism. He is 8years old. I have had a lot of time to come to terms with this. Evenso, the frustration of dealing with autism is nearly eclipsed by thefrustration and the lack of concrete information about this disorder. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb to be considered rare, the kind of thing you see in movies or read about in books, but it never actually happened toanyone you knew. In January of this year, the Autism Society ofAmerica estimated that autism had increased from 15 out of every10,000 individuals to 1 in 500. And the repercussions of this in-crease are so far-reaching. These children will need specialized education and appropriate care for the rest of their lives. Are we honestly ready for this? Areour schools equipped to handle this increase? This overwhelmingsurge in this disorder is not just going to affect individual families.This is going to impact our community and the entire world inwhich we live. My son is a beautifully colored thread in the fabric of my family. But even so, 1 in every 500 families should not have to live withthis disorder. And what if these numbers keep increasing? So here I am today, wearing the only suit that I own, discussing my son before the legislative arm of the ruling body of the greatestNation in the world. Believe me, testifying here today is one of themost important things I have ever done, and with all due respectto the tremendous body of work before each of you, I would like tothink that it is a very important day for you as well. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much, Mr. Curtis. Mr. Smythe.[The prepared statement of Mr. Curtis follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you very much, Congressman Burton, Con- gressman Waxman, and other Members of Congress, for this oppor-tunity to speak here for my son and for the tens of thousands ofautistic children around this country and the millions of peoplewho are affected by this, literally \u2014parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, and so on. I will keep my remarks to 5 minutes, but I would like to make three points here, and I would like you to write these down. The first is that living with these children can be hell. They can destroy your entire home. You cannot keep anything nice around.They will ruin your rugs. They will jump off the furniture. Theywill move the furniture around the room, push it over, breakthings, clear counters with one sweep of the arm. And they do allof these things with no malice whatsoever. One cannot take them to friends ' homes. One cannot stay over- night at friends ' homes. When one is at a friend 's or a relative 's home, they will be worse there because it is a strange environment. The second point is that no one to my knowledge is consistently measuring acquired autism. And Congressman Waxman, you men-tioned that there is no causal connection between autism and vac-cines. Mr. W AXMAN . I did not say that. Mr. S MYTHE . That there is no measurable causal connection. Mr. W AXMAN . I said there is a theory, and that theory is still controversial. Mr. S MYTHE . Is unproven. And I would suggest to you that we are now defining autism behaviorally; that certain activity, certainbehaviors on the part of these children cause them to be classifiedas autistic, and then, most of the medical community gives up. Andthere is a difference between classical autism, a child who is bornautistic, that one knows is autistic, and most doctors have beentrained about autism because that is the way they were born, andthey show up that way; and this late-onset autism that we are see-ing, this acquired autism, if you will. There is a tremendous dif-ference, and there may be many different medical causes. But be-cause, in our language, we are not making that distinction, we arenot able to follow medical cures or even medical causation. So thatis an important distinction which I think needs to be made for allof us and by the NIH. If you look at the insurance companies, if a child is labeled autis- tic, they will not cover it. It does not matter what the cause of thatbehavior is. If you look at the educational models, if you speak tothe professionals in education, they do not have a distinction to myknowledge in the way that children who are acquired autistic aretrained, compared with children who are classically autistic, howthey are educated. The end result is that our educational modelsare not recognizing that some of these children may in fact justsimply be sick; they may just simply be diseased. As a result, weare letting them down, and they are going through the educational system basically being warehoused, without any treatment, eithermedically or educationally. From a financial standpoint, the stresses are huge. When one has an autistic child, suddenly, a whole new world of potential VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb opened up, and there is very little known on this sub- ject with regard to treatment. We have followed a number of different treatment programs \u2014au- ditory integration therapy, vision therapy, speech therapy, occupa-tional therapy, and sensory integration therapy. We have partici-pated in swimming and horseback riding, had CAT-scans, allergytesting, stool analysis and urine analysis, and all kinds of bloodanalysis. What we have noticed is that there is often kind of anuncaring attitude by the providers of many of these services, that''Maybe we will find out what is going on. '' But their house is not being destroyed. They do not have the motivation or the drive, itseems, to research this process. But it is very important to re-search. Our school system is so overwhelmed that a recent Indianapolis Star article said that the State of Indiana has now changed therules, so that a special education teacher can include anyone whohas a college degree. What kind of special education is that? Thereis such a need out there, and the burdens are only going to becomemuch greater. The waiting list for Indiana 's Medicaid waiver in order for a par- ent to get some financial assistance here is 3 years, and as I under-stand, it is growing \u2014it has to grow \u2014with the increase in the num- bers of these children. The ignorance in the insurance industry is phenomenal. I noticed that Secretary Shalala and the First Lady spoke about the use ofritalin in children, and I have heard that 10 to 20 percent of chil-dren are now on ritalin. Has it occurred to anyone that there mayvery well be and almost certainly is a causal connection that is re-lated between ADD and this increase in autism; that they may beall part of one spectrum? I suggest that this needs to be looked at.But we have to make distinctions in language in order to do that. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Smythe, if you could summarize, please, we would appreciate it. I know that you have a lot to cover, and wedo appreciate your testimony. Mr. S MYTHE . Thank you, Congressman. The bottom line is that there are ways to measure how at least some of what is now showing up as autistic behavior, seems to beimmune-related is affecting the brain differently from most of us,how it can be treated and then cured, and how the treatment itselfcan be seen to produce results in the return of blood flow to thebrain. I sincerely request that the members of this panel, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Secretary of Health andHuman Services look very carefully into this process and supportthe healing of these children \u2014at least the subset which is probably responsible for this large increase. Thank you very much.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Smythe. We appreciate you being here. Ms. Reynolds.[The prepared statement of Mr. Smythe follows:] VerDate Mr. Chairman and Members, my name is Shelley Reynolds. I live in Baton Rouge, LA with Aidan, my husband of 8years, and my children, Liam, who is 4, and Mairin, who is 2. Iwould like to thank you both for holding this hearing and allowingme to testify before you today. I met Aidan in the 10th grade. We were in love with each other from day one. We dated all through college, and we got married assoon as we graduated. We had our own house, two cars, two ca-reers, and two dogs. We were living the American dream. Right after we were married, Hurricane Andrew, one of the most destructive hurricanes to ever hit the United States, slammedthrough Baton Rouge. Sustained winds of 100 miles an hour rippedoff our roof, and 8 days without electricity left us with very littlefood or water. We promised each other we would never again beunprepared for such a disaster. But 6 years later, hurricane-force winds blew into our home again. This time, the disaster was the diagnosis of autism for ourfirst born son Liam. It completely tore our home apart, and the ef-fects have lasted much longer than 8 days. No amount of prepared-ness can ready you for a storm such as this. Liam was a normally developing baby until June 27, 1997, when he received his MMR and Hib vaccines. He did everything he wassupposed to do. He cooed, rolled over, crept, crawled, pulled up andwalked on time. He said ''Mamma, '' he said ''Daddy, '' he said ''Love you.'' He learned how to sing ''Itsy Bitsy Spider. '' He played finger games with us. He loved to interact, and he especially loved toshow off for his grandparents. We did all the well-baby checkups on time. I breast-fed him until he was 8 months old. I did not start solid foods until he was 4months old. We did everything completely by the book. But when he was 17 months old, shortly after he had received the shots, he started exhibiting some different behaviors. He wasconstantly taking off his shoes; he screamed if we dressed or un-dressed him; he would stare for hours in front of the television andwould not move if you blocked the view. He could not tolerate play-ing in the sandbox anymore. He did not want to sing any of his fa-vorite songs; he would cover his ears and scream ''No.'' We assumed he was just asserting his independence, since he was almost 2. And somewhere along the way, he developed chronic,nonspecific diarrhea, sometimes 8 to 10 times a day, and still suf-fers from that 3 years later. By April 1998, I realized that Liam was no longer saying ''Mamma '' or ''Daddy '' or ''Love you, '' so I took him for a speech and language evaluation. They told me that my 27-month-old child hadthe language capacity of an 8-month-old. This was a child who onlymonths before would chime in ''Ee-i-ee-i-o '' at the appropriate mo- ment when singing ''Old MacDonald. '' What had happened to our beautiful baby boy, and how could we help him? My husband and I decided to become advocates andwork for increased funding for autism research and awareness. Theanswers may not come in time to help our son, but we are hopefulthat we can persuade you to see the need for intensive research re-garding this disorder which is affecting more and more childrenevery year. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 case, we have no doubt that he developed his autism as a direct result of an adverse vaccine reaction. And personally,if I could strike the belief that my son 's autism sprang from a rou- tine childhood vaccination, that I held him down on the table forand had to go back to the Russian roulette of genetics, I would takeit in a heartbeat, because the pain of knowing that I inadvertentlycaused him harm due to blind trust in the medical community, ora matter of inconvenience of yet another office visit taking timeaway from my job is nearly unbearable. Many in the medical community continue to dismiss this as mere happenstance because autism often coincides with the time of vac-cination, and state that there is no scientific evidence to back thisup. My question to you is: How long does it take for a coincidenceto surface time and time and time again, case after case after case,before it can become a viable hypothesis, especially when the solu-tion to solving the problem seems so apparent? How can pharma-ceutical companies concoct substances with mercury, formaldehyde,antifreeze, lead, aluminum, aborted fetal tissue and live virusesand not expect that as they continue to pour these highly toxic andreactive substances into children, increasing dose after dose, all onthe same day, that it will not alter their minds and bodies? Why would it be so completely impossible for a child to contract a chronic form of the disease rather than to have the ''proper immunologic response, '' especially if their immune systems are not up to par? And where is their scientific evidence to back up theclaim that this cannot happen, when it is published in the verypackage inserts, in their writing, that they have not studied the ef-fects of these vaccines for more than a few weeks, or longer thanthe incubation of this disease itself? What happens when you give multiple doses in 1 day or combine different diseases into one hypodermic needle? I need someone to explain to me why it is acceptable to have products on the market that exposed my son to 37.5 microgramsof mercury in 1 day at a time when he should not have been ex-posed to more than .59 micrograms of mercury given his bodyweight. I should not be exposed to more than 5 micrograms, andI have 31 years of an immune history behind me. It is completelyunacceptable. One size does not fit all when it comes to vaccines. Through our organization, Unlocking Autism, we have talked with thousands and thousands of parents from across the country,and their story is the same: Child is normal; child gets vaccine;child disappears within days or weeks into the abyss of autism. If you doubt me, I invite you to come to the ''Hear Their Silence '' rally on April 8th on the Mall, where the ''Open Your Eyes '' project will be displayed and view the thousands of pictures that we havecalled and realize that 47 percent of those people who participatedbelieve that vaccines contributed in some way to the developmentof their child 's autism. Parents like me are relying on you to demand that the pharma- ceutical companies retrace their steps once again and that the pub-lic health community look at the possibility that these things mightindeed not just be a coincidence. They obviously have a forced mar-ket. They manufacture products that are required for every childin this country. We fear that it is possible that while seeking great- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 profits, there may be some who have lost sight of the medical community 's original goal regarding vaccinations \u2014to pro- tect children from harm. I know my children, and I know what happened to my son. As far as I am concerned, the needle that silently slipped into mybaby 's leg that day became the shot heard around the world. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Reynolds. Ms. Smith.[The prepared statement of Ms. Reynolds follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Chairman and Members, I am Jeana Smith. I live in Denham Springs, LA with my husband Darrell and our foursmall children \u20145-year-old genetically identical twins, Jesse and Jacob, 3-year-old Garrett, and 16-month-old Julianna. Darrell and I have always loved children, and we tried for over 6 years to have a child. We simply gave up on the idea that it waspossible, and then I discovered I was pregnant with not one buttwo babies. I was completely overwhelmed. Perhaps because I had tried so hard to have a child, I took espe- cially good care of my body while I was pregnant with the twins.Our identical twins were born right on time and were completelyhealthy. We were absolutely thrilled. Our family was perfect. One month later, we found dark blood mixed in with Jacob 's di- arrhea. Jacob had never had diarrhea before. We immediately tookhim to the doctor, who assured us that there was no problem. Hementioned that in the chaos that generally follows the birth oftwins, we had been released from the hospital without them receiv-ing their hepatitis B vaccine and wanted to give it to Jacob thatday. I questioned him, because it did not seem right to give a poten- tially ill child a vaccine, but he convinced me that it was routineand safe and not to worry. Two months later, Jacob received his second hepatitis B vaccine and Jesse his first. On the same day, Jacob and Jesse both receivedtheir first DPT, polio, and Hib vaccination. From that day on,Jacob was constantly coming down with one ear, respiratory, orsinus infection after another. Jacob was constantly on antibiotics. As his mother, I was heartbroken to see him sick or in pain prac- tically all the time. As a new mom, I was embarrassed and frus-trated to have a child who was always ill. I knew I was doing ev-erything I could for him, and I could not understand why he wasconstantly ill. Jacob met every developmental milestone that first year, right along with Jesse. They were two little peas in a pod and went ev-erywhere together. At only 16 months of age, Jacob and Jesse re-ceived their first MMR vaccine. On this same day, they also re-ceived their fourth DPT, their fourth Hib, and their third hepatitisB. The following 24 hours, both twins slept most of the time, withover 100-degree temperatures, in spite of receiving the rec-ommended Tylenol dosage every 6 hours. Immediately followingthat, Jacob began exhibiting strange behaviors. He was no longerexcited or responsive when Daddy would come home from work. Hebegan to become preoccupied with certain toys. He would spendlong periods of time studying the way their wheels would spin orwhether or not they were lined up just right. Any attempt to inter-rupt or distract him was met with great resistance and an eventualfit. During this time, Jesse continued to progress, starting to talkand interact with all the children around him. Back to the doctor we went again, but this time with even bigger concerns about the growing developmental difference between Jesseand Jacob. And once again we were met with the ''dominant twin '' theory, that Jacob would probably be more quiet, Jacob would prob-ably want to play by himself more often, and Jacob is fine, stopworrying. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 would not stand the undeniable difference between their language and communication skills. Something was most defi-nitely wrong with Jacob. He could not express even the most sim-plest needs or wants. He could not ask for juice or something toeat. Jesse was chattering constantly. And at times, Jacob was sowithdrawn that we could absolutely not reach him. On days when Jacob is overloaded from sounds, colors, or lights, we cannot go anywhere. Autism not only isolates the individualwhom it affects; it isolates the entire family. My husband and Ihave to go to the grocery store independently. When our other chil-dren have programs at school or birthday parties, one of us has tostay home, because Jacob cannot stand the outside stimulation.Our vacations have changed to only being able to go to the beach \u2014 no amusement parks, no baseball games, no family outings. Unlike most parents of an autistic child, I do not have to wonder what Jacob would have been like. I know what he would have beenlike. I see what he would have been like every day in Jesse 's eyes. I see Jesse excelling in school and in social activities. I see Jesseexcited about T-ball; I know that Jacob will probably never play T-ball and that he cannot attend birthday parties. For us, there is no denying that in Jacob 's case of autism, the answer does not lie in genetics, but in a catalyst. The thousandsof hours of research that we have spent searching and retracing hisregression continue to point to the fact that the road of Jacob 's au- tism began when his immune system was damaged by the hepatitisB vaccine he received when he was ill. The final blow was the ad-verse reaction to the host of vaccines he received 16 months later.We are certain that for Jacob, the catalyst was his vaccine. I cannot bear the thought that after waiting so long and being so careful carrying my twins, I was so easily persuaded to immu-nize Jacob without knowing all that I should. I should have takenthe time to find out what his risk of contracting hepatitis B at only1 month old was. I did not do that. I should have found out aboutall the toxic metals that are used to manufacture the vaccines. Idid not do that. I should have known back then what I do today.I did not. I trusted his pediatrician. I trusted the CDC. I was per-suaded to believe that I was doing the best thing I could to protectmy child. No scientist, doctor, researcher or parent looking for answers or resources should never have to question where the funding willcome from. It has to be here, and it has to be here now. I imploreyou to act now. Please \u2014we do not have the time to wait for an- other hearing and another panel of parents and experts to adviseus that this epidemic is waiting in the wings. We are swiftly andsilently losing a generation of children to this disease that possiblycould have been avoided. Please let this country be the leader inseeing the percentages of autism decrease and not increase. Every night, Darrell and I tuck two beautiful little boys into bed. On the outside, they look the same. Their pajamas are the same;their bed covers are the same. Everything on them is the same.They have the same ears, and they have matching toes. As Darrelland I sit in between their beds, we talk to Jesse about his day. Hegives us all the details of his day at school and tells us everythinghe did with his friends. He talks about how excited he is for the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb will come this weekend. He talks to Dar- rell about working on his batting swing to prepare for T-ball in thesummer. As he drifts off to sleep, we turn and look at Jacob. We know that even at only 5 years old, Jacob will never be able to enjoy thesimple pleasures of childhood the way Jesse does. He will never beon a sports team. He cannot enjoy the fulfillment of a birthdayparty or friends. This difference is real. We know that Jacob 's au- tism will not go away. When they fall asleep, we once again see two beautiful, matching faces. We know what should have been. It is the only time thattheir faces match. Even though they are identical, Jacob 's coun- tenance left when he was 16 months old. The light behind his eyeswas replaced with a blank, lost, bewildered stare. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Smith. [The prepared statement of Ms. Smith follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ONO. Before I begin, I would like to give you the perspective of an autistic parent. Right now, I am more nervous about where my son is, because I do not see him, than I am about being before you today. That isa constant worry in the mind of a parent of an autistic child. My name is Scott Bono, and I live in Durham, NC with my wife Laura and my children, Dylan, Ashley, and Jackson. I have readthe testimony and heard the stories of other parents in similar cir-cumstances \u2014change that to ''identical circumstances. '' Our story is not much different. We had a perfectly normal pregnancy and birth of our son. In the first 16 months of life, he learned language, played with toys, ap-propriately began pretending skills, initiated contact with his twinsisters, and could light up a room with his wonderful personality.He was brighter than most, and he could even tell the differencebetween a Concord jet and a 727 at such an early age. On August 9, 1990, Jackson would begin a journey into silence, bewilderment, and a medical enigma. That was the day he receivedhis MMR immunization. He would not sleep that night. In the daysto follow, he would develop unexplained rashes and horrible con-stipation and diarrhea. After eating, he would experience projectilevomiting that would scare him. His normally very healthy body was being ravaged by an in- vader. Over the next weeks, he would slip away, unable to listenor speak. He retreated into what we now know as autism. He be-came allergic to everything in his world. His immune markers sky-rocketed. What was the reason for this change? It is my sincerest believe that it was that shot. The single biggest challenge in raising an autistic child is getting appropriate, informed, and competent medical services. As I sit be-fore you today, autism is, as it has been for decades, viewed as apsychological disorder. I cannot help but wonder about and getfrustrated by the lack of medical and physiological intervention forall of these children. I live just 3 miles from Duke University Medical Center, yet for one of the most effective treatments for Jackson 's gastrointestinal problems, I drive 12 hours for a procedure that takes 5 minutes.I have been doing this for the past 2 12years and will be making this trip 13 times this year alone. To dismiss Jackson's acidic diarrhea for 7 years because ''autistic children sometimes do that'' is just what happened. That is just un-acceptable. As my son's advocate, I know that he is not receivingthe medical treatment he needs, and I believe that as long as au-tism is regarded as a psychological disorder, this will always be thecase. We need and seek responsible, effective and caring physicianswho do not dismiss the patient's ailments as ''behaviors,'' but lookat them as treatable medical conditions with appropriate medicalintervention. This is what I believe to be the single biggest problem in getting group insurers to pay for medical services. Insurers must pay ac-cording to their contract. It is the law. But if a doctor says the visitto his office is for the treatment of autism when the autistic childis being seen for gastrointestinal distress, the insurer will not pay VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 If, however, the diagnostic code for the visit shows that it is for gastrointestinal distress, the bill will be paid. The diag-nosis of autism is used as a shield by some insurers to deflect theresponsibility of paying for medical and remedial treatment forthese children 's medical problems. The expenses of seeing Jackson 's needs are overwhelming \u2014hun- dreds of thousands of dollars over the past 8 years. After goingthrough all of our savings and retirement, we continue to accumu-late debt to meet his educational and therapeutic needs and hismedical needs. Our priority right now is to get him well. There are other costs besides financial. Jackson is on a very strict diet that takes timeand money. If he eats offending foods, he gets a rash, has diarrhea,and we will not sleep for the next 5 nights. His behaviors will wors-en. How do I put a cost on not sleeping for 6 years? How do I put a cost on attention not paid to my daughters because I am seeingto the needs of my son? How do I put a cost on locking every doorand window at all times for fear of him wandering out of thehouse? Financial burden is only part of it. It is only part of the picture that families with autistic children face. If the price of eradicatingmeasles, mumps, rubella, or any other illness is thousands of autis-tic children or health-impaired children, is it worth it? Have wesimply traded acute illness for chronic disease? Is that worth theprice? Autism has reached epidemic proportions, and the numbers are still growing. We must allocate funds to find the cause and thecure. The U.S. Department of Education indicates the increase inautism is 900 percent in the 8 years since 1992. If tooth decay wentup 900 percent, we would be scrambling for answers. The statistics can no longer be ignored. Thousands of parents who claim their children were developing normally until the MMRvaccine should no longer be ignored. We all cannot be wrong. As elected officials, you hold the public trust, the essence of faith in Government. Your challenge is to uphold that trust. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much, Mr. Bono. Dr. Dankner.[The prepared statement of Mr. Bono follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 committee members, fellow panel partici- pants and members of the audience, I feel privileged today to ap-pear before this committee to share my perspectives on autism,foremost as a parent but also from the additional perspectives asa pediatric infectious disease specialist and a scientist engaged inclinical research and evidence-based medicine. My daughter Natalie, who is over there, is now nearly 13 years old, has autism, and has taught my family and me a lot about our-selves and how the world around us deals with individuals who ap-pear different from the norm. She has been both a joy and a realchallenge to live with, and we continue to live through these expe-riences every day, and I want to emphasize that. We have weathered this storm by rejoicing in her triumphs and finding humor in past events, even when those events may haveseemed unbearable at that time. And I should add that my wife,unfortunately, is the one who has to bear most of these unpleasantexperiences. We have found that our daughter 's greatest needs have been in the area of education and for a highly structured environment toallow her some control over the events of her life. It is in the areaof education that we have experienced our greatest challenge andhave been labeled by our local school district administrators as themost difficult parents they have had to deal with. In the contextof that meeting, we found this statement an insult, and there wereother personal comments made to my wife that essentially haveput her in a position where she will not talk to the school districtadministrators any longer. But we have been convinced by our friends and family that we should wear this as a badge of honor. If anything, it highlights theadvocacy that we have championed for our daughter 's right to an appropriate education that addresses her individual needs and themanner in which she learns best. I should point out that probablyevery parent on this panel is his or her own child 's best advocate. My greatest hope today is that members of this committee and the audience will gain a better understanding of the unique natureof autism, the challenges and demands placed upon families caringfor autistic children and adults, the significant emotional, financial,and community resources required to prepare and involve these in-dividuals in everyday life, and to accept and respect these individ-uals for who they are. However, as previously mentioned, I also come to this committee as a trained infectious disease specialist and clinical scientist and,therefore, feel compelled to comment on two other areas of impor-tance to me. In the area of medical and other treatments intendedto help autistic children function to the best of their ability, I wouldhope to see more funding to allow for appropriately controlled andconducted studies to rapidly determine the true effectiveness ofthese interventions so that families can make informed decisionsregarding the best use of their limited resources, as we have heard from a number of the panel participants already. Without thesestudies, I and other parents of autistic children are forced to makedecisions which may at times prove disadvantageous to all in-volved, without the benefits of real data. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 also wish to comment on the current concerns regarding the potential causes for the perceived increase in autism. I implorethe committee to be cautious in its statements and conclusions withregard to possible links to environmental factors and medical fac-tors, especially immunizations. Recognizing that there are otherparents on this panel who may feel otherwise \u2014in fact, definitively feel otherwise \u2014as a pediatric infectious disease specialist, I have seen no sound evidence linking autism to the MMR or any othervaccine, yet there is considerable evidence proving that the MMRvaccine is safe and highly effective in protecting children from seri-ous diseases. In closure, no matter what conclusions are formed today or where the activities of these hearings may lead, I would like toshare an axiom of medicine I have learned, practice daily, and con-tinue to teach to future doctors: Above all, do no harm. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. of all, I 'll start with you, Dr. Dankner. Your daughter \u2014whom I see sitting over there and is a lovely young lady\u2014acquired her autistic condition \u2014was this from birth? Dr. D ANKNER . No. She had the typical description that has been more commonly described of showing behaviors that became moreand more obvious from about 14 to 18 months of age. Mr. B URTON . When she was 14 months or thereabouts, did she receive any shots? Dr. D ANKNER . She received the normal vaccine schedule of im- munizations as recommended by the American Academic of Pediat-rics and the \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . What shots were those? Dr. D ANKNER . She received her MMR at about 1512months of age. Mr. B URTON . And when did she manifest or change? Dr. D ANKNER . She was manifesting subtle changes before that. It was obvious to us; we just did not know what to attribute it toat that time or what the issues were. We used to joke that com-pared to our older son, she seemed to be on an ''independent study program. '' Mr. B URTON . Did she receive any other shots when you started seeing the manifestation of autism? Dr. D ANKNER . She had received her previous shots at about 6 months of age. Mr. B URTON . And had she received any others close to the time she started developing autism? Dr. D ANKNER . Not at that time, no. Mr. B URTON . There were no other shots? Dr. D ANKNER . No, because at 12 months, essentially, you just get your PPD to screen for tuberculosis, which in California is poten-tially prevalent. Mr. B URTON . When she started manifesting these signs, did she get worse after the MMR shot, or did it have any effect at all? Dr. D ANKNER . We did not notice any difference in her behavior; in fact, she got her second dose of MMR at about 5 years of age,and there was definitively no change in her behavior after that.She pretty much continued on in her mode of autistic behavior thatrequired, in our opinion, a definitive educational approach to ad-dress her needs. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. Mr. Bono, when did your child start manifesting signs of autism?Mr. B ONO. Within about 30 days of the MMR. Mr. B URTON . So when did \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ONO. Quite honestly, when my wife had said, ''Don't you see?'' I think mothers have a much keener sense of behaviors with their infants. Mr. B URTON . I understand, but what I am trying to find out is she received the MMR shot, and you and your wife started noticinga change \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ONO. Indeed; exactly. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. In 30 days, you said? Mr. B ONO. Well, within hours of the shot, we went home, and there was no sleeping that night, and he had rashes on hisbody \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 got progressively worse? Mr. B ONO [continuing]. And over the next week, there were gas- trointestinal problems, and finally, full blown behaviors that wereodd. Mr. B URTON . And how old was your child when that started? Mr. B ONO. I think it was right at 16 months. Mr. B URTON . Sixteen months. Ms. Smith, when did your child start manifesting a change in be- havior? Ms. S MITH . Well, at 16 months when they received the host of multiple vaccines, including the \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Which were what? What were all those shots? Ms. S MITH . The DPT, the Hib \u2014it was their fourth DPT, their fourth Hib, their third hepatitis B, and their first MMR on thatday\u2014they came home, they slept for 24 hours, most of that time, did not eat a whole lot, long periods of sleep, had over 100-degreetemperatures in spite of giving them Tylenol before the vaccine andduring the entire 24 hours. After that time, I figured, well, Jacob is sick again, because he was just kind of out of it and did not seem real interested inmuch \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But this was at about 16 months \u2014\u2014 Ms. S MITH . Right, right. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. That you started seeing the manifest change in the child with autism. Ms. S MITH . Right. And when we did go to the pediatrician, they just passed it off as his asserting his independence. Mr. B URTON . OK. Ms. Reynolds.Ms. R EYNOLDS . Liam got his shot on June 27, 1997. That is when he got his MMR and his Hib. That was the day before he turned17 months old. A week later, I went to visit my parents in Mary-ville, TN for July 4th, and we started seeing some very strange, dif-ferent behaviors showing up then. He would not come when wecalled his name. He was doing weird pattern movements upagainst the wall \u2014but it was within a week. Mr. B URTON . So it was right after he received the MMR shot. Ms. R EYNOLDS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . OK. Mr. Smythe.Mr. S MYTHE . At about 20 months, our son \u2014I included in the record his vaccine schedule and my other children 's, and interest- ingly, he was given hepatitis B the day he was born and then re-ceived the other two shots, one of them 30 days later, and anotherabout 8 months later. He received 12 vaccines in the first 6months, as the record shows, as compared to our other childrenwho did not, in fact, receive the hepatitis B until a year after hereceived his third shot. Mr. B URTON . When did he start \u2014\u2014 Mr. S MYTHE . Right after the MMR, at 20 months. Mr. B URTON . At 20 months, right after the MMR. So you four people right here are all in concert that right after the MMR shot, you started seeing the manifest change in your chil-dren. Is that correct? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 . Yes. Ms. R EYNOLDS . Yes. Mr. B ONO. Yes. Mr. B URTON . And your child, Mr. Curtis? Mr. C URTIS . I guess I have to be the dissenting opinion on this end of the table. I do not really remember the specific day of Mor-gan's MMR shots or any of his immunizations. He did not really exhibit any behaviors \u2014it was not anything that he did \u2014it was what he never did. It was the fact that he never talked. And again,as I mentioned, it was a very gradual process. I think his idiosyn-cratic behaviors of lining up his toys and the self-stimulatory be-havior, the flapping of the hands, the spinning, all really startedafter he was 2 years old. It seemed like once we had a word forit, then it almost got worse. We have thought about this a lot, because this is a very common theory. You read about it on the net, and you talk with other par-ents, and my wife and I have both discussed it at length, and wereally do not see any correlation between the time of his immuniza-tions and the onset of any specific or more intense behaviors. Mr. B URTON . OK. My last question, then, would be did you notice shortly after his birth, as he was progressing, some problems then? Mr. C URTIS . I think, yes. The reason I say ''I think '' is because we wanted to believe that he was a late talker, a late developer.The only thing we noticed was that he was not speaking and thathe did not seem to react to the things that we did with him \u2014but otherwise, he was a very normal, happy baby. He played, heinteracted, he made lots of noises. He just never formed words andalmost did not seem to react to our speech. For a long time, we were very concerned about his hearing, that maybe he did not hear properly. In fact, when his hearing was test-ed, in the first test, they said he was deaf, and once they did thebrainstem test that was conclusive, it turned out that his hearingwas absolutely fine; it was just that he was not reacting to soundor voice. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Curtis, very much. I want to yield \u2014go ahead. Mr. S MYTHE . I am sorry. I also noticed that my son was given the DPT vaccines the same day he was given the MMR. So he gotsix vaccines on the same day. Ms. S MITH . So did mine. Mr. S MYTHE . Yours did, also? OK. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Mr. Waxman.Mr. W AXMAN . It takes a lot of courage for all of you to be here, and I want you to know how much I appreciate it, especially whenyou are talking about something personal and painful. And, I knowyou are here to try to help us understand what you are goingthrough so that we can try to find out about autism, and so thatwe can spare others from going through what you are goingthrough. There is legislation \u2014this committee does not have legislative au- thority; it has the ability to hold hearings and get information. Butthe committee that has legislative jurisdiction, which I am also on, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb and there, we have a bill, H.R. 3301, which incorporates legislation by Congressman Greenwood, Con-gressman Bilirakis. Both Mr. Burton and I are on that bill, and itwould do a lot to research more about the prevalence and ways todeal with autism. I hope that will give us some of these answersthat we so desperately want. Dr. Dankner, you are in a unique position. You are the father of an autistic child, and you are also a pediatrician and an expert oninfectious diseases. But your testimony, is that you do not thinkthere is sound evidence linking autism to the MMR vaccine. Howcan you say that when the other parents have given us evidencethat, in their view, their children developed autism after the vac-cine? Isn 't that sound evidence? As a scientist, how do you think we should consider it, and what do we need to prove that there isa connection, if there is one? Dr. D ANKNER . One thing is that I am not here to invalidate the testimony of the other individuals. I know that from their heart,they feel that these events occurred in relation to a specific timeand place, and it would be wrong for me to make a challenge toanyone on this panel. This is a personal issue for a number of theseindividuals. However, as a clinical scientist, when we do research \u2014I take care of HIV-infected children \u2014it is important to identify causal events so that we do not do, as I mentioned, harm on either sideof the fence of any of these issues. And I think it is important thatif this committee or the scientific world feels that there is notenough evidence to generate a causal link between vaccinationsand autism or any other disorder, those studies need to be doneand that people then should look at those studies in a critical view,with appropriate peer review, and all individuals who are purport-ing one position versus another should be able to stand under thelight of appropriate peer review to ensure that the scientific infor-mation is collected appropriately, analyzed appropriately, and dis-cussed in an open forum and not in closed sessions, to ensure thatthe best information is provided to everyone so that, again, best de-cisions can be made by individuals. I would like to bring a personal perspective as an infectious dis- ease doctor. Unlike the other panel members, I have been on theother side of the fence and have seen children who have beenharmed by vaccine-preventable diseases. I live close to the border,where the vaccination rate in Mexico is not the same as in theUnited States. I have seen children who have developed congenitalrubella, a lifelong disabling condition. I have seen children die ofmeasles during a measles epidemic in San Diego 10 years ago, evenwith the pretty reasonable vaccine rates for a highly transmissibledisease. I have seen children suffer from pertussis, hospitalized atsignificant rates. That position puts me in a position of being cautious about mak- ing any links, because if the vaccine rates fall in the United States, I can almost guarantee from my own personal experience thatthere will be individuals who will suffer on the other side of thefence, and those are the individuals that this committee usuallydoes not hear about. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 I am not a scientist. I studied science at different levels of my education, and when I studied science, I was told thatthere is a scientific method to try to get answers, and the scientificmethod sometimes took a theory or a hypothesis and then testedit, and you had trials and control groups, and you tried to find outwhether that theory is correct or not. Sometimes, theories turn outto be widely believed, but then they are discarded. We all studiedthe fact that in the past, people did not know about hygiene in con-nection with hospitals, which used to be among the most dangerousplaces to be because of the lack of hygiene. But you are a scientist \u2014the others on this panel are parents \u2014 but from a scientific method, are you saying the theory is abso-lutely incorrect, or are you saying that we just do not know enoughto say that it is correct? Dr. D ANKNER . There are other people who will testify today who I think can probably better answer that. I was asked to come onthe panel both as a parent and as a scientist. My reading of what has been correlated to date does not appear to indicate a causal link. I think that debate has not been settledand probably needs to be, so that we do not continue to move downavenues that may be less productive in terms of the resources thatare necessary to identify other potential links to autism, what theneeds are in the community, which I can tell you are great \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . Let me interrupt you because my time is up. Are you saying to us, in other words, that we should not be alarmedabout vaccinations and have parents refrain from having their kidsvaccinated because of this theory, which, at this point, you do notthink has gone through a scientific evaluation to be established asscientific fact? Dr. D ANKNER . I think an alarmist view is always of concern. I am a cautious individual, and I think we just need to be cautiousin how we approach this issue. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Dr. Dankner, I hope that you will have the ability to stay and hear some of the other scientists ' positions just for your own infor- mation. Dr. D ANKNER . I planned on it. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. Mrs. Morella.Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very moved by the testimony that I have heard and read today. You are indeed the heroes, and we see you as role models,and your children are very fortunate to have you as parents. Sothank you for being here. I think the only question I want to ask is to Mr. Bono. When you said that you had to travel 12 hours for a 5-minute treatment \u2014I do not know enough about the background to know what thattreatment is, why you have to travel 12 hours for it, and how youfound out about it. Mr. B ONO. I have to travel 12 hours, but that is deceiving, and first let me apologize. It is 6 hours up and 6 hours back in 1 day,so it is 12 hours. Mrs. M ORELLA . It is significant. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ONO. I have to travel because the treatment is not recog- nized as helping my son, and it is not approved. It is secretin, andthey call it a slow push, or an infusion of sorts. We found thatgoing up about every 28 days is a real good cycle for Jackson. With-out it, he will not have a normal bowel movement; he will haveacidic diarrhea, and he will not digest food properly, he will haveunexplained rashes. Mrs. M ORELLA . Who advised you that this would help him in that area? Is there another doctor who made the suggestion? Mr. B ONO. At the press conference, one of the doctors said that the parents have really been the ones in the forefront of findingtreatment options for their children, and this was a parent, too.Her name is Victoria Beck, and she serendipitously discovered se-cretin working for her child as the result of an endoscopy. Laura and I had always thought there was some connection be- tween the gut and the brain that needed to be bridged, and whenwe heard about Victoria 's experience, we were rather fascinated, and we began to read about it, and that is how we arrived at thattreatment. Mrs. M ORELLA . Dr. Dankner, I just want to briefly ask you \u2014it is your daughter who is autistic, but in general, as I mentioned inmy opening statement, there is a prevalence among males with re-gard to autism \u2014are there some unique challenges that you face with a female rather than a male with autism? Dr. D ANKNER . Oh, yes, and those challenges are becoming more apparent now that she has achieved puberty. Luckily, she respondsvery well to sequenced pictures. One of the social stories that wasprovided to her through her school at my wife 's insistence \u2014and I have to admit that she has taken the forefront on this \u2014is how to deal with menstruation. If you allow our daughter to do her ownthing, she gets into a pattern, and that pattern becomes very dif-ficult to break. And we have several holes in our wall for which wecould probably pay a drywall person a pretty sum of money to re-pair when she gets mad at things, she will kick holes here andthere. Luckily, we are having a room addition put on very soon, sothat will take care of the last patch jobs that we did. That is oneissue that came up. Another issue that my wife and I feel very concerned about is the risk for her to be sexually abused as she gets older because of herinability to really indicate or express interactions with other indi-viduals, as a number of the other panel discussants talked aboutwith older children. Our daughter comes home from school, andyou can ask her how her day went, and she will say ''Fine, '' but you will not be able to \u2014unless we are given a set of things that went on at school, she is not there to carry on small talk; that isnot a major impetus in her life. She will interact with us becauseshe has needs, and she will seek us out for those, but if left to herown devices, she will stay in her garage room, watch her TV, what-ever video she finds the most appealing that day, and she loves toplay with the reverse and replay buttons on a regular basis. So, yes, I think there are some special challenges, but I think there are challenges for males growing up with autism also. Thereare things that they are going to have to face as they get older, andas they get older, I think the challenges become different. And I VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb of the parents have to deal with the issue of what is going to happen to their children as they get older, who is going to takecare of them when the parents are beyond an age when they canno longer take care of these children. Mrs. M ORELLA . The toll on parents is immeasurable, obviously. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. Mr. Turner, do you have any questions?Mr. T URNER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Doctor, I just have one question for you, and I know this hearing centers on the problem of autism. The chairman has had personalexperience with it in his family, and I know that he has also hadsome experience with a granddaughter with the hepatitis B vac-cine. I just wonder \u2014is there any reason to question the age at which some of these vaccines are administered? I have always had thefeeling that the younger the child, the more fragile, and therefore,the negative impact, if it be there, the potential is certainly greaterwhen those vaccines are administered at an early age. I have, of course, had particular interest in the hepatitis B vac- cine which is administered, I think, in most States now at birth,routinely. In fact, I was in the home of a family in my district thisweekend who have a 2-year-old child who is severely disabled, andbasically, this family spends most of their waking hours tending tothe child, and they strongly suspect that the problem is the resultof a hepatitis B vaccination. That is administered at birth, and Ihave been told that there is really no logical argument for tryingto vaccinate a newborn, because the threat of hepatitis B does notexist at that early an age, but it might be a more appropriate vac-cine for later in childhood or approaching the teenage years. Is there any reason to question the timing of some of these vac- cines? One of our witnesses today talked about the large numberof vaccines administered at one time. Dr. D ANKNER . Again, I was not called to the panel, I think, to give a long explanation of vaccine policy. There are lots of other in-dividuals who have been involved in those policymaking decisionsover the years. But I can give you my perspective once again fromthe diseases that we see in these age groups. Albeit hepatitis B is an uncommon disease process that children may or may not get exposed to, the more likely exposure is goingto occur when they reach sexual debut, as we call it, when they caneasily be exposed to hepatitis B from a partner. That is one of themajor concerns, and hepatitis B is a major cause of chronic liverdisease in the United States and has reached a rate where vaccina-tion would definitely have an impact on that disease in terms ofits prevention. The reason for giving some vaccines earlier is just to ensure that the vaccination gets performed. Rubella is a perfect example. Whencongenital rubella was identified in the United States, Australiaand Europe as a devastating disease linked definitively to the ac-quisition of rubella by mothers who were previously uninfected,with no previous immunity to rubella, the approach was taken dif-ferently by different nations. If you look at the United States, they VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb the rubella vaccine early in life so that you would eliminate the pool of individuals who were exposing adults to rubel-la, whereas England took the approach of trying to vaccinate ado-lescent females primarily, because they were the, ''at-risk popu- lation '' who could transmit rubella to their unborn fetus. The expe- rience in England was that it took them a lot longer to eliminatecongenital rubella from their population, and the experience in theUnited States was an enormous success, because even though youhad women who were susceptible to rubella, they were not beingexposed, and as those children who got the rubella vaccine early inlife aged up into their childbearing years, they were no longer atrisk of developing congenital rubella. The result is that the UnitedStates sees probably about two, four, five cases of congenital rubel-la a year, and most of those are from individuals who have eithernot received vaccination or come from a foreign country where thevaccine rates are much lower. Additionally, the hemophilus influenza B vaccine, the vast major- ity of H-flu meningitis that we see occurred in children less than24 months of age. If you wait until they are 2 years of age to givethe vaccine, you have missed the peak period. We used to see atour Children 's Hospital in San Diego 60 to 70 cases of hemophilus influenza meningitis per year. That is a pretty devastating diseasefor most of the children. We see essentially one case about every2 or 3 years now, and the last case we saw was in a mother whohad her fourth child and just did not get to the doctor to get theH-flu vaccine. I think that if you want to ask about the policies, you will need to talk to the policymakers for their conclusions. I can only giveyou my viewpoint from the standpoint of how I see infectious dis-ease and the impact that I have seen in our local community, andthe diseases that I no longer see, which some doctors in practicenow may never see again, I think to the advantage of those par-ticular children who are not suffering from those particular dis-eases. To be fair to the other panel participants, I recognize that I am a physician and I bring certain issues to the table, but I think theother individuals also have a lot to say that needs to be heard, andI do not want to monopolize everyone 's time. Mr. T URNER . I appreciate your comments. I guess the only point I was trying to make, and perhaps the witnesses on our secondpanel will help us with it, is that there are obviously good publicpolicy reasons to have the vaccines given, but at a minimum, if thetiming of those vaccines could be later in life for children, it seemsthat at least we owe the public that information, because particu-larly in the case of hepatitis B, if the threat of hepatitis B only oc-curs at the time when the child has the potential of becoming sexu-ally active, it does not make a lot of sense to have a public policythat says we administer it on the second day of life; and if thereis a risk, I as a parent certainly would not want that vaccine ad-ministered to my child at that point in time. People need to havethat information. Thank you so much, Doctor.Mr. B URTON . The gentleman 's time has expired. Mr. T URNER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 much, Mr. Turner. Mr. LaTourette.Mr. L ATOURETTE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Waxman. I want to thank each of you for sharing your families ' experiences with us today. Ms. Smith, my wife and I are the parents of 8-year-old twins, and we always said that if the twins had been first, theywould have been last, because raising twins is enough of a chal-lenge all by itself. I was not going to talk about what my friend from Texas was talking about, but it always amazed me \u2014and I am not smart enough to know the connection between vaccines and what bringsyou here today \u2014but it always amazed me that after these vaccines, you would bring your baby home, and he would turn bright red andhave a horrible fever, and they would say, ''Well, you just have to hang on for a little while, and everything is going to be OK, '' and this was a drug which was going to prevent some horrible child-hood disease in the future. But why they were being exposed tothese vaccines within the first couple days of being born, or eventhe first few months of being born, is something that I do think weneed to get a handle on. But Ms. Smith, I want to talk to you about a portion of your tes- timony, and Ms. Reynolds also, because if I understand it, you maybe following similar paths. That is, you have had Jacob screenedand tested for the presence of heavy metals and fungi and otherforeign substances within his system, and he is currently under-going some nutritional therapy and so on. I wonder if you couldshare those experiences with us. And I think it was you, Ms.Smith, who wrote that the results of that screening were shockingand that it was amazing \u2014was it you who had Dr. Stephanie Cave \u2014\u2014 Ms. S MITH . Yes. We both \u2014\u2014 Mr. L ATOURETTE . You both had Dr. Stephanie Cave. Ms. S MITH . Right. Mr. L ATOURETTE . OK. Then, maybe one at a time or in tandem, you could tell us a little bit about Dr. Cave 's work and what about the results of these screenings was shocking, and what sorts ofthings now Liam and Jacob are going through that give you hopeand point in the direction that this is a biomedical condition ratherthan a neurological condition. Ms. S MITH . In my case, it is clearly not a genetic issue, consider- ing that they are identical. The other reason I do not feel that itwas a neurological disorder that he was born with is because hisdescent into autism happened so rapidly. He was completely withme, and he descended into autism so rapidly, and to me, that is nota neurological disorder that he had at birth. Also, I feel that it was not a neurological disorder that he was born with because when he was 2 12, we had several professionals recommend that we put him on medications. I do not know whatmedications they said, such as Ritalin \u2014I never pursued that ave- nue, because I felt like medicating a 2 12child was simply not good enough when I did not know what his body was already doing. I went to see Dr. Cave, and she ran blood and urine tests and took stool samples to see what deficiencies he had, the areas that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb lacking in, his amino acids and so on. We found that he had 10 food allergies. Because he had been on repeated antibiotics, hehad extremely high \u2014out of 23 fungal and yeast infections, he was high in 20. He was chromium, zinc, magnesium and copper defi-cient. He was B5-deficient. So, basically, what we did was we im-mediately started taking out what was bad and putting back whatwas good and taking him off the foods that he was allergic to. Andwithin 5 days, my son, who had only a couple of words in his lan-guage and was very lost, said a full, appropriate sentence andstarted speaking again. So the rapid improvement also shows me that this was not a neurological disorder in his case. Mr. L ATOURETTE . OK. And Ms. Reynolds, is Liam also under- going similar therapy? Ms. R EYNOLDS . Yes, he is. When he was diagnosed in May 1998, we put him on a strict, gluten-free, casein-free diet that Dr. Caveprescribed, where he was not allowed to eat any of the substances,because his body was taking those things and actually manufactur-ing morphine, which was what was making him just sit and stareand not respond appropriately to things. Since that time, he has undergone an MRI, EEGs, all the normal things that they run on autistic children, and those all point to nor-mal things. But when you start doing blood work and stool workand urinalysis, and they measured for toxic metals in his hair, shesuggested that we give him a medication that would help pull outthe heavy metals that he had been exposed to, and my husbandand I were so gun-shy at this point from dealing with doctors thatwe pulled out the PDR and read through it, and we were, like, ''I do not know, this sounds a little weird to me; I do not think weare going to try this. '' And we took Liam to an environmental toxi- cologist who did some blood work and told us that the shape ofLiam 's blood \u2014he had stippled cells that would be the same as a plant worker who had had serious toxic heavy metal exposure andthat our son 's blood cells were malformed as a result of heavy metal exposure that he had received. We have given him this medication several times. We were able in December to get a good urine sample, which is a little challeng-ing around our house, and we were finally able to test that. Thenormal range \u2014and I am probably going to mess this up \u2014but the normal range for anything to show up in their bodies is betweenzero and six, and his lead and mercury had reduced down to nor-mal ranges, but his levels of tin were completely off the charts.They were not even measurable. They were up around 250. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Did you say tin? Ms. R EYNOLDS . Tin. Mr. L ATOURETTE . If I could just beg the chairman 's indulgence, is he likewise receiving, aside from the medication that you aretalking about, a nutritional program? Ms. R EYNOLDS . He receives a number of nutritional supplements every day. He is on an antifungal medication, because we havebeen dealing with a yeast infection that just will not go away for3 years, that makes him just a real mess. He is just a walking bio-logical nightmare. And he looks as healthy as a horse. He has greatskin, he has great teeth and cheeks. He is a beautiful, beautiful lit- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 but if you take it down to the cellular and the molecular level, you can see that this child is a total mess. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Ms. R EYNOLDS . You are welcome. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much, Mr. LaTourette. Ms. Biggert, did you have any questions?Ms. B IGGERT . No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Well, let me thank this panel. I just want to say to the four of you who have experienced this change right after theMMR shot that my daughter is sitting back there, and I and mydaughter experienced exactly the same things that you did, and Ibelieve what you are saying, and we are going to pursue that asdiligently as possible, because I cannot believe that it is just a coin-cidence that the shot is given, and within a very short time \u2014he got nine shots in 1 day, the MMR and DPAT, HIB and oral polio \u2014and within a matter of just a few days, instead of being the normalchild that we played with and talked to and everything else, hewas running around, banging his head against the wall and flailinghis arms. When people tell me that that was a genetic problem, I am tell- ing you they are just nuts. That is not the way it was. With that, I want to thank this panel very much. We will now go to our next panel. Thank you very much.We now welcome our second panel to the witness table. This panel consists of: Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who came all the wayfrom merry old England, and we appreciate him being here; Profes-sor John O 'Leary, whom I am sure you will notice after he starts talking is from Ireland; Dr. Vijendra Singh, I appreciate you beinghere; Dr. Coleen Boyle, Dr. Paul Offit, and Dr. Brent Taylor. Would you all please rise and be sworn?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Please have a seat. Dr. Wakefield, would you like to start this panel? STATEMENTS OF DR. ANDREW WAKEFIELD, ROYAL FREE AND UNIVERSITY COLLEGE MEDICAL SCHOOL, LONDON, ENG-LAND; DR. JOHN O 'LEARY, COOMBE WOMEN 'S HOSPITAL, DUBLIN, IRELAND; VIJENDRA K. SINGH, UTAH STATE UNI-VERSITY; COLEEN A. BOYLE, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CON-TROL AND PREVENTION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ANDHUMAN SERVICES, ACCOMPANIED BY DR.

BRENT TAYLOR,ROYAL FREE AND UNIVERSITY COLLEGE MEDICAL SCHOOL,LONDON, ENGLAND Dr. W AKEFIELD . Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. It is a great privilege to be here. The purpose of my testimony is to report the results of the clini- cal and scientific investigation of a series of children with autism.Nothing in this testimony should be construed as anti-vaccine;rather, I advocate the safest vaccination strategies for the protec- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 the control of communicable disease. I am also here on my behalf representing the children who have come to mefor investigation. I would like you to look at the screen if you would, please, and I will take you through the presentation. Next slide, please.Just as a little bit of background, this represents 12 years of in- tensive clinical and scientific research, collaborative research, intothe causes and mechanisms of bowel inflammation. I am a gastro-enterologist. The principal authors of this work have contributed to over 1,500 peer-reviewed and published scientific papers and abstracts. Again,these represent my views. Next slide, please.I want to report the results today from the first 60 children that we have investigated. We have now investigated over 150 children,and the results that I am going to describe are pertinent to allthose children bar about four. As far as the range of psychiatric assessments, the great majority had autism, but there was a spectrum of neuropsychiatric problemsincluding Asperger 's Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder. By far and away the most important investigation has been direct vis-ualization of the bowel and taking biopsies by the procedure ofileocolonoscopy. This is a flexible instrument introduced into thebottom end to take a biopsy. Next slide, please.What you have heard this morning is a classical description of two different types of autism from the parents. You have heardabout the children that we have seen, those who have gone off aftera period of normal development, many of them in the face of mul-tiple vaccine exposures with severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The other type, described very articulately, was of an insidious failure to acquire skills at an extremely important point. The es-sence of what I am going to present today is based upon conven-tional clinical medicine. It is listening to the patient. Here is a child who was entirely normal for the first year of life and went off a week after receiving his MMR vaccine. He is exactlyas the four children were described earlier. Next slide, please.The classical features in these children are pain \u2014there is a radiograph here of the abdomen, and there is fecal impaction.When these children came to us, the feature was of diarrhea, butin fact this turned out to be what we call spurious or overflow diar-rhea. There was soiling, loss of contents, fastidious eating habits,reflux and nighttime wakening. They get heartburn, and they wakeup very distressed. These symptoms are the same wherever you go.If I listen to parents from Canada, from the States, from Europe,and from Australia, the story is the same. Next slide, please. The associated features that we have in these children are of atopy \u2014asthma, eczema, and hay fever. There are refractory upper respiratory tract infections. They do not deal well with commonchildhood infections, colds, and there is a very high level of auto- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 \u2014thyroid disease, diabetes, for exam- ple. Next slide, please.This is the insider 's view of the small intestine. The panel on the top left is of what it should look like in a child. The bottom leftof is lymphoid nodular hyperplasia. There is a swelling of thelymph glands in the bowel. These are rather like tonsils, and whenthey swell, they cause pain and symptoms. Mr. Waxman asked about the reproducibility. He is absolutely right. Up on the top right-hand panel, you see a child who wasscoped in the United States with exactly the same symptoms. Sothis is reproducible in two different continents. We have comparedit with controls, and the graph on the bottom right shows that evenchildren who come to us with gastrointestinal symptoms who arescoped, the finding of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is relativelyuncommon. In the bar on the left, 85 percent of them show no evi-dence of it, but virtually all of our autistic children show evidenceof lymphoid hyperplasia, either mild, moderate, or severe. Next slide, please.There are histological changes under microscopy which show there is a definite disease. The top left-hand panel is normal; thebottom right-hand panel, for example, shows what is called a cryptabscess, that is, puss in the bowel wall, and this is a feature thatwe see in children and adults with ulcerative colitis. There is aclear and demonstrable, albeit subtle, pathology. Next slide, please.A further paper that is due to be published soon has taken this to one further level and asked is this disease distinct from classicalinflammatory bowel disease, Crohn 's and colitis, or is it something new. And the data, at least, so far, suggest that it is somethingnew. Next slide, please.We have described this feature in the gut, lymphoid hyperplasia, and colitis in children with autism. From this same city, fromGeorgetown University, Professor Joe Bellanti has described it inchildren with attention deficit disorder, coming back to the ques-tion, is this a spectrum of disorders which have at their heart somegastrointestinal abnormality. Next slide, please.Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia classically occurs in the presence of immunodeficiency. We do see it during acute infection, but it isclassically associated with immunodeficiency. Are our childrenimmunodeficient? As a group, the answer is yes, they are. This graph just shows you a particular count of a certain type of immune cell in the blood. The green line is the upper limit fornormal, the red line is the lower limit for normal, and each bluedot represents a child. You can see that the great majority sit ator below the lower limit of normal. Not only are they numericallydeficient, their immune system does not respond appropriately to common recall antigens when compared with normal age-matchedchildren. In other words, if you give them a skin-prick test for per-tussis or diphtheria, they mount no response. Next slide, please. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb are developmental regres- sion, inflammation of the small and large intestines \u2014and immunodeficiency. Next slide, please.So it is a real syndrome, there is a remarkably consistent pattern of bowel inflammation, and it provides us with vital clues. Whatare those clues? Next slide, please.The story as told to us and which we have an obligation to report is that the majority of children regressed following a period of nor-mal development in the face of MMR vaccination. That does notmean it is the cause of the disease. We also had two children who regressed after classical measles infection \u2014one after the monovalent measles vaccine and one after a rare vasculitic rash. Thirty-six percent of parents could contem-poraneously identify no particular environmental hit. Next slide, please.Have measles and common childhood infections been linked to autism before? Is there a reason to go into this and look at it? Theanswer is yes, there is. There is a paper that came from the Har-vard School of Public Health, and it showed that atypical patternsof exposure to common childhood infections \u2014measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella \u2014were a risk for autism in the child. By ''atypi- cal,'' I mean maternal exposure when pregnant or neonatal expo- sure. What was intriguing about this, which we may come to later, is that if you were a pregnant mother who was exposed to more thanone of these common infections at the same time, or indeed, an in-fant child, then your risk of autism was both greater, and the se-verity of the autism was greater. Question: Was there a compoundeffect of more than one infection? It has also been shown that children born in and around epidemics of measles and rubella have higher rates of this disease. Next slide, please.What about vaccines? There is a paper from the Vaccine Damage Compensation Board in the United States \u2014acute encephalopathy followed by permanent brain injury or death associated with fur-ther attenuated measles vaccine. What was intriguing in this co-hort of children who fulfilled rather strict criteria was that 43 outof 48 underwent developmental regression as part of their syn-drome. So we have this other pattern of exposure to measles as thefurther attenuated vaccine children undergoing developmental re-gression. Next slide, please.To summarize, unusual patterns of exposure to common child- hood infections are associated with autism and developmental re-gression. Next slide, please. Here is the clue. This is the important image, and here, you see the insider 's view again \u2014these swollen tonsilar tissues. If you are looking for an infection, this is where you should be looking. Next slide, please. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb down the microscope, this is what that swollen tonsil tissue looks like, and you are looking in the center of thatfor the infection. This is a response to a foreign agent, a foreignantigen, usually an infection. So if you are looking for the cause ofthat, that is where you are looking. Next slide, please.This is a very high-powered micrograph of a single cell called a follicular dendritic cell, and this is crucial, because if you are look-ing for the source of that infection, not only are you looking in thatlymphoid follicle, not only in the center of the lymphoid follicle, butin this specific cell. Next slide, please.When we look in that specific cell using an antibody which picks up measles protein and only measles protein, we find it in that cell.We do not find it in other cells or other tissue, we find it in thatcell. Next slide, please.You look for other viruses. You ask the question: Is this just a nonspecific response? Do we find other viruses in there? So youlook adenovirus, herpes simplex I and II, rubella, mumps, HIV,and other crucial controls that Mr. Waxman referred to early, andyou do not find them. They are not there. So at least within the context of this study, this appears to be specific for measles virus. Next slide, please.The next question: Is there an antibody; is there an immune re- sponse to the virus in these children? The mere presence does notmake it the cause. Is there an immune response? We take the autistic children, and we compare them with age- matched controls, and we look at measles antibody titers. We alsolook at controls of mumps, rubella, and cytomegalur virus, or othercommon childhood infections. The only one for which there is a sta-tistically significant difference between the cases and the controlsis for the measles virus. Next slide, please.We had failed completely to identify this virus by molecular am- plification technology. In my laboratory, we had a reaction that wassensitive to about 10,000 copies. Anything less, we could not findit. The Japanese had succeeded, so we sent nine blood samples from our children to the Japanese laboratory, and we also sent 21 otherpatients. We mixed them up. We did not tell them what they weregetting. They just had a control label. And they identified measlesvirus in three of those nine children in the peripheral blood. Thatis an intriguing finding. This is consistent with; but not definitely,vaccine strain. One can only say that this is consistent with, butthere it is, and this was a blinded control study. Next slide, please.Very briefly, to finish up, what is the link between the gut and the brain? This is one of the most difficult things for people to un-derstand. How can the gut influence the brain? I come from a liverunit where we see patients with chronic liver failure, acute liverfailure, all the time, and one of the classical manifestations ofthat\u2014next slide, please \u2014is hepatic encephalopathy. This is damaged, is diseased, and fails to degrade the chemical constituents of the bowel that come through. It fails to mop themup and clear them out; they impact upon the brain. This is largelyreversible. If you are hit with these for long enough, it becomes ir-reversible. The question is, therefore \u2014at least we have biologically a plau- sible hypothesis, a testable hypothesis that elements from the gut,undegraded chemicals from the gut, including the opiods that werereferred to by Shelley Reynolds, may be getting through, may notbe metabolized, may be impacting upon the rapidly developingbrain during the first few years of life and producing residual cog-nitive deficit, which we recognize as autism. Next slide, please.So finally, in summary, we have an environmental insult in per- haps a genetically susceptible child. The problem is that if you goto Sweden now, autism affects over 1.2 percent of the pediatric pop-ulation. So if there is a genetic background, it is clearly widely dis-tributed within the population. We believe that in many children,clearly, the subset of autistics, it leads to gut infection and damage;that leads to an ingress, an impaired metabolism, degradation ofthese chemicals from the gut which then get through and impactupon the brain. And the disregulated immune system which mea-sles classically can produce also encourages immune diseases,atopic diseases, and immuno disregulation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. Professor O 'Leary. prepared statement of Dr. Wakefield follows:] VerDate Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, the purpose of my testimony is to report the scientific results in a se-ries of children with autistic enterocolitis that has just been de-scribed to you. Nothing in my testimony should or must be con-strued as anti-vaccine; rather, it encourages safe vaccination strat-egies. The opinions that I am expressing in the text and in mypresentation are those of my own. These studies were undertaken following an approach made to me by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who has just submitted independenttestimony. The studies represent a transnational, multidisciplinaryresearch program aimed at elucidating the causes and pathogenesisof inflammatory bowel diseases in association with developmentaldisorders of childhood. Next slide.Dr. Wakefield has alluded to measles virus as a potential associ- ated factor in the pathogenesis of autistic enterocolitis, and hecame to our laboratory to seek molecular confirmation. Next slide, please.He posed some questions. The first question: Was measles virus present in gut biopsies from these children? Next slide, please.Where was it located? How much was there? Could it be sequenced \u2014could we actually confirm there was measles virus? And finally, could different molecular technologies actually inde-pendently confirm the presence of measles virus? May I inform you that I am a pathologist and a molecular biolo- gist. My area of diagnostic expertise is histopathology, which is un-derstanding and examining the cellular basis of disease. Next slide, please.The blinded study included 46 cases; 25 children had a diagnosis of autistic enterocolitis, and 21 controls were included in the study,including 15 normal children who did not have a developmentaldisorder, four children with Crohn 's disease, which is a chronic in- flammatory bowel disease condition, and two children with ulcera-tive colitis, a very similar condition but one which is histologicallydifferent. We examined terminal ileal biopsies, and from the blocks of tis- sue that were given to us, we looked at four to six serial sectionson the one case. What we wanted to do was to see if we could iden-tify the virus; could we replicate it on multiple sections from onepatient. Where available, fresh tissue was examined. Next slide.The positive control materials in this study were transvected measles virus-infected viral cells which contained measles virus ge-nome, and measles virus-infected brain tissue. As negative controls,we screened a panel of other virally infected cells lines. Next slide.To confirm the presence of measles virus, we adopt a five-hit strategy. The first was to localize and identify the presence of mea-sles virus RNA in the tissue sections from these patients. The second was to quantify using a technology called TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR. I have worked in this technology forthe last 6 years, and it is approximately 1,000 times more sensitivethan existing PCR-based technologies. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 wanted to confirm the sequence of the virus, so we employed capillary fluorescent-based sequencing. Next slide.Let me summarize what in-cell PCR is. I know this is technical, but I think it is extremely important. Measles virus is an RNAvirus, and RNA when it is removed from the body is extremely eas-ily degradable. PCR basically is like a photocopying reaction. Wecan make multiple copies of a particular gene that we are inter-ested in looking for. In-cell PCR allows us to demonstrate these genetic sequences in cells and without cells, looking down the microscope. Next slide.TaqMan quantitative PCR basically is a revolutionary PCR-based technology which is sequence detection-specific. You will only get apositive result in this assay if the desired gene of interest that youare looking for is present in the tissue section. Next slide.In our laboratory, we are one of the few laboratories in the world that actually perform RNA inhibition assays. This is effectively totest how degraded the RNA in our samples is, and No. 2, is thereanything in the environment of the laboratory that is contributingto the breakdown of RNA in tissue samples of cells. Next slide.I think it is extremely important in relation to the detection of low-copy viral infections, and I think our laboratory has a reputa-tion for the detection of low-viral copy numbers, that we have strictanti-contamination measures. What I mean here is that we do notwant to generate false-positive results. So we have separate, isolated extraction and PCR areas. This is in a newly built, custom-designed molecular biology facility. Wehave two independent laboratory sites, and for the purpose of thisinvestigation, we employed in situ hybridization, which is basicallya way of taking a cloned or a fragment of DNA or RNA that youhave in your laboratory and looking for the presence of that in atissue section or cell. We can use the technology of in-cell PCR thatI have described, solution phase arecomplementary technologies, but TaqMan PCR is 1,000 times moresensitive than standard solution phase PCR technologies, and thensequencing. Next slide, please.Just to reiterate again the point: Our laboratories go to desperate lengths, No. 1, to prove that we do not have RNA inhibition, butsecond to prove that we do not have contamination. We purposelyin all of our plates set up contamination. This is effectively tooutrule the possible generation of false-positive results. Again, I would appeal to the non-scientific members of the com- mittee that this is an extremely important control that must be in-cluded if you are looking for low-copy viral gene detections. Next slide, please. And of course, to confirm the presence of measles virus, the gold standard is to confirm the sequence of the virus, to say yes, thisis measles virus RNA that we have got in the tissue sections. Next slide, please. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb look at the results now. We carry out an extensive set of optimization reactions where we had measles virus clones, lookingat several regions of the measles virus genome, F, N, and H. Thetechnical detail of this is not important, but just to show you thatwe could look at several genes within the measles virus genome,and we could reproducibly make copies of these or amplify them. The bottom panel shows you an experiment which allows us to detect the measles virus in viral cells, showing what the optimalconcentration of the probe that we require to detect the virus is,and you can see clearly that the optimum concentration is 1 to 1.5micrograms per ml. Next slide, please.This slide shows the results of in-cell PCR by two different tech- nologies. One is in-cell solution phase PCR, the other is in-cellTaqMan PCR, which produces a green signal in the right-handpanels, top and bottom. Again it demonstrates that we can clearlyidentify measles virus in these transvected cells. Next slide, please.This is a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Mea- sles virus is the cause of this condition. So of course, if we are toreliably detect measles virus in biopsies of the children that Dr.Wakefield provided to us, we should of course be able to identifymeasles virus in brain biopsies from patients with SSPE. The left panel and the middle panel show measles virus presence in these biopsies, and the right-hand panel is the negative control. Next slide, please.This is a case of an autistic child No. 1. You can see the top left- hand panel is a microscopic appearance of what the gut lookslike\u2014and this is not normal gut epithelium from a child; it is heav- ily inflamed. The bottom left-hand panel show a spidery, black de-posit, outer width of the cells that are in green. This is actuallymeasles virus RNA. The top right-hand panel again in a differentfield shows a heavier deposit of black, which again is measlesvirus, and again, I need to point out to you that this is outer widthof the cells that are surrounding it. Measles virus was located in the tonsils, in the lymphoid hyperplastic areas that Dr. Wakefield described on endoscopy. Andthe negative control is absolutely clean. Next slide, please.This is another case, a second autistic child, again showing a very similar findings \u2014a black deposit, which is measles virus, out- side of inflammatory cells, associating the fibrillary matrix, and thenegative controls here for mumps are absolutely clean. Next slide, please.I think this slide is extremely important. If you look at the left- hand panel, this is measles virus for the nucleocapsid gene. It isa black signal. It again is the outer width of the cells, but it hasa spidery, cobwebby morphology. There are little processes and ten-tacles coming out of this region. If you look at the top right-handpanel, the follicular dendritic cell has processes, dendrites, whichform the cell matrix, which is very, very similar to what we see onthe left-hand panel. And the immunocytic chemical staining analy-sis which Dr. Wakefield alluded to gives exactly the same results. Next slide, please. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb by what we call fairly standard labora- tory protocols, we can detect the measles virus in gut biopsies fromthese children, and the negative controls are appropriately nega-tive. Next slide, please.Even in a paraffin-embedded tissue section that has probably been sitting around in wax for 4 to 5 years, we can detect measlesvirus. That is an astounding finding in view of the fact that waxand fixation by itself breaks down RNA. This graph shows in realtime, we can look at the accumulation of the PCR product that weare making, confirming that measles virus is actually present inthis biopsy. Next slide.And of course, we can sequence it, and we can say that this is measles virus RNA present in the biopsies of these children. To do this properly, you need to do it in a forward and negative strand. I started off by saying that measles virus is an RNA virus.When we make copies of the RNA virus, we make copies in two-strand forms. So if we are to sequence it, we should sequence ina forward and reverse strand. Looking at that electrophoretogram, the sequences in both direc- tions are exactly the same. Next slide, please.In summary, then, in terms of the association that Andrew Wakefield alluded to, I can confirm that his hypothesis is correct \u2014 24 out of 25 children \u2014that is 96 percent of the children 's biopsies that he sent to my laboratory, blinded \u2014children with autistic enterocolitis harbor measles virus genomes. Three out of four patients with Crohn 's disease \u2014these are chil- dren with Crohn 's disease \u2014and one out of two children with ulcer- ative colitis also contain measles virus. That is an interesting bio-logical fact. Finally, 1 of 15, 6.6 percent, of control children harbored measles virus genome. I think it does not take greater statistical analysisto work out that there is a significant difference between 24 out of25 and 1 out of 15. Next slide.Solution phase RT-PCR, which is standard laboratory-based tech- nology, was positive in all children with autistic enterocolitis fordifferent regions of the measles virus genome. That is extremelyimportant. And we can sequence measles virus isolates from thesechildren. Final slide, please.However, the infection that is present in these children is at ex- tremely low copy, at about 5 to 30 transcripts per approximately2,000 cells. Now, again, I want to add some technical overlay on this. The way that we quantify RNA in our laboratory is by a method calledcopy RNA. Again, we are one of the few laboratories worldwidethat would do this as the most accurate way of actually measuringRNA. Indeed, industry now is accepting this as a standard way ofquantifying RNA in cells of tissue sections. Finally, the presence of measles virus was identified by in situ hybridization, by solution PCR, by TaqMan really, in terms of technology, is as good as it gets right now. I hope that I have given you evidence here which is compelling in relation to the presence of measles virus in children with autis-tic enterocolitis. Thank you for your time and attention.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Professor, and when we get to the ques- tion-and-answer phase, I am sure that we will try to ask questionsin layman 's terms and try to get some answers so that we can un- derstand everything that both you and Dr. Wakefield said \u2014but I think we got the gist of it. Dr. Singh.[The prepared statement of Dr. O 'Leary follows:] VerDate Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I did not realize that I could have shown a couple of slides as well to make the point much more in layman 's language, but I will try to explain the results of the research that I am involved in. It has been nearly 25 years that I have been involved in so-called childhood diseases, from the immunology side as well as the pedi-atric neurology side. I was working at Children 's Hospital in Van- couver, Canada, which is where I began my career in childhood dis-eases, and early on, I saw a few examples of autism mentioned incongenital rubella syndrome. It was a fascinating observation, be-cause at that time, I was very excited about the research on virusinfections and nervous system disorders. That really led me to kindof work back and forth between nervous system disorders and virusinfections and immunology. So the whole thing here is that we need to consider combination of these disciplines that we talk about. We are not going to be ableto answer any questions as far as I am concerned about nervoussystem diseases simply by studying psychology or simply by lookingat the epidemiology data. We need to come together as a team tofocus histories of nervous system, immune system, and whateverelse comes into the picture. That is one major focus of attentionthat at least I am taking for my future research. On autism as an immune disorder, I think I am probably one of the earlier investigators who started working on the immunity andautism connection. Followed by that was my theory thatautoimmunity is a very important process in autism. That is partlybecause I was studying autoimmunity in nervous system disorderslike multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer 's disease. Quite frankly, some of my earlier work in Alzheimer 's disease has opened the way, and today, people are actually using immunology as a platform to de-sign treatment for Alzheimer 's disease. It was funny to see on the news last night that some doctor has a new approach; he says he is going to use immunology as a meansof activating the nervous system in order to correct the Alzheimer 's problem. That is a fascinating stuff, at least to me. So I started to pay more and more attention to autism, and the results that I am going to share with you are actually quite uniqueto autism. They are part of the nervous system, but they are beinganalyzed by the immune system research. I know there are people, especially who are funded by NIH or by CDC, who continue to make no mention at all of this so-called im-munology research or autoimmunity research in autism. I havebeen invited by the NIH panel; I have made two trips to NIH pan-els. I made a visit to the Institute of Medicine and the NationalAcademy of Sciences about 1 12or 2 years ago. And if you hear those people who have been funded by these agencies, when theygo out and present, they do not even mention anything aboutautoimmunity in autism. NIH people prepared a document of thatmeeting. It was designed for updating the screening and diagnostic criteria. If you read that document, there is virtually no mentionof this sort of research. To me, this is simply mind-boggling. Is it because people out there in the scientific community do not want to buy the argument, or are they just being naive about what VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb coming out in the way of solid, decent, experimentally proven research? Now, having given that background, let me show you some of the results. First of all, I started looking at autism as an autoimmunedisorder, as I mentioned. And what we have found is over the last5 or 6 years of research \u2014and I think now, the number of cases I have studied is approaching about 400 cases \u2014very early on, I wanted to study the myelination problem in the brain. You will askwhat is myelination. It is one of the most critical events in thenervous system development. So when a child is actually growing,this myelination process is very important. It is really more or lesslike a mother will feed a child and perhaps nurse in such a waythat this process has to be nurtured very, very carefully. Having said that, what we are finding is auto-antibodies. Auto- antibodies are the hallmark of the autoimmune process. If youhave an autoimmune process, you are going to have auto-anti-bodies, but if you have those antibodies against an organ which isaffected in a disease \u2014in autism, what would that be \u2014that would be the brain. So we are finding brain auto-antibodies in autobodies. What I am trying to illustrate in this chart is that we had a number of normal children, normal adults, patients with other dis-orders, Down syndrome, and none of those seemed to show theseauto-antibodies, but on a rare occasion, 1 or 2 percent positive inthe normal or control population. Here, we have a scientific observation which anybody can go out there and repeat. I do not think I need to use any difficult thingto illustrate that point. It is a consistently reproducible result, andit is happening now in children all over the world. I am gettingspecimens from overseas as well, not just the nationwide specimensalone. So this is a very important thing. Furthermore, I find that particular protein marker is selective, because I have now studied two additional markers of the samestructure in the brain, and I do not find these auto-antibodies inautism. Let me move on to the next issue. What happens is, assuming there is an autoimmune process, most autoimmune diseases aretriggered by virus infections. So I started to think about looking atviruses. I was not thinking of the vaccine issue at all. I was think-ing of virus infection. And, quite surprisingly, when I started to doantibody measurements to viruses which are out there or tempo-rarily associated, what I found was that the measles virus standsout as statistically significant in terms of its antibodies, signifi-cantly much higher in autistic children. So these children havewhat is so-called hyperimmune response to the measles virus \u2014not viruses. We studied rubella virus, HHV -6 virus, cytomegalovirus, and none of those three viruses showed thishyperimmune antibody response. Furthermore, the important thing is the measles antibodies which we have now measured by two different methods, and theresult is the same \u2014a statistically significant increase. The next thing I wanted to see was if anything correlated be- tween these two parameters. Quite strongly, I found that brainauto-antibody-positive patients also had measles antibody levelswhich were very high. So the higher the antibody level to measles VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 the chance of brain auto-antibody. It does not take too much intelligence to make some sense here now. Over the years, some of these families have been sending me written notes or telephone calls and so on, and every time I wasgoing out to make my presentation, people would tell me about thevaccine connection with autism. Early on, I was not sure what was happening. So I tried to put together their own reports, and the report looks like this in the piechart. Nearly 53 percent of the families reported that their childgot autism because of MMR. The remaining 30 percent said it wasbecause of the DPT shot. And about 15 percent \u2014this was a critical category for two reasons \u2014about 7 percent said they were not sure whether it was measles or DPT, but the remaining 7 percent hadno history of vaccination connection, or at least they did not makethe connection. I wonder if that 7 or 8 percent category is whereDr. Dankner 's child might fit in. The last point I want to make is that of a very recent research finding of my own, not yet published, but something quite impor-tant. About which I showed a slide in my presentation in a meetinglast year which was held in Orlando, FL. This is an observation ofantibodies to measles, rubella, because that is the largestpopulation which was reported to me as being affected by the mea-sles vaccine. We took the vaccine preparation itself, and we decided to exam- ine antibodies in these children. Normal children do not show anyantibody to a protein that I will point out in a second, but in chil-dren with autism, nearly 65 percent of them showed that antibody. Actually, I can illustrate that point a little more if we just imag- ine that I am a molecule, or a preparation of measles, mumps, ru-bella. This protein, this antibody that I am detecting will be some-thing like detecting this coat pin. In other words, antibodies to thisprotein which is present in the measles, mumps, rubella vaccinepreparation were found in autistic children, but not in the normalchildren. I think this is a very, very important laboratory-based re-search evidence. If anybody wants to make a criticism of that, ofcourse, they are at liberty to do so. However, I find this is a sci-entifically very, very important observation, telling us that perhapsthere is a good connection, there is something happening with thismeasles, mumps, rubella vaccine in these children, something isunusual. So basically, after having illustrated some of these points, I want to make a final comment. That is, if you really look at the lit-erature reported on the vaccine adverse reactions, I do not thinkyou will need a crystal ball to see that vaccines have adverse reac-tions. The literature is full of those reports. What is not there oris it has never been reported, or at least, the officials from the CDCcontinue not to mention anything about it. What they mention isthat vaccines are good. Every week, you read about it in the news-paper, and you hear about it on the television. And I do not disputethat information because I know vaccines are very, very important.My concern as a researcher now, more so than ever before, is thatwe must pay attention to the safety of these vaccines. It is missing;it has not been disclosed publicly, and I do not think it exists in VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb therefore, I urge the Government Reform Com- mittee to look into particular new policies concerning the vaccinesafety issue. Thank you very much.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Singh. Dr. Boyle.[The prepared statement of Mr. Singh follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Dr. Coleen Boyle, Chief of the Developmental Dis-abilities Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.I am presenting the agency 's testimony, and I am accompanied by Dr. Ben Schwartz, who is the Acting Director of the Epidemiologyand Surveillance Division at the National Immunization Programat CDC. I am pleased to discuss our work at CDC to prevent develop- mental disabilities including autism. I want to begin by assuringthe parents that we have heard from today that CDC is concernedabout autism, and that we are working hard to find the causes ofautism and other developmental disabilities so that all childrenwill have the opportunity to have a healthy and productive future. Autism is a serious developmental disability which can have pro- found impact on children and their families. It is characterized byqualitative impairments in social interactions and communicationand a pattern of restrictive, repetitive, and stereotypic behaviors,interests, and activities. Autism may require long-term special edu-cation and care at a cost of more than $30,000 per year. Costs forresidential care can be $80,000 to $100,000 per year. CDC 's role in preventing developmental disabilities including au- tism is to track the disease rates in the population and to identifycauses of this condition. CDC can then establish prevention pro-grams and then evaluate how well these programs work. We do not know if autism rates are going up. Early studies found autism rates in the range of 4 to 6 per 10,000 children, using anarrow set of criteria. More recent studies have reported ratesaveraging 12 per 10,000 children, but these studies have used dif-ferent criteria than the earlier studies. CDC is not certain how much of the reported increase is due to changes in the definition of autism or an improved recognition ofthis condition over time. We also do not know if other factors havecontributed to the larger numbers of children seeking treatment. CDC is currently developing ways to better measure autism. In 1998, we added autism to our Metropolitan Atlanta DevelopmentDisabilities Surveillance Program. This program, which also mon-itors other serious developmental disabilities such as mental retar-dation and cerebral palsy among school-age children in Atlanta, isthe only community-wide study in the United States. CDC has justfunded Marshall University in West Virginia to start tracking au-tism in six countries in that State. At this point, I want to briefly describe our activities in Brick Township, NJ and in investigating the alleged association betweenautism and the MMR vaccination. In early 1998, the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR], were contacted by the New JerseyHealth Department, Senator Robert Torricelli, and U.S. Represent-ative Christopher Smith, requesting the CDC investigate autismrates in Brick Township. They were concerned that the number ofchildren with autism was too high. In response, CDC conducted a study of children with autism liv- ing in Brick Township during 1998. ATSDR investigated sources ofenvironmental pollution and exposure routes in Brick Township.All the data have been collected, and the results are currently un- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb Once this review is completed, we will provide the report first to the parents of the affected children, thecommunity, and then the local and State health departments. Wewould be pleased to brief interested Members or their staffs on theresults of this work at the time we make them available to thecommunity. As the committee is aware, a theory links the MMR vaccine and autism, which has generated public interest and some controversy.CDC believes that the current scientific evidence does not supportthe hypothesis that MMR or any combination of vaccines cause thedevelopment of autism. Initial case series reports have not beensubstantiated by more focused reviews or by more in-depth follow-up research. It should be pointed out that factors known to be associated with autism include genetic factors and events that occur before birth. CDC recognizes how important it is to identify the causes of au- tism as well as to ensure the safety of vaccines. CDC is currentlyundertaking three studies related to autism or about hypothesesrelated to vaccines and autism. First, CDC is using its Autism Surveillance Program in Atlanta to examine the possibility of a link between the MMR vaccine andautism. Second, we are working with the National Institutes of Health to conduct a study that will evaluate whether vaccination is linkedwith developmental regression which occurs in some children withautism. Third, CDC is using the Vaccine Safety Datalink, in collaboration with several HMOs, to study inflammatory bowel disease and theMMR vaccination. Through these studies, CDC is working to assure the safety of the vaccination program and to identify preventable causes of au-tism. Mr. Chairman, in the past 4 years, public health has made sig- nificant advances in preventing developmental disabilities. Preven-tion of congenital syphilis and congenital rubella syndrome havespared lives and prevented disability for thousands of children.Newborn screening programs have prevented lifelong mental retar-dation in children with hyperthyroidism and sickle cell disease. However, given these strides, we still do not know what causes many developmental disabilities, including autism. While addi-tional scientific research is being completed, it is important to alsoconsider the broader context of public health, including the vaccina-tion program, which is one of the most successful public healthachievements of the 20th century. Given the weight of the scientific data and the known serious- ness and ongoing risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, in CDC 's judgment, the best public policy is to continue vaccination un-changed while aggressively working to try to identify causes of de-velopmental disabilities. CDC agrees with the committee and the parents who have testi- fied today that autism has a significant and profound adverse im-pact on the lives of children and families and communities whereit occurs. We must track this disorder, we must identify the pre- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb we must institute effective prevention pro- grams. It is my hope that our efforts, combined with those of the NIH and the academic community, will lead to a way to prevent devel-opmental disabilities of autism, enabling those children to live fulland productive lives. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Boyle. First, I would like to recognize the courage of the par- ents who have testified her today, as well as the two grandparentson the committee, including you, Mr. Chairman. As I share my tes-timony, I also deeply share their feelings and concerns. My name is Paul Offit. I am pediatrician, and I am also the chief of infectious diseases and the Henle professor of immunologic andinfectious diseases at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. In addition, Iam a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices to the CDC. I have 20 years of experience in the areas of vi-rology and immunology. My role in these proceedings is to explore the theories that have arisen due to concerns by the public that autism might be causedby the combination of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines knownas MMR. No evidence exists which proves this association. However, three theories have been used to explain it. In the time that I have beengiven, I would like to explain why I think that these theories arenot valid. The first theory is that children who get the measles vaccine make an immune response not only to the vaccine, but also to theirown nervous system. This kind of reaction is called autoimmunity.To understand why this theory is invalid, we must first understanddifferences between natural measles infection and measles vaccina-tion. During natural measles infection, the measles virus reproduces itself many times in the body and causes disease. In contrast, fol-lowing measles vaccination, the vaccine virus reproduces itselfmuch less and does not cause disease. Because more measles pro-teins are made during natural infection than after immunization,the immune response to natural infection is greater than the im-mune response to immunization. If the immune response is greaterafter natural infection, then the autoimmune response would alsobe greater. If this were the case, then autoimmunity should occurmore frequently after natural infection than after vaccination. Or,said another way, if measles virus caused autism, then measlesvaccination would lower, not raise, the incidence of autism. The second theory is that the child 's immune system is simply overwhelmed by seeing three viruses in a vaccine at the same time.Some have gone so far as to suggest that it may be of benefit todivide the MMR vaccine into three separate vaccines. The rationalebehind this theory is that children do not normally encounter suchan assault on their immune system. From the birth canal and beyond, infants are confronted by a host of different challenges to their immune system. Their intes-tines encounter foreign proteins in milk and formula. Their lungsencounter bacteria inhaled on the surface of dust in the air. Andliterally thousands of different bacteria immediately start to live onthe skin as well as on the lining of the nose, throat, and intestines. Here is how infants deal with this immediate confrontation to their immune system. Babies have a tremendous capacity to re-spond to their environment from the minute they are born. Thenewborn has billions of immunologic cells which are capable of re-sponding to millions of different microorganisms. By quickly mak- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 immune response to bacteria that live on the surface of their intestines, babies keep these bacteria from invading their blood-stream and causing serious disease. Therefore, the combination of the three vaccines contained in MMR, or even the 10 vaccines given in the first 2 years of life, isliterally a raindrop in the ocean of what infants successfully en-counter in their environment every day. The third theory is that the MMR vaccine is given by an unnatu- ral route. The rationale behind this theory is that children do notnormally encounter viruses or bacteria under their skin or in theirmuscles. But infants and children frequently encounter viruses andbacteria in many places throughout the body. Our species survivesbecause from the minute we are born, we are capable of meetingchallenges at all sites. To review, here are the medical facts. First, if autism is a con- sequence of autoimmunity, the incidence of autism would have de-creased, not increased, after vaccination. Second, children from birth are confronted with and manage an enormous array of different challenges to their immune system atthe same time. Third, challenges to their immune system occur by a variety of routes. The parents we have heard testify here today are asking a sci- entific question: Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? Questions ofscience are best answered by scientific studies, and the answer tothis question is already available. Dr. Brent Taylor and his cowork-ers in London have conducted a large, meticulously designed, well-controlled study that disproves an association between MMR vac-cine and autism. I believe other studies will confirm Dr. Taylor 's results, because it is important to have confirmatory studies. What is really at stake here? In the early 1990 's, our immuniza- tion rates against measles dropped only about 10 percent. Measlesoutbreaks swept across the country. About 11,000 people were hos-pitalized, and 123 died from measles \u2014died from a disease which is easily and safely prevented by a vaccine. My concern, Mr. Chairman, is that parents listening to or read- ing about this hearing might incorrectly conclude that vaccinescause autism. This is not the case. Vaccines are extremely safe andhighly effective. I encourage this committee to make that fact clearto every parent in America. If, as a result of reading about this hearing, some parents choose to withhold or delay vaccines for their children, their tragedy couldbe profound. If many parents choose to withhold vaccines, the trag-edy all across America could be devastating. Let us proceed cautiously, carefully, and scientifically.Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you. VerDate Hello. I am Brent Taylor. I am the professor of com- munity and child health at the Royal Free and University CollegeSchool of Medicine and the head of the Department of Pediatricsand Child Health on the Royal Free campus of University CollegeLondon. I am honored to have the opportunity to testify today. I am here as a clinical scientist, but I am also a practicing pediatrician. Myclinical work involves children with disabilities including autism. I know how desperate families can be to understand the cause of their child 's often devastating condition. I also know that if we are to avoid families being led astray by false hopes, advances inunderstanding and treatment must be based on high-quality andrigorous science. Mr. Wakefield and Professor O 'Leary 's testimony notwithstand- ing, the belief that MMR is the cause of autism is a false hope. I have four main points. We do not fully understand the reasons why autism has recently increased. We do know that there is noevidence that immunizations are involved. Second, there is no evidence that MMR vaccine causes autism. Third, there is no conspiracy to suppress information about theside effects of vaccines \u2014completely the reverse. Fourth, because of poor science, uptake of MMR vaccine has fallen to dangerously lowlevels in the United Kingdom, putting children 's lives at risk from a resurgence of the damaging and occasionally killing of prevent-able diseases, measles, mumps, and rubella. The same thing couldhappen in the United States of America. If I could have the first overhead, please.Here are some figures from the United Kingdom. You can see at the top, in the black closed circles, MMR uptake, which has fallenfrom about 90 percent in 1995 to 75 percent in April 1999. Thereis almost an exact parallel fall \u2014shown in the open circles \u2014in mothers ' confidence in the safety of MMR vaccine. Could we have the next overhead on top of this one, please?The reason for this loss of confidence relates mainly to two pa- pers produced by Mr. Wakefield and colleagues. The first, which in-correctly related measles vaccine to Crohn 's disease, one form of in- flammatory bowel disease, has subsequently been completely un-dermined. There is no evidence that measles or measles vaccineplay any part in inflammatory bowel disease. The second arrow shows the timing of a paper produced by Mr. Wakefield and colleagues describing a small group of inadequatelydescribed children with a range of autism-related disorders. Following each of these papers, there was a major effect on moth- ers' confidence and a resultant further decline in MMR uptake. I will now discuss the results of an epidemiological study I led to test Mr. Wakefield 's hypothesis that MMR causes autism. My two senior colleagues, Dr. Elizabeth Miller and Dr. PattyFarrington, have submitted testimony to this committee with de-tails of our methods and the background of our study. We identified all known cases of autism \u2014498 in total \u2014living a defined area of North London and compared details of the onsetand recognition of their condition with independently collected dataon exactly when they received MMR and other measles-containingvaccines. The study involved a large amount of work, and we ana- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 in considerable depth. There are lots of results which have been published in the Lancet. In summary, all of our analyses were negative. We concluded that MMR vaccine is not causally related to autism. In particular,we looked at the clustering after MMR of regression where it oc-curred, the timing of parents ' concern about the child 's develop- ment, and the age at diagnosis. There were no significant relation-ships. Our results are supported by other studies from Sweden, from Finland, and from France. Our particular interest in this hearing is the rise with time we identified from the late 1970 's to 1992. Could we have the next overhead, please?Mr. Wakefield has compared our results with those reported in California. This is the overhead. It is important to remember thatthe authors of the California report clearly stated that theirs wasnot incidence data. The overhead, which is downloaded from the Lancet Web page, is of rather poor quality, and so is Mr. Wakefield 's content. He has fiddled with the data regarding the dates of the introduction of au-tism, and to demonstrate other problems he has with time relation-ships, it is worthwhile just looking at the bottom line, where it goesfrom 1987 to 1960 to 1990. What is actually going on? I have included two additional arrows, the red arrows, which per- haps more accurately identifies the acceleration in cases in therates at which autism is increasing. These, one can see, occurredat least 2 years before autism was introduced into the United King-dom and at least 2 years after in California \u2014hardly a convincing causal relationship. There is another problem for the MMR theory. Could we have the next overhead, please? Here is our data from our study up until 1992, which is what we published. The rise in autism can be seen there as clearly occurringlong before MMR was introduced, and I must say, contrary to whatMr. Wakefield and some of the groups he is associated with say,that we included all cases in our analysis, including those involvedin the MMR Catch-Up Campaign. After 1992, the numbers fell. We did not include these data in our analysis because we felt that there might be too many missingcases not yet diagnosed, and by leaving the left-hand side, it reallygave the hypothesis that MMR causes autism the best chance ofbeing confirmed. The parallel line in red is data from two of the larger districts, and this is important, because we have preliminary data as partof the further study on the same population to see what has hap-pened. Is autism still going up, or is it flattening out? What our early results in these two districts show \u2014if we could have the final overhead \u2014is that rates are going down. There is an overall increase of numbers, reflecting continuing better recognitionof autism, and immigration. The fall is seen in both studies, sug-gesting it is a real fall. Cases appear in this population to havepeaked in about 1992, for reasons which are quite unclear. This finding alone must exclude MMR as a cause of autism. MMR had a rapid uptake in our population from 1988; then, rates VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 1995, while autism rates were rising and then falling. We need more research on autism and its treatment, but Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, present evidence doesnot support a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and au-tism. As a result of adverse publicity on this topic, many clients inthe UK are now at risk from the dangerous diseases of measles,mumps, and rubella. I urge this committee to strongly support thecontinued MMR program to avoid putting America children 's lives at risk. As a result of my work and clear study of the evidence on this topic, I believe I can say with confidence that MMR vaccine is nota cause of autism. [The prepared statement of Dr. Taylor follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I want to thank the panel. We will now go to our questions. Dr. Offit, you talk about collaboration, I guess, with the Merck Pharmaceutical Co.? Dr. O FFIT. Yes. As I disclosed in my written report, I have been in collaboration with Merck and Company on the development ofa rotavirus vaccine since 1992. Mr. B URTON . Do you do any traveling around, speaking on behalf of Merck or Merck products? Dr. O FFIT. I travel and speak about vaccines, and those talks are supported by unrestricted educational grants from either pharma-ceutical companies or from universities. Mr. B URTON . So they pay for your expenses and that sort of thing? Dr. O FFIT. They have an interest in educating physicians about vaccines, and it is good that they do, because physicians need tobe educated about vaccines. Mr. B URTON . I understand. And they produce the MMR vaccine, don't they? Dr. O FFIT. Yes, they do, yes. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Dr. Taylor, in your Lancet paper, you omitted to mention the Catch-Up Campaign. That is the vaccination of children over 1 yearof age when the vaccination was introduced. Yet you appear tohave included these Catch-Up children in your analysis of the step-up hypothesis. So you consider that to be methodologically \u2014do you think that is a correct analysis? Dr. T AYLOR . Basically, that statement is not true, Mr. Chairman. We did include the children involved in the Catch-Up Campaign inour analysis, as is clearly stated. To suggest otherwise \u2014and I sus- pect the suggestion comes from Mr. Wakefield \u2014is malicious. Mr. B URTON . Well, was it included \u2014was it not omitted in the original paper that you submitted? Dr. T AYLOR . No. All cases were included who received MMR vac- cine. All cases \u2014we will submit additional analysis with all cases who received any measles-containing vaccine \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Didn 't some of those 36 children receive the MMR vaccine after the \u2014\u2014 Dr. T AYLOR . I think what you are referring to is the reply which we put to Mr. Wakefield 's criticism of our paper in the Lancet. I have to say that his is the only criticism of our paper which wehave received on a scientific basis. All other reports have been con-structive and supportive. Mr. B URTON . Well \u2014\u2014 Dr. T AYLOR . What we looked for there were the children who had received MMR vaccine, which we had included in our analysis.There were 36 such children, and in 29 of them, there was evidenceregarding when the parents became concerned about their child 's development. In all cases, this was before they received the MMRvaccine. Mr. B URTON . We have an epidemiologist in the audience, and \u2014 where is he? Would you mind coming up? I would like to have you sworn in real quickly. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb URTON . Thank you. Can you explain the importance of properly counting these chil- dren born before 1988 who were given the Catch-Up vaccines? STATEMENT OF DR. WALTER O. SPITZER, PROFESSOR EMERI- TUS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, MCGILL UNIVERSITY, AND MEM-BER, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, CORPUS CHRISTI, TX Dr. S PITZER . Well, as implied by Professor \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . Point of order, Mr. Chairman. Point of order, if you will suspend your answer to that question. I want to make a pointof order. Mr. B URTON . The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. W AXMAN . The rules of this committee require that ''Wit- nesses appearing before the committee shall, so far as practicable,submit written statements at least 24 hours before their appear-ance, and, when appearing in a nongovernmental capacity, providea curriculum vitae and a listing of any Federal Government grantsand contracts received in the previous fiscal year. Identification ofwitnesses are to be provided to members of the committee.

The ranking minority member shall be respon-sible for providing the same information on witnesses whom theminority requests. '' Suddenly, we have a witness being called forward. We have all of these people testifying, and we have now a witness coming up \u2014 I do not know who he is. It just seems to me that this is in viola-tion of the rules. Mr. B URTON . I think as you were reading there, where there are ''unusual circumstances ''\u2014and I believe you can go back and read that again \u2014or whenever ''practicable '' was another term that was used in there \u2014so the chair \u2014excuse me, let us suspend for one mo- ment. [Pause.] Mr. W AXMAN . Mr. Chairman, if I might be heard \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No\u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN [continuing]. And I am going to withdraw my point of order \u2014but I do want to say that there are procedures for the conduct of hearings which provide for opportunities for all pointsof view to be expressed. And for a witness to be brought out of theaudience because the witnesses before you did not give you testi-mony that fit with your preconceived theory seems to me to turna congressional hearing more into a circus than a genuine fact-find-ing opportunity. But I will not object if you want to call this witness. I do want to also point out that we have rules on the time allocated to mem-bers, and I would insist that that time be observed or that allmembers be given the same open-endedness that I see about to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 your questioning, because the clock that usually keeps time for our questioning has been deliberately stopped. I will not object, but I do think it is inconsistent with the rules of this committee to bring witnesses out of the audience when youhave a panel here that just testified, with whom we ought to pur-sue our questions. Mr. B URTON . The parliamentarian has just informed me that where there are extenuating circumstances, the chair has the abil-ity to bring a witness forward \u2014and this is not the first time this has happened. [Applause.]Mr. B URTON . That is the first thing. The second thing is that this is one of the most important hearings I think we have had, becausewe are talking about an epidemic of autism that is taking place inthis country, and if there is information that is being given to thecommittee that is going to be in the Congressional Record that isnot accurate, it needs to be corrected as quickly as possible so theAmerican people and people from around the world who may wantto look at the record of this committee have the facts. Now, if we have an epidemiologist here who has expertise about a report and can cite that information about this report wherethere might be an error, then we ought to correct it right now, in-stead of waiting until a report is filed, goes out to the Americanpeople, and then try to correct it where there might be a misunder-standing. So \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . Well, we do have an epidemiologist on this panel, and perhaps you ought to question her, or this other witnessshould have been asked to testify. No one would have objected tohaving anybody who had anything pertinent to say to us to havean opportunity to present what they have to say. Mr. Chairman, let us proceed, and let us keep the rules on time, or acknowledge the open-endedness of questions, because we willhave a lot of questions as well. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Spitzer. Dr. S PITZER . Very briefly, Congressman Waxman, your points are well-taken, and I respect them. I will say now to Professor Taylorthat those additional cases in the Catch-Up Campaign may wellhave been included in the paper but were not clearly segregated oridentified or enabled peers to evaluate the possible impact of in-cluding them or not, so the findings may have been misleadinguntil we reanalyze them taking that into account. Moreover, the use of the case series strategy of analysis is uncon- ventional, not accepted by mainstream scientists, and leaves thepaper at best as a hypothesis-generating study and not somethingwith which he or anyone can categorically say this proves thatthere is no relationship. It just shows and emphasizes what he saidhimself, that we need to study it further. So we have a compelling reason to have a blue panel, an inter- national panel, to go back to that data base, look at the raw data,and be able to come up with a second assessment that is verifiableby the scientific community and the relevant community. Thank you, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. Mr. T IERNEY . Point of order, Mr. Chairman. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I comment on that? Mr. B URTON . Stop the clock. The gentleman will state his point of order.Mr. T IERNEY . Is Mr. Taylor going to be given an opportunity to respond at this point in time? Dr. T AYLOR . May I comment? Mr. T IERNEY . I think it might be helpful to those of us who are sort of surprised by this new witness. I would like to hear what Mr.Taylor has to say in response to that. I think it would be edu-cational. Mr. B URTON . I have no objection to him responding, but I have some more questions of Dr. Wakefield, so \u2014\u2014 Mr. T IERNEY . Well, Mr. Chairman, my point of order is can we have them nearer in time to each other so we can get the full bene-fit of it, rather than go back and forth. Mr. B URTON . I will yield to the gentleman next. He can have the time next, or Mr. Waxman can, and he can yield to Dr. Taylor. Dr. Wakefield, would you come back up, please? Dr. Wakefield, would you clarify the difference of opinion that you have from yourcolleague? Dr. Wakefield. My anxiety, Mr. Chairman, is that if you test a step-up hypothesis \u2014that is, those children who should be the first to receive the vaccine at the age of 1 year, born in 1987, becausethe vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988, and therefore theywould have been 1 year old, then the take-off, if there were a rela-tionship between MMR and the vaccine, should have occurred atthat point. The paper illustrated the point that the take-off occurred before those born in 1985 and 1986. What took place when the MMR wasintroduced was the Catch-Up Campaign, where all children of 1 to4 years of age were targeted. It was an aggressive campaign \u2014I know that, because one of the authors on the paper that we pub-lished in the Lancet was in charge of that campaign for Hackmeyin Northeast London. If you give the vaccine to children over theage of 2, then it will cause the take-off to occur before 1987, andthat is exactly what occurred. Now, at the very least, those cases should have been mentioned, because the reviewers, in the absence of those data, cannot give avalid interpretation of the paper when they make a recommenda-tion for it to be published or not, and they should have been ex-cluded from the analysis so we could see how the graph lookedwithout them, and that did not occur, and that is a major anxiety. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Taylor, do you want to respond now? Dr. T AYLOR . It does seem slightly surprising that at one moment, we are accused of excluding them and therefore that upsets the re-sults, and now we are accused of including them, and that upsetsthe results. I have to say the time relationships, the step-up part of our paper is the least important part of our findings. The direct find- ings, the time series analysis, is much more important, which isthe direct evidence that the individual children did not developsymptoms of autism within various defined periods after they re-ceived the MMR vaccine. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 just comment on Dr. Spitzer 's comment, he describes our analysis as unorthodox. We used the highest standards of epi-demiological and statistical analysis in our handling of this data,and this data has been reviewed by numerous experts, both priorto publication and since. Last week, our research was the basis of a detailed debate at the Royal Statistical Society, where there was no criticism of the statis-tical techniques that we used, and the conclusions of our paperwere accepted by this very expert group. The testimony which you received from Dr. Elizabeth Miller, who is an epidemiologist, and Dr. Patty Farrington, who is an expertstatistician, is tabled for the committee 's consideration. Mr. B URTON . Would you mind, since there is a strong difference of opinion between you and Dr. Wakefield, and I presume someothers, providing the data for your study to the committee, thecomplete data? Dr. T AYLOR . I will have to take advice on that from both my col- leagues and the others. I would be required to decide whether thecommittee is an appropriate body for this information, which wascollected, as you know, by the Medicines Control Agency, which isa branch of the Department of Health in the UK. In principle, Ihave no problem, but in practice, I would need to check \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, we would be very happy to write to the De- partment of Health in the UK and ask that you be able to releasethat information to the committee in total so that we could havesomebody who is totally nonbiased, hopefully, on this issue to ana-lyze it. Dr. T AYLOR . Yes. I think it would need to be done by more than a selected statistician. If it is to be reanalyzed, it should be reana-lyzed by independent individuals \u2014which, of course, is the problem with much of Mr. Wakefield 's research, that it has never been inde- pendently verified. No one anywhere in the world has been able toreproduce any of his studies, and it seems possible, and it is onlygoing to be a matter of time before this most recent information isalso found to be inadequate. Mr. B URTON . Well, my time has expired, but let me just say that I believe that Dr. Wakefield and Professor O 'Leary and others would be willing to give us the documentation in the study thatthey did, and we would like to have yours as well so we can lookat all of that. Mr. Waxman.Mr. W AXMAN . Mr. Chairman, because I believe autism is such a serious problem, I am troubled by this hearing. This hearing wascalled and structured to establish a point of view, and it is thepoint of view of the chairman. The chairman believes a particularpoint of view, and that is the connection between autism and vac-cinations. You can look at it by the first panel, where we had five parents, all of whom believed the same thing that the chairman believed,and the way we just had the handling of the questions a minuteago. What also bothered me was when we asked that we have the American Medical Association or the American Public Health Asso-ciation or the National Network for Immunization Information or VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb of HHS, Dr. Louis Sullivan \u2014real experts in addition to those we have before us \u2014we were told no, they cannot fit in. I think hearings like this have a real danger because if you sen- sationalize the idea that there is a connection between immuniza-tion and autism, immunization rates will drop. That is what hap-pened in Great Britain after Dr. Wakefield published his firststudy. Immunizations dropped. Autism rates did not drop, but mea-sles rates increased. I was impressed by the statement that we had a drop of just 10 percent in measles immunizations in 1990, and then we had 11,000people hospitalized from measles. This can cause brain retardationand death. We know we can prevent that. Why should we thenscare people about immunizations until we know the facts? I fear that what we have in this hearing is a sensationalization by the chairman in order to get all these cameras to report to theAmerican people that there is this connection because he believesit, and many other people believe it, and therefore a lot of otherswho watch this will think, ''I will not immunize my children. '' Dr. Wakefield came out with a report in England, and the first group that examined his claims was the Medical Research Council,which is the British equivalent of the NIH, and they found no evi-dence to indicate any link between the MMR vaccine and boweldisease and autism. After they did their work, the Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom issued a letter to doctors in 1998, stating, ''Based on the previous material that I have seen and on the opinion of expertspresent at the Medical Research Council, I have concluded there isno link between measles, measles vaccine, or MMR immunization, '' etc. Then, the World Health Organization looked at his study, and they came up with the following statement: ''Given our view, the previous scientific claims made by Dr. Wakefield and colleagueslack scientific credibility, and his present study does not meet therequirements for establishing such a causal relationship. '' I do not know whether that is true or not, but that is what the scientists in England said when they evaluated it, as did Dr. Taylorwhen he evaluated Dr. Wakefield 's study. Now, Dr. Wakefield has testified he has some new information. Fine. Let us get the new information out there. Let us let the epi-demiologists evaluate it. Let us let scientists explore where thetruth may be. But to put this out in a congressional hearing andscare people from getting immunizations \u2014we know that without immunizations, dreaded diseases will occur, deaths and mental re-tardation and disability will occur among our children, and we canprevent that. What we do not know, and we have a lot of information to the contrary, is that autism will result from that immunization. Dr. Taylor \u2014well, let me ask Dr. Boyle. You are an epidemiolo- gist. Suddenly, we had to pull out of the audience an epidemiolo-gist. But you are an epidemiologist. What do you have to say aboutthis debate that we are seeing back and forth? Have you evaluatedany of this information that is now being presented as if it werefact? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 I think that the scientific data currently does not show an association between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wehave heard from Dr. Taylor. We also know that there is a studyin Sweden by Dr. Gilberg and associates, who have been monitor-ing\u2014Sweden is actually the only country that has been monitoring the rate of autism over time \u2014and they looked at pre-MMR immu- nizations and post-MMR immunizations and found no changes inthe rates of autism. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, I cannot tell you what is true or not, but I do not think our chairman can tell you what is true or not either,and I feel that when we had the hearings on whether there werecampaign abuses by Democrats, a lot of people 's reputations were ruined, and I thought the hearings were unfair. But those were po-litical. The consequences of an unfair hearing on autism connectedto vaccinations can cause people to die, and I worry about that, andI think we should get the facts before we make the assertions andnot make the assertions and then throw out the witnesses who tellus information that does not fit those allegations. I yield back the balance of my time.Mr. B URTON . The gentleman 's time has expired. Does the gentlelady from Florida wish to question the panel?Ms. R OS-LEHTINEN . Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you for holding this hearing. Rather than asking questions, because I am needed for a caucus in my other subcommittee, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, forholding this important hearing and for highlighting the need forfurther research as we explore the possible causes, interventions,strategies, counseling and other services to help families who areliving with autism. We need to keep in mind that a person withautism is indeed a person first and not a behavior. These posters, which I would like to have the audience and the panelists see, show constituents from my Congressional District,Bonnie and Willis Flick, two beautiful children in my district whoare living with autism, and, indeed, the whole family lives with au-tism. Bonnie and Willis are fortunate to be able to afford treatment and therapy, but so many other families are not as fortunate. So I thank you for the opportunity to hear from researchers and from parents and people who cope daily with this disease, and Icommend you for your initiative, Mr. Chairman, in seeking an-swers to help those individuals with autism and for the opportunityto learn from experts and researchers. I especially want to thank you for allowing Dr. Cathy Pratt, the director of the Indiana Resource Center for Autism to come todayand share her expertise on what we as policymakers can do to helpfamilies deal with autism. Approximately 50 percent of Florida 's children with autism re- side in my community in south Florida, so I am delighted to haveyou take this leadership role, Mr. Chairman, and have your com-mittee address this issue so that 1 day, we can find prevention andmethods and a cure to help us all cope with this rising curse of au-tism. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Will the gentlelady yield Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask Dr. Wakefield, because I want to conclude with this panel and move on \u2014would you be willing to give us all of the information on your study so it can be reviewed? Dr. W AKEFIELD . Certainly. Mr. B URTON . AKEFIELD . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. Professor O 'Leary, would you be willing to give us all the infor- mation on your study so that we can review it? Dr. O 'LEARY . Yes, sir; no problem. Mr. B URTON . I cannot hear you. Dr. O 'LEARY . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . OK. Dr. Singh, would you be willing to give us all the information on your study so we can review it thoroughly? Mr. S INGH . Yes, absolutely, without any hesitation. Mr. Chairman, if there is a moment, if I may have a chance, I would like to raise some interesting points later on. Mr. B URTON . Yes, but just 1 second. Mr. S INGH . Yes. Thank you very much. Mr. B URTON . Now, then, Dr. Taylor, will you give us all the infor- mation on your study so we can review it along with the others? Dr. T AYLOR . In principle, I have no problem, but I would need to discuss that with my employing authority, University CollegeLondon, and with the Department of Health, who funded thisstudy. Mr. B URTON . Who funded your study, Dr. Wakefield? Dr. W AKEFIELD . We did. We have a small charitable contribution, but\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . A charitable organization did; I see. Dr. W AKEFIELD . We found it a little difficult to get funding \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . And yours was done by the Government? Dr. T AYLOR . It was funded by the Medicine Control Agency, which is the body charged with responsibility for the safety of vac-cines and other treatments. Mr. B URTON . Well, I would be happy to work with the ranking Democrat, Mr. Waxman, to get an independent group of doctors/sci-entists that we mutually agree upon to review all of your work tocome to some kind of a conclusion if that is possible. So, since Dr. Wakefield and Professor O 'Leary and Dr. Singh have all agreed, we would sure like to have yours, and I will behappy to write a letter, as I said before, to the authorities in Eng-land asking for your report, and hopefully, we will get that alongwith the others so we can review them side-by-side. Mr. W AXMAN . Mr. Chairman, on that point \u2014and I want to agree with you. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . I drafted a letter, and I am going to share it with you, and I hope you will join with me on this letter to SecretaryShalala. We say in this letter: ''Because of the vital public health importance of childhood immunization as well as the growing con-cerns over the prevalence of autism in the United States, we urgeyou to convene, under the auspices of the National Institutes of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration, an expert panel of leading sci-entists and clinicians to review whether there is any causal asso-ciation between vaccines and autism. Given the grave possibilitythat immunizations against life-threatening childhood diseasesmay decline is a result of unsubstantiated allegation of vaccine-in-duced autism, I would want her to act as expeditiously as possible. '' Perhaps you will join me in this letter because I think the only proper thing to do is to get the experts to evaluate all of these con-flicting claims. I would not want the American people as a resultof this hearing to stop being immunized if these claims are not \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me reclaim my time and say nor would I, but one of the concerns \u2014the time is right there; it is on the clock \u2014let me just say that the Department of Health and Human Servicesand Donna Shalala and the others have some very competent peo-ple over there. We have been checking into all the financial recordsof the people at FDA, HHS, and CDC, and we are finding thatsome of those people, even on the advisory panels, do have somepossible financial conflicts, as was expressed in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine just recently, on their front page. As a result, I will join with you to get an independent panel to review all of these studies, but I want to make sure they are notcontrolled by the health agencies of this country that may havesome people who have some possible conflicts of interest. It has al-ready been expressed in the New England Journal of Medicine, andwe believe that that also possibly exists with some of the agenciesof our health services here in the United States. So I will join withyou, and we will pick them together, and we will try to make surethat we have some people who are totally unbiased. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, ''independent '' means no conflict of interest. I would not want a panel that had people with a conflict of interest,but I do want a panel of experts, and I think that the NIH andthe CDC and the FDA can give us a panel that can do this evalua-tion. [Laughter.] I do not know why some people find that amusing, but I think \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So long as we find there is no conflict of interest, we would not have any problem with that. Mr. Tierney.Mr. T IERNEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have to say that I am a bit disturbed with the nature of this hearing and the direction that it has gone, only because I have aconsiderable number of people in my district who have not onlychildren with autism, and they deal with it every day, but we havea number of institutions that have been working hard to give peo-ple the kind of support they need to deal with this situation, andI find this hearing taking on a lot different tone than a hearingthat would like to look at some solutions and work together in acooperative way to find out just what we can do. I do note that Representative Michael Bilirakis from Florida has some legislation filed, and one of the provisions would authorizefunding for the NIH to establish Centers of Excellence that wouldconduct basic and clinical research into the causes, diagnosis, de-tection, prevention and treatment of autism. I congratulate the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb panel who are cosponsors on that legislation and hope that that is the direction in which we will proceed, becauseI think we need to find out what the causes are. First, Dr. Boyle, you are an epidemiologist. Given your back- ground, have you examined the evidence that autism is increasingin the United States? Ms. B OYLE . We do know that the rates of autism appear to be higher than previously thought. As I said in my testimony, theyrange from 10 to 15 per 10,000. But that is really from studiesfrom other countries. We have not had prevalence studies con-ducted in the United States. There were two done in the eightiesthat found very low rates, with perhaps methodologic reasons forthat. At CDC, we have begun to develop a monitoring program at CDC which is only for the Atlanta area. We have our first year of datacollected, and we are in the process of reviewing the informationon the children with autism, and we hope to have a rate fairlysoon. And we would like to see similar activities in many other lo-cations. We have a wonderful model on birth defects. They aremany years ahead of us in terms of trying to understand the causesof birth defects, and there are about 35 States that monitor birthdefects on an ongoing basis. That does not happen for develop-mental disabilities, and we need to make that happen. Mr. T IERNEY . There are people in my district, particularly in the Merrimac Valley area, who seem to have at least acknowledged anincreased number of reported cases, if not of autism itself, of oneof the related diagnoses. Have you heard of \u2014\u2014 Ms. B OYLE . It is a difficult issue because the diagnosis for autism has changed considerably. The first studies were based on fairlynarrow criteria from the way it was originally described. The morerecent studies have actually used criteria that are much broader,and there is increased recognition. So we really do not know. Therehave been a number of investigators who have tried to see whetherthe increase in rates over time, or the higher rates in more recentyears, is really due to a real increase or sort of a redefinition andbetter awareness. It is not an easy question to answer. Mr. T IERNEY . I bring that up only because in one instance, at least, a group of very active parents of children with autismworked with the school system and some other researchers andheightened the awareness of identification and found a marked in-crease in the number of cases that were beginning to be identifiedin the area, so people had not really appreciated these symptoms,including some doctors, pediatricians, who looked at it. Does that sound right to you?Ms. B OYLE . The one study that has addressed this is the study by Gilberg which I mentioned earlier, which looked at trends overtime. If you look at the range of functioning of those children overtime, it appeared that the increase was in children who were high-er-functioning as well as children who were lower-functioning. Sothe classic group seemed to remain constant. Now, why that is hap-pening, we do not know. That is what we hope to do the researchto understand. Mr. T IERNEY . Well, I agree that we ought to do this research and do it soon. I am a little bit concerned about what might be the mes- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 from this hearing by people and what we want to take on this. Dr. Boyle, if you had young children today, would you vaccinate them? Ms. B OYLE . I do have children, and they are both fully vac- cinated, and I would vaccinate them again. Mr. T IERNEY . Dr. Offit, how about you? Dr. O FFIT. Yes. I have a 7-year-old son, Will, and a 5-year-old daughter, Emily, and they are both fully vaccinated. Mr. T IERNEY . And you would do it again? Dr. O FFIT. Of course. I want them to be protected against the vi- ruses and bacteria that can cause serious disability and death. Iam fortunate, actually \u2014I was a little boy in the early 1950 's, and when I was a little boy, there were four vaccines \u2014diphtheria, per- tussis, tetanus and smallpox. I was fortunate that I was not killedby measles or paralyzed by polio. My son, hopefully, did not haveto be as lucky, but hopefully, as we move into the 21st century andcan develop vaccines against respiratory virus and para flu, chil-dren will not have to die from those diseases. Mr. T IERNEY . Dr. Boyle, you wanted to add something. Ms. B OYLE . I did want to mention one thing. We do monitor the trend of other serious developmental disabilities in Atlanta, andjust based on my own experience over the last 10 or 15 years, weused to see children who were deaf due to congenital rubella orwho had mental retardation due to hemophilus influenza Type B.We no longer see those children in our program. Mr. B URTON . The gentleman 's time has expired. Mr. T IERNEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . I just have a few more questions, and then we will go to the next panel \u2014I think Mr. Waxman has a few as well. Dr. Boyle, why did the CDC ignore the pleas of the parents of Brick Township when they begged CDC to look at the vaccineissue? Ms. B OYLE . Actually, the study of Brick Township is sort of our first step, which is to look at the prevalence of \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Did you check into the vaccine issue, though? The parents there wanted the vaccines looked into as well. DidCDC \u2014\u2014 Ms. B OYLE . The concern with the parents from Brick Township in a number of meetings that we had with parents was related toenvironmental concerns. Mr. B URTON . They did not \u2014\u2014 Ms. B OYLE . We have been working with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registration \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But didn 't they also ask that the vaccines that had been given to their children also be investigated? Ms. B OYLE . That is not my understanding. My understanding is that their initial concern was to answer the question, is the rateof autism in their community higher than what they thought \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, the information that we have is that the par- ents of Brick Township were very adamant that they wanted thevaccines checked because so many of their children had become au-tistic. And evidently, that is not one of the things that CDC is look-ing into, and I would like to pose the question to you and have you VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb \u2014why? Why didn 't CDC include as one of the things they were investigating the possibility that some of thesevaccinations may have caused the autism increase? Would youcheck that out and let me know? Ms. B OYLE . I would be happy to. Mr. B URTON OK. [The information referred Taylor, you have shown the measles virus in the intestine, and you have in your laboratory \u2014or ''laboratory, '' as they call it in your country \u2014you have gone through and checked those samples that were sent to you by Dr. Wakefield that showthat there definitely was measles in the gut of these children whobecame autistic. I think Dr. Singh verified the same thing. Did you check any of that, Dr. Taylor, why there was measles in the guts of those children? Did you take a look at any of that? Dr. T AYLOR . I am sorry, I have not had a chance to look at this paper. It is interesting information. However, in terms of Mr.Wakefield 's history, in all of his initial results, he has found the cure for, first of all, Crohn 's disease, and he has found the cure for\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask you this \u2014I do not want to go into those other things \u2014Dr. Wakefield showed us on his slides that there was measles in the guts of these children who were vac-cinated with the MMR shot. Professor O 'Leary verified it in a sepa- rate laboratory \u2014\u2014 Dr. T AYLOR . Not in a separate laboratory; that was the same lab- oratory. That, I think, is the critical point. Mr. B URTON . Well, it was \u2014\u2014 Dr. T AYLOR . This information does have to be verified by an inde- pendent laboratory. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. It was sent to him \u2014and Dr. Singh, I think, verified it as well. You have not, though, looked into theproblem with the measles in the gut of these children, though? Dr. T AYLOR . I do not know quite what you mean. That is not my area. Mr. B URTON . You have not checked into that; OK. Professor O 'Leary, did you want to say something? Dr. O 'LEARY . Sir, can I make a comment, please? What I pre- sented is evidence, direct evidence, cell-based and tube-based. Itwas done at a separate laboratory from Dr. Wakefield 's. If Professor Taylor has a beef with me, he should say that. My work is completely independent. I stand over it. I have come hereto tell the truth. There is nothing for me to be gained in not tellingthe truth. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Singh, you had some more comments, and I want to yield the balance of my time to you to respond. Mr. S INGH . Yes, just a couple of things. Basically, I want to raise the issue that when we think about epidemiological studies, whatare these individuals really looking at. All they do is they takenumbers from previous, old records of what-have-you. They do noteven pay any attention to the fact that old-time vaccines weremade based on old immunology. Today, immunology is so different;it is almost a difference of day and night. So we need to take intoaccount that new research should really be evaluated by so-calledexpert epidemiologists. The second thing \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, let me just say one more thing. I want to ask Dr. Boyle one last question, and that is do you believe anybody whois getting funds from Merck or any of the other pharmaceuticalcompanies should be on advisory panels that are making judg- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 coming from those companies, or do you believe that that is a conflict of interest? Ms. B OYLE . I think that is a difficult question to answer. Mr. B URTON . Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You think it is a difficult question to answer. If somebody is getting fundingof some type from a pharmaceutical company, for them to sit on anadvisory panel that is approving or giving their approval to a newdrug that is coming on the market, you do not see that as a con-flict? Dr. S CHWARTZ . Mr. Chairman, I am Dr. Schwartz. I am a col- league of Dr. Boyle and am the acting director of the Epidemiologyand Surveillance Division in the National Immunization Program,and we appreciate your indulgence in allowing me to testify and tohelp with answering questions about immunization. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is a char- tered advisory committee under the FACA regulations. There arevery strict guidelines regarding the participation in votes of mem-bers who may have conflicts of interest that will help assure thatthose potential conflicts of interest, those potential financial con-flicts, do not affect the votes and the decisions of the advisory com-mittee. The reason why individuals who may potentially have conflicts are included in the committee is to assure that we get the best ex-pert advice possible so that we can make the best vaccine rec-ommendations possible, and frequently, the best experts are thosewho may have done research or may have provided information tosome of the vaccine manufacturers \u2014but their role in the committee and in the voting process is very strictly defined. It is also important to point out that recommendations for vac- cination are made independently by the American Academy of Pe-diatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, andthose recommendations are virtually always in harmony with therecommendations from the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices. Mr. B URTON . Well, I am going to go ahead \u2014my time is expired, but I am going to come back to you on that. I will take anotherround on that. Mr. Waxman.Mr. W AXMAN . I want to say to the parents in the audience and to others, family members, who are here that I do not want youto think that I am in any way trying to minimize what you havegone through or to in any way challenge the depth and sincerityof your feelings. I think that is a separate question from the sci-entific question of whether there is a causal link. And because itis so important, it is essential that through sound science, we de-termine this fact \u2014not through emotionalism and not through sen- sationalism. I did not come here to say one side is right or one side is wrong, but I want us to have the best scientific information we can have. Now, Dr. Offit 's integrity has been challenged, presumably be- cause he has a point of view that does not quite fit with the chair-man's point of view. Dr. Schwartz started to indicate why he thought your situation, even though you have a relationship withMerck, did not put you in a conflict. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb you directly, Dr. Offit, do you have a conflict of inter- est, and if ''No,'' why not? Dr. O FFIT. No, I have no conflict of interest. What I have is an apparent conflict of interest, and that is why I disclosed that at thebeginning of every ACIP meeting, and that is why I disclosed it inmy written report. If I could just explain this a little bit, I have been doing research for 20 years on rotaviruses. What I have done in my laboratoriesis try, with my colleagues, to understand what the genes are thatcause diarrhea and what the genes are that help the body fight in-fection. That led to a patent on a vaccine for rotavirus. Rotaviruseskill 13 children a day in this world, and rotaviruses cause 1 out ofevery 75 children born in this country to be hospitalized. It is a se-rious, and in developing countries often a deadly, infection. It would be an advance if we could prevent that disease. Merck and Company has made a commitment to developing that vaccine,and hopefully, if we can develop a safe and effective vaccine, wecan prevent a lot of disease and death. Mr. W AXMAN . I think that everyone here should agree that we want a safe vaccine, or a vaccine that is as safe as possible. Merckdid not hire you to come up with a particular position, did they?Did they tell you they wanted your research to have a certain out-come? Dr. O FFIT. No. This work was all done \u2014frankly, it was funded by the National Institutes of Health, and it was funded by researchthat we did as a basic \u2014I am an immunologist \u2014that is my exper- tise. Mr. W AXMAN . There is an organization \u2014and I am going to put this in the record \u2014called the Autism Autoimmunity Project. I have a letter from its president urging people to give money to it, be-cause this project is going to fund research that is going to showthe connection between vaccines and autism and other diseases.And they proudly say they fund Dr. Wakefield and Dr. Singh. Isthat true? Mr. S INGH . Yes. Mr. W AXMAN Is that true, Dr. Singh? Mr. S INGH . Yes. I just received some money from that founda- tion, oh, about 2 months ago. My research has been going on onthis issue for the last 15 years. Mr. W AXMAN . Yes \u2014and I am not saying there is anything wrong with it \u2014\u2014 Mr. S INGH . I just wanted to make a point on that. Mr. W AXMAN [continuing]. Although this organization seems to have a particular point of view. How would you think they wouldfeel if your research came up with a different conclusion from whatthey wanted to achieve in their \u2014because they have a position \u2014\u2014 Mr. S INGH . Mr. Waxman, I am a very honest, decent human being \u2014unlike, perhaps, some other people that you might know of\u2014and I can tell you that if I found a connection which was not existent or if my results did not support what this foundationwanted, I would even return the money to that foundation. Mr. W AXMAN . Even though they want a particular point of view \u2014\u2014 Mr. S INGH . They never asked me to do any research \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb You are an independent scientist, and you have integrity. Mr. S INGH . What I am \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . Just answer yes or no, because I do want to ask\u2014\u2014 Mr. S INGH . I beg your pardon? Mr. W AXMAN . My question to you is they have a point of view, but they fund you, you have integrity, and you are going to do yourwork based on science. Is that your answer? Mr. S INGH . My answer is that I am getting funds from private sources because national agencies continue to decline my researchgrant proposals when I submit. Where else am I going to go to getthe funding? Mr. W AXMAN . Have you been turned down by NIH? Mr. S INGH . I am trying to raise funding independently, on my own, not necessarily \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . Have you been turned down by NIH? Mr. S INGH . Three times, I have attempted \u2014three times, I have written grants, and NIH has not given me a single dime. Mr. W AXMAN . I want Dr. Wakefield to be able to answer the same question very briefly. Dr. Wakefield, you acknowledge you have received money. Do you feel that that in any way raises expectations that your re-search come out with a result that this organization wants? Dr. W AKEFIELD . We are funded to test hypotheses, and we present the data whether the hypothesis is correct or not. And wehave done that, we have gone on record as doing it. We publishnegative studies in association with measles and Crohn 's disease. That does not mean it is not there; it means that our hypothesiswas wrong in terms that we could not find it using the technology.So we have gone on record as publishing both positive and negativedata. Mr. W AXMAN . I ask unanimous consent that those documents from the Autism Autoimmunity Project be put in the record, andI would note, Mr. Chairman, that you are also associated on theboard of this group. Mr. B URTON . Without objection. That is no problem. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I see this as a little bit different situation. The pharmaceutical companies who are producing jobs \u2014and they do a great job for the country \u2014but they have a financial interest in get- ting things approved. The New England Journal of Medicine has recognized this in a recent publication, on the front page. They said that they had somepeople on their advisory committees who had made some commentsand made some recommendations that had financial interest, andthey had not scrutinized them properly, and they apologized for itand said it would not happen again. So what I asked Dr. Boyle and what I am inferring here today is that there can be a bias if people are being paid or reimbursedby pharmaceutical companies when they start making a decision ora recommendation on an advisory panel. Now, you said that if they represent Merck or Bristol Meyers or some other laboratory, they will probably excuse themselves fromvoting, and there may be a requirement for that. That does notalter the fact that they are sitting on that panel, and they are talk-ing to everybody else on that panel, and they have influence onthat panel, and they do have a tremendous impact on whether ornot certain things are approved or disapproved. And I think thatthat is a conflict of interest. I do not see why we cannot have peo-ple on advisory panels who have no financial interest whatsoeverwith pharmaceutical companies when they are approving those, be-cause we are talking about the health of the Nation. And that issomething which ought to be investigated very thoroughly by thisCongress. We are talking today about autism, but there is something of as great stake here as the autism question and whether or not theMMR vaccine and other vaccines may be contributing to autism,and that is are we letting pharmaceutical companies have too greatan influence on the decisionmaking process that affects very one ofour lives? Right now, we are talking about the anthrax vaccine. They are going to inoculate every one of our military personnel, and thereare all kinds of questions about the anthrax vaccine, all kinds ofthem. We have had all kinds of side effects that we have talkedabout, and I have talked to people who have had them. And theformer chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is on the board of thatcompany that makes the anthrax vaccine. They are manufacturingmillions of doses of this vaccine, and every member of the servicewill have to get six shots of that. If the decisionmaking process in-volves people who have a financial interest in it, and that out-weighs the potential side effects of any drug, then I think there issomething amiss. So I have great concerns about that, and I would just say to you that HHS and CDC and FDA and all of them ought to take a hardlook at whether or not they have people on their advisory panelswho have a potential conflict of interest by getting money or some- thing else from a pharmaceutical company that they represent. Now, I was not trying to impugn the integrity of Dr. Offit, but I did want to point out that he does get money from Merck andgets some benefits from Merck. So for anybody to say that he can VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb unbiased is questionable. Maybe he would be totally un- biased, but it is questionable. So I think that this whole issue of whether or not the MMR vac- cine is a problem \u2014the measles vaccine has been found in the gut, it has been verified, and we still have this problem, and the ques-tion was whether or not it goes from the gut up to the brain andis a contributing factor to autism \u2014but the companies that make the MMR vaccine have people on the advisory boards who are par-ticipating in the decisionmaking process. So it makes me wonder whether we are going to really get to the bottom of it unless we go to outside entities \u2014and that is not ques- tioning anybody 's integrity. It is just saying that if I am paying somebody money for some product or something, and there is some-thing else that I am going to make money off of, and they are ona board that is going to participate in a decisionmaking process, tosay that they do not at least think about me and think about wherethe money is coming from just boggles my mind, and I think itwould most people. With that, do I have any further questions? Let us see what else we have here. [Pause.]Mr. B URTON . OK. Dr. Boyle, for your information, at a public meeting in Brick Township in January 1997 \u2014and you should know this\u2014with CDC and others present, several audience members asked about the vaccines and the possible autism link, and theyasked that vaccines be checked. That is from Andy Napoli, the leg-islative director of Representative Chris Smith. So, I again want to stress that we want to have an answer from CDC. If parents from that township were wondering about the pos-sible connection between these vaccinations and autism, why didn 't CDC check on it? Why not? You are checking on everything else,the other environmental concerns around there. Why not check onthe vaccine? And I submit that maybe, just maybe, it is because the pharma- ceutical company that manufactures it had some influence on thepeople who were in that meeting, and they said, Hey, we do notwant to get into that. And if that is the case, that is damned nearcriminal. With that, I will be happy to yield back the balance of my time and let Mr. Waxman have his 5 minutes. Then we will go to thenext panel. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to have Dr. Spiker come forward, if he would.Dr. S PITZER . Spitzer. S-p-i-t-z-e-r. Mr. W AXMAN . Oh. I am sorry. Dr. Spitzer, where are you \u2014\u2014 Dr. S PITZER . I am a professor of epidemiology with the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University in Montreal. Mr. W AXMAN . When you came forward a moment ago, you ap- peared to be reading from a prepared statement. Did you have a statement written out that you read from? Dr. S PITZER . Yes, I did. The circumstances are that I personally learned of this hearing, and of related activities very late in thegame. I have been an honorary assistant to 2,100 families in the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb who have great difficulty getting scientific help and cannot afford it. I have chosen on this issue \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . Excuse me. Did you prepare that statement your- self before the hearing? Dr. S PITZER . Yes, I did. Mr. W AXMAN . OK. And were you contacted or did you contact Chairman Burton 's staff before your testimony? Dr. S PITZER . I did so indirectly, to the best of my knowledge, through a person named Ms. Barbara Fisher. Mr. W AXMAN . And could you identify Barbara Fisher? Is she here? Dr. S PITZER . She is here in the audience. Mr. W AXMAN . Is she a staffperson for the committee? Dr. S PITZER . No. She is in the vaccination \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . When did you talk to her? Was it today or earlier than today? Dr. S PITZER . I spoke to her yesterday and the day before yester- day by telephone and met her here \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . And you met her here? Dr. S PITZER . I met her this morning. Mr. W AXMAN . But you talked to her yesterday and the day before about coming here to testify? Dr. S PITZER . Yes. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much. Dr. Offit \u2014\u2014 Dr. S PITZER . I am sorry. It was primarily for the press con- ference, but with the possibility of being able to testify as well. Mr. W AXMAN . Yes \u2014some extenuating circumstances for which the rules did not have to be observed. Dr. Offit, the chairman says he is not impugning your reputa- tion, but it sounds to me like your reputation has been impugned.You get money from Merck. They make the vaccine. You are on anadvisory committee for the CDC about vaccines. That is an appar-ent conflict of interest. Again, why isn 't it a conflict of interest? Dr. O FFIT. Because as I sit on the Advisory Committee on Immu- nization Practices and make recommendations for children in thiscountry, the only thing I consider is exactly how I would treat myown children. I mean, I take the job very seriously. So the rec-ommendations that I make are based solely on a careful review ofthe data that are presented to us, period. I do not have any conflictwith regard to that decisionmaking process. It is simple in thatsense. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. Boyle and Dr. Schwartz, what would happen if you excluded people from your advisory committee who workedin the area of research on vaccines or in some other area for apharmaceutical company? Dr. S CHWARTZ . Those with the greatest expertise on vaccines and those who are best able to make recommendations that will protectthe health of American children have frequently done research in vaccines. They are the ones who know the issues best and who canmake the best recommendations. By including them on the advi-sory committee, but implementing appropriate controls to makesure there are no apparent conflicts of interest, the CDC feels that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb advice to make the best public health rec- ommendations. Mr. W AXMAN . How about people who are funded by the Autism Autoimmunity Project \u2014have you ever heard of that group? Dr. S CHWARTZ . The ACIP meetings are all open public meetings. They are all \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . What is ''ACIP? '' Dr. S CHWARTZ . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac- tices meetings are all open meetings and are announced in the Fed-eral Register. If someone from that particular institute wanted tocome and share information or present to the ACIP, they wouldcertainly be welcome to do so. Mr. W AXMAN . And would you feel they have a conflict of interest if they are funded by an organization that wants to have scientistsestablish a certain conclusion? Dr. S CHWARTZ . I think the most important thing that we need to consider is the quality of the scientific data and whether those datahave been peer-reviewed, whether they have been considered byother scientists, and whether they have been replicated in otherlaboratories. Mr. W AXMAN . So you think the most important thing is that Dr. Wakefield and Dr. Singh ought to disclose if they are funded bythis group, and Dr. Offit ought to disclose if he is funded by Merck. Dr. S CHWARTZ . I think disclosure is important, yes. Mr. W AXMAN . And then you evaluate their science? Dr. S CHWARTZ . Yes. Mr. W AXMAN . Because ultimately what is at stake are the sci- entific questions that we want answered. Dr. S CHWARTZ . That is exactly correct, and preserving the health of American children. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, that, it seems to me, should be the goal of all of us, and I hope that hearings like this are to try to get to thatresult and not simply to further a particular point of view whichcould well be wrong, and if it is wrong, as I fear it may be, by ad-vertising this particular point of view and scaring the public, wecould see a drop in immunization rates. And we do not know if au-tism will drop \u2014in fact, we have evidence from Great Britain that it did not drop when immunizations did \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I am allowing you extra time because I have one more question. I am allowing you extra time. Mr. W AXMAN [continuing]. I am getting extra time \u2014for good be- havior \u2014that when we do have an example in the real world of sen- sational press about the link between autism and vaccinations, vac-cination rates dropped, and we knew that caused an increase inmeasles, but we saw no decrease in autism. It is troubling to me. I appreciate all of the views that have been expressed here, and I hope that we can get an independent groupto look at this, because I do not think this committee is an inde-pendent group trying to reach an honest conclusion. I yield back the balance of my time to the chairman.Mr. B URTON . Let me just make one final comment, and that is that the people who are doing the independent studies here do notsit on any advisory boards that are making decisions on what kindsof vaccinations we are going to be giving to the people of the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb The people who represent the pharma- ceutical companies and sit on those boards do. That is the dif-ference. And let me just conclude by saying that I really appreciate all of you being here. This is a very difficult issue. I think it was un-avoidable that there would be this kind of contention today becausewe have a lot of parents and grandparents, like myself, who feelvery strongly about the life that our kids and grandkids are goingto have to lead; and on the other side of the issue are the peoplewho are saying there is no impact from the shots that are beinggiven to our kids. So the bottom line is that there are going to be strong differences of opinion, and we want to get all those differences of opinion onthe record, and then we will all go out and have a cup of coffee to-gether and debate it in private. The American people need to know the facts. Lincoln said, ''Let the people know the facts, and the country will be saved, '' and I think that is just as true today as it was at the beginning of thisRepublic. So that has been our goal \u2014not to fight with everybody, but to get the facts out. And we are all for vaccinations. It is justdo we want to give a child nine vaccinations in 1 day; do we wantto give them 31 or 32 or 33 vaccinations between the time they areborn and age 6? Isn 't that maybe a little bit of overload? That is the whole question. I want to thank this panel. We have one more panel. I really ap- preciate all of you being here, even though we may have some dif-ferences with some of you. Thank you.I apologize to the next panel for having to sit there for so long.While the next panel is coming up, we will take a couple-minute break. The next panel consists of Dr. Bernard Rimland, Dr. Mi-chael Goldberg, Dr. Mary Megson, Dr. John Upledger, Dr. Cath-erine Pratt, Dr. Deborah Hirtz, and Dr. Edward Cook. We will start in just 1 minute.[Recess.]Mr. B URTON . The committee will reconvene. Would everybody please take their seats and shut the doors, please? I appreciate very much your patience today. Would the panel please rise? [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Have a seat, please. will start with you, Dr. Rimland. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 AUTISM RE- SEARCH INSTITUTE, SAN DIEGO, CA; DR. MICHAEL J. GOLD-BERG, DIRECTOR, NIDS MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD,TARZANA, CA; DR. MARY N. MEGSON, PEDIATRIC AND ADO-LESCENT ABILITIES CENTER, RICHMOND, VA; DR. JOHN E.UPLEDGER, THE UPLEDGER INSTITUTE, CLEARWATER, FL;CATHY L. PRATT, INDIANA RESOURCE CENTER FOR AUTISM;DR. DEBORAH G. HIRTZ, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH;DR. EDWIN H. COOK, JR., UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Mr. R IMLAND . Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. It is a great honor and a great privilege. I want to start by commenting that there has been a lot of dis- cussion during the past few hours about the supposedly unprovenhypothesis that vaccines may cause autism. There is anotherunproven hypothesis which has been unchallenged and unques-tioned, at least relatively so, and it is really a very important hy-pothesis, and that hypothesis is that vaccines are safe. The real hypothesis which should have been tested years and years and years ago by much more scientific research than hasever been devoted to it is the proposition that vaccines do not causedamage. The Vaccine Information Adverse Reaction Reporting Sys-tem has not been studied; it has not been looked at at all carefully,and therefore, the assumption that many people are making is that the vaccines have been looked at carefully for adverse reactions,and they have not been. The other point I want to make has to do with the testimony of Dr. Brent Taylor, who spoke here on the last panel. I was verybothered by the lack of information and the confusing informationin his paper. My entire life has been spent as a professional re-searcher \u2014almost 50 years of my life has been as a full-time profes- sional researcher. I am a fellow of the division of statistics, meas-urement and evaluation of the American Psychological Association. I wrote a friendly letter to Dr. Taylor indicating that I would very much like to take a look at his data, because I did not under-stand part of it, and there were some questions that I wanted toraise. He ignored my first letter. I sent a second letter, and he re-sponded to that by saying no, I could not have a look at his data. I then wrote to the editor of the Lancet urging that a blue-ribbon committee be appointed to take a very close look at the data of Dr.Taylor. So I am delighted that you have asked for it as well. My own son Mark was born in 1956 as a severely autistic child from birth. Our pediatrician, who had been in practice for 35 yearsat that time, had never seen such a child or heard of such a child. When Mark was 2, my wife and I found the word ''autism '' for the first time in a textbook. I was at that point 5 years beyond myPh.D. in psychology, never having heard of or seen the word ''au- tism'' before. It obviously was a very rare disorder, extremely rare. None of us had heard of it. Today it is extremely common. There is hardly a high school kid in the country who has not heard of autism. It is a household wordnow, and that is not because of the movie ''Rain Man, '' but because it is extremely prevalent. Despite denials from some experts, there is a terrible worldwide epidemic of autism. In the mid-1960 's, after my book ''Infantile Au- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I began hearing from parents throughout the world whose children had been normal until given the DPT shot.I began to make note of it and ask questions about it in the formletters I sent out to parents seeking information about autism. In the past few years, the Autism Research Institute, which I di- rect in San Diego, has been flooded with letters and faxes aboutchildren whose parents say and can prove very well with video-tapes and photos that their kids were normal until getting anothertriple vaccine, the MMR shot. In my view, the evidence is over-whelming that vaccines, especially the triple vaccines, and amongthe triple vaccines especially the MMR, can and do cause manycases of autism. It is also alarming but true that 90 to 99 percent of adverse reac- tions to vaccines are never reported. There is no penalty for a doc-tor's failure to report a bad vaccine reaction, so they simply do not do it. Why should they engage themselves in paperwork if there isno requirement that they do it and no penalty for not doing it? This being so, how can the authorities claim that the vaccines are safe, given that only 1 to 10 percent of adverse events are everreported? Doctors must be trained to recognize, and required, notjust requested, to report adverse events. With regard to the question of genetics, they say that autism has a large genetic component, and therefore, vaccines must play aminimal role. My book, ''Infantile Autism, '' published in 1964 was the first systematic attempt to marshal the evidence for a geneticrelationship to autism, so I am certainly not hostile to that idea.However, genes do not begin to account for the huge increase in theincidence of autism. There is no such thing as an epidemic due togene problems. The increase ranges from 250 to 500 percent in var-ious places, as other people have pointed out here. As the editor of the Autism Research Review International, I have just reviewed a very large number of studies on the geneticsof autism. The next issue of the Autism Research Review is goingto contain our review study. The results of our review are spectacu-larly inconsistent. The best guess is that there are at least 20 dif-ferent genes that may be involved in the causation of autism.Genes are not the answer to the question, even though, at onetime, I was very much in favor of looking at that hypothesis. I amstill interested in the hypothesis, but it is certainly not responsiblefor the increase in autism. The people who claim that the vaccines are safe claim that au- tism naturally occurs at about 18 months, when the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine is routinely given, so the association ismerely coincidental and not causal. But the onset of autism at 18months is a recent development. Autism starting at 18 months rosevery sharply in the mid-1980 's, when the MMR vaccine was intro- duced. For the previous 30 years \u2014we have been collecting informa- tion from children born in the fifties, sixties, seventies, and soforth \u2014there were twice as many kids reported with the autism started at birth as there were kids whose parents reported that theautism started at 18 months. Starting in about the 1980 's, when the MMR vaccine was intro- duced, those two curves converged. Over a period of several years,the number of kids whose autism started at 18 months rose to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb as the number starting at birth. On the last page of my handout, I have a graph that shows those curves based on therecords of over 31,000 children in our San Diego institute. So thatparticular argument against the MMR hypothesis is obviously avery poor one. Autism is not the only severe chronic illness which has reached epidemic proportions, as the number of very profitable vaccines hasrapidly increased. Children now receive 33 vaccines before theyenter school \u2014a huge increase. The vaccines contain not only live viruses, but also very significant amounts of highly toxic sub-stances such as mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde. Could thisbe the reason for the upsurge in ADHD, asthma, arthritis, Crohn 's disease, lupus, and other chronic disorders? It seems as though weare trading protection against acute diseases such as measles andmumps for a huge epidemic of chronic diseases like autism, asth-ma, and the others I mentioned. As a parent and a full-time professional researcher, I am bitterly disappointed with the medical establishment 's dismal record with regard to autism over the past 60 years. The medical schools aswell as the Government agencies have consistently supported out-moded, unproven and even disproven ideas, including the one thatautism was caused by ''refrigerator mothers '' who did not love their children, thus causing autism. The medical establishment was op-posed to behavior modification, or what is now called the ABA ap-proach. They said that this was not a way to treat autism, becauseautism was based on deepseated emotional problems, so a tech-nique that is used to train animals cannot be used to improve au-tistic children. That was untrue. They have ignored and continueto ignore the long series of studies conducted both in the UnitedStates and Europe showing that the elimination of foods containinggluten and casein from the diet brings about marked improvementin many autistic children. They have consistently ignored the seriesof 18 consecutive studies conducted by researchers in six countrieswhich show that almost half of all autistic children and adults re-spond favorably to high doses of Vitamin B6 and magnesium, withno adverse reports from any of these studies. Eleven of these stud-ies were double-blind placebo-crossover experiments. There is nodrug which comes even close to B6/magnesium in terms of safety,efficacy, and positive research findings, yet it is not being exploredat all. Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on nonproductive lines of research while virtually no money at all has been given toresearch on methods of alternative medicine which are far morepromising in terms of both safety and efficacy. The most interesting questions are not being asked. Why does the majority of any population survive such epidemics as autism,the bubonic plague, Legionnaire 's disease, polio and AIDS, while relatively few succumb? The very obvious answer and the most probable answer is that the survivors have healthy, effective immune systems. Would en-hancing the immune system decrease the likelihood of adverse re-actions to vaccines \u2014including, by the way, the anthrax vaccine. I hope that DOD will pay some attention to that. There is good rea-son to think about anthrax in this context. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb that the immune system must be adequately supplied with many nutrients if it is to function properly, includingespecially Vitamins A, C, E, B6, and a number of minerals, includ-ing zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Nutritional levels of these sub-stances are not only harmless, but they are essential to goodhealth. Since people do not change their diets readily, I believe that foods should be fortified with these nutrients, especially foodswhich will be consumed by infants and children. Research alongthese lines, as well as on the safety of the vaccines, is desperatelyneeded. Recently, Professor Clementson published a paper \u2014he is the au- thor of a three-volume treatise on Vitamin C \u2014reviewing the evi- dence showing that individuals who are vaccinated without havingadequate supplies of Vitamin C in their bodies are far more likelyto suffer an adverse reaction to the vaccine than those who havehigher levels of Vitamin C. Dr. Archie Kalokerinos of Australia, a pediatrician assigned by the Government to the outback people there, found an infant deathrate of 50 percent among the children he cared for. They died soonafter the vaccines. He found that they were extremely Vitamin C-deficient, and he learned that by giving them some extra VitaminC, he could prevent their deaths. The death rate went from 50 per-cent to zero in a very short time. Dr. Kalokerinos was given amedal by the Australian Government. We should be giving our children Vitamin C as well as other nu- trients to make sure that their immune systems are well-fed andfunction well. I think we would see a lot fewer of the problems thatwe are experiencing today. As a parent and as a researcher, I believe there should be a marked redirection of effort and funding along the lines suggestedabove. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Rimland. I appreciate your com- ments. Dr. Goldberg.[The prepared statement of Dr. Mr. Chairman and members of this committee, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak here today. Iwish to take a moment to examine the urgency of this epidemic. I am Dr. Michael Goldberg, a practicing pediatrician for over 20 years in Los Angeles, and I am on the clinical teaching staff ofUCLA. I am also the founding member of the NIDS Research Insti-tute, a parent-physician partnership developed to expedite researchon behalf of children with special needs. Out of necessity and a desire to help, my practice is comprised primarily of children with autism, ADD, and other special needs.I am here before you today to share my frontline, everyday experi-ence with these children, experience that has overwhelmingly con-vinced me and my colleagues that this is a disease that can betreated. In turn, I hope to propose a unique medical research model that combines the tenets of basic science and strong academics with anunprecedented sense of clinical urgency. To understand this new autism that everyone keeps speaking about, one must actually step back and look at the increased un-derstanding and incidence of autoimmune diseases across theboard from the mid-1970 's to the present date. All that one has to do is look at the medical literature to realize that every disorderwe have associated as an immune-connected, immune-mediated de-fect of the system \u2014lymphomas, multiple sclerosis, 's, lupus, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, rheu- matoid disease, and even aging \u2014have all become recognized as in part an autoimmune process or illness. As Dr. Galpin, an authorityin infectious disease immunology and a pioneer in the applicationof immune-modulators and a member of the NIDS Medical Boardlikes to say: The friendly fire of our own bodies causes the damage. We either have to assume that the increase in these disorders in the human population is mass hysteria, mass psychosis, schizo-phrenia and/or behavioral-developmental disorders, as was thoughtin the old days, or we need to step back and realize that maybewe have a large number of adults and children suffering a diseaseprocess that is affecting how their brain and nervous system func-tions. I have family after family within my new practice in whichthere is a mother or a father with chronic fatigue syndrome, anolder child with ADD/ADHD, and a young child or two with au-tism/PDD. Unless we assume that this is all random, unfortunately, there is a logical connection between the above disorders and the rapidemergence of this crisis. We must rapidly realize that almost all ofthese disorders result from a treatable disease process. When you look at the factors among the children that I am see- ing, many of them have low natural killer cells. These are part ofthe findings being reported in many of those other disorders. An-other frequent finding is the presence of active HHV -6 virus and other related herpes viruses in some of these children. Similar find- ings are being reported for various adult autoimmune disorders,and recently, even the Centers for Disease Control published an ar-ticle focusing on our emerging knowledge of HHV -6 and related disorders. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 talk about the unknown entity of au- tism, I can show you picture after picture after picture that has al-lowed me with the help of researchers, Dr. Ismael Mena and Dr.Bruce Miller, to look at NeuroSPECT scans and understand whatis going on in the brains of these children. For the majority, thereis a decrease of blood flow and function of the temporal lobe of thebrain, areas that are consistent with that predicted by neuro-anato-mists. We have a large collection of scans that show a decrease in blood flow that is reproducible, quantifiable. Blood flow corresponds di-rectly to function. When compared to MRIs and CAT-scans, theyhelp to confirm no pre-existing damage but rather point toward aneuro-immune direction etiology. In fact, as we learn more throughimaging and scans and technology about the brain, in a recent NewEngland Journal of Medicine article a year ago, they discussed theimmune-brain-endocrine connection in the hippocampus, a systemthat, with the CA1 and CA2 nuclei and neuron, affects cognitivefunction, fatigue, and memory. Today I have come to look upon this as a reversible condition. Thankfully, many children return to normal/above normal function-ing by combining steps reflecting diet control, a combination ofantivirals, antifungal, and low-dose SSRIs. Parents who are told that their children will never be independ- ent, will never be able to earn a living, will 1 day might have tobe placed in an institution, have seen their children become top oftheir class academically. I have children within the practice scoringin the 97th and even the 99th percentile in California and IllinoisState testing. This past week, a mother came to me with her 5-year-old child, who has been with me in the practice for about 8months. She related an instance where the child said, ''Mom, do you want me to pretend I cannot talk? Remember when I could nottalk? '' We have so misunderstood and misjudged these children. What harm are we doing to these children as a result? Hopefully, tomorrow, we will see new agents which will let us work better with the immune system. If we can focus a unified ef-fort to identify a subspecialized set of immune markers, that willlet us understand which patient is the most likely candidate forwhich immune agent, separate out this mixed group of childreninto logical subgroups. In my written submission to the committee, the NIDS Medical Board outlines a hypothesis which is supported by over 60 journalreferences on children with autism and the neuro-immune diseaseprocess that is potentially reversible. It is interesting to note that that hypothesis has been reviewed by at least four pharmaceutical companies, and there are no holesor deficits in that hypothesis. Within the NIDS Institute, our researchers are all heavily credentialed, and many are involved in current NIH projects andother activities at the NIH and the FDA. Using this technology,their past experience, and a computerized data base, we can unifyresearchers in institutions across the country. We can literally pickand choose top physicians and researchers around this country andaround the world to focus on the crisis it has become. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb I am pleased to announce that members of the Mind Institute are hopefully looking at joining and combining ef-forts, and my hope would be that many independent groups canfocus in a scientific manner on answering the questions beingraised by this committee today. Another significant benefit of exploring this disease process with a sense of urgency would be the unprecedented ability to screenchildren who might be susceptible to vaccines or any other factorswhich have been implicated as potential roles in subsets of thesechildren. Any injury or loss of a child that could have been pre-vented remains unacceptable. There is no way to adequately con-sole the parent of a lost or damaged child. If focused correctly, we do have the ability to accelerate under- standing and identification of potentially high-risk children. If wecan identify these children, adjust their vaccine schedule appro-priately, we have begun the process of stemming this epidemic andwill have created a preventive health policy which would be partof a collective legacy for generations to come. In 1996, I was a speaker at the Autism Society of America, at- tended by over 2,000 parents and professionals. My wife made thecomment: ''Where are the M.D.s? '' The medical community had es- sentially abandoned these children once they became labelled asautistic. The NIDS Medical Board is designed to help logically, academi- cally, scientifically circumvent the expected learning curve as wesee physicians coming back into this field make a radical shift indirection and orientation from what we might have been taught asphysicians. I plead with you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. These children are supposed to be a productive part of this coun-try's future, not a health cost and burden. These children have the potential for full, productive, intelligent lives. Contrary to the oldidea, their genetics are not the determining factor. A child cannotdevelop normally, develop some language, and lose it all, except ina disease process. We can apply good, sound science and logic tohelp solve the crisis now. We must embrace what is literally a paradigm shift in the world of medicine and begin to view autism and other related classifica-tions like we do Alzheimer 's disease, cystic fibrosis, childhood can- cer, and multiples sclerosis. Tragically, if we accept the status quo,we will be sacrificing millions of kids and will likely lose more insubsequent generations. I implore you to investigate the concepts I have introduced, evaluate them, test them \u2014do whatever it takes to convince you that we have a crisis for which inaction is politically and medicallymore risky than action. I am extremely fortunate to have three healthy children and one healthy grandchild. I selfishly want the rest of my future grand-children, all of yours, and others out there to have the samechance. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 URTON . Thank you, Dr. Goldberg. As I think you can prob- ably guess, we are going to pursue this for a long time. Dr. G OLDBERG . I hope so. [The prepared statement of Dr. follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 M EGSON . Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mary Megson. I am a board-certified pediatrician, fellow-ship-trained in child development, a member of the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics and on the clinical faculty at the Medical Collegeof Virginia. I have practiced pediatrics for 22 years, and the last 15 years, I have worked only with children with developmental disabilities,which include learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism. In 1978, as a resident at Boston Floating Hospital, I learned that the incidence of autism was 1 in 10,000 children. Recent surveyshave suggested an incidence in several parts of the country of be-tween 1 in 300 and 1 in 600 children. Over the last 9 months, I have charts now in an office that I opened last June on 1,900 patients, well over 1,200 of whom havefullblown criteria for autism. I have 70 autistic children in a clini-cal trial and I am beginning a second clinical trial to look at treat-ment on these children. At the same time, the State Department of Education says there are only 1,522 children with the diagnosis of autism in the Stateof Virginia. Mental health and mental retardation agencies have scrambled to set up infant intervention programs and have had a hard timekeeping up with the numbers of delayed infants and toddlers. Ihave served as an advisor for the city of Richmond and the sur-rounding counties as they set up these infant programs and alsoset up special education programs for children with autism. Nowthere are autistic classes in each county and several classes in sev-eral schools. There has been a very rapid rise over the last severalyears, The segment of children with ''regressive autism ''\u2014who de- velop normally and then regress usually between 18 and 24months \u2014has increased dramatically. This past week, I was in- volved in four cases of children who were perfectly normal in theirdevelopment until they had their school-age shots at age 5 \u2014DPT, hepatitis vaccine, MMR. Within weeks, they were autistic. In thepast, this was unheard of. In the vast majority of cases, I have discovered that one parent or another reports night blindness or other rare disorders associ-ated with a defect in something called a G protein. G proteins areproteins inside the cell that join receptors that sit in the cell mem-brane. They are cellular proteins that upgrade or downgrade sig-nals in their sensory systems all over the body that regulate touch,taste, smell, hearing, and vision. They are important also in turn-ing on or off multiple metabolic pathways, including those for glu-cose, lipid, protein metabolism. They also turn on and off pathwaysfor cell growth differentiation and survival. Close to the age of autistic regression, we are adding a second defect to the G protein \u2014namely, pertussis toxin \u2014which completely disrupts these G protein pathways. The opposite G protein path-ways are on without the off switch. In my research, I have discovered that some children are pro- tected if they have the lipid-soluble form of Vitamin A, that 's found in natural sources. Those children, especially those who are breast- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 vaccines in spite of having the genetic defect and do fine. However, the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine at 15 monthsof age depletes the body of all Vitamin A. When they get the DPTthe same day or several months later, many of these children dis-connect. There are several metabolic problems that I am seeing repeat- edly in these children. The pathway to break down the storageform of glucose in the body is on without opposition. These childrenhave elevated blood sugars. In the past week, I have been madeaware of four cases of autistic children who developed juvenileonset diabetes. There is a 68 percent incidence of diabetes in theparents or grandparents. Lipid breakdown is turned on without opposition. I have diag- nosed many 2 12-year-old children with autism who have serum cholesterol of 240 and above. There is an incidence in one of threeof these families of heart attack of a parent or grandparent underage 55 and diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Of great concern, cell growth, differentiation, and survival is turned on, which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. In the first 60families I examined, there were 62 cases of malignancies associatedwith the RAS oncogene. I have also discovered that the measles antibody that the body makes, once they are exposed to the measles vaccine, cross-reactswith intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments are the gluethat hold the cells that line the gut wall together, so when they getthat MMR vaccine, they develop a leaky gut. Intermediate fila-ments are also important in areas of high stress. One of the areasof highest stress in the human body is the upper small intestineright below the stomach. They develop a chronic autoimmune dis-order at that point. The loss of the cell-to-cell connection also occurs in the blood- brain barrier and in the cells that surround the bite annicul: wheretoxins are excreted from the body. So any toxins that they are ex-posed to, leak through the gut wall, and they cannot pump themout of the body. The loss of cell-to-cell connection interrupts another process in the body which is very important called aproptosis, or the abilityof neighborhooding cells to get rid of abnormal cells. The MMR vac-cine at 15 months precedes the DPT vaccine, which turns on un-controlled cell growth differentiation and survival. Most families have reported cancers in parents or grandparents. The genetic defect found in 30 to 50 percent of adult cancers is acancer gene, the RAS oncogene. This is the same defect that is thedefect for congenital stationary night blindness. In Harrison 's Textbook of Internal Medicine, which is the stand- ard textbook in medical schools all across this country, it is statedthat it is absolutely contraindicated to give the MMR vaccine or ameasles vaccine in the face of Vitamin A deficiency. I am afraidthat some of these children are facing that vaccine when they arealready deficient in their Vitamin A stores, and then they cannotreconnect pathways. Most of us in our current diets have the lipid-soluble form of Vi- tamin A taken out. This lipid-soluble form is found in liver, kidney,milk fat and cod liver oil. In lowfat milk products, however, it is VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 another, water-soluble form is added which they are unable to absorb. Mr. B URTON . Pardon me, Dr. Megson. You heard all those buzzers. That means that I have to run to the floor and vote or else I will be voted out of office, which I donot want to happen. Dr. M EGSON . OK. Mr. B URTON . So if you will please bear with me, I will get over there and vote and get back just as quickly as I possibly can, be-cause I am very interested in everything that you folks are saying,and I do want to get answers to a number of questions. We have two votes, and I will be back just as quickly as possible, so we will stand in recess \u2014there are how many votes \u2014I think ev- erybody had better get a cup of coffee, because there are four votes.It is probably going to be half an hour before I get back. I apolo-gize. We stand in recess.[Recess.]Mr. B URTON . I really want to apologize to those of you who have been so patient today hearing all the debate. It must have been dif-ficult for you, but I am sure it has also been entertaining. Would you close the doors in the back after everyone comes in?OK. We left off with Dr. Megson in a very impassioned moment of her talk. Dr. M EGSON . Briefly, I was saying that in the vast majority of these children, I get a history from one parent or another of a dis-order associated with a defect in these major signalling proteins,the G proteins. As I approached my research, I looked through the eyes of these children and tried to figure out what their world was like. Nowthat I have talked with them and know what questions to askthese children, I understand how these G protein defects affecttheir perception. They have a severe loss of rod function in their eyes. There are four beautiful studies that have been published and out there forseveral years that show this. They are then left with cone functionin which to see their world. Cones give us color and shape in ourenvironment. The only situations I could imagine having only colorand shape to organize my world are those ''magic eye puzzles, '' where you look beyond and back up, and then you get a box of 3D.That is the only place in their visual field where they get a 3D im-pression of objects. Mr. B URTON . Everything else is flat? Dr. M EGSON . Correct. Only then, when they look at a box, like television or a computer, or a therapist who is sitting right in front of them, do they consist-ently hear the right words for what they are looking at. So thatmost of the day, they are not hearing the right words for what theyare looking at, because they only have one area of their visual field where they see 3D. I have treated some adults, and one adult I am treating in Ala- bama calls me every week and gives me the measurement of his''box'' as it grows, and he gets better, which is really fun. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb of perception and sensory perception are con- trolled by G protein pathways as well, and adding a second defectto these children, who on a genetic basis probably have a first de-fect, changes multiple sensations. Their avoidance of eye contact isan attempt to have light land off-center in the retina, where theyhave some rod function. So when they look away from Mom, theyare actually looking at Mom. When we make them force their pu-pils directly in front of us, we are making them look away from us.With this form of natural Vitamin A treatment, within days, theylook right at you. The other things that happen in these children \u2014suddenly, Mom 's touch starts to feel like sandpaper on their skin because of modulation of touch; common sounds sound like nails scraped ona blackboard. These are words that autistic children have given meas they have gotten better. We think these children cannot abstract, when actually, we are sinking them into the middle of an abstract painting at 18 monthsof age, and they are left trying to figure out if the language theyare hearing is connected to what they are looking at at the sametime. This defect for congenital stationary night blindness is on the short arm of the X chromosome, which explains the male-to-femaleratio autism, and it affects cell membrane calcium channels thatDr. Goldberg just referred to in the hippocampus. These are theNMDA/glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. These pathwaysare where major pathways processing language cross from the leftside of the brain to the right. The pathways then go back throughthe hippocampus. The frontal lobe is where attention is added, ex-ecutive function, inhibition of impulse, and all social judgment. When stimulated, these NMDA receptors through their G pro- teins stimulate other receptors in the nucleus of the cell, rightthere at the hippocampus. These receptors were discovered by RonEvans in December 1998. In the animal model, when they areblocked, the mice are unable to learn or to remember changes intheir environment; they act like they have significant visual per-ceptual problems, and they have significant spatial learning defi-cits. Of great concern to me is that when the hepatitis B virus was initially isolated, the protein sequences were isolated and insertedinto the gene for one of these Vitamin A receptors, RAR beta. Thisis the critical receptor important for plasticity and retinoid signal-ing in the hippocampus in this area of major pathway intersection.We will have to look at the vaccine and see if there is any defectbeing produced by that related to the recent increase in autisticspectrum disorders. What I am treating these children with is the natural, lipid-solu- ble form of Vitamin A. I am giving them their recommended dailyallowance only of Vitamin A in the form of cod liver oil to bypassthese blocked G protein pathways and turn on these centralretinoid receptors. In a few days, a lot of these children look at me, focus, they re- gain eye contact, and they talk about their box of vision growing.After 2 months on this Vitamin A treatment, I give them a singledose of a medicine called bethanechol, which system in the gut. What I have discovered is that there are nerve receptors in the gut called acetylcholine re-ceptors, or muscarinic receptors which are blocked in these chil-dren. This medication mimics acetylcholine. It does not cross theblood-brain barrier. I give it to these children in the office, andsometimes, 30 to 40 minutes after the initial dose, after havingpathways corrected for several months of Vitamin A, when I bringthem in and give them this medicine and observe them, they con-nect in the office. I have had children look at me, talk, act out, talkback to their mothers, and use vocabulary above their chronologicalage. This is a disconnect, and I have seen this again and again andagain. Bill Walsh in Chicago has seen it; Woody McAinnis in Ari-zona has seen this change. In one child I have treated beginning last April, her IQ score has gone up 105 points, from 60 to 165. This treatment improves cognition, but these children are still really physically ill. Their Vitamin A stores are depleted, often-times before and if not before, at the time of the MMR vaccine, andthey cannot compensate for these blocked pathways. Vitamin A has been called the anti-infective agent. It leaves them immunosuppressed when they are depleted. They lack cell-mediated immunity. Adding a second defect to this GI alpha pro-tein blocks a very important pathway in the body where you con-vert retinol into something called 14-hydroxy retro-retinol. 14-HRRis needed to turn on T-cells. I give these children cod liver oil \u2014cold water fish oil is the only natural source of 14-HRR \u2014and the children get well. The parasympathetic nervous system which is blocked in the gut is part of what I call the peripheral nervous system. We think ofthe nervous system as having two major parts. The central nervoussystem is the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral system is di-vided into two parts. The sympathetic nervous system is your fight-or-flight response \u2014everything that happens to your body when you run away from danger \u2014you dilate your pupils, increase your heart rate, and increase your blood pressure. The parasympathetic sideof the peripheral nervous system allows us to sit back, relax, focus,and digest our food. We are blocking the parasympathetic side ofthe nervous system, and these children are in fright or flight allthe time. I have asked someone to bring these panels out so you can look at these children and see their faces. I live in a small middle-class neighborhood with 23 houses. I re- cently counted 30 children who were on stimulants for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder. One week ago, my oldest son, who isgifted but dyslexic, had 12 neighborhood friends over for dinner. AsI looked around the table, all of these children but one had dilatedpupils. After 2 12months of taking his recommended daily allow- ance of Vitamin A and D in cod liver oil, my son announced: ''I can read now. The letters do not jump around the page anymore. '' He can focus, and his handwriting has improved dramatically. In a survey in his private high school for dyslexic students who are bright enough to go to college, 68 out of 70 of those childrenreported night blindness. They see headlights like starbursts, andthey get a whiteout when their picture is taken. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 we are staring a national disaster in the face which is affecting thousands of American children. The children with au-tism, ADD, dyslexia are lucky in a way, because they are identi-fied. There are many other children out there who are not identi-fied and who have just been disconnected. We must direct all of our resources and efforts to establish multi- disciplinary centers to treat these children. Insurance companiesshould pay for evaluations, both medical and psychiatric, and treat-ment. For over a year, I have been paying for speech therapy for these children. They are able to talk, but they do not know what to dowith their mouths. I have had 10-year-olds wake up and talk. In-surance companies do not pay for rehabilitative services for thesechildren. These children are physically ill, immunosuppressed,have a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting multiple organ sys-tems. We must get funding to look at the etiology of autism andidentify these children prior to autistic regression and prevent thisdisorder. Implementing vaccine policies which are safe for all chil-dren should be our first priority. Mothers from all over the country have brought pictures of their autistic children to Washington this weekend. Most of these chil-dren were born normal and lost to ''autistic regression. '' Look into their eyes, and you will hear their silence. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. We are going to read the text of your comments very thoroughly. Dr. M EGSON . Thanks. Mr. B URTON . I am John Upledger. I am an osteopathic physician, and I thank you for inviting me to come and present today. I should probably tell you a little bit about my background first, because you will understand that I am coming at autism not in dis-agreement with anyone but by adding another parameter to it. First of all, I used to teach biochemistry, so the molecular things are not new to me. I practiced general medicine and surgery forabout 11 years in Clearwater, FL and then got into the ratheravant garde things, and they invited me up to Michigan State Uni-versity, where I became a clinician researcher in the Departmentof Biomechanics. Being a researcher in biomechanics, I was researching a system which ultimately became called the craniosacral system. Thecraniosacral system is simply a semi-closed hydraulic system. Theboundary of the hydraulic system is the dural membrane which en-cases the brain and spinal cord and provides sleeves for all of thecranial nerves and for the spinal nerve roots. The fluid inside it iscerebrospinal fluid, essentially. Of course, there is blood flowingand so on and so forth within vasculature, but it is not really partof the system. And it is called ''semi-closed '' because the inflow of the volume is controlled, and it is rhythmical, and the outflow israther constant and reabsorbs the fluid; so you have a circulationof fluid with a rhythmical rise and fall of fluid volume and pressurewithin the system. If one looks at advances as we go along, we used to think that cerebrospinal fluid bathed the surface of the brain, and that iswhat it did. About 8 years ago, it was very definitely shown usingradioactive tracers that cerebrospinal fluid is formed in the ventri-cles of the brain, and within seconds of its formation, it not onlybathes the surface but it penetrates all the spaces between all thecells that form the brain; it also goes down the spinal cord inter-nally as well as externally. More recently, in a symposium called ''Neuroprotective Agents '' by the New York Academy of Science, I came across a piece thathad just been discovered, that is, that cerebrospinal fluid not onlycirculates nutrients and carries away waste products, but it alsohas chelating agents in it, so it cleanses the brain of metallic de-posits, which would be the mercury, the aluminum and that kindof thing. So it is very important, and if you look at it this way, it is ex- tremely important, that cerebrospinal fluid flow be kept moving.Stagnation of cerebrospinal fluid is going to lead to brain dysfunc-tion. In my work at Michigan State in developing this department, de- veloping this whole system, what happened was that it was decidedthat I would be working with brain-dysfunctioning children to seethe applications. Autism happened to be one of the things that Iwas assigned to, so for 3 years, I spent 2 days a week at theGenessee County Center for Autism, and I went in there not evenunderstanding the first thing about what autism was. We did work with what was called hyperkinesis in those days, and we found out on a structural level that the hyperkinetic childcould be relieved of his hyperkinetic activity if we released a com- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 of his skull between the first cervical vertebra and the occiputal base. Tracing this backward, this happens a lotduring delivery. The baby is face down, the obstetrician assists thebaby coming out under the pubic bone, the head comes base or for-ward, and the cervical vertebra goes that way, and they jam to-gether. You release that jamming, and you get rid of your hyper-kinesis in a matter of minutes many times. That is not the only cause for hyperkinesis, but when it is there, and you release it, it is very definitely going to show you clinicallythat it is over. We also found out that in newborns we could treat colic this way.When I got into looking at autistic behaviors, there were several things that we noticed, and being a novice, I was not about to ac-cept anybody 's word for anything. I went over there with a neurophysiologist and another fellow who was a generalist inscience, a design specialist, and we started going every week,Thursday and Friday. Our observations showed first of all that a lot of the kids were banging their heads. There were 28 kids in that first year we wentthere. I noticed their head-banging, and they were chewing on theirwrists; they would get all the way down to the tendons sometimes.We were also told they sucked on their thumbs, and I saw that, butthey were not making an airtight things with their lips; what theywere really doing was pushing up on the base of their skulls. So we thought about this a lot, and one would say, OK, they are banging their heads, and this happened at a behavior modificationcenter that we were working at, so I had them take the helmetsoff, and we let them bang their heads and watched very carefully,and it looked like they were trying to knock something loose intheir heads, as if something was jammed together. When we started looking at their wrists and everything, I thought, OK, maybe they are inducing a controlled pain for a painthey have in their head that is uncontrolled, because I think any-body here would agree that sometimes when something hurts, andyou just cannot get to it, you will give yourself a pain somewhereelse, and it at least gives you some sense of comfort. And the otherthing that might be happening is when they are chewing, they areinducing endorphin production and getting that natural analgesia,because endorphins are like a natural morphine. The thumb-sucking clearly, to the point where it was causing the teeth to protrude forward over a period of time, the thumb-suckingclearly was an attempt to mobilize the base of their skull. Anatomically \u2014and now I am in biomechanics, so I am thinking anatomically, and what I am doing a lot of on the other days offis getting very fresh cadavers, dissecting them, studying mem-branes and all of that kind of thing on the inside of the head, soI am tying these two things together. So we began to get the ideathat the cranial rhythm or the movement inside that head was notgiving the amplitude that we were looking for in other children.The autistic head just did not have the craniosacral rhythm, the ac-tivity, so it was not pumping cerebrospinal fluid. Hence, you would get an accumulation of toxic metals. You would also get a deficit in the delivery of fluid carrying nutritional agentsand carrying away metabolic byproducts. You would also get a VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 we began to understand clearly, and this became the model we put forth after about the second year, and that is thatsomething occurred to denature the membrane biochemically sothat it would not expand and accommodate the normal growth pat-tern of the skull as it was trying to expand in the brain and tryingto grow. If the brain is trying to grow against the resistance of amembrane that is having difficulty expanding, you are going to cutdown cerebrospinal fluid exchange and you are going to cut downblood flow. We finally got into it and started decompressing heads forward to backward in this direction \u2014forehead forward, back of the head backward. We would just sit there and hold it, a small force overa long period of time, and ultimately, the head would begin to ex-pand in that direction. When it did, those things that looked likethey were trying to create their own pain \u2014the thumb-sucking stopped, the head-banging stopped, and the wrist-chewing and thatkind of thing stopped \u2014they stopped spontaneously after we re- leased that particular forward-to-backward compression. That was probably very close to 100 percent response. Now, you had to spend a lot of time to get an autistic kid to lie on a tablein an autistic center and let you work on them and have them bequiet, but after we saw them three or four times, they would actu-ally come in, lie down on the table, take your hands and placethem on their head where they wanted them. And I would go alongwith that. The next thing I wanted to do was expand the head side-to-side. I had a lot of graduate students with me all the time and did notknow what to do with them, so I would put one student on eachleg and one student on each arm, and I would just start expandingthe head laterally. Well, we found out that after we got that expan-sion done laterally, first of all, the child would very, very muchrelax, and the body would go into all kinds of contorted positionsand stay there. As they stayed in that contorted position, you couldfeel energetic changes going on throughout their body, and whenthey finished that particular thing, they were very liable to turnaround and kiss you and give you a hug. And after that, they be-came sociable. So what I am looking at is a model here that says, OK, decom- press these membranes. What caused the membranes not to ex-pand? And then, historically, we started looking at it. Febrile epi-sodes were extremely common. The fever could be due to a vaccinereaction, it could be due to a viral infection, it could be somethingin utero that occurred when Mom had a little fever when she wasstill pregnant. And it seemed as though it was taking about 2 to3 weeks historically for most parents to discover the signs of thechanges occurring which were later called ''autism ''\u2014after the feb- rile episode. So we chalked up the idea that most likely febrile episodes could cause a change in the biochemistry of the membrane so that it didnot accommodate the growth process as readily as it could. Now,that does not fly in the face of genes at all, because I am sure thatgenes control some of the accommodative process of the dural mem-brane, and therefore, if they have a genetic predisposition to amembrane that is vulnerable, it takes a smaller shock to make the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb accommodative. That does not bother me at all. We also found \u2014after I got this going, I was invited to London to start an autistic treatment program for children in a craniosacraltherapy clinic, and again, in Brussels. And in London, I have to tellyou that I wound up evaluating children that I thought were autis-tic from a craniosacral evaluation perspective \u2014I wound up with 42 children in that clinic, and I was there for about 4 days evaluatingthem \u2014and 38 of the parents out of the 42 said the febrile episodes were subsequent to a vaccine. And most incriminating \u2014and this would be in the late seventies \u2014the vaccine most incriminated by the parents in their opinion was pertussis. When I went to Brussels, it was an entirely different thing. The feel of the head, the energy patterns in the head, everything wasdifferent. Almost all of the autistic kids I picked up there had beendelivered by vacuum extraction \u2014that is where they put the suction cup on the head and just pull. If you consider a plumber 's tool, and you clamp it on the top of the head and pull, what you are goingto do is extravasate a lot of capillary blood, and when blood breaksdown and deteriorates, it becomes bile in one of its stages, whichis extremely irritating, so the tissue that has these red blood cellsthat are deteriorating begins to contract and cause scarring andlose its accommodative ability. In Belgium, that was the maincause we came across. In this country, there is a great variation. At the autistic center where I spent the first 3 years of my experience, I would have tosay that two-thirds of those kids were in foster homes, so we didnot know much about their backgrounds. But when I finished thecontract for autism at the Genessee County Center in Flint, weopened a clinic at the university, and there, I have to say thatprobably 50 percent of the parents were totally convinced that theautism was secondary to a febrile episode which more often thannot, they related to a vaccine reaction. And I do not say that thatis yes or no, but I say it certainly does deserve a healthy look. Some of the things that I would like to share with you that we did\u2014and it is interesting that Dr. Megson talked about parasympa- thetic, because one of the pieces of research we did on our autisticchildren was to monitor with a thermograph the hand as we werestretching the membranes in the head. And as we got some re-leases, the temperature of the hand would go up 2 or 3 degreesFahrenheit, which indicates that the blood vessels in the hand arerelaxing; you are getting better blood flow. And in order to get bet-ter blood flow, you have to reduce the activity level of the sympa-thetic nervous system which she was referring to, and that is theflight-or-fight system. So we were able to reduce their sympathetic activity by working on their head and stretching their membranes. Now, the whole thing begins to make a lot of sense if you con- sider, then, the things that we were watching happen. If we got achild 's membrane stretched in all directions, and he was feeling pretty good, he would take on a lot of good behaviors; and if wegot that to happen and then \u2014our research was always held up from June until September when school was out, getting the con-tract renewed and all that kind of thing, so we had a lot of children VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb not receive treatment for 2 or 3 months, and they would regress. I look at it this way \u2014their head is trying to grow, and their brain is trying to grow, but they need a mechanical stretchingactivity which is craniosacral work to keep the membrane spread-ing enough so that it will accommodate that intended growth proc-ess. And if you do not have that for a while, then you begin to re-gress because the pressure on the brain and the reduction of fluidactivity, the reduction of blood flow, all begin to recur. So the next thing we try to do \u2014and we have done this success- fully I would say with 30 percent or so of our parent groups, andI did not have the opportunity to do it the way I would really liketo\u2014but we taught them to do this treatment process once a week and maybe see a therapist every 6 weeks or so. That seemed towork if the parents were willing and able to learn how to do it. Itis not hard once you get the initial job done; then it is a questionof maintenance, which is not too difficult. And that is one of thethings we look for. I left the university in 1983 and took time out to develop a proto- type for a holistic health center for Unity Churches, and then westarted our own institute in 1985, at the end of 1985. Since thattime, the way we handle the problems is, first of all, we do not al-ways focus on autism, because the kind of difficulties we have withthe craniosacral system can involve anything from autism to hyper-kinesis to chronic pain \u2014seizure activity is a big one we work with \u2014and all those kinds of things, but about four times a year, we will have a special intensive program for just autistic children.That is what we do, and we try to help the parents learn how towork with it. And when I say ''intensive, '' it is a week, and it is from 10 a.m., until 6 p.m., and it is hands-on work almost all thetime. During that week, we get things pretty well taken care of.And I do not think we have had a child yet who did not show atleast 50 percent improvement during that period of time, and mostof them do significantly better than that. That is about where I am.Mr. B URTON . Very good. That was a very good lecture. I enjoyed that, and we will have some questions about whether or not anyof our health agencies have picked up on your procedures. Dr. U PLEDGER . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Dr. statement of Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today concerning autism treatment options andresearch. I am here today kind of in multiple roles, first as directorof the Indiana Resource Center for Autism, located at Indiana Uni-versity 's Indiana Institute on Disability and Community, and as a board member of the Autism Society of America. I would like to commend you and thank you for holding this hearing. I think that for too many years, the voices of some of thechildren you see on the posters have not been heard; this givesthem a wonderful opportunity to be heard. While I have your attention, I would encourage you to do two things. One is to continue funding the Centers for Disease Preven-tion and Control in terms of looking at the incidence and preva-lence of autism. As I was working with your office on providing tes-timony for today, it is clear that we do not have a true idea of theincidence and prevalence of autism across the United States. The other thing that I would encourage you to do is to work with your colleagues on supporting H.R. 3301, which is the omnibuschildren 's health bill, which would provide clear direction to the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. I am probably the oddity on this panel. I am not a physician. I spend a lot of time in classrooms and in homes and around theState of Indiana, visiting children and their families and their edu-cators and other professionals who support them. And while I knowthat there is broad disagreement about whether there really is anincreasing incidence of autism, I know that we are incredibly busy.I know that I hear from professionals out in the field and fromfamily members that they truly are seeing many more childrenthan they ever saw in the past. So I have to listen to their words. In terms of the potential causes of autism, I hope you realize that autism is referred to as a ''spectrum disorder, '' and along with that, that probably reflects the idea that there is a spectrum of rea-sons why children do develop the characteristics associated withautism and that each of the professionals and family members whoare here today are painting just a piece of that picture for you. Iwould really encourage you to propose legislation and funding thatwill look at the possible multiple causes of autism, and along withthe vaccination issue, the issues around environmental situationsand other issues which parents keep reporting as being possibly re-lated to the occurrence of autism. I have never heard from any of the families an issue about whether they want to vaccinate their children or not. I think theissue is in terms of safe vaccinations. As a professional in the Stateof Indiana, I know there is broad disagreement about whetherthere is a link between autism and vaccinations. As a professional who works with families every day, here is my position. If I could have helped those four families who are heretoday to avoid having a child diagnosed with autism by givingthem accurate information, I would have done so in a heartbeat re-gardless of what the research tells us. I think that is the issue thatall of us face, that when the research may not be proving it, whenwe hear the stories, we want to avoid further stories being told. In addition to looking at the research behind causes, I would also encourage us not to forget about the 500,000 other individuals and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb who currently have a diagnosis of autism and the needs that they have. The families and several of the paneliststoday have talked about some of those needs. The first one is in terms of early intervention. I really applaud the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes ofHealth for starting to look at the essential components of earlyintervention programs that are most effective. I think we have fo-cused a lot of effort on looking at specific programs, and whilethere is some broad disagreement about which of those specific pro-grams is most effective, I think there is some general agreementarising about the components of those programs, and I hope thatthose things will really be looked at. Based on the testimony that I have heard during the National Academy of Sciences meetings, it is very clear that additional re-search is needed to try to really build a case for the various compo-nents of effective programming. The next issue that I would like to cover is full funding for IDEA and the professional development efforts. In a recent report, it wasnoted that 44 out of 50 States are not in compliance with the ''free and appropriate education '' mandate of the Individuals with Dis- abilities Education Act. While those reasons may differ from Stateto State, I believe part of the reason is due to funding. In addition to that, there is a tremendous need for trained pro- fessionals in the field. Sometimes, professionals are placed in therole of supporting challenging individuals, and they do not receiveany training or guidance or assistance in being able to do so. SoI would really encourage that we look at providing funding supportto States for continued professional development. In addition to that, you have heard from many of the parents about the need for accurate information to pediatricians and otherphysicians who play a critical role. They are oftentimes the firstpeople that parents talk to when they think their children mayhave a diagnosis of autism. The information that they can provideto families can help to set them on either the right track or thewrong track. So I really encourage education for them. Another issue that I hear a lot from families is in terms of insur- ance coverage and funding sources. In my written testimony, I pro-vide the example of a family in Indiana that was denied coveragefor their child 's appendectomy because he had a diagnosis of au- tism. Autism is considered a pre-existing condition by some insur-ance companies, so these children are excluded from insurance cov-erage. I hope you realize the tremendous accommodations that the fami- lies that you saw today have had to make to be here today, andin their lives on a daily basis. The tremendous financial devasta-tion that many of them face, the stresses on their marriages \u2014and I am so glad to see that many of them are here, fathers and moth-ers together \u2014the stress on their entire lives is just unbelievable. You know first-hand as a grandparent how tremendous the stress can be. I also need to tell you that your support is greatly appreciated by the autism community. Your support is even more greatly ap-preciated by your daughter today. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 you realize that when insurance companies turn fam- ilies away, they look to other funding sources, whether State orlocal agencies, and in many cases, that money, that funding, isnonexistent or is inadequate for the family support needs. Familiesare told that they have a window of opportunity for their children,and at that point, they have run to get those services and supportsthat they need; and when they are denied the funding they needto be able to provide those services, they will do anything and risktremendous devastation to be able to reach those goals. A population that I hope we will not forget is the adults who have autism. We have a high percentage of individuals who remainunemployed, who are very competent, talented individuals with au-tism; others who are underemployed or in jobs which really do notmatch their talents and skills and interests. In addition, many of them choose living options that are only a far-off dream \u2014to live in a community, to have access to the same rights and privileges as every other citizen of the United States.While progress has been made in this area, much is still left to do. While I commend the committee for taking this opportunity to listen to families today, I also urge you to support authorizing leg-islation and appropriation provisions that will further the state ofautism research. While much progress has been made, rememberthat there is still much to do. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much, Dr. Pratt. Dr. Hirtz.[The prepared statement of Ms. Pratt follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Chairman, I am Deborah Hirtz of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], at the Na-tional Institutes of Health. I have been asked to appear before you today to give the commit- tee and the families of autistic individuals who are here a sense ofwhat we have learned from research, what we hope to achieve, andI want to explain that we at the NIH share the sense of urgencythat autistic individuals and their families and advocates feel withregard to unlocking the mysteries of this devastating disorder. As a physician who takes care of children with neurological dis- orders including autism, this urgency has a particular intensity forme as well. By presenting information about a broad array of NIHautism research activities, I will try to convey to you the strongcommitment of the NIH to increasing our knowledge about autism,what causes it, how best to diagnose and treat it, and we hope nottoo far in the future, perhaps even how to prevent it. I would also like to tell you that over the last 5 years, the total NIH funding for autism research has nearly quadrupled. It was$10.5 million in fiscal year 1995 and $40 million in fiscal year1999. We now know that autism is much more common than we pre- viously thought. Estimates vary widely, but recent studies suggestthat as many as 1 in 500 people may be affected by some form ofautism. Recent reports suggest that the number of children withautism may be increasing substantially. It is not clear whether thereported increases can be accounted for by improved or expandeddiagnosis, or by the increasing availability of services for autismand it would be necessary to study the trends of that prevalenceover time. The NIH recognizes the pressing need to look into these issues and to do this work and is actively working to design studies thatcan give us knowledge in these areas. Accurate and consistent di-agnosis of autism is one of these difficult areas. To address thisproblem and in response to the requests of concerned parents, theNIH sponsored a 1998 meeting of major medical and professionalsocieties, parent advocacy groups and Federal agencies to reviewexisting evidence for autism screening and diagnosis. Based on theassembled research and evidence, a consensus statement is nearcompletion as a practice parameter, which is a professional guide-line for recommended procedures, criteria and timing for screeningand diagnosis in autism. This will be the first time that such amultidisciplinary group has reached consensus on screening and di-agnostic procedures in the area of autism. The specific practice pa-rameters or clinical recommendations, once approved, which we ex-pect to be shortly, by the boards of various relevant professional so-cieties, will be published in widely read medical journals. In the vast majority of cases, no specific underlying cause of au- tism can be identified. A variety of genetic, metabolic, infectiousand unknown factors may be important. The NIH supports re-search directed at exploring the possible role of these various fac-tors and is exploring the feasibility of a very large, multi-agency,prospective study that could shed light on some of these questions. A working group convened by NIH in 1995 reached a consensus that for at least a significant subgroup of people with autism, there VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb genetic susceptibility that most likely involves mul- tiple genes, and the NIH has conducted two major meetings on thegenetics of autism. An exciting development this past year has been the identifica- tion of the gene for Rett syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder.In addition, genetic ''hot spots, '' potential chromosomal locations, for more classic forms of autism have been identified. In anotherarea, NIH is supporting a major pediatric brain imaging initiativeto learn how the brain develops in normal infants, children andadolescents. This will provide important data for comparison instudies of developmental disorders such as autism. Although there is currently no known cure or treatment which can reverse all the symptoms of autism, interventions designed toalleviate specific symptoms are available. In November 1999, theNIH held a workshop in conjunction with the Department of Edu-cation on treatments for people with autism and other pervasivedevelopmental disorders. The purpose of this workshop was toevaluate the current biological, behavioral, psychopharmacologicaland biomedical treatments in autism and to identify critical re-search needs in autism treatment. The written reports and rec-ommendations from the working groups at this meeting have re-cently been assembled and are currently being reviewed by themembers of the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee, which is agroup from various institutes involved that coordinates the NIH re-search activities, and also by the representatives of autism advo-cacy groups to see where we go from here in pursuing various ave-nues of treatment research. I have just very briefly described some of the NIH autism re- search activities. There are several more presented in my writtentestimony. I would like to add that autism research is a major priority for the NIH, and we are committed to continuing to work to expandour efforts. I have tried to stick as closely as I could to the 5-minute limit, Mr. Chairman, so that concludes my prepared statement, but Iwould be pleased to respond to any questions you might have. Mr. B URTON . And your full statement will appear in the record. Dr. Cook.[The prepared statement of Dr. Hirtz follows:] VerDate you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to tes- tify on the topic of autism. I am, as some have before, speaking assomeone wearing three hats \u2014actually, first, as the brother of the late Kenneth Wade Cook, who had many of the problems of chil-dren and adults with autism; I am also speaking as a child and ad-olescent psychiatrist who cares for many patients with autism, andas a biomedical researcher trying to increase our knowledge of thecauses of autism and, above all, to try to increase our ability totreat this devastating disorder. It starts with me recalling being an 8-year-old boy with a 2-year- old brother who my family had just realized was not developingnormally. I remember vividly the pain of my parents. I further re-call that we went to a meeting where, to my recollection \u2014I will not speak for my parents \u2014we were told that it was known from theory about what was known of the brain at that point that ''patterning, '' a way of moving the arms and legs, a special diet, re-breathingthrough a mask, and related methods still practiced today in var-ious forms, would cure his problems. I remember our family being skeptical from the beginning of that meeting. However, by the end of the meeting, we and the otherfamilies in the group were sold on this treatment because it wastoo painful to accept what we knew was happening. If there is anything I have not forgotten, it is that hope is some- thing essential in working with children with severe challenges \u2014 for the children, for the families, and for all of us. I am very thankful to those who were interested enough that far back in children with developmental problems to have spent somuch time with my brother and my family and to be with us. Theyknew that providing us the tools to work to teach my brother thebasics of communication and motor skills was very helpful, and Isuspect that many of them were practicing this method for thesame reason we were \u2014they simply had to try. I could complain about the 5 a.m. mornings in which as a child, it was physically exhausting to perform the patterning, but I amsure it was good training for being a physician-scientist, or perhapsa Congressperson. However, I am not pleased that there was not more time spent teaching me to play with my brother instead of trying to teach himto read just to show that their method was working, when it wasnot even close to being an appropriate next step. Our family learned to accept and love my brother deeply. I would like to add that at this time, the preferred professional responsewas to tell you to put your child away at birth. And some of ourincreased awareness, I am afraid, actually positively, is that we donot simply ship the kids away. We felt sort of like we were goingagainst advice to keep him in our home, which we did for 10 years. I am very thankful that children today have more opportunities for education due to congressional legislation. Excellent communitysupport and model community support in St. Louis was vital to my family during my brother 's last year. Mostly, I miss him deeply, since his death remains as unexplained as his original problem, al-though the two are certainly related. It reminds me that not onlyis there much suffering, there is also death with this disorder. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb also a physician-scientist because I cannot accept this, even after he is gone. Having several hats, as brother, physi-cian and scientist can be extremely painful. I recall my anger asa child when investigators found that patterning was not effective.As it turns out, I collaborate with people at the same institutionat Yale today \u2014but I wondered how could they do such a thing, and how could I now be in their shoes, now that I have studied secretinand have failed to find that it is working as much as initiallyclaimed. The only thing in my defense, frankly, fighting myself here, is to say that I actually shed a tear when the data were analyzed forsecretin, because even though at the bottom of it, there is not a lotof plausibility, I do not care \u2014I deeply wanted this to work. And that is probably what my anger is, that all these things have notprovided what they say they will, and I am the first one who wantsthem to work. So our laboratory, not being satisfied with the status quo, has worked on neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology, neuroimaging andneurogenetics of autism. The reason for our current focus on genet-ics is the data, not our impressions or our wishes, show it to be themost powerful influence on the etiology of autism \u2014and many have been studied carefully \u2014maybe not carefully enough. It is not the only influence \u2014I would agree with what has been said several times \u2014it is certainly not the only influence in autism, and it is certainly not a simple, single-gene disorder. If it were, wewould know for sure what that single gene was. However \u2014and this is very important \u2014it is a rare event in my lifetime to realize that suddenly, molecular-genetic study of autismspectrum disorders provides one of the best scientific opportunitiesin medicine. I must say that usually throughout my career, I havehad my passion, and my colleagues say, yes, it is very important,but there is no scientific opportunity; we cannot learn anythingthere. In genetics, we are actually ahead of most other medical dis-orders when we study autism. In terms of why study genetics of autism, I think it is unlikely \u2014 and I would have said this before recent events \u2014that gene therapy will be the result of genetic research in autism. It is also unlikelythat genetics of autism will explain a relatively recent increase inmeasured autism prevalence. The point of genetic research is to develop treatments that will correct the missing or abnormal signals for a small set of nervecells in the amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellum so that thenerve cells mature. I very much agree with those who are optimis-tic on this point. These are not children who have brains that can-not further develop. That is my view, but it is a view as a scientist.You do not see the kinds of changes in the brain that would makethings not able to move forward. If we knew the signals, what has long been a too complicated puzzle of autism would become simple enough for us to understand.We are all challenged in a sense in trying to make sense of this.So although the simple idea is to provide gene therapy, oral deliv-ery of more traditional small molecules, which we usually refer toas ''medications, '' is likely to be more feasible and preferable, partly because there are few treatments that we have not wanted to take VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb something that I have learned as a physi- cian\u2014I try things, and they make sense, but if they do not work, it is time to stop them. Two recent developments in the broader field of developmental disorders show that complex situation may be better understoodthrough molecular genetics. The first is the finding of the gene forFRAXA, or Fragile XA mental retardation. This is very relevant toautism since a substantial proportion of children with FRAXA haveautism spectrum disorders. Although one wishes knowledge of agene will lead to new treatment sooner, the results of a decade ofresearch in FRAXA to understand the mechanism of this disorderis leading to an almost exponential growth in understanding com-plex interactions of molecules in the process of learning. Mentioned earlier, which is actually quite historic, was the re- cent finding of the gene for Rett syndrome, because this is actuallyfinding a specific gene for an autism spectrum disorder. It is nota-ble that it is caused by a single gene, MECP2, but that it has acourse of regression in social behavior and communication betweenthe first and second birthdays. Knowing the gene has led to abreakthrough in the systematic approach to investigation of Rettsyndrome in terms of how it affects the development of the brain,and this is already moving us forward. Although we do not know the specific genes involved \u2014and I would agree with that, and it is definitely something that is per-sonally frustrating today \u2014several groups have been finding evi- dence that an extra part of chromosome 15 leads to a high risk forautism, especially if inherited from the mother. Believe me, basedon the history of autism, if I could have it come out another way,I would; but this is simply the origin of the chromosome and hasnothing to do with the mother 's behavior, as the theory went in the past. Although this is responsible for less than 4 percent of cases of autism, these 15q11-q13 duplications, like Rett syndrome andFRAXA, are helping us understand autism with regression, be-cause all three of these often have this as a component, more gen-erally. Several laboratories including our own are searching for a gene in this region. As an example of our concern in genetics about notwanting to waste precious resources, the probability at this pointof there not being a gene in this region is about 5 in 100,000 withthe most rigorous blinded studies. But we are not sure yet, andthat is just the way it has to be, because we may expend our re-sources in the wrong direction. We are close to sure at that level. Of course, the problem is that we will have to get beyond regions with likely autism genes to actually finding the specific changesand then getting on with the work of using the information to im-prove treatment, because that is the point. So it is a good thing there are people doing excellent clinical re- search and trying to improve educational and other interventionswhile we are working out the fundamental causes, with many oth-ers. However, it is important not to think we have more of an effectthan we can back with controlled data. The history of autism teaches that zeal without skepticism may have negative consequences. The first was blaming mothers, and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb was false accusation of fathers of children with autism of abuse when their children were undergoing facilitated commu-nication. That was probably the biggest problem that we had lastdecade in terms of things that, on their face, should not have badconsequences but did. The challenges of autism research are obvious. In terms of needs, I mostly want to thank Congress for the appropriation of increasedfunds for biomedical research generally. All of the pertinent NIHinstitutes are now actively engaged in the support of autism re-search. A simple statement of needs is that there are many important and feasible questions about autism not able to be asked with cur-rent resources. There are not enough well-trained researchers inthe field, partly because, in spite of the figures that they have in-creased, I question that it was much more than zero 5 years ago.Most importantly, questions that are being asked efficiently, suchas in the area of molecular genetics and others, are not being an-swered at an optimal rate given current funding in this area. Thatis not OK for me, because my patients are aging with me, andmore are being born. Again, I am not criticizing the funding but ap-pointing a statement of scientific opportunity that we do not wantto miss. I thank you for the opportunity to communicate.[The prepared statement of Dr. Cook, Jr., follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Dr. Cook. Let me start the question with you. Do you subscribe to the the- ory that part of the problems of kids getting autism is caused bythe vaccine? Dr. C OOK. I guess that is a direct question to me, having evaded that. Mr. B URTON . Yes. Dr. C OOK. I have heard more today than I knew before I came. I did not specifically address that because I have not directly stud-ied the question. As I see the data at this point, the data do not support the idea that vaccines cause autism. As someone who studied secretin as anexample, I realize that I cannot prove the absence of something.For example, on secretin, all I can say is that I have proved theabsence of it for myself; if someone else wants to come and onlytreat a certain kind of child in a certain kind of setting, then per-haps our work will have helped them. Mr. B URTON . What would you think, Doctor, of taking a hard look at the conclusions that Dr. Wakefield and Professor O 'Leary and Dr. Singh came to with their research? I know you work ongenetics, but what would you think about looking at their research? Dr. C OOK. Well, in some ways, I work in the area of clinical trials, so I can comment on why they fail to convince me that thereis a connection. They have raised the possibility of a connection,but there are several areas in their logic that do not come together.It may be that if they were up here, they would say, yes, those aregaps that we have to fill \u2014but I am concerned that in the presen- tations, starting with the original paper and today, they have notsufficiently highlighted where the gaps are, so the logic falls apartin a few places. First of all, if we know that we have prevented a lot of autism by preventing rubella-caused autism, which was a prevalent cause20 or 30 years ago, as Dr. Chess showed, then why is it now MMR,and all of a sudden, it is measles? Now, if someone is so pleased \u2014and I must say it is fairly fancy methodology in terms of pulling the measles virus out \u2014why not show that they can pull the measles virus out from the vaccine, dif-ferentiated genetically from the measles virus that would occurwithout the vaccine? These are holes, and my main thing is what I hear from the posi- tive side is an almost total lack of self-criticism, OK? That is a keypoint \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But \u2014\u2014 Dr. C OOK [continuing]. That is a key point of the scientific meth- od. Mr. B URTON . But you do not think that their research is worth taking a look at? Dr. C OOK. Oh, I think their research is very interesting, and I think it is particularly interesting to what I think \u2014and this is an interesting epidemiological question \u2014if there is autistic enterocolitis \u2014and I think they have interesting data \u2014how much of the total group of autism is it? From what I have seen, it wouldnot be nearly enough of autism to account for an increase in preva-lence. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 heard the \u2014and I am going to go down the line with the rest of you in just a minute \u2014\u2014 Dr. C OOK. If I have a child who is vomiting, I very much agree with the \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON [continuing]. You heard the testimony of the four parents as well as the testimony I gave about our grandson; andwithin just a day of their getting these shots, their temperatureswent up, and they started the violent reactions, and it got worse.How would you account for that? Is that just a coincidence, orwhat? Dr. C OOK. Well, if I am to take that as a reason for their autism to be caused, then I will agree with the parents who told me theirchild had autism because they took a 2-day trip, leaving the childwith very good grandparents; they came back, and the child hadautism suddenly. Am I supposed to now tell them, yes, you areright, because you see the connection \u2014because of a potential coin- cidence \u2014you are right and caused it by taking 2 days off and leav- ing your child in very loving hands? I think we have got to be very careful and use careful epidemio- logical approaches. Dr. Taylor has done the best epidemiologicalstudy. There is not another one on the other side. If there were,I would weight it \u2014in fact, I would give more weight to a positive, well-done epidemiological study. We have only got one. Mr. B URTON . Well, I am not a doctor, but it just seems to me that the scientific community ought to have their minds open to all pos-sibilities as far as the causes of autism are concerned. From yourtestimony, you sounded like it is a gene problem, and the vaccinescould not possibly be a contributing factor. Dr. C OOK. No. They could, but the people who think they could, the people who want to raise the hypothesis \u2014and I am someone who has spent a lot of effort testing other people 's hypotheses \u2014I think there is a lot of duty when people raise a hypothesis, includ-ing Dr. Wakefield, from GI studies, who raise an epidemiologicalhypothesis, I think it is his responsibility to test the hypothesiscarefully. I have thrown out hypotheses that I quite loved, and theywere great \u2014they were not all genetic; some were immunological \u2014 but you have to go with the data. If I have the data, I will go withit. Mr. B URTON . When you studied secretin, did you study more than one dose? Dr. C OOK. No. As a matter of fact, before we did the study, there was a meeting which included people who were convinced that se-cretin worked who said it was one dose, and we used the dose itwas supposed to be; we used porcine-derived secretin \u2014and now, all of a sudden, the hypothesis shifts. Now, the hypothesis shifted tomultiple doses \u2014that is fine. The people who think it is multiple doses and single doses now have to test it. And if we have helpedto refine the hypothesis so they can do a better study and showthat it works, then I am fine with that. I recognize that basically, science cannot disprove anything. It is really meant to \u2014you have to actually set up a hypothesis to tear apart to accept the other one. That is what I mean by part of theself-criticism of the scientific method. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 turned around in particularly children with projectile vomiting \u2014that is a very rare group of autism \u2014but somebody with projectile vomiting, maybe 30 kids like that, secre-tin would work wonderfully. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Hirtz, we were talking about the study at Brick Township, NJ. I do not know if you heard me ask the question ofthe doctor from the CDC earlier. Why would you think that the Na-tional Institutes of Health and CDC and others would go into BrickTownship, NJ and look at all the environmental problems that mayhave caused the autism epidemic they have had there, and whenthe parents asked that they check to see if any of the vaccines hadanything to do with it, why would you think the health agenciesdid not check that as well? Dr. H IRTZ. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, I am not at all familiar with the study at Brick Township; that was conducted by the CDC,not the NIH, and I am afraid you will have to ask them questionsabout it. I would be glad to tell you about activities that the NIH is doing in this area, however, if you would like to hear some of them. Mr. B URTON . What would you say about the NIH taking a hard look at the studies done by Dr. Wakefield, Dr. O 'Leary, and Dr. Singh, and some of the theses that Dr. Megson espoused earlier? Dr. H IRTZ. I think that examining scientific evidence is always a useful thing to do; there is nothing wrong with that. In terms ofthe vaccine issue, I would just like to say that you are right \u2014we do need to keep our minds open. I do feel that at this time, theavailable, valid scientific evidence does not support that vaccine isa cause of autism. However \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . What bothers me about a lot of this is Dr. Cook and you say if there is a hypothesis that says this, it has to be provenbefore we will even take a hard look at it. Dr. H IRTZ. No\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, that is the impression that I am getting, and\u2014\u2014 Dr. H IRTZ. May I finish? Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Let me just finish. The problem is that there are a large number of children who have acquired this prob-lem shortly after getting these vaccines, and when scientists anddoctors from other parts of the world come up with a thesis, I thinkit is irresponsible to out-of-hand just discard that and say, well,that is something they have to further prove, because their hypoth-esis has not yet been proven. It seems to me that you say, hey, ifthere is a positive result there, if it looks like there may be some-thing there, why don 't we take a look at it, too, instead of keeping yourselves confined to one area? Dr. H IRTZ. If you will let me finish, Mr. Chairman, I was going to tell you about all the efforts we are making to look at that. WhatI was going to say when I continued was that even though that isthe case at the moment, we do take this very seriously, we takethe concerns of the parents very seriously, and when we have re-ports like this and concerns like this, we do address them. We are taking three steps at the NIH, and we are undertaking three projects to look at the relationship of vaccines and autism. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb them is very immediate and is going to be done in the cen- ters that now exist. The Child Health Network has Centers of Ex-cellence in autism, and they have about 1,000 children enrolled. Inconjunction with the Deafness and Communicative Disorders Insti-tute and the CDC, they are going to look at the children who haveregressed and look at their vaccine histories and study this issue,compare them to other children. That is going to be done as soonas possible, hopefully, this fiscal year. In addition to that study, something I have been working on, we are planning at the NIH to look at the very important issue of notonly vaccines but risk factors for development of autism as well \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I have had a number of people today testify from the health agencies that there is no scientific evidence that autismis related to vaccines. How do they know that? Dr. H IRTZ. They do not. Mr. B URTON . How do you know that? A vaccine is put out on the market, children all take it \u2014\u2014 Dr. H IRTZ. On the \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Let me just finish \u2014and there is an in- crease from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 400 or 500, so we have an epidemicon our hands; and yet the health agencies of this country are tell-ing us there is no connection between these vaccinations and au-tism. How do you know? Dr. H IRTZ. I do not know that there is no connection. What I know is that the evidence that has been reviewed by the BritishMedical Research Council and the epidemiologic evidence does notsupport a large-scale causation. But I still think \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . How do you know that? Dr. H IRTZ [continuing]. But I still think that there are and there may be certain children who are susceptible, and that is what wehave to go after. It is very important that we look for why childrendevelop autism and whether there might be a small minority ofchildren who have some susceptibility, and we are not ruling thatout. Mr. B URTON . Yes. One of the things that concerns me \u2014and phar- maceutical companies are extremely important; they employ anawful lot of people in my district and in Indiana; we have somegreat pharmaceutical companies that have saved a lot of lives andprobably kept epidemics from happening around the world, thereis no question about that \u2014but there are so many people who work at CDC, HHS, NIH, and the other health agencies who have somekind of connection to the pharmaceutical companies and are onthese advisory boards, that it causes one to wonder whether thereis thorough research going into these things before they are ap-proved. Does that concern you at all?Dr. H IRTZ. At the NIH, we do not really deal with the approval process of the vaccines. Other agencies can tell you more about howthey deal with that. What I am really concerned about \u2014it is hard for me to convey to you that we really \u2014there is nothing I would not do to stop au- tism from occurring and to stop children from developing thisorder, but I \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Well, then, what I would suggest is that we are going to get all of these studies \u2014I am going to get them \u2014and we are going to send them to all the health agencies, and I want thehealth agencies to write back and tell me, after they do some re-search, whether or not they feel there is any merit to these argu-ments. And I want them to look at \u2014and I will get other Members of Congress to join me if necessary \u2014I want them to look at Dr. Wakefield, Dr. O 'Leary, Dr. Singh, Dr. Megson \u2014all of the doctors who have come here today with various solutions that haveworked \u2014Dr. Upledger with his cranial manipulation. Those things should all be looked at, because we are giving the health agenciesin this country billions and billions and billions of dollars, and forthem not to look at every avenue for possible treatment for thesethings I think would be wrong. Let me just go down to the end of the table and give all of you a question \u2014Drs. Rimland, Goldberg, Megson, Upledger, and Ms. Pratt. Do you think from what you have heard today and seen in your scientific research that there is a possibility that the vaccines arecontributing to the increase in autism? Mr. R IMLAND . There is not only a possibility, there is an ex- tremely high likelihood. Mr. B URTON . Would you pull the mic closer? Mr. R IMLAND . There is not only the possibility, there is an ex- tremely high likelihood from all the evidence available, includingthe so-called anecdotal evidence that people like to snicker at, butwhich is really very important evidence, from the kind of evidencethat Dr. Wakefield submitted, from the rise in autism at the timeof initiation of the MMR, the time of the rise of the epidemic, thedata that I provided in my handout which shows that late-onsetautism started at just about the same time that the MMR was ini-tiated. There is just a world of evidence that leads me to think thatit is extremely likely that when the final answer is known, if it isever known, the MMR will be strongly implicated as an importantcause of autism. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Goldberg. Dr. G OLDBERG . With caution as I say this, as a practicing pedia- trician, I have vaccinated children in my practice whom I consid-ered high-risk \u2014I have literally had a godchild with one foot in au- tism and one foot out and vaccinated her along the way. As I statedthis morning, I however try to practice vaccination policies that Iwas taught 20, 30 years ago \u2014you do not vaccinate an ill child; you use certain plans; I never gave a child a hepatitis B shot in thenursery yet. But I think that the effort to solve autism gets dis-tracted by the fact that we do have a lot of children triggered offby some time correlation to the vaccine. As I mentioned in my testimony, I think that if we are going to understand this, we need to step back and figure out why there isa wealth of science that says, hey, the vaccines do not create this or cause it, and then we suddenly have this epidemic going on, andI really believe the way it will come out in the end, whether wedo it in the next 6 or 8 months or in 10 years, is going to be thatthis will all tie in from the eighties and nineties with what is going VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb our population and it is not specifically the vaccines, but the vaccines are playing a role in it. Mr. B URTON . Would play a role in it. Dr. G OLDBERG . Pardon? Mr. B URTON . The vaccine would play a role. Dr. G OLDBERG . Yes, the vaccines would play a role. But we need to understand why, suddenly, a population has become susceptibleto those when they did so much good along the way. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Megson. Dr. M EGSON . I am seeing more and more families that are com- pletely devastated. I know one mother who has been very active inthe parent support group in our local community has had threechildren. The oldest has severe dyslexia/ADD; the second one diedof SIDS within 24 hours of DPT; and the third one is autistic. If my theories are correct, there is an organ in the neck at the base of the main artery to the brain called the carotid body, andwe are disconnecting the pathway. When the oxygen-level in theblood decreases in the carotid body, there is a signal sent to therespiratory center in the brainstem to increase breathing rates, andwe are disconnecting that pathway. Recently they discovered that, oh, if you put children down to sleep on their backs, they do not die of SIDS. I think we reallyneed to look at this. I do not want to be here. I have never gone against the grain. I am not a vaccine researcher. But once I discovered some of theseconnections, I do not think any of us can turn our backs. So manyfamilies are devastated. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Dr. Upledger.Dr. U PLEDGER . I have to say yes, I do. As I stated earlier, I think there is a group of autistic children \u2014and by no means do I say all autistic children \u2014whose problems are due to membrane dysfunc- tion. But I have learned to understand that a significant numberof them do, and I can easily differentiate autism from childhoodschizophrenia just based on the feel of the membranes. I think that the membrane is a place where several factors may go, and it can be, as I said, a fever due to a virus, it can be a vac-cine reaction, it can be a traumatic delivery \u2014it can be anything that creates a change in the membrane flexibility and growth ac-commodation. From the histories I have taken \u2014and I have taken histories with autistic parents since 1975 \u2014it is more than coincidence as far as I am concerned. I do not know how many cases of anecdotes weneed to consider that the anecdote has some validity, but it wouldappear to be that it is infinite. We still will not believe the anec-dote. I happen to subscribe to the idea that if you study the anec-dote, you might learn something. So I would go very strongly in favor of the idea that vaccines are potentially able to cause autism in terms of their effect on mem-branes. I think that membrane condition is probably largely influ-enced by genetic factors along with nutritional factors, along withtoxic factors, and so on, so you have a susceptible membrane. I have opened up enough human heads that are not embalmed, that are maybe 4 or 5 hours old, and I can see the difference in VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb when you look at the diagnoses, you begin to put 2 and 2 together. I think one of the major things that has happened in medicine is the meningeal membrane system has been given a very shortshrift. It is a very important system. It has just come out re-cently \u2014I cannot think of his name now, but a fellow from Califor- nia, UC San Diego, I think, came out with evidence, very strongevidence, that 1 gram of dura mater membrane, which is a verysmall quantity of that membrane, carries 100 million single-domainmagnetic crystals that are ferric. What does it take to change that? The brain itself has 5 million per gram. Anything that interferes with electrical conduction ormagnetic fields is going to screw up that brain function. When westretch that base membrane laterally, why does the kid get betterin terms of his emotion? Because I think we are improving the con-ditions under which his temporal lobes have to live. That is why.You can tear it all apart, and if you study temporal lobes, you cansay, OK, temporal lobes cause autism. But what caused the tem-poral lobe, and what caused the membrane to not accommodate thetemporal lobe? When you start looking at it that way, you startlooking at multiple factors any one of which can be causal \u2014and I put vaccine in that category. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. Dr. Pratt, do you have a comment?Ms. P RATT . I think it is a very hard issue, and from both the au- tism side of America and the Indiana Resource Center for Autism,our job is really to provide information for families. And it is veryhard when you listen to very well-respected scientists and re-searchers like Dr. Cook, whom I have tremendous respect for \u2014and I point him out because he is in Illinois, the State neighboring Indi-ana\u2014it is very hard when you hear the testimony and the research that says there does not seem to be a link, and then, when youhear from the families their stories. Balancing that out is a verydifficult thing, and I struggle with that, because I do not want allof us running down one path, hoping that, yes, at the end of thatpath is going to be a cure or the reason or whatever. I hope we can all keep our minds open to all possibilities. Again, to be an ethical and decent professional, I have to say to familiesthat I am hearing some stories, and there is a possibility for it.Those families and the families that you have heard from todayreally cannot wait for the research to tell them conclusively thatthere is a relationship. I would say that in all likelihood, Congressman Burton, if your daughter had another child, she would take a very serious look atthe usage of vaccinations with her third child, regardless of whatthe research tells her. That is the complexity of the issue. So, what you have heard over the last several hours today is a lot of different testimony and sometimes conflicting testimony, andI hope that what we will all focus on is trying to uncover the com- plex nature and perhaps the complex causes behind autism. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Let me just ask Dr. Cook one more question, and then I want to make a couple of announcements before we conclude. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb how do you account for these parents and these doctors finding the measles virus in the guts of these kids who have hadthe MMR shot? Dr. C OOK. I am very interested in that finding because I think it is a fascinating finding even if it applies to one in 1,000 kidswith autism. Each child is very valuable. So first of all, realize thatDr. Wakefield is talking about a very small group of autism, withdocumented pathology, with vomiting \u2014which, as I said, is quite rare in autism. I think that is an interesting finding that needs tobe followed up. The next step of that may not be a link with vaccines and au- tism; it may be something quite more important in understandingwhat is happening with autism. So that some of what was pre-sented today, it was very good to see data ahead of time; it is rare,and it is nice of them to share it. There is something about theirwork, particularly seeing more controlled data than I have seen be-fore, that is very interesting, and I will be paying quite a bit of at-tention to, because we need every clue that we can get. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Very good; 1 second. [Pause.]Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask you a couple more questions, Dr. Cook. Where do you see the autism rates in the next 10 years? Doyou see them pretty close to where they are now, or do you seethem increasing? Dr. C OOK. I think if we are talking about from the perspective of school districts, they will continue to rise, because I think we arestill underestimating across all school districts. In terms of the actual prevalence, meaning all the children who have always been out there suffering from this, I do not see itgoing up that high. What I see is appropriately \u2014and this is a very important, I think almost civil rights movement \u2014these kids and families are being heard now. But I do not see this as an epidemicin the sense of prevalence. I see it as an epidemic in terms of awake-up call that lots of kids and families have been suffering fora long time. Mr. B URTON . So you are saying the 1 in 10,000 \u2014\u2014 Dr. C OOK. It was never \u2014I do not know \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON [continuing]. It was always a lot higher than that? Dr. C OOK. I do not know of a 1 in 10,000. I know that 2 to 4 per 10,000 is what DSM3 said, which was 1980 to 1987. And 1987 hasbeen referred to as around the time of an increase. That is whenwe went from DSM3 to DSM3R. The reason is DSM3 said the childhad to have a pervasive lack of responsiveness. Now, I do not knowwho these kids were who had autism then, because every childwith autism is related; they are just not related in the same ways.So now you have increased the definition as of 1987 \u2014and I think I have lost the question. I am sorry. Mr. B URTON . It was about the projected increase in the next 10 years. Dr. C OOK. Right. So the most important thing about the 2 to 4 per 10,000 estimates is that they were often done by, well, let ussay someone has come in to a university clinic, and you estimate VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb the population. What has happened, which is better epidemiology since then, is you go knocking on every door. So I have heard 1 in 500 referred to more than just autism, but the best study where they knocked on every door, half a million inJapan, found 1 in 500 for autism. So I do not think we are estimat-ing it yet in terms of its impact. Mr. B URTON . Do any of the rest of you have any projections or guesses on that? Mr. R IMLAND . In California, the increase started in 1977 before the diagnostic changes were made, so the switch from DSM3 toDSM4 cannot even begin to account for that. Dr. G OLDBERG . If I can tie in a projection, unfortunately, I can remember discussions back, literally, in the mid-eighties with clini-cians, and at that time, the CDC, the NIH and everyone was say-ing this new entity out there that we were calling ''chronic fatigue syndrome '' or whatever it was supposed to be did not exist, or was not in any big numbers, and as clinicians, we were saying we weregoing to see 1 to 3 percent of the population. Well, now we are inthe late nineties, the numbers are getting very close to that, andwe are now talking 5 or 10 percent. I think that if this is the same crossover to the children as was seen in adults, you can make a prediction that in the next 5 to 10years, you may hit 5 or 10 percent of our population or more. One of the most scary moments in my life recently, literally, was coming back on a flight from giving talks in Australia. I rememberthere was literally not a family who did not know a family who didnot know a family that either had chronic fatigue syndrome, ADD,or autism. My thoughts on the flight coming back were, well, whereis Australia \u2014near the ozone hole \u2014but my big concern was that that was going to be our country 5 or 10 years later. In the lastmonth, I have literally had three families in \u2014this is only a year and a half from that flight \u2014telling me they do not know a family that does not know a family that does not know a family. This isa major crisis. Mr. B URTON . Any other comments? [No response.]Mr. B URTON . Let me just end by thanking all of you. I really ap- preciate your being here. I have two grandchildren \u2014one got a hep- atitis B shot and stopped breathing within an hour; the other onegot nine shots in 1 day and had a temperature of about 105 andbecame autistic, slamming his head against the wall, runningaround screaming. That is two for two. I guess maybe I am just oneof those unfortunate statistics. But I have got to tell you, I thinkthe problem is much greater than we believe, and I do believe, Ipersonally do believe the vaccines have something to do with it. Now, my position, since I am not a scientist, is really not one that most people are going to pay much attention to, or the parentswho testified here today. But, what I do want to do is take all thescientific information that we have acquired today from you, fromall the other doctors, and submit that to the health agencies of thiscountry and ask them to do a thorough study of all of them to seeif there is any validity to what we think the problem is. If they dothat and do it thoroughly, and they report back to the Congress,it will be a real service to the American people. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:13 Feb IMLAND . I think it is rather interesting that most of the of- ficial authorities are taking the position that the increase in autismis unrelated to the vaccine use. One of my favorite expressions \u2014I do not know who said it; I heard it one time, and I have tried to find out who said it, becauseI think it is extremely true \u2014is ''The chronicle of man 's progress is the history of authority refuted. '' Mr. B URTON . Well, thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.I have two very quick announcements. The NIH is having a meeting for parents of children with autism tomorrow morningfrom 10 a.m. to noon at the Natcher Auditorium on the NIH cam-pus in Bethesda. If you would like to attend, you are welcome toattend that. And we need to announce that the Unlocking Autism group is having a reception in HC -5 in the Capitol immediately after the hearing. Thank you very much. I appreciate your being here. We stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 5:25 p.m., the committee was "}
