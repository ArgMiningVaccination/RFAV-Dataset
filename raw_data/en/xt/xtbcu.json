Vaccination has been very successful in the major population centers, a key contributor in keeping the covid-19 pandemic under control in the archipelago. By the end of April, most of the population had already received 2 doses of vaccine against covid-19, however there was still some work to be done for boosters. While access to booster shots has been made readily available by the authorities, it remains a challenge for rural communities. As part of our CSR program, De Monchy Natural Products Indonesia organised a vaccination campaign for the residents of Cigombong, West Java, where our facilities are located. The event was held on the 30th of April 2022 on the grounds of our warehouse with assistance from the local government and health authorities. The event was a success, with local residents receiving their booster shot over the course of the day. It was also an opportunity for De Monchy Natural Products Indonesia to connect with the families in the area and to show the strong cooperation between the company and the local authorities. Food distribution in the spirit of Ramadhan As the country with the largest Muslim population, the month of Ramadhan is a time of celebration, connection and sharing in Indonesia. However, in these difficult economic conditions and a global economy only just starting its recovery from the pandemic, food security is at risk for the most vulnerable communities. The day of the vaccination campaign coincided with the end of the Holy Muslim month which was a great time to reinforce the spirit of sharing and togetherness by distributing food parcels to the families of Cigombong. Hundreds of food parcels were distributed that day, containing food essentials such as rice, flour and cooking oil.
