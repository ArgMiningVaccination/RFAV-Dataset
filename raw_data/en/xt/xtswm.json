The book ends with a discussion of the continued popularity of Chinese medicine, particularly as a gentler, low-cost alternative to western biomedicine and the expensive drugs and treatments associated with it. Shelton describes how Chinese doctors, like Ka-Kit Hui, founder and director of the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine, have established practices and institutes devoted to the study of the therapeutic effectiveness of Chinese medicine and are exploring ways to integrate biomedical science with traditional Chinese therapies. Herbs and Roots primarily focuses on the period following the discovery of gold in California , which brought thousands of Chinese to the United States seeking an opportunity for a better life and a chance to \"strike it rich.\" It continues through the mid twentieth century, when Chinese medicine began to flourish and gain greater popularity among non-Chinese patients. Shelton discusses the diametric reception of Chinese medicine in the United States among a non-Chinese audience: from fascination, admiration, and praise to revulsion and criticism. Chinese medicine was simultaneously praised by White Americans for its effectiveness, gentleness , and reliance on natural ingredients, while being derided for supposedly being unscientific and superstitious. Chinese doctors were caught in the middle of an ongoing battle between \"regular\" and \"irregular medicine\" during the early-to-midnineteenth century. That battle pitched physicians promoting the heroic system of medicine, which relied on harsh chemical treatments and \"bleeding, blistering, and purging\" to remove toxins from the body, against practitioners promoting gentler, less invasive, and less toxic \"alternative\" therapies such as homeopathy. Later, Chinese medicine practitioners were caught in the fight over \"scientific\" and \"unscientific \" medicine during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Shelton discusses how Chinese medicine practitioners frequently fought against anti-Chinese narratives that portrayed Chinese medicine as exotic, Oriental, unscientific, superstitious , magical, and mystical. She argues that Chinese doctors fought against negative stereotypes and anti-Chinese legislation through the court system, White testimonials, occasional bribery, educational advancement, and by using stereotypes associated with Chinese medicine to their advantage. She argues that, despite numerous struggles and anti-Chinese sentiment, Chinese doctors and other Chinese medicine practitioners continued to expand their practices and that traditional Chinese medicine remains a popular \"alternative\" treatment to western biomedicine. Shelton incorporates a broad range of sources in her exploration of the Chinese doctors in the American medical marketplace, and she is one of the very few historians of Chinese medicine in the United States who cites the role and work of archaeologists in understanding types of therapies and the material signatures of treatments used by Chinese immigrants to the United States. The book reads well, follows a set timeline, provides sufficient context for understanding how Chinese physicians established their practices in the United States, and how they were both accepted and rejected by the medical community and the public. This book would appeal to anyone interested in learning more about the history of Chinese medicine in the United States as well as scholars of nineteenth-century medicine, and of Chinese American history.

In March 1933, just over three years following the stock market crash that triggered the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt became president. His administration soon enacted back- 458 OHQ vol. 121, no. 4 to-work programs with head-spinning urgency. Government officials quickly realized the importance of extending relief to workers in the art world and over the following decade, crafted programs not only to lift artists out of poverty, but also to boost the flagging morale of a nation. New Deal Art in the Northwest is the first comprehensive exploration of how these art programs, often lumped together under the New Deal or Works Progress Administration (WPA) banner, played out in the Northwest in Region 16, specifically, Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho. It is also the catalogue for the traveling exhibition, Forgotten Stories: Northwest Public Art in the 1930s. The core of the book, a culmination of nearly twenty years of research by Margaret Bullock, comprises three chapters: the first covers the Public Works of Art... "}
