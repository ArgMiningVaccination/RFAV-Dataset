We anticipate that once each year, typically in the fall, UCSC will require students to either attest to being vaccinated against COVID-19, or submit an opt out/declination form. You do not need to take any action for COVID or flu at this time. [Visit this link for updates and communications on how to attest or decline](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/immunizations.html), when the process becomes available later this year. For staff and faculty COVID-19 information please visit the [Risk Services department website](https://risk.ucsc.edu/covid-19-support/index.html). Cost On-campus COVID-19 vaccines will be free to all registered UCSC students. Off campus locations will vary, please check with the particular clinic you are visiting. The University of California, Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) does not require a referral for off campus COVID-19 vaccinations or COVID-19 diagnostic testing, retroactive to March 2020. A referral is needed if any other service is performed during the visit. The COVID-19 immunization is a preventative service and as such there is no out-of-pocket cost to the student when the service is performed by an in-network Anthem PPO provider. If you have paid out of pocket for any of these services or have received a bill from a provider for these services, please see the message on the [UC Student Health Insurance Plan](https://www.ucop.edu/ucship/) website to learn about your options.
