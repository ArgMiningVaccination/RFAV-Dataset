Of epidemic proportions, diabetes poses a substantial economic burden on the country and its healthcare system, as well as people with the disease, and their families. Diabetes though is often just the starting point for other related problems like retinopathy, heart disorders, nerve damage and kidney diseases, among others. What makes the situation even more challenging is the lack of awareness, diagnosis and access to treatment, social barriers, and adherence to recommended guidelines. Therefore, we have prioritised diabetes management as a core area of focus at Sanofi India. By bringing Scientific discoveries do not happen overnight or without hard work. But our determination to find answers for patients motivates us to develop breakthrough medicines. And to never settle. We are driven by a unifying purpose and ambition. Guided by our purpose - chasing the miracles of science to improve people's lives - we are redefining who we are and why we exist, with greater clarity for our people, partners, patients, and healthcare professionals. Committed to a healthier India Case in pointWe chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives 2022 was a year of transformation. We examined what today's India needs, and in turn our product portfolio, structure, processes, and ways of working.

We are chasing ways in which we can deliver our miracles of science to benefit patients and create value for society, thus contributing to making a healthier India. our comprehensive range of diabetes management solutions (orals and injectables) and complementing it with education about the disease, its causes, and preventive measures, we are making significant progress in addressing this health issue.

We bring them quality products, devices, services, and access to information that empowers them to manage their condition and lead healthier lives.

The new dedicated cartridge system is intended to simplify the cartridge exchange process and help prevent insulin mix-ups, by preventing users from accidentally attaching an incompatible insulin cartridge.

Health is inextricably linked to the world around us. Allergies The prevalence of allergies in India has doubled over the past decade. While our direct physical reach is to ~8,000 physicians, we have increased our reach to 1 lakh physicians across India by adopting an omni-channel strategy. We continue to strengthen our Nasal Allergy portfolio with innovative and patient-centric solutions since ~70% allergic rhinitis patients exhibit nasal congestion as a bothersome symptom. Pollution is a key aggravator to allergic rhinitis and India is home to 9 out of the 10 most polluted cities in the world. Despite such high occurrences, awareness about allergic rhinitis remains low, causing aggravated symptoms. Sanofi India has taken a lead in creating awareness on the impact of pollution on allergies in India. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency Post-covid, the awareness and importance of immunity has gone up significantly. We have leveraged this to drive growth for our wellness portfolio with DePura Kids by highlighting how optimal Vitamin D levels help maintain good bone health and immunity.People's lifestyle and the environment are causing several ailments like allergies and pain, which are common and everyday occurrences. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and insufficiency is found in 76% Indians. This high prevalence of VDD in a sun-rich country like India has been reported due to several reasons that include inadequate exposure to sunlight, dietary factors, and pollution hampering the penetration of ultraviolet rays. Over the course of the pandemic, the world has witnessed a sea-change in awareness and willingness amongst many people to take a proactive role in managing their own health and well-being. Pain management Pain is one of the most common health issues today. For over 30 years, people across India have trusted and relied on Combiflam\u00ae, one of our flagship prescription brands.

Social media and radio campaigns Digital campaign - Since 2020, Jonty Rhodes, an international cricketer living with epilepsy, has partnered Sanofi in our crusade to normalise living with this condition and eradicating taboos and stigmas around it. In 2022, we partnered the widely watched TV news channel 'Times Now' as well as their social media platforms to host a panel discussion and several influencer videos. Since there is a need to educate people about epilepsy, we are reaching out to people through media, several times a year. Doctors shared their messages through Radio Mirchi covering 26 cities in 19 states. Basal Caf\u00e9 A digital platform created to increase awareness and preference for basal insulin. 1,350 HCPs experienced an integrated customer journey of 4 eCMEs (e-Continuing Medical Education) over four months. The basal caf\u00e9 model is a mentor-mentee cohort model where 1 mentor is assigned to 15 mentees. The feedback for this initiative has been exceptional.

In keeping with our philosophy of partnering with HCPs to deliver better care, Allegra played a leadership role and was instrumental in driving continued medical education during the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly establishing the role of fexofenadine and montelukast in managing allergies.Epilepsy Frisium\u00ae is one of our brands developed to treat epilepsy, which is essentially clobazam, which is a 1,5-benzodiazepine with anxiolytic and anti-convulsant properties and can be used as an add-on therapy in patients with epilepsy.

Our effort is focused on improving VTE management practices and protocols in hospitals, to help improve outcomes for patients. Antibiotics In the resistant Gram+ segment, our anti-infective brand, Targocid\u00ae, is backed by real life experience of over 20 years.

Given the nature of our business and our close to seven decades of existence as a socially responsible and ethical organisation, your Company has earned both respect and trust of doctors and people across India. Therefore, demonstrating the highest levels of corporate governance is a logical step towards further improving transparency in our interactions with stakeholders. While the world battles geo-political tensions and economic stress caused by untamed inflation and supply disruptions, India continues to demonstrate admirable resilience and a growth-focused policy environment. The Covid-19 pandemic brought about a tectonic shift in the way people view health and overall well- being. To bridge the gaps in health infrastructure and make quality healthcare affordable to all, the Government of India has prioritised its efforts towards strengthening the country's healthcare ecosystem. This provides enormous opportunities to make a difference to more than a billion lives. Sanofi India is well positioned to capture some of these opportunities while staying true to its commitment for a healthier India. The focus on sustainability challenges continues unabated with climate change becoming a global and national task at hand. At Sanofi, our purpose 'To chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives' provides an impetus to us, as the Board, to have a stronger focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters. As you know, the DNA of your Company is intrinsically ethical, responsible and process-driven. With increasing awareness about ESG, we are adopting newer ways to have an integrated business strategy, that generates long-term value for our stakeholders. Our programmes for planet mobilisation, diversity, equity & inclusion, social impact and employee well-being, now include impact measurement so that we can assess how well we are doing against these. Inspired by Sanofi's global ESG strategy, Sanofi India undertook a materiality survey to establish a baseline in our very first Integrated Annual Report for 2022 last year. Along with the details of the financial out-turn, you will find comprehensive disclosures on various ESG topics in this report. As you will recall, in June 2022 your Company had a change in leadership with Rodolfo Hrosz taking over the reins as the new Managing Director. Rodolfo brings with him a wealth of experience spanning commercial, marketing, and general management roles across various multinational companies. He joined Sanofi in 2017 as General Manager of the consumer healthcare business in Brazil and led its transformation, starting from setting up the business unit to helping it become a significant growth contributor and a digital acceleration benchmark within the Sanofi Group. With his leadership, your Company has already refreshed its strategy with a renewed focus on growth and improving operational efficiencies. The entire team is motivated to unleash the potential of your Company for the next phase of its development. Your Company will mobilise energies, increase agility and capitalise on the emerging opportunities that lie ahead to improve more lives across the country, and simultaneously, minimise the potential environmental impacts of our activities and products throughout their life cycle. Before closing, I would like to record my gratitude to all our customers, employees, business partners, regulatory agencies and all other stakeholders for their contribution in our progress during 2022 and seek their continued support in our onward journey. Also, my sincere thanks to each one of you for your unstinted support in our progress so far and look forward to your continued endorsement for all we do in the times ahead. Best wishes, Aditya Narayan Chairman Shaping the future of healthcare in India To bridge the gaps in health infrastructure and make quality healthcare affordable to all, the Government of India has rightly prioritised its efforts towards strengthening the country's healthcare ecosystem. This provides enormous opportunities to make a difference to more than a billion lives.Sanofi India is well positioned to capitalise on the opportunities while staying true to its commitment for a healthier India. Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statements Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 202221 20Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022 20Managing Director's message Serving a universe called 'India' Dear Shareholders, 1.4 billion people across India are bound together in a shared pride of being part of a young nation that is a rising superpower. The country's rich diversity makes chasing the miracles of science to improve people's lives in India not just challenging, but also promising. In the vastly transformed post-pandemic world, healthcare is expected to continue experiencing significant growth, as health and wellness become a greater priority for individuals and governments. It is my privilege to assume the office of the Managing Director of Sanofi India Limited, when India is prioritising health and wellness. In this context, the year 2022 showed progress on different fronts by the Company. Toujeo\u00ae, our U300 insulin, doubled its sales post the launch of Toujeo\u00ae cartridges. In the consumer healthcare business, our flagship brands like Allegra\u00ae and Avil\u00ae have registered a high double-digit growth rate during the year. DePura Kids is a Nano Vitamin D brand with published evidence, which has helped gain the trust of paediatricians. In our epilepsy portfolio, Frisium\u00ae continued to be the most prescribed brand across anti- convulsants in India. While your Company has been evolving and transforming over almost seven decades, in 2022, your leadership team decided that your Company must refocus its strategy and execution, in order to be fully geared to capture current key growth opportunities in the country. By the end of 2022, our leadership team devised our 'India for India' strategy, electing to focus on four main growth pillars: First , the diabetes segment continues to be our biggest driver of growth. Today in India, Sanofi has the most comprehensive portfolio in this segment. With the changing trends in treatment, we will further strengthen our diabetes portfolio, and increase our engagement activities to multiply awareness. Second, the consumer healthcare business led by big brands including Allegra\u00ae, Avil \u00ae, Combiflam\u00ae, will be another major growth driver. We will continue to deepen our understanding of the consumer healthcare business and focus on expanding our portfolio by leveraging the wide array of products available in our global portfolio. Third , we will significantly step up our focus on increasing our market share through a combination of product innovation (both globally and locally developed), supply localisation and strategic partnerships. Fourth , our go-to-market strategy has a large role to play. In line with emerging market trends, your Company is now structured to be more customer-centric and has a hybrid model to optimally capture the demand generated by Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) in the treatment of patients. As part of the transformation, we changed our organisation structure from eight Business Units (BUs) to a focused group of three BUs: (i) Diabetes; (ii) Consumer Healthcare; and (iii) Transplants & Cardiology. Fewer BUs with broader portfolios, allows our Company to better serve the HCPs with a wider range of related products, while improving our reach and presence. Your Company also deployed dedicated resources to drive multiple innovation projects and a new trade organisation within the Company to improve and fully develop our commercial network and partnerships. We have also taken steps to simplify processes and ways of working, so that we can become more agile and empower our teams. What has not changed though is that patients continue to be at the core of Sanofi India. This has always been our strength and continues to be the lighthouse for us all. I am so proud of every member at Sanofi India, from manufacturing and supply, to regulatory, to the medical team, other support functions, and most importantly, of our front-line sales force who never waiver from being attentive to what is best for the patient. Accordingly, we maintain high ethical values and single-minded focus on delivering high quality medicines to anyone in India who suffers from diseases like diabetes (Lantus\u00ae and our entire range of orals and injectables), struggles with respiratory allergies (Allegra\u00ae) or pain management (Combiflam\u00ae), has vitamin D deficiency (DePura\u00ae) and relies on quality intensive care products (Clexane\u00ae) for successful surgical outcomes. Your Company will now also benefit from ESG (Environmental Social Governance) reporting, including the ability to identify and manage risks and opportunities related to environmental and social impact, and further build trust and transparency with investors and stakeholders. We have in place a robust governance structure, which I believe is essential to drive a responsible and ethical business culture that goes beyond regulatory compliance. The structure includes policies, procedures and ongoing communication and trainings that set clear expectations on ethical behaviour and accountability in our employees, leadership, and partners. We also excel in our people practices. I am particularly proud to share that for the fifth-year in a row (since 2019), Sanofi India has been recognised as a 'Top\u00ae Employer'. As we stand here today, I take this opportunity to thank all the employees associated with Sanofi, present and past. The fact that Sanofi India has been able to fortify its position as one of the leading pharma companies in the country, boils down to the sheer grit and determination demonstrated every single day. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I thank all our stakeholders for their continued support. I am very optimistic of the times that lie ahead of us and we look forward to creating a long-lasting impact on the lives of millions across the country.

In keeping with it, and with a view to create long-term stakeholder value, foster continuous improvement and innovate and protect Company's assets, we have set up a risk management framework. This framework is in compliance with regulations and industry best-practices. The purpose of our risk management framework is to ensure accountability and competence for managing risks across the organisation. The framework strives to ensure effective, relevant, and timely exchange of information with internal and external stakeholders, while supporting decision-making processes fully aligned with risk exposure. It also lays down activities for risk identification, monitoring, review, control and risk prioritisation, along with development of a risk response plan. The Risk Management Policy is reviewed periodically, at least once in a year. Risk management governance The Risk Management Committee is a Board-constituted committee, which works with the Board to manage the Risk Management Policy, direct implementation, and track and assess its effectiveness. The Risk Management Committee has detailed a stage-wise approach for risk identification. Each business head is responsible for identifying risks, basis which, risk owners are identified to analyse the key contributors to the risks, and subsequently design appropriate risk mitigation plans. The Risk Management Committee meets on a quarterly basis to effectively manage identified risks. To oversee, assess, monitor, and control risks in an efficient manner, we have established specific roles and responsibilities.Risk management process Risk identification is an ongoing process. The Risk Register is collated containing potential risks across each of the business units and functions. Each identified risk is assigned to a risk owner, which is decided on the basis of the nature of the risk, the potential impact, and the people responsible for acting on the mitigation plans. The process enables identification of potential future events that could affect assets critical to the execution of business model of the Company, business units, and enabling functions. The identified risks are categorised under the following categories: Audit Committee Internal Control Function Risk Management SecretariatRisk Management CommitteeBoard of Directors India Country Council (ICC) Business Unit & Site Leadership Team Risk Owners Periodic Residual Risk Assessment Risk IdentificationRisk AssessmentRisk PrioritisationRisk Response PlanRisk Review, Reporting and MonitoringRisks identified are assessed on the basis of the risk rating criteria. Risk rating criteria is used for evaluation and prioritisation of identified risks. Risk rating involves analysing and evaluating the probable impact and likelihood of risk occurrence. The Company has developed impact scales for rating the degree of consequences to the organisation, should the event occur. We acknowledge that risk management is a dynamic and ever-evolving concept. Hence, it is important to revisit the policies, framework and practices periodically to ensure that they remain relevant and adequate. At Sanofi India, we review the risk framework regularly to align with the changing regulatory requirements and to increase maturity and resilience of the Company's risk response mechanism. Risk response planning is an important step that involves identifying the most appropriate strategies to manage risks and reduce them to an acceptable level. The response planning for each risk balances efforts and benefits for the Company, maintaining its compliance to legal, regulatory and other requirements. The risk owners review the risks periodically, in line with changes in the internal and external environment in which we operate. Risk culture We have attempted to consolidate all risks so that the management/Board of Directors have full visibility on the risk events including business, financial, operational, sectoral, sustainability (particularly, ESG-related), information, cybersecurity or any other risk, as may be determined by the Risk Management Committee.

We have applied robust best-in-class technology for the manufacturing of medicines and vaccines to limit our environmental and ecological footprint. At our Goa site, we have implemented Health Safety and Environment (HSE) Management systems to monitor and address any concerns that arise or may arise as a result of our operations. Climate change Climate change is undoubtedly one of the greatest global concerns. Going beyond healthcare, we care for the planet by reducing the environmental impacts of our products and activities, while strengthening our resilience in the face of climate change. This risk related to climate change poses severe challenges to business and the economy. Currently, climate change is a major element in defining our environment-related decisions and prompting us to focus on promoting cleaner technologies and innovations. Sanofi has joined the 'Race to Zero' initiative, a global commitment to Net Zero carbon emissions by 2014. We are working towards three goals set by Sanofi Global: Build the road to carbon neutrality by 2030 and Net Zero by 2045 Limit our environmental footprint and adopt circular solutions Improve the environmental profile of our products Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 202250 Our capitals51 Corporate overview Value creation approach Statutory reports Financial statementsSanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022 50Natural capital Our consumption details: Category Unit FY 2021 GJ 6,576.12 6,540.64 5,455.31 Electricity purchased from the grid - Renewable energy (Solar) GJ 3,494.88 - - Renewable energy solar generation within the organisation GJ 1,895.66 - - Renewable energy - Biomass consumption 28,083.60 Total energy consumption GJ 78,219.80 77,236.67 80,933.67 Energy conservation We place high importance on resource conservation while formulating operating strategies. Considering the finite nature of non-renewable energy resources, we are in the process of increasing the use of renewable energy resources wherever possible throughout our business and manufacturing operations. We are committed to lowering the total energy usage by enhancing energy efficiency and incorporating alternate energy sources. We have implemented efficient monitoring methods to record energy usage throughout our organisation. At our Mumbai office, energy is completely obtained from renewable energy sources and for Goa operations, we have installed a solar panel project of 1,809 kWp to fulfil our energy requirement for FY 2022. We have put together concerted efforts to raise awareness on energy conservation through trainings and awareness programs. We have installed energy-efficient motors and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to increase energy efficiency. D3.2 cr Amount invested in energy management projects in FY 2022 1,809 kWp Installed capacity of the solar power project in Goa Emissions The use of fossil fuels and grid electricity contributes significantly to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We have set yearly targets, and also installed the required pollution control machinery to track and monitor emissions periodically. Our aim is to minimise GHG emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in the total energy mix of our operations. We are also consciously trying to mitigate emissions by adoption of energy-saving programmes and the installation of energy- efficient equipment. Our electricity purchased from the grid has decreased as compared to the past year due to installed solar energy units at the Goa factory and Mumbai office. Air emissions We regularly measure our stack emissions for SOx, NOx and particulate matter (PM) at our Goa site, and Mumbai office. As per the regulatory requirements, we monitor these emissions for DG set and boiler stacks and submit it to the respective State Pollution Control Board. To ensure ambient air quality across our operations, we abide by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) 2009.Environmental compliance We are committed to abiding by all environmental norms and regulations at all our manufacturing operations and corporate office as set forth by the relevant regulatory authorities. To guarantee and adhere to the legal and regulatory framework, each unit competent HSE teams, who are managing these compliance. All enquiries related to environmental compliance are resolved on a timely basis. During FY 2022, we did not incur any fines or penalties with regard to any environmental violations.Energy management Energy management is one of our key business imperatives. Energy consumption is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, while energy costs have a direct impact on the cost of operations. We are cognizant of the necessity to improve our energy efficiency and are continuously upgrading our energy management systems. To promote this, we strive to make optimum use of existing energy-consuming assets, espouse energy management best practices, and prioritise the implementation of energy- efficient technology. Our energy consumption needs are mostly met through the electricity grid and renewable energy sources. We used 39.7% of renewable energy in FY 2022 through solar power generation and biomass utilisation. We are using 51.9% of energy from the purchased electricity grid and 6.9% from renewable solar energy. The BOOT project, Goa Our Goa site procured electricity from the Goa Electricity Department, using coal as a primary fuel source in India. We utilised 12 million units of power purchased through the grid in FY 2021. With an aim to adopt a sustainable approach and reduce environmental impacts at our site, we have installed a solar panel with a capacity of 1,809 KWP in September 2022. This project, called BOOT (build, own, operate, transfer), is a funding model, based on a third party arrangement.

At Mumbai office, we treat wastewater through a Sewage Treatment Plant. The treated wastewater is tested to meet the stipulated discharge limit as per regulatory requirements. At Mumbai, more than 65% of water is recycled and the remaining water is discharged to municipal water drain as per consent received from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). At our Goa operations, we treat all the wastewater generated on site. Currently, treated water is used for horticulture purposes and in restrooms. There is no disposal of wastewater outside the plant boundaries. Conserving water resources We, at Sanofi, always strive to work and contribute for a sustainable world. We have taken series of actions to optimise the uses of natural resources and reduce our environmental impacts. On water sustainability, we have worked and identified areas of action to reduce our water consumption. As part of long-term actions, we have gradually reduced our dependency on groundwater and switched to surface water supplied by Goa Industrial Development Corporation. Our sustainable approach limits our water footprint and ensures no negative impact on any water source due to our operations. We have taken series of actions for creating awareness amongst our employees towards conservation of water, arresting leakages, optimising processes and innovative initiatives. We have defined our approach to identifying the operations, where water requirements can be minimised, water can be recycled or rainwater harvesting can be adopted. To reduce our fresh water intake, we are focusing on developing infrastructure for rainwater harvesting at our site and office. At the Goa site, we have set up a rainwater collection tank inside our premises. During this reporting year, we have increased the size of the rainwater collection tank from 300 Kl to 700 Kl. This rainwater is filtered and used in cooling towers and utilities purpose. By this initiative, we are able to reduce our freshwater intake of approx. 2000 Kl. In our manufacturing process, we have optimised the requirement of rinse water from 15 minutes to 5 minutes during every rinse cycle, achieving water savings of 2.3 million litres per year. While making these process changes & optimisations, its made sure that it passes through strict validation process. Water management Water withdrawal by source Unit Kl 1,02,752 92,440 1,63,653Water management We acknowledge the crucial role of water as a basic and irreplaceable natural resource.

Proper resource utilisation and conservation with good waste reduction practices are the key concerns of being a responsible business. We integrated best industry practices and adhered to the waste management standards that meet our applicable legal requirements. We have complied with all applicable Health Safety and Environment (HSE) requirements to ensure environmentally sound disposal practices. Hazardous as well as non-hazardous waste is generated at our Goa site and Mumbai office. Non-hazardous waste includes paper, glass, etc. These generated waste are diverted from disposal by handing it over to State Pollution Control Board approved third-party vendors for recycling. The food waste generated is converted into manure at the internal plant for in- house gardening. E-waste generated from our manufacturing sites and offices are disposed off periodically through the pollution control board approved vendor. Hazardous waste generated in our operations are disposed off as per environmental guidelines to cement industries for co-processing. There is zero waste sent to landfill. Hazardous wastes like batteries are given for recycling, while ETP sludge is sent for coprocessing. Biomedical wastes like syringes and other medical waste generated at Goa site OHC are disposed through a deep burry pit constructed on site. At our Mumbai office, biomedical waste are sent for incineration. Biodiversity Biodiversity management is one of our main focus areas, directed towards responsible business practices. We strive to ensure that our operations have the least impact on biodiversity. We have aligned our biodiversity management with Sanofi Global's biodiversity commitment. Sanofi India manages the biodiversity around its sites through its environmental sustainability programme called 'Planet Care.' We actively contribute to protect biodiversity through our 'planet care' roadmap, addressing environmental challenges, such as climate change, waste management, pharmaceuticals in the environment and water stewardship, among others. Apart from this, at the Mumbai office, our premises are covered with gardens. We are not using any pesticides or insecticides at the office and have also constructed bird nests to support biodiversity.

Diversity at workplace Diversity, equity and inclusion are critical enablers of how we operate at Sanofi. It is fully integrated with our people strategy and our commitment to society. Our strategy has been co-created with a cross-section of employees around the world and likewise, in India, we aim to ensure that every employee feels like they can bring their full selves to work, every day. For us, diversity means taking competitive advantage of our collective difference. Equity is about providing customised resources that different groups need, to be successful at work and inclusion means feeling that you belong, are respected and always valued. Promoting diversity across all levels of the workforce is well-valued and imbibed across every level in Sanofi. We embarked on this journey a few years ago and we have undertaken numerous initiatives across various pillars like talent and hiring, culture building, enablers, development and governance to ensure we are consistently fostering diversity and inclusion within and throughout our organisation. In our approach to enabling a diverse and inclusive work environment, the key impact areas we closely look into are gender, PRIDE (i.e., the LGBTQ+ community) and ability. We have focused on improving the gender balance over a number of years and have taken significant strides in this direction.Likewise, in areas of PRIDE and disability, we are at the nascent stages and have charted a roadmap that will enable us to be an organisation, where people from all walks of life feel included. In order to make our office premises more accessible to our differently-abled employees, workers and visitors, we have made the necessary infrastructural arrangements by establishing a dedicated parking lot, washrooms, providing security support, creating adequate space for wheelchair movement, putting in place visual and audio alarms, an emergency evac chair, ramps in the basement for ease of wheelchair movements at the entry, and making braille additions as required in all the lifts. It is our endeavour to constantly work towards identifying the need of our differently-abled employees and proactively update our facilities to meet their needs. We are pleased to note that in this financial year, the percentage of women represented in the Board of Director's body stands at 25%, whilst the percentage of women represented in the key management team stands at 25%. Additionally, the percentage of women in the total workforce is 17% and similarly, the percentage of external women hired has increased to 48%. The remuneration structure at Sanofi India is solely based on the employee's role and not their gender. The range of remuneration is competitive in nature and is derived based on a market study considering a group of our peers. This study is conducted by an external entity. We are happy to note that this year, there have been no delays in the payment of wages to our employees. This financial year, there were no complaints pertaining to child labour, forced labour, or involuntary labour. No employee or worker under the age of 18 was recruited at Sanofi India. We are consistently ensuring that we associate ourselves with suppliers, who hold zero-tolerance for forced labour.During the year, there were no complaints made by employees on working conditions, health and safety, child labour, forced/involuntary labour, wages and other human rights-related issues. There was only one complaint received under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy and law, which was addressed in accordance with the policy. Additionally, in our efforts to uphold human rights and the highest ethical values, we provide training sessions on human rights issues and policies established for our workforce. We ensure that all our employees are paid more than minimum wages. We provide health insurance benefits to all permanent employees and workers. Advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at Sanofi India Limited The efforts taken by Sanofi India in the space of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion are under the global banner of 'All In'. We want to reflect on the diversity of our communities, unleash our best selves every day to transform the practice of medicine. We truly believe that diverse teams lead to better outcomes and thus, we are working towards building a company that is representative of the society - in other words, of the people and patients we serve. We aim to create a culture that allows people to unleash the very best version of themselves, every day. Under the 'Reflect' pillar we aim to build a representative leadership, which clearly reflect the diverse nature of the communities we serve. Through the 'Unleash' pillar we hope to create a thriving environment for our workforce to enable each one of them to bring their full and best selves at work. Under the 'Transform' pillar, we are looking to impact society in a positive manner by advocating for our diverse set of communities.When we started on this journey several years ago, we realised that there were a number of quick, yet important wins in making Sanofi more inclusive, especially from the gender balance perspective. We were one of the first organisations to change our maternity leave from 3 months to 6 months, two years prior to the official government mandate. We also provided a number of enablers in the form of self-defense workshops, enhanced hotel and travel coverage and security helpline numbers, among others, to ensure our women employees felt safe and fully-equipped to make meaningful contributions at work. Furthermore, we ran sensitisation workshops from the top-most leaders right down to the first line managers, to ensure they understood what biases are, how each one of us has them and how they can negatively impact the person experiencing them. This, in turn, helped create a culture where employees and managers were more sensitive to the needs of others. We also instituted development programmes for women employees to help them overcome their own barriers and fulfil their own potential to take on the next level roles. In 2022, we introduced Gender Neutral parental leave giving men 14 weeks paternity leave which 66 men availed in 2022. Also, we introduced Employee Assistance programme to support mental well-being and Inclusive job templates to ensure we remove hidden biases when advertising roles. Today, we see sponsorship for diversity, equity and inclusion from the top business leaders and have instituted Employee Resource Groups, which provide a platform for all employees to make their voices heard and contribute meaningfully to the initiatives introduced under these. One of the achievements we are very proud of is compelling the Goa government to allow us to increase the shift timings for women employees so they can contribute fully during the evening shift.FY new hires Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 202258 Our capitals59 Corporate overview Value creation approach Statutory reports Financial statementsEmployee health, safety and well-being Occupation health and safety (OHS) We have established a well-defined HSE policy and HSE management system with a robust monitoring plan, operating with a multi-year approach, to ensure the effective implementation of the HSE policy.

Promotion of healthcare including preventive healthcare solutions, which are majorly concerned with non- communicable diseases Promotion of education initiatives related to healthcare services or systems Key CSR focus areasSocial impact programme for Type 1 diabetes Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) is on the rise in India, with an annual increase of 3-5%. There are 2.3 lakhs individuals under the age of 20 with T1D. T1D requires a lifetime of specialised care, including diabetes education, multiple insulin injections per day, daily blood glucose monitoring, ongoing screening for and management of chronic complications, psychological support, and societal support rather than discrimination. This can be a demanding and expensive condition for both, the affected child and their family to manage. Additionally, optimal T1D management requires significant resources and can be costly. There is currently no cure for T1D, and if it is not properly managed, it can reduce an individual's productivity and life expectancy. Access to affordable insulin and other necessary medical supplies, as well as the availability of knowledgeable medical personnel, are major issues in the management of T1D. Adding to the complexities of T1D are challenges, such as the lack of diagnosis, social stigma surrounding T1D, lack of refrigeration for the storage of insulin, and lack of patient education. It is also observed that T1D results in social isolation, particularly for girls. We introduced a social impact programme for Type 1 Diabetes, healthcare condition reveals the extent to which the primary healthcare in rural areas and urban slums in India remains underdeveloped and faces challenges including shortage of personnel, inadequate resources, and poor infrastructure. The primary healthcare needs, especially regarding non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with an aim to improve the health status (mortality and morbidity) of T1D care and support programme by initiating 'Education of Healthcare Professionals (HCPs)' to ensure correct diagnosis and management. This will lead to the reduction in the occurrences of chronic complications. We aim to create a network of T1D educators and provide them with trainings to improve both, their care and management skills. Furthermore, through the programme, we are ensuring that individuals diagnosed with T1D along with their respective care givers, are being educated about the best practices of managing Type 1 Diabetes. Lastly, free treatment, which includes provision of insulin, syringes, lancets, and glucose strips, is provided for the underprivileged patients. RSSDI (Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India), PPHF (People to People Health Foundation) and Diabeties Foundation are our partners for this programme. must be addressed for those facing challenges with gaining access to quality healthcare, given that early screening services for NCDs are often lacking. Taking this into consideration, the social impact initiative of establishing mobile medical units in Maharashtra for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) screening and awareness, was introduced. We have been able to successfully deploy the mobile medical units in a total of 10 districts in Maharashtra. This initiative, carried out in partnership with Piramal Swasthya Foundation, can potentially benefit close to 1,50,000 individuals each year.

The programme aims to do so by building the capacities of doctors to improve NCD management, engaging with education systems, principles, teachers and children of secondary schools through the Kids and Diabetes in Schools (KiDS) programme. Social and relationship capital Supporting NCDs through other programmes 1) Supporting NCD awareness and screening in Hyderabad To contribute to the national goal of both reducing mortality as well morbidity rates occurring due to the NCDs, we supported PPHF to implement the NCD awareness and screening programme in Hyderabad. We aim to contribute to the national goal by enhancing the level of awareness about timely screening, prevention and management of NCDs amongst communities by improving the healthcare personnel's capacities. This will help in identifying diabetes, hypertension, and cancers in a timely manner, and will aid in recording the learnings achieved through this programme to help extend the interventions introduced. Doing so will improve access to healthcare services, increase the primary care worker's competence levels, establish referral mechanisms, and empower communities and individuals for self- care and treatment adherence. 2) Building awareness on cervical and oral cancers Cervical and oral cancers account for 20% of the cancers that are diagnosed in India. In keeping with this, we have introduced a programme for creating awareness about the existence of these cancers and nudging at-risk households/individuals to undergo regular screenings and check-ups and treatment, counseling for patients with head & neck cancers.This programme was initiated in Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana in 2021, in collaboration with Indian Cancer Society.Additionally, the programme has helped build a healthier lifestyle for the general public through mass media campaigns and events, such as 'Sakhar Free Shukrawar' and the 'STEP challenge,' which encouraged students to lead a healthy life by incorporating walking into their routine and covering 10,000 steps daily for three months, in collaboration with Conexus Social Responsibility Foundation and Departments of Heath and Education, Goa.In solidarity with the people of Assam In association with Americares India Foundation, we initiated a programme to help the survivors of the Assam floods to return to their normal lives by providing the necessary relief support.Encouraging our employees to create impact through volunteering During the year 2022, in partnership with Project Heena, employee volunteering programmes were implemented to support communities under the Health, Education, Environment, and Capacity Building categories. 912 employees also accompanied by their family members successfully participated in numerous virtual and on-ground volunteering activities focused on social causes.

Thus, energy Management becomes one of our key requirements for running and governing our business. Energy consumption is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, while energy costs have a direct impact on the cost of operations. We are increasingly cognizant of the necessity to improve our energy efficiency and are continuously upgrading our energy management systems. To promote this, we strive to make optimum use of existing energy-consuming assets, promote energy management best practices, help prioritize the implementation of energy-efficient technology.

Energy Conservation measures undertaken in 2022: Goa factory HVAC energy optimization project for production -2 building completed. For production -1 building, work is in progress and is expected to be completed by 2024. Once the project is executed, this will generate good savings. 1.8 MW Solar power system installed under Opex model, this will reduce 22% CO2 emission for Goa Site and will generate annual savings of C 4.4 Million for next 15 years. In 2022 a multi-site ISO 50001 certification was launched. Such certification attests to the effectiveness of our sites' energy management systems.

For Makarand M. Joshi & Co. Company Secretaries Makarand M. Joshi Partner FCS: A' Management Discussion and Analysis Report Economic outlook India's economy has now become the fifth-largest in the world on nominal GDP (US dollars) and is set to become the second-fastest growing economy in FY 2023, despite the slower global demand and tightening of monetary policy to manage inflationary pressures. The Indian economy is projected to record a relatively healthy Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 6.1% (Source: IMF) in FY 2023 and is showing signs of moderation. GDP growth is expected to decline to 5.7% in FY 2024, as exports and domestic demand growth moderate. Inflation will slow private consumption but moderate along with improved global conditions, to accelerate growth to 6.9% in FY 2025. The key drivers for medium-term growth are increasing public sector expenditure on infrastructure, supply-side and financial reforms (GST and better tax compliance, bankruptcy court, bad bank, etc.), India's digital architecture that includes the universal payment systems, nationwide identification framework, distribution of welfare schemes, healthcare official data stack intended to solve social, inclusion needs, and logistics and favourable demographics are expected to set the economy on the path of recovery. Retail inflation prints peaked in September 2022 and have since begun to ease, helped by favourable base effects. Inflation is expected to remain sticky in the coming months before gradually rolling off in 2023-24 as growth slows and input price pressure abates. The USD/ C s expected to consolidate between 80 and 84 over the next two years. Industry update The Indian pharmaceutical industry has been growing at an average of ~10% over the past five years. The industry growth was severely impacted in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, however, the growth reached spiked to 18%, with higher sales in acute care therapies and COVID-related medicines. In 2022, the industry grew by 6.5%, adding nearly C 12,000 crores of incremental sales. The demand for acute therapies increased, while most chronic therapies like diabetes and cardiovascular treatments remained relatively steady. The IQVIA Prognosis Report (2022) projects that the Indian pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow at a CAGR ~9.2% (+/-2%) between 2021-26 and reach a market size of C 2,951 billion by 2026. Acute therapies will continue to drive growth, along with an increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Improvements in the drug registration process will make India more attractive for the early launch of innovative drugs. The rapid expansion of the e-pharmacy sector, expansion of co-marketing agreements, coupled with the introduction of new OTC regulations will also be a growth driver till 2026. ~H 3,000 billion Projected size of Indian Pharmaceutical Market by 2026 India advantages Growth in partnerships and co-marketing agreements: Partnerships and co-marketing agreements between Indian and foreign companies are expected to increase, reflecting benefits for both originators and local partners. Such alliances will drive rapid and broader market penetration for new brands while increasing sales for more established products. Expansion of e-pharmacy and chain businesses: E-pharmacy sales, which were already rising rapidly, saw a strong surge in demand during the second wave of the pandemic, registering more than 25% growth in 2021. The rapid growth of the sector is encouraging investments from large businesses, and consolidation of smaller players; however, it will lead to increased competition and pressure on drug prices. Increase in health insurance coverage: The central Yojana (ABPMJAY) health insurance scheme will drive healthcare access, affordability and improve health outcomes over the forecast period. The 'Aap Ke Dwar Ayushman' campaign, to facilitate door-to-door beneficiary mobilisation, identified over 40 million people under the scheme. Low cost of production: The presence of various generic drug companies is a major factor for India to establish a leadership position in the global pharmaceutical sector. Furthermore, India provided for ~40% of the generic demand in the United States and 25% of all medicine in the United Kingdom. India is the world's largest supplier of generic medications, accounting for ~20% of the worldwide supply by volume and supplying about half of the global vaccination demand. This is based on India Brand Equity Foundation's Pharmaceutical Industry Report published in March, 2022. ~50% Global vaccine demand fulfilled by India Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statements Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 202297 96Company performance We are multinational healthcare organisation with the purpose of \"Chasing the miracles of science to improve people's lives\".

Our portfolio includes a wide range of medications and dietary supplements for the treatment of heart disease, thrombosis, epilepsy, allergies, infections, and diabetes (both insulins and oral medications). Insulin for diabetes Diabetes portfolio India is referred to as the diabetes capital of the world. However, Sanofi, with its 70 years of legacy, is committed to make a change and treat people with diabetes by providing high-quality medicines and services.

The likely price rationalisation of our flagship brand Lantus\u00ae would make this world-class insulin more affordable for people with diabetes in the extra rural segments as well. Our increased footprint in the market followed through with our renewed marketing strategies, would ensure that we further cement our leadership position in the diabetes segment in India. To secure our future leadership in the coming years, we would continue to enhance our product portfolio. In 2022, we received approvals and positive comments for three new products, which we would launch over the foreseeable future and make our offerings more comprehensive for clinicians. In line with our India for India strategy, we have researched and developed insulin injection devices like the TouStar\u00ae pen, with a dedicated cartridge that is available only in our country. We would continue to invest in science through clinical studies and research to get a higher level of understanding of the diabetes paradigms in our country. Our recently concluded longitudinal RWE (Landmarc) data saw multiple publications in Indian and international scientific meetings on diabetes and is a reference document on diabetes epidemiology and management. Toujeo \u00ae, our U300 insulin, doubled its sales in 2022, in the first full year post the launch of Toujeo \u00ae cartridges. Patient support programmes As leaders in this segment, we recognise how capability and capacity building among our stakeholders is crucial to reduce the burden of diabetes in our country. Thus, it is incumbent on us to shape the diabetes ecosystem and manage it sustainably. Our flagship doctor education programs like ICON and B-School are led by centres of excellence and aims to improve the physician capability in managing complex diabetes situations. Our commitment to patients is underlined by our longest patient support programme: Saath 7 . It touches the lives of more than 100,000 patients each year, in every major city of India, by educating and hand-holding them though their insulin journey. Through this process, they are provided with solutions, better education and increased medical adherence to help them achieve better therapeutic outcomes. Through our customer-awareness initiative 'INTOLIFE' (www.intolife.in ), we activated a series of social media programmes to educate people about various aspects of diabetes management. Our Sanofi Campus programme keeps physicians updated on the latest trends in diabetes management and is gaining traction towards being the go-to place for diabetes clinical information. *More details of the success of this initiative are available on (www.intolife.in ) Digitalisation Digitalisation is an acknowledged change in the way we all live and interact with each other. Thus, we leverage our digital experience by unobtrusively increasing reach and intensity with doctors and patients alike, enabling them to consume information at their convenience and in formats of their choice. Digitalisation and evolution of market economies have resulted in a large imprint of e-commerce and modern trade in our distribution pipelines, and we now do 20% of our business with these emerging stakeholders. We shall continue to partner with them to get insights of the market and patient purchasing patterns and behaviours which would allow us to fine tune our approach as we move forward. In 2022, we collaborated with one of the leading e-pharmacy players to jointly run a programme for making our insulin administration pen device accessible free of cost to patients newly initiated on our Insulin. The year 2022 also saw us getting regulatory approvals and positive regulatory comments for the future launches in the diabetes segment which shall augment our current portfolio in 2023. Our longitudinal RWE (Landmarc) data saw multiple publications in Indian and international scientific meetings on diabetes. We also participated in 'World Diabetes Day 2022' - a campaign targeted towards access to diabetes care. Oral diabetes The oral anti-diabetes drug portfolio maintained its competitive position at #5 in an extremely fragmented market. The newest line extension, Amaryl MV recorded market-beating growth and has consolidated its rank in the represented category. An innovative content strategy of unbranded digital connect allowed our teams to break the cluster and engage in insightful discussions with our HCPs. Our digital outreach initiative - Sanofi connect - with our external partners, reaches out to 10,000 doctors not met by our field force and shown initial success programme. Dedicated efforts were undertaken towards conducting medico-marketing initiatives.

Frisium\u00ae continues to be the most prescribed brand across all anti-convulsants in India. The CNS portfolio maintained its market share in epilepsy, through regular digital customer connects, market-shaping activities and academic engagements. A world-class HCP education and certification programme was developed in collaboration with Boston University School of Medicine. Despite being the 2nd most common neurological condition and India being home to 1 out of 6 people suffering from epilepsy worldwide, epilepsy awareness in India is limited. Keeping this in mind, we launched a mega public awareness initiative: DARE (Drive for Awareness & Right information on Epilepsy), coinciding with 'National Epilepsy Awareness Month' (November 2022). We further partnered with leading neurologists and the cricket legend, Jonty Rhodes to spread awareness about the ailment via digital and radio channels. We are planning to strengthen epilepsy management in the paediatric age group with the launch of a new SKU in 2023. In 2022, Sanofi published the first Indian data on clobazam usage in epilepsy management to strengthen our commitment towards patient benefits.

Digital health will emerge as a key enabler of demand and delivery. There is a large opportunity to have more efficient supply chain operations, after the implementation of GST. We are working on harnessing efficiencies in this area. Our business is also exposed to few risks. Some of the key risks are listed below: In past few years, the Government of India has made frequent changes in regulations covering drug pricing, trade margins and other laws which impact us. Any adverse changes in government policies with respect to pricing or trade margins with respect to our products may impact our performance. We are present in therapy areas such as Diabetes, Cardiology, Thrombosis, Anti-infectives, Central Nervous System and Allergy and Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements. We depend on the research and development conducted by the Sanofi Group for new product commercialisation. The future research and product pipeline strategy of the Sanofi Group may not always be in these therapy areas. This may impact our growth in the long-term. The prices of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates fluctuate based on the market demand and supply conditions. We may not be able to pass on any sharp increases in the prices of raw material to consumers, resulting in margin contraction. We are also exposed to risks like falling interest rates, cyber security failures, adverse social media, counterfeit drugs, adverse orders passed by courts in pricing, tax and other litigations, among others. However, we continue to take steps to mitigate the above risks by: Outlook - Renewed strategy and focus on growth We are moving towards ensuring greater access to quality healthcare products for the Indian population. We lay emphasis on innovating new products as well as accelerating efficiency for a sustainable growth. Some of our priorities going forward will:Focus on growth Grow the businesses in line with the strategy, leverage trade organisation to capture demand and drive growth, and broad public national disease and therapy awareness campaigns on core assets.

Leadership Indicators 1. Has the Company conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products: To better understand the environmental impact of medicines, Sanofi conducts life cycle assessments on key products, develops tools and performance indicators. This approach allows us to be more efficient on action plans. Sanofi group has been implementing an eco-packaging project which applies an eco- design to packaging. This approach starts by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental profile of products, with a focus on the packaging across the entire value chain. This method is scientifically recognized and standardized and allows comparisons to be made. It is therefore possible to check whether the technical modification options on a package are beneficial for several environmental indicators. In 2021, a digital tool dedicated to eco-packaging was deployed, which enables us to complete a LCA on existing packaging and compare it with potential improvements.

Sanofi India is committed to bringing value through equality and to foster and promote human diversity across our operations. We encourage an inclusive work philosophy of creating a supportive professional atmosphere that promotes trust, compassion, and mutual respect. Our policy on Code of Ethics has been developed in line with our commitment. Refer to the web link - Code of Conduct . The efforts taken by Sanofi India in the space of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion are under the global banner of 'All In'. We want to reflect the diversity of our communities, and unleash our best selves every day to transform the practice of medicine. We truly believe that Diverse Teams lead to better outcomes and thus, we are working towards building a company that is representative of the society, in other words, of the people and patients we serve. We aim to create a culture that allows people to unleash the very best version of themselves, every day. Under the 'Reflect' pillar we aim to build a representative leadership which clearly reflect the diverse nature of the communities we serve, whilst through the 'Unleash' pillar we hope to create a thriving environment for our workforce to enable each one of them to work to their fullest potential. Lastly, under the 'Transform' pillar, we are looking to positively impact the society in a positive manner by advocating for our diverse set of communities. When we started on this journey several years ago, we realized that there were a number of quick yet important wins in making Sanofi more inclusive, especially from the Gender Balance perspective. We were one of the first organizations to change our maternity leave from 3 months to 6 months, two years prior to the official government mandate. We also provided a number of enablers in the form of self-defense workshops, enhanced hotel and travel coverage security helpline numbers etc. to ensure our women employees felt safe and fully equipped to make meaningful contributions while at work. Furthermore, we ran sensitization workshops from the topmost leader right down to the first line manager, to make sure they understood what biases are, how each one of us has them and how they can negatively impact the person experiencing them. This in turn helped to create a culture where employees and managers were more sensitive to the needs of others. We also instituted development programs for women employees to help them overcome their own barriers so as to prepare them they were capable of and to take on the next level roles. Today, we see sponsorship for DE&I from across the top business leaders and have instituted Employee Resource Groups which provide a platform for all employees to make their voice heard and contribute meaningfully to the initiatives introduced under DE&I. One of the achievements we are very proud of is compelling the Goa government to allow us to increase the shift timings for women employees so they can contribute fully during the evening shift. 5.

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Sanofi India Limited (\"the Company\"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2022, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at December 31, 2022, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year then ended.Basis for Opinion 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SA) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key audit matters 4. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Tax litigations and contingencies. (Refer Note 9(a), 9(b), 39(a), 39(b) and 43 to the financial statements) As at December 31, 2022, several litigations under direct and indirect tax laws are pending for decision at various authority levels, in respect of which, the Company has disclosed contingent liabilities of C 2,694 million. The management's assessment with regard to the tax matters is supported by advice from independent consultants. We considered this as a key audit matter, as evaluation of these matters requires significant management judgement and estimation, interpretation of laws and regulations and application of relevant judicial precedents to determine the probability of outflow of economic resources for recognising provisions and making related disclosures in the financial statements. The application of accounting principles as given under Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, in order to determine the amount to be recognised as a provision, or to be disclosed as a contingent liability, needs careful evaluation and judgement to be applied by the management.Our audit procedures included the following: Understanding and evaluation of the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls in respect of assessment of tax, its accounting and disclosures in the financial statements; Obtaining a complete list of litigation matters and reading the underlying orders and other communications received from tax authorities and management's responses thereto, to assess the status of the litigations; Evaluating the independence, objectivity and competence of management's experts involved; Reading the management's experts advice, as applicable; Evaluating the management's assessment on the probability of outcome and the magnitude of potential outflow of economic resources in respect of tax matters including involvement of our tax experts for assessing complex tax matters, based on recent rulings and latest developments in case laws; Evaluating appropriateness of the Company's disclosures in the financial statements. Based on the audit procedures performed, we did not identify any significant exceptions relating to the provisions recognised and disclosures made in the financial statements in respect of the tax matters.Other Information 5. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements 6. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 7 . In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 8. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 9. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statements Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022153 152 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 10. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 11. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 12. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 13. As required by the Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2020 (\"the Order\"), issued by the Central Government of India in terms of sub-section (11) of Section 143 of the Act, we give in the Annexure B a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the extent applicable.14.

(b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books (c) The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including other comprehensive income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the books of account. (d) In our opinion, the aforesaid financial statements comply with the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act.

(g) With respect to the other matters to be included in the Auditor's Report in accordance with Rule 11 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 (as amended), in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us: i.

The dividend declared and paid during the year by the Company is in compliance with Section 123 of the Act. 15. The Company has paid/ provided for managerial remuneration in accordance with the requisite approvals mandated by the provisions of Section 197 read with Schedule V to the Act.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statements under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act 1. We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Sanofi India Limited (\"the Company\") as of December 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 2. The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (\"the Guidance Note\") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\"). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor's Responsibility 3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements 6. A company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements 7 . Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Opinion 8. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at December 31, 2022, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

(d) The Company has chosen cost model for its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of Use assets) and intangible assets. Consequently, the question of our commenting on whether the revaluation is based on the valuation by a Registered Valuer, or specifying the amount of change, if the change is 10% or more in the aggregate of the net carrying value of each class of Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of Use assets) or intangible assets does not arise.

(a) The physical verification of inventory has been conducted at reasonable intervals by the Management during the year and, in our opinion, the coverage and procedure of such verification by Management is appropriate. The discrepancies noticed on physical verification of inventory as compared to book records were not 10% or more in aggregate for each class of inventory. (b) During the year, the Company has not been sanctioned working capital limits in excess of C 5 crores, in aggregate from banks and financial institutions on the basis of security of current assets and accordingly, the question of our commenting on whether the quarterly returns or statements are in agreement with the unaudited books of account of the Company does not arise. iii.

(c) In respect of the loan to employees including loan to a director, the schedule of repayment of principal has been stipulated, and the employees including director are repaying the principal amounts, as stipulated given in the earlier year.

The financial statements are presented in C million and all values are rounded to the nearest million ( C 000,000), except when otherwise indicated.2.2 (a) New and amended standards adopted by the Company The Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2022: 1) On March 24, 2021, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") through a notification, amended Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. The amendments revise Division I, II and III of Schedule III. Key amendments relating to Division II relate to companies whose financial statements are required to comply with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules.

Key amendments are: COVID-19 related concessions - amendments to Ind AS 116 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - amendments to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107 The amendments listed above did not have a material impact on the company. 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies i. Current and non-current classification The assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet are classified on a \"current / non-current basis\". An asset is treated as current when it is: Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle; Held primarily for the purpose of trading; Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date, or Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. A liability is current when: It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle; It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current/non- current classification of assets and liabilities. ii. Fair value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming the market participants act in their economic best interest. The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account, market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. Where required/appropriate, external valuers are involved. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 (if level 1 feed is not available/ appropriate) \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 (if level 1 and 2 feed is not available/ appropriate) \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The Company recognizes transfers between levels of fair value hierarchy at the end of reporting period during which the change has occurred. iii. Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The Chief Operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and makes strategic decisions. Refer Note 36 for segment information presented. iv. Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates ('the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in Indian C (INR), which is Sanofi India Limited's functional and presentation currency. Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022169 168Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statementsNotes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022Notes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated. All non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency are carried at historical cost or other similar valuation and are reported using the exchange rate that existed when the values were determined. v. Revenue recognition According to Ind AS 115, revenue is measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when control of the goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them are transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognised using the following five step model specified in Ind AS 115: Step 1: Identify contracts with customers Step 2: Identify performance obligations contained in the contracts Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations Step 5: Recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold, and services rendered is net of variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the contract. This variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value of outflow. Revenue (net of variable consideration) is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that the amount will not be subject to significant reversal when uncertainty relating to its recognition is resolved. Sale of goods The Company derives revenue principally from sales of pharma products. Revenue from sale of products is recognized when the Company satisfies a performance obligation in accordance with the provisions of contract with customer. This is achieved when control of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is generally determined when title, ownership, risk of obsolescence and loss pass to the customer and the Company has present right to payment. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discount and volume rebates, and goods and service tax. Provision is made for the non-saleable return of goods from the customers estimated on the basis of historical data of sales return trends. Such provision for non-saleable sales returns is reduced from sale of products for the year. Sale of services Revenue is recognized from rendering of services when the performance obligation is satisfied, and the services are rendered in accordance with the terms of customer contracts. Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers. vi. Export Incentives Export benefits available under prevalent schemes are accrued in the year in which the goods are exported and there is no uncertainty in receiving the same. vii. Income tax The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences. Current income tax The current income tax charge is calculated based on the Indian Tax Laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. The provision for current tax is made at the rate of tax as applicable for the income of the previous year as defined under the Income tax Act, 1961. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provision where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for the financial reporting purpose at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forward and unused tax credits could be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. viii. Leases Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the company. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: Fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable Variable lease payments Amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantee Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received Any initial direct cost and restoration costs Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Payments associated with short-term leases and all leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. ix. Impairment of non-financial assets At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets except inventories to ascertain whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash- generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Intangible assets excluding goodwill with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022171 170Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statementsNotes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022Notes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash- generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. x. Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of presentation in the Statement of Cash Flows, Cash and Cash Equivalents includes balance with banks and demand deposits with banks with original maturities of three months or less and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. xi. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, packing materials, work-in-progress, stock-in-trade and finished goods. Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV). Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Cost of raw materials and packing materials includes cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods includes direct materials, labour and proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, wherever applicable. Cost of finished goods includes other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of stock-in-trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. However, materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be used are expected to be sold at or above cost. xii. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument for another entity. Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets: Classification The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through the Statement of Profit and Loss), and those measured at amortized cost. The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through Profit and Loss are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets are measured at: fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through Profit and Loss), or amortized cost. Debt instruments Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') or fair value through Profit and Loss ('FVTPL ') till de- recognition on the basis of (i) the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and (ii) the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments. (a) Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. (b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVTOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the Statement of Profit and Loss and recognised in other gains/ (losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. (c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Equity instruments All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of such investments. Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment of financial assets The Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, deposits, and bank balance. trade receivables. The Company follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables which do not contain a significant financing component. Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022173 172Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statementsNotes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022Notes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022 The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognized only when: the Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognized. Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the Company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset. Income recognition Interest income Interest income from debt instruments is recognized using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. Financial liabilities: Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are initially measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial liability not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue/origination of the financial liability. Subsequent measurement Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held - for - trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. The Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge risks which are not designated in any hedging relationship i.e. hedge accounting is not followed. Such contracts are accounted for at FVTPL. Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are off-set and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. xiii. Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Items of Property, plant and equipment acquired or constructed are initially recognized at historical cost net of recoverable taxes, duties, trade discounts and rebates, less accumulated depreciation, and impairment loss, if any. The historical cost of Property, plant and equipment comprises of its purchase price, borrowing costs and adjustment arising for exchange rate variations attributable to the assets, including any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to their working condition for their intended use. Capital Work-in-Progress represents Property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as at the reporting date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The Company identifies and determines cost of each component/part of the plant and equipment separately, if the component/part has a cost which is significant to the total cost of the plant and equipment and has useful lives that is materially different from that of the remaining plant and equipment. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year in which they are incurred. Gains and losses arising from derecognition of PPE are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized. Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual values Depreciation is provided, pro-rata for the period in use, on the straight-line method based on the respective estimate of useful lives given below. Estimated useful lives of assets are determined based on technical parameters/assessments. The management believes that useful lives currently used, which is prescribed under Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, fairly reflects its estimate of the useful lives and residual values of PPE, though these lives in certain cases are different from lives prescribed under Schedule II.Asset Category Useful Lives (in Years) Buildings - Factory 30 Buildings - Non-Factory* 30 Plant and Machinery* 10 Furniture and Fixtures 10 Office equipment 10/5 Computers 3 Laptops 3 Motor vehicles 8 Leasehold improvements Amortised over the lease period *In respect of these assets, management estimates different useful life than prescribed under part C of Schedule II based on internal assessment and independent technical evaluation. Estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually, considering into account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Advances paid towards the acquisition of PPE outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under 'Other non- current assets' and cost of assets not put to use before such date are disclosed under 'Capital work-in-progress'. xiv. Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated amortization / impairment losses. Acquired intangible assets Separately acquired intangible assets are shown at historical cost. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows: Asset Category Useful Lives (in Years) Brand 10 Software 3 Technical know- how 5 Sanofi India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022175 174Corporate overview Value creation approach Our capitals Statutory reports Financial statementsNotes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022Notes forming part of financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022 In respect of the above assets, management's estimate is based on internal assessment and independent technical evaluations. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The amortisation expense on intangible assets is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of Intangible assets are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amount and are disclosed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Research and development expenditure Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Development costs of products are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless a product's technical feasibility has been established, in which case such expenditure is capitalised. Development expenditure on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale. Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset. How the asset will generate future economic benefits. The availability of resources to complete the asset. The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development. The amount capitalised comprise of expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis for creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended use. Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future benefit from the related project, i.e., the estimated useful life. Amortization is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. xv. Provisions and contingent liabilities P r o v i s i o n s Provisions are recognized when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and there is a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost. Contingencies Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements. Contingent liabilities are disclosed for when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company, or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. xvi. Employee benefits I. Short term benefits All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, bonus, short term compensated absences and the expected cost of ex-gratia is recognized in the period in which the employee renders the related service. II. Other long-term employee benefits The Company has for all employees' other long-term benefits in the form of Long Service Award and Compensated Absences as per the policy of the Company. Liabilities for such benefits are provided on the basis of actuarial valuation, as at the reporting date, carried out by an independent actuary. The actuarial valuation method used by an independent actuary for measuring the liability is the Projected Unit Credit method. III. Post-employment benefit obligations The company operates the following post- employment schemes: a) defined contribution plans such as superannuation fund and provident fund for Nepal and b) defined benefit plans such as gratuity, pension plan and provident fund (other than Nepal) Defined contribution plans The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Superannuation Fund which is recognised by the Income-tax authorities and administered through trustees and/or Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Further, the Company also has a defined contribution plan in the form of a provident fund scheme for its staff and workmen at Nepal and pension scheme under the Employee's Pension Scheme 1995 for its all employees, which are administered by the Provident Fund Commissioner. All the above-mentioned schemes are classified as defined contribution plans as the Company has no further obligation beyond making the contributions. The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss, when an employee renders the related service. Defined benefit plans The company has defined benefit plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident Fund (treated as a defined benefit plan on account of guaranteed interest benefit), Gratuity and Pension Plan (treated as a defined benefit plan on account of guaranteed pension). The Company has for all employees other than Nepal, defined benefit plans for post- employment benefits in the form of Provident Fund which is administered through trustees (treated as a defined benefit plan on account of guaranteed interest benefit). Further, the Company has defined benefit plan for post-retirement benefit in the form of Gratuity which is administered through LIC for all its employees and pension plan for certain employees. Provident Fund and Gratuity fund are recognised by the Income-tax authorities and administered through trustees and/ or LIC. Liability for Defined Benefit Plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bond that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related gratuity, pension plan and provident fund liabilities. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the Balance Sheet. xvii. Share based payments Sanofi S.A. France, being the Ultimate Holding Company has given restricted stock option plan to certain employees of the Company. Pursuant to Ind AS 102 'Share-based Payment', the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the stock options as at grant date. The expenses are amortised over the vesting period which is conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. The corresponding credit is given to equity because the award represents in substance equity contribution by the Parent Company. The cumulative expense recognised for stock options at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

Exceptional Items When items of income or expense are of such nature, size and incidence that their disclosure is necessary to explain the performance of the Company for the year, the company makes a disclosure of the nature and amount of such items separately under the head \"exceptional items.\" xix. Contributed equity Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. xx. Dividends distribution to equity holders Provision is made for amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. xxi. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. xxii. Cash flow statement Cash flows are reported using the Indirect Method, as set out in Ind AS 7 'Statement of Cash Flow', whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transaction of non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. xxiii. Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet. 3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") has vide notification dated March 23, 2022 notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022 which amends certain accounting standards, and are applicable to Sanofi India Limited from January 1, 2023. Below is a summary of such amendments: Ind As 37, Provisions, Contingent liabilities and contingent assets Onerous contracts - Cost of fulfilling a contract Ind AS 103 Business Combination - Reference to conceptual framework Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments - Fees included in test for derecognition of financial assets Ind AS 101 First time adoption - Subsidiary as a first time adopter Ind AS 41, Agriculture - Tax on fair value measurements Ind AS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before intended use of property, plant and equipment These amendments listed above is not expected to have any material impact on the Company. 4. Significant Judgements and Estimates The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the accompanying disclosures and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances existing when financial statements were prepared. These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates is recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future year affected. Estimates and Assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, which may cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company.

Changes in bond yields: A decrease in yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings. Longevity risk: If improvements in life expectancy are greater than assumed, the cost of benefits will increase because pensions are paid for longer period than expected. This will mean the funding level will be higher than expected. Inflation risk: If inflation is greater than assumed, the cost of benefits will increase as pension increases and deferred revaluations are linked to inflation. ix) Broad category of Plan assets relating to Gratuity Particulars Gratuity December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fund managed by Life Insurance Corporation of India (unquoted) 94% 93% Special Deposit Fund 6% 7% Fund is Managed by LIC as per IRDA guidelines, category-wise composition of the plan assets is not available.

(a) Consequent upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of prices of certain bulk drugs fixed by the Government of India under the Drug (Prices Control) Order, 1979, the Company paid an amount of C 31 Million in 1988 being the liability determined by the Special Team appointed by the Government. However, during 1990, fresh demands aggregating to C 781 Million alleged to be payable into the Drug Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA) were made by the Government on account of alleged unintended benefit enjoyed by the Company. The Government has also made certain claims for applicable interest. On a Writ Petition filed by the Company in 1991, the Bombay High Court passed an order whereby the demands were to be treated as show cause notices. The High Court directed the Company and the Government to furnish relevant data to each other based on which the Government was to rework the figures. The Government did not furnish the requisite data to the Company. In 1995, a further demand of C 80 Million was made by the Government. In the meantime, a Committee was constituted by the Government to determine the liabilities of the Drug Companies. The Company filed written submissions with the Committee and contended during the personal hearing that in the absence of the Government furnishing the requisite data as directed by the Bombay High Court, the Company was not in a position to make an effectual presentation before the Committee. In January 1999, the Company filed an Application before the Bombay High Court seeking directions to the Government to furnish the requisite data. The Application is pending. In the meantime, the Committee has deferred further hearing of the Company's case, until the Application is heard and decided by the Bombay High Court. In any event, the Company is contesting the above demand. (b) National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) had raised demands on the Company for alleged overcharging of some of its products. The Company had contested the demands by filing writ petitions in the Delhi High Court. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide order dated May 16, 2019, without expressing any opinion on the matter, set aside the demands raised and the matter was remanded back to NPPA for considering them afresh in accordance with law. As a matter of abundant precaution, an amount of C 162 million which had been provided in the books of account in earlier years has been retained. The Company will continue to assess any further developments in this matter. Based on the management assessment, the likelihood of any additional outflow is considered as remote in respect of above (a) and (b) matters. 46.

Financial risk management The Company's activities expose it to variety of financial risks namely market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company has various financial assets such as deposits, trade and other receivables and cash and bank balances directly related to their business operations. The Company's principal financial liabilities comprise of trade and other payables. The Company's senior management's focus is to foresee the unpredictability and minimize potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company's overall risk management procedures to minimise the potential adverse effects of financial market on the Company's performance are as follows: The Company's Board of Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. The Company's risk management is carried out by the management in consultation with the Board of Directors. The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific risk areas. This note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed to and how the entity manages the risk. (A) Management of Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and other financial instruments. The Company establishes an impairment allowance based on expected credit loss model that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. (i) Trade and other receivables The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to C 1,291 million as at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - C 1,429 million). Trade receivables are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers located in India as well as outside India. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry, the country and the state in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Further, significant sales of the Company are against advance payment/collection on delivery terms. The management continuously monitors the credit exposure towards the customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period to determine incurred and expected credit losses. The movement in the allowance for credit loss in respect of trade receivables was as follows: Particulars December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Opening balance 68 50 Changes in loss allowance (15) 18 Closing balance 53 68 The management believes that no further provision is necessary in respect of trade receivables based on historical trends of these customers. Concentration of credit risk arises when counter parties are engaged in similar business activities or have similar economic features that would cause the ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economical, political or other conditions. Concentration of credit risk indicate the relative sensitivity of the Company's performance to developments affecting a particular industry. The Company's exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer has significant contribution to trade receivable balances. (ii) Cash and cash equivalents and bank balances The Company held cash and cash equivalents of C 10,049 million as at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: C 15,380 million) and other bank balances of C 120 million (December 31, 2021: C 123 million). Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as these are generally held or invested in deposits with banks and financial institutions with good credit ratings.

The Company's maximum exposure to credit risk as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is the carrying value of each class of Financial Assets. (B) Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The Company's approach in managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. The Company maintained a cautious liquidity strategy, with a positive cash balance throughout the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Cash Flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.

Market risk comprises three types of risks namely interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as commodity risk. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk and other price risk whereas the exposure to currency risk is given below: Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates and arises where transactions are done in foreign currencies. It arises mainly where receivables and payables exist due to transactions entered in foreign currencies.
