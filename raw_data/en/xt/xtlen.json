A CMP was ordered which revealed elevated glucose, creatinine, BUN, CO2, and AST values. Also noted were decreased potassium and ALB values as well as severely elevated creatinine kinase levels. Selvin arrived in Bath (UK) from Jamaica in 1956, Selvin wife arrived 2yrs later. Married for 61 years they have together four Daughters and one son. Selvin and his wife owned a West Indian shop retired and later moved to London in 2006. So, what is the definition of health care associated infections? They are infections that patients acquire while being hospitalized to receive treatment for their conditions either medical or surgical. Many of the HCAIs are preventable. In the modern healthcare, there are many types of invasive procedures that is used to treat patients to help them recover, also some devices are used, and all can be a potential risk for transmitting an infection to the patient while receiving the treatment. According to Mayo Clinic, an overactive bladder is just that: a bladder-storage problem resulting in sudden and frequent urges to urinate. Often these \"urges\" may be so strong that they cannot be stopped leading to incontinence.The amount of urine released may be a small trickle, or it may be a complete emptying of the bladder. The National Library of Medicine notes that the number of seniors with an overactive bladder continues to grow. It is well over 10 percent today and may reasonably be expected to reach a full quarter of seniors in the next two decades. The result of urinary incontinence in seniors is often social isolation, anxiety, fear, and depression linked to the embarrassment of having The morality of Healthcare acquired infections has increased tremendously whereas; both inpatient and outpatient clients have been infected during a hospital visit. These infections has weaken the sick which may lead to additional medications, or surgery, and extended hospital stay. According to (CDC 2002), healthcare acquired infections are result of unhygienic practices in medical field. This includes ambulatory surgical centers, hospice center, nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. Most common infections that plague the healthcare is Clostridium Difficule (C.diff) that lives in the intestinal tract which causes a sereve case of diarrhea. C.diff does not affected healthly people but can be alter by use of some antibotics 2. Discuss catheter-associated urinary tract infection & apply evidence-based principles for inserting and removal of a catheter. An example of when I have used inter-professional communication to collaborate to improve patient outcomes is when a patient came into the ED with urinary retention. This patient was an older man and he said that he has not urinated well the past few days. He stated that he just gets dribbles every so often and that he has an urge to go so bad. Once the ED physician communicated with the patient an order was put in to insert an Indwelling Catheter. I went into the patient's bed area and described to him what I was going to do and how the catheter works. On assessment of his abdomen I noticed his lower pubic area was bulging outward, which looked very abnormal. I started to insert the Indwelling catheter and noticed that when it was fully inserted there was no urine return, but I was Cabral is well respected by staff, patients, and families and is respectful of others as well. She makes appropriate referrals to other disciplines to promote continuity and Veteran centered care. Ms. Cabral developed a monthly note template with pertinent nursing diagnosis, interventions and patient goals that are now being used exclusively by staff. She provides nursing care that is environmentally safe and healthy and does so with good infection control practice. Under her leadership there have been 0 incidences of blood stream infections or transmission. Ms. Cabral is 100% compliant with the use of safety devices for patients with catheters being tracked on a daily basis as part of the unit's safety program. Sepsis is a common life threatening condition that unless promptly recognized and treated, can progress to septic shock. In the United States, sepsis is the 10th leading cause of death, and is suspected to have an increased prevalence due to the aging population; an increase in immunocompromised patients; greater use of invasive medical technologies; and greater antimicrobial resistance (Vanzent, 2011). It accounts for a mortality rate of 35%, and 20,000 deaths per day worldwide (Kafle & Nath, 2014). This is substantial because there are few disease processes that are associated with such a high mortality rate. The unregulated inflammatory response leads to intravascular volume loss, cellular hypoxia, and multisystem organ failure. The impact of CAUTI remains a major threat to the safety of the patient and accounts for about 40% of hospital-acquired infection. The main culprit associated with the occurrence of CAUTI is having an indwelling catheter during a hospital stay. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CAUTI's are well thought-out to be an avoidable barrier of hospitalization, hence no extra payment is afforded for this treatment. The proposed solution would be to have a nurse champions for CAUTI prevention on the unit. As an example, the nurse would be a resource for questions regarding CAUTIs prevention, such as care of urinary catheters, clinical education and training, as well as making patient rounds with the physician to verify the need for the urinary catheter.

Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia, 103(4), 292-298. PMCID: PMC4206359 In the nursing field it is essential to provide excellent patient care to promote the wellbeing of all patients. One of the most essential times for nurses to collaborate and work as a team is during report between shifts. It is of upmost importance that each nurse gives a thorough report to the next shift so that they are aware of all issues each patient is having and they can work as a team collaborating proper care to promote patient wellbeing. Whether it's a doctor's office, outpatient clinic, ambulatory care center or a hospital, cleaning in a health care facility serves the dual purpose of providing patients and their loved ones with confidence in the medical care, as well as eliminates germs and minimizes the risk of infections that can be so prevalent in these settings. In all areas of healthcare, particularly in acute care settings, patients may be unable to care for their nutritional and/or hygienic needs properly. One area that is especially important to address is the perineal care of patients who are incapacitated, or otherwise unable to care for their hygienic needs independently. Normal bacterial flora can develop into an opportunistic infection if the bacteria reaches certain areas of the body. For example, a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) is due to Escherichia coli from the colon coming into contact with the urethra (Copstead & Banasik, 2013). If the patient is immunocompromised, elderly, sedentary, or otherwise compromised in their abilities to void, this can predispose the patient "}
