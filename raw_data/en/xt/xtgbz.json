Peppermint essential oil is also an amazing oil for stomach and abdominal upset. You can also use peppermint essential oil for controlling fevers. Tea Tree - Tea tree oil is very important in the health of the immune system, as it acts as an immuno-stimulant and increases the body's ability to fight off any infections, while it also is used to revive the mind and body after shock.

How to use the essential oils There are so many ways to integrate these essential oils into your daily life to help boost your health, here are some ideas: BCALM Spray Why not make a spray that you use throughout the day? Particularly useful before bed to help clear congestion, or to spray on your pillow to help clear sinuses whilst you sleep. To 100ml of water add up to 30 drops of essential oils from the list above. Choose the oils that you like the smell of, as those are the ones your body will need the most! You can blend them all so get creative! Peppermint especially is cooling, so it's perfect for spraying onto the skin when it is a humid night! Diffusion Try our immunity boost signature scent, lemon, tea tree and peppermint in your diffuser, as well as soothing symptoms, it makes the room smell beautiful! Lemon's great for concentration too, so it's ideal for when you are working. Steam Inhalation If you're really congested, try a steam inhalation over a bowl of boiling water with up to 10 drops of your chosen oil. Place a towel over your head as you inhale for a few minutes at a time, remembering to close your eyes. Better still, try having a bath with your chosen oils. Ensure that all of the doors and windows are closed and enjoy your inhalation whilst having a relaxing soak. Itchy Eyes Cool compresses can be extremely soothing for sore, red, itchy eyes! Soak a couple of cotton pads in water, pop in the fridge for a few minutes and place over the eyes for 10-15 minutes. Alternatively the classic cucumber slice works wonders!
