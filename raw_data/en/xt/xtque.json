Busch, III, is a comprehensive combination of pain relief treatments for back pain and neck pain conditions. The DRS Protocol\u00ae utilizes [spinal decompression](https://buschchiropractic.com/news/what-is-spinal-decompression) along with multiple therapies customized for each patient's unique condition. The DRS Protocol\u00ae is a safe, non-surgical, and drug-free treatment for chronic pain conditions including, but not limited to: herniated disc, bulging disc, sciatica, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and facet syndrome. This pain-free treatment protocol has been offered exclusively in Fort Wayne at the Busch Chiropractic Pain Center for over fifteen years. What Does the DRS Protocol\u00ae Treat? The DRS Protocol\u00ae treatment has been proven most effective for involved and chronic disc conditions: - degenerative disc disease - herniated disc(s) - numbness and tingling of the hands/arms and legs/feet - sciatica - posterior facet syndrome - spinal stenosis - failed back and neck surgeries [back pain](https://buschchiropractic.com/low-back-pain)of any kind [neck pain](https://buschchiropractic.com/neck-pain) Dr. Busch customizes treatment for each patient's needs, as each patient's health and condition are individual. Dr. Busch states, \"I know what we do for care is the solution for the fight against low back pain and neck pain because for over fifteen years we have seen the life-changing outcomes for our patients through treatment with our unique, customized DRS Protocol\u00ae.\" The DRS Protocol\u00ae is so safe and effective that many medical doctors refer their chronic pain patients, including their senior patients, to Busch Chiropractic for treatment rather than have them face invasive procedures such as back surgery, fusion, or steroid injections along with a lifetime of addictive medications. How Does DRS Work? DRS ( Decompression, Reduction, and Stabilization) applies an \"axial\" or distractive force to injured disc levels. During treatment, discs are rehydrated when pressure within the disc is dropped from a positive to a negative promoting the diffusion, or intake, of water, oxygen, and nutrients. Repeated pressure differential promotes retraction of a herniated nucleus pulposus (the elastic core of the intervertebral disc). In other words, the DRS treatment reduces pressure inside of the disc which reduces the painful herniation and the pain from disc-related degenerative conditions. The pressure reduction results in increased blood flow to the injured area, reduction of pain, increased mobility, and tissue repair. Studies show that DRS is a \"front-line, non-surgical premier treatment for patients with chronic pain conditions. DRS Protocol\u00ae Reviews Dr. Busch has successfully treated thousands of chronic pain patients using the DRS Protocol\u00ae - spinal decompression therapy. Patients who were told that surgery was their only option or that nothing more could be done and that they'd \"just have to live with the pain\" have found relief at Busch Chiropractic.
