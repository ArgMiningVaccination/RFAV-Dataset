[Susana Fuentes](https://www.rivm.nl/en/about-rivm/knowledge-and-expertise/experts-and-expertise/dr-s-susana-fuentes) is a professor at the Centre for Infectious Disease Control in the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands. While Fuentes was working on the microbiome and its relation to the immune system, she was surrounded by immunologists working on vaccine responses. \"I saw two very separate people working on the impact of birth mode on microbiome and people working on the immunology of the national immunization program on children, and I was always intrigued to put the two together,\" said Fuentes. In a recent study published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34155-2), Fuentes and her colleagues, in a collaboration with [Debby Bogaert](https://www.ed.ac.uk/inflammation-research/people/principal-investigators/professor-debby-bogaert) at the University of Edinburgh, used human infant cohorts born at term to investigate how the delivery mode-vaginal or c-section-affected the microbiome and influenced vaccine responses.6 To investigate the association of delivery, the microbiome, and early vaccine response, Fuentes and her colleagues followed a cohort of 120 healthy infants. Formation of the early infant immune system is partially governed by the [gut microbiome](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad7121), which is seeded at birth.7 The [method](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(20)30203-2) by which an infant is born influences what types of bacteria are more prevalent in the early microbiome.8 The researchers characterized the infants' early gut microbiome through genetic sequencing and their mucosal antibody responses following administration of the anti-pneumococcal vaccine at 12 months and the anti-meningococcal vaccine at 18 months of age. They then investigated factors such as mode of delivery, early feeding methods, sex, having pets or siblings, exposure to antibiotics, and daycare attendance on the microbiome and antibody responses. This investigation presented a considerable challenge because the microbiome can be influenced by many different factors. \"Do you even have enough information to correct for everything else that is happening around [them]? Because we're not isolated from the world. So, they have brothers and sisters, they have pets, they use a pacifier, are bottle fed, breastfed, all these factors. It's always very challenging,\" said Fuentes. Despite these challenges, the researchers showed that birth by vaginal delivery resulted in higher antibody responses against the anti-pneumococcal and anti-meningococcal vaccines. This could be because the [vaginal microbiome](https://journals.lww.com/mcnjournal/Abstract/2017/11000/The_Maternal_Infant_Microbiome__Considerations_for.3.aspx) is an important microbial source that drives infant gut microbiome development.9 Fuentes further found that the presence of Bifidobacterium and Escherichia coli in the first few weeks of infant gut development resulted in increased immune responses to the vaccines. This study is the first to show an association between gut microbial colonization patterns early in life and the vaccine response, establishing the microbiome as a novel player that researchers can exploit when designing new intervention strategies for infectious diseases. \"I think it really puts another nail in the coffin [in the debate whether] microbes really do influence immune system development in early life,\" said [Brett Finlay](https://www.msl.ubc.ca/people/dr-brett-finlay/), a professor and microbiologist at the University of British Columbia who was not involved in the study. \"And that's what a vaccination is, it's a readout of the immune system.\" Fuentes and her colleagues will continue investigating the microbiome and vaccination. In the future, Fuentes hopes that modifying the microbiome with temporary methods, such as diet or probiotics, will boost vaccine responses. References - Maurice JM, et al.
