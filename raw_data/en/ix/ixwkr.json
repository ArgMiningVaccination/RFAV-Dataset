A method of approaching illness looking at the mental or emotional conflicts, as well as past traumas, that fundamentally underlie the root of a condition. This process is done through dialogue, language, visualization, and writing. This is beneficial for those who are seeking to heal at a deeper consciousness level to reprogram and restore their biology. Conditions Addressed Acute or chronic pain Digestive system disorders Anxiety and depression PSTD Insomnia Musculoskeletal pain Anxiety & depression Persistent fatigue Who can benefit from this therapy? Individuals with conditions ranging from chronic pain to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic infections, and eye disorders who find themselves needing more than conventional biomedicine can benefit from this therapy. In these instances, the mind-body therapy can help to address deeper roots of illness that often involve a loss of power in one's life force resulting from unresolved conflicts rooted in the emotional or spiritual. This approach allows the client to experience a deeper layer of healing that is often necessary before healing of physical conditions can take place. What methods do I use? Dialogue We identify the client's comprehensive history of their story and experiences through discussion to attain an initial overall understanding of their condition. Visualization Through active participation, clients are guided to identify their underlying emotional or psychological conflicts that may be impacting functioning in daily life. Once awareness of the blockages are attained, this brings new perspectives for healing and empowerment. Writing The client communicates through a hands-on technique to resolve subconscious blockages. Writing allows for effective communication with the brain and our emotions. TESTIMONIALS After 4-5 treatments with both needling and hypnosis, my eczema finally went away and my eyebrow grew back. \" I was Lan's patient for a recalcitrant skin condition over 10 years ago. After many years of steroid creams and acupuncture treatments, my facial eczema kept coming back with unwelcome effects of losing 50% of my left eyebrow when I first met Lan. After 4-5 treatments with both needling and hypnosis, my eczema finally went away, and my eyebrow grew back. Furthermore, I was fortunate to have an opportunity to join Lan's 8-week Well-Being Immersion Program online in the fall of 2020 during the pandemic. Her explanations in detail on immune-strengthening Qi-gong exercise really prepared our group to navigate the pandemic. I'm grateful to have known Lan as my healer and as a friend. \" Cynthia Diep Lan was instrumental in helping me get realigned and feel healthy again. \" Lan has been a truly incredible resource in my life for the past five years. I have used her to treat anxiety, depression, infertility, and back pain and most recently to treat a stomach infection. I got e.coli and c.difficile this past year and lost 20 pounds, and felt awful all the time. It took three rounds of heavy-duty antibiotics prescribed by my gastroenterologist to treat the infection. While it finally cleared, the medications wreaked havoc on my system. Lan was instrumental in helping me get realigned and feel healthy again. Not only with our acupuncture sessions, but also with herbs and the eating protocol she had me follow. Thanks to her, I am finally back to my normal weight and feel healthy again. Lan is magic. Being in her presence is healing, and I couldn't trust her more. I'm so grateful for her. \" Kate Glodney A brilliant doctor with amazing insight into the human mind and body. \" Two years ago I had a severe stroke that left the left side of my body significantly impaired. I have been receiving acupuncture treatments from Dr. Lan for over a year. Her treatments have greatly improved my circulation, sensations in my hands and feet and my ability to function. She has healing touch and a brilliant doctor with amazing insight into the human mind and body. I listen to her heartfelt instructions and follow her direction in my recovery. Dr. Lan has me taking herbal supplements daily that give me increased ambition and stimulation. I was a student of her initial Well-Being Immersion Program and practiced Qigong daily. It has noticeably improved my range of motion, flexibility and energy. \" "}
