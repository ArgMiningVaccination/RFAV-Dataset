The good news is that All essential oils help reduce stress, provided that the aroma is appealing to the individual's senses. Less stress equals fewer food cravings, so you won't have to rely so much on willpower to keep you from over-indulging in non-nutritive food.

Even when you're not feeling hungry, it takes a whole lot of willpower to refrain from eating whatever it is you're craving. The easy solution is to reduce cravings...the ones that have nothing to do with nourishing the body and everything to do with avoiding and resisting your uncomfortable feelings.

Of course, this isn't the best idea if you're trying to lose weight. Getting more restful sleep at night seems to result in more energy during the day, which can help you make better food choices and avoid the \"afternoon crash\" that often leads to unhealthy treats. [Lavender essential oils](https://miraclebotanicals.com/collections/lavende) can help you relax in the evening, making it easier to fall asleep while also improving the quality of your sleep (Lillehei AS, 2015). This helps to decrease the chance of you turning to a quick pick-me-up. Lavender can also help smooth digestive tract muscles (5 Ways to Heal with Lavender, 2018) and improve digestion, which helps you feel fuller without feeling uncomfortable. This helps reduce cravings and give you added energy throughout the day. One of the most common ways to use lavender is to place a drop on the pillowcase. You can also inhale it, diffuse it, or add a few drops to a bath. $11.97 Botanical Name: Lavandula Angustifolia Plant Part: Flowering Tops Method of Extraction: Steam Distilled Country of Origin: France Color/Consistency: Clear with Thin Consistency Aroma: Floral, Crisp, Sweet, Herbaceous, Gentle, Balsalmic Undertones Main Chemical Components: Linalyl acetate (32.40%), Linalool...

The lymphatic system works to eliminate waste in the body, and detoxing it helps reduce bloating and water retention, which has a slimming effect (Shortsleeve & Felbin, 2022). Since peppermint oil can also help reduce inflammation, it helps prevent insulin resistance and leptin resistance which commonly come with weight gain. Reducing inflammation helps your body function optimally which results in elimination of excess weight. (Williams, 2022). A drop of peppermint oil can be placed under the tongue. It can be inhaled, diffused, or a few drops can be added to food or drinks.
