The intent of this document is to ensure that the levels of evidence for SE are rigorous enough to protect public health and maintain consumer confidence, while providing a clearly defined pathway to register health supplements. It should be read togethe r with the current versions of the following documents , including those referred to therein: 6.18 Screening Template for new applications for registration of a Complementary Medicine 7.01 Complementary Medicines - Discipline -Specific: Safety and Efficacy 7.02 Complementary Medicines - Roadmap and Transitional Process 7.03 Complementary Medicines - Use of the ZA CTD format in the preparation of a registration application 7.05 Complementary Medicines - Complementary Medicines: Quality 7.06 Complementary Medicines - Guidance on Specified Substances Other SAHPRA guidelines may be referred to where appropriate. A cop y of the referenced guideline should also be supplied. ii) Scope and Overview This guideline provides information for the registration of health supplements in South Africa. Products which include any substance of discipline -specific origin would need to follow the registration procedure indicated by the Guideline for Complementary Medicines - Quality, Safety and Efficacy (Discipline Specific). In general Complementary Medicines (CMs) are used and sold by many people in RSA. These guidelines accompany the regulations dealing with the registration and post -marketing control of health supplements that are subject to the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965) \"the Act\" . The guidelines give direction with regard to the required information but should not in themselves be regarded as the final reference point. Where the applica nt wishes to use and submit information not found in these guidelines these would have to be justified scientifically and technically. This mechanism of registration is restricted to schedule 0 substances identified as health supplements at specified dosage s. It is acknowledged, however, that in some instances developments may dictate alternative approaches. When a deviation from a guideline is required, a detailed motivation giving the reason(s) for the deviation and justification for the alternative approach should be included in the expert report submitted with the application. Guidelines are constantly evolving as a result of scientific developments and harmonisation of the requirements of regional and international regulatory authoritie s. The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA / Authority ) endeavours to regularly update the guidelines to reflect current thinking and keep its technical requirements and evaluation policies in line with \"best international medicines regulatory practice\". With respect to any registration of a medicine, it is a legal requirement that data submitted for evaluation should substantiate all claims and should meet technical requirements of quality, safety and efficacy of the product for the purposes for which it is intended. The nature of registration of health supplements is such that the SAHPRA wishes to ensure that products sold to the public which fall under this classification are of good quality and are safe. Efficacy of such products is established by the use of permitted claims Registration of Medicines: CMs Health Supplements - Safety and Efficacy March 2022 7.04_CM_SE_Health_Supplements_Mar22_v4_3 Page 5 of 154 Back to ToC associated with individual ingredients . Allowance is made for the development of multiple substance formulations and their associated claims. Over time pharmacological classifications that relate to health su pplements will be called up in a staged and systematic process . This will be in line with the published recommendation s contained in this document relevant to allowable levels and claims for various substances. Multiple substance formulations will be called up for registration when all lists have been populated. ANNEXURE A is included to help decide what would be regarded as a Category D (Complementary Medicine ) substance . 1.1 Definition As per the General Regulations made in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965): \"health supplement\" means any substance, extract or mixture of substances as determined by the Authority, sold in dosage forms used or purported for use in resto ring, correcting or modifying any physical or mental state by - (a) complementing health; (b) supplementing the diet; or (c) a nutritional effect, and excludes injectable preparations, medicines or substances listed as Schedule 1 or higher in th e Act; Substances that are excluded from being regarded as a health supplement include: injectable substances ; substances scheduled 1 or higher (when indicated for any listed purposes in the schedule) ; substances not specified in the lists of included su bstances (unless duly motivated for inclusion as a health supplement as per ANNEXURE B ), or isolated active ingredients not provided for in the annexures of health supplements.

Unless otherwise stipulated or provided for in another manner, health supplements may contain inactive ingredients that are classified as being Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) (http://www.fda.gov/food/IngredientspackagingLabeling/GRAS/ ). Where r equired make reference to the relevant GRAS listing and ensure that the substance complies with specified requirements. All ingredients that may be delivered by a particular source material used in a health supplement should be identified and quantified (e.g. Magnesium ascorbate which may yield Magnesium and Vitamin C) . In ge neral, health supplements should not be intended for supply to any children under the age of seven (7) months old unless where supplementation is medically warranted. Applicants are expected to include such information on their labelling ( label/s, PIL, and PI). 3.1.1 Single Substance Formulations Products containing single substances must conform to the dosage range provided in the relevant ANNEXURE . All products are required to display any prescribed warnings on the label, Package Insert and Patient Info rmatio n Leaflet. 3.1.2 Multiple Substance Formulations Applicants must present sufficient data demonstrating that the combination of such substances is safe in the dosages indicated. Ideally, specific data demonstrating the safe administration that is product specific should be included in any application. Literature (including reference s, history of use, other acceptable sources and monographs) must be submitted in substantiation of the safety profile of the product. Any multiple substance formulation which contains a substance of discipline specific origin and other substances defined as health supplements must be submitted as a \"combination product\" Discipline Specific product. Applicants will need to demonstrate explici t, cogent philosophies of use amongst all ingredients and the traditional use and/or associated clinical evidence should accord with the provided claim. For combination products refer to Guideline for Complementary Medicines - Discipline Specific: Safety and Efficacy . Registration of Medicines: CMs Health Supplements - Safety and Efficacy March 2022 7.04_CM_SE_Health_Supplements_Mar22_v4_3 Page 11 of 154 Back to ToC 3.2 Labelling and Allowable Claims Health supplements should be labelled according to labelling regulations as stipulated by the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965). In general and unless specifically pre -approved a s a disease risk reduction claim, indications that refer (explicitly or implied) to the treatment, or cure of specific diseases are not suitable for use for health supplements. Reference to the relative Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) as a percentage may also be included on the label where relevant. Any use of artificial sweeteners must be clearly stated as the Guideline: Complementary Medicines: Registration Application ZA -CTD - Quality . The Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) should co ntain the statement that: \"A varied diet is the most effective and safe way to achieve good nutrition, health, body composition as well as mental and physical performance.\" 3.2.1 Single Substance Formulations (SSF) With reference to single substance formul ations , only those claims provided in relevant ANNEX URES shall be permitted. The claim must match the intention of the product for the intended age or sex of the intended user , where applicable . Dosage ranges provided for in the relevant ANNEX URE must be accounted for . Any substance which falls above the maximum will not permit registration as a Health Supplement. In the case of single substance formulations that fall below the minimum dosage, no claim may be used from those stipulated for the relevant substance(s). Claims for such products may be motivated provided that efficacy for the product (backed up by appropriate clinical evidence) can be proven related to such claim. Products of single substance formulation sold without any claims will still be required to be registered and as such duly comply with any relevant Quality and Safety standards as provided herein. For any substance contained in the ANNEXURES that does not carry an allowed health claim, an ANNEXURE B submission is required to be submi tted for consideration prior to the consideration of any application which contains the substance as a SSF. 3.2.2 Multiple Substance Formulation (MSF) Claim Development Claims for multiple substance formulations that conform to the definition of a health supplement may be formulated by the applicant should such not be provided for. Such claims will only be allowed should they conform to general principles contemplated below and with specific motivation that all ingredients would reasonably allow fo r the maintenance of such claim (s). Due to the nature of multiple substance formulations, standardised claims are not always provided in the relevant ANNEX URES below. As such, applicants may be required to propose acceptable health supplement claim (s) that will adequately provide for the intended action (s) of the product. A health supplement claim is a statement that indicates the intended beneficial effect of a product when used in accordance with its recommended conditions of use. The term \"recommended use or purpose\" is often used interchangeably with \"health claim\" or \"indications for use.\" Claims associated with single substances may be used for the generation of claims related to multiple substance formulations, provided that the claim is sufficient ly substantiated and accords with the other substances found in the formulation. Registration of Medicines: CMs Health Supplements - Safety and Efficacy March 2022 7.04_CM_SE_Health_Supplements_Mar22_v4_3 Page 12 of 154 Back to ToC The choice of wording would include any of: General health enhancement without any reference to specific diseases1 Health maintenance, including nutritional support. The use of the words \" contributes\", \"assists\", \"helps\", \"aids\", or \"maintains\" are the basis for claim formulation together with a beneficial physiological effect based on generally accepted scientific evidence. The applicant is expected to formulate a claim which match es the intention of the product with the intended age or sex of the intended user , where applicable . The use of any claim must take account of minimum and maximum dosage levels prescribed f or all substances where the claim must relate to levels permitted in the relevant ANNEX URE and must also account for the action of all other included substances in the product. A suitable justification from various allowable sources is required to substan tiate any developed claim. Below in Table 1 is a list of terms and claims (including wording of similar meaning) that may not be used in association with the development of any claim. The list is not exhaustiv e and will be updated from time to time. Table 1. Undesirable Terms and Claims for Health Supplement s Magical Miracle / Miraculously The only product to use World's best 100 % safe No side effects Guaranteed Other drugs/products cannot compare with it Sensational relief The No. 1 (unless substantiated) Efficacious/Effective Perpetual youth Anti-ageing Longevity Breast enhancement, enlargement, growth Penis enlargement Height enhancement / growth Enhance intelligence / Increase IQ Hormone releaser/enhancer/amplifie r Enhancement of sexual organs Sexual powers Arousal, Libido Reference to the cure, treatment or diagnosis of any disease unless specifically provided for. Or any terms that would reasonably infer a similar meaning or intention in English or any other language . Terms that generally imply or infer a superior action will not be permitted. For multiple substance formulations where any constituents fall below the allowable minimums, no claim may be used from those stipulated for t he relevant substance(s). Applicants may motivate for a claim for such products provided that efficacy for the product (backed up by appropriate clinical evidence) can be proven related to such claim. 1Health enhancement claims apply to enhancement of normal health. They do not relate to enhancement of health from a compromised sta te.
