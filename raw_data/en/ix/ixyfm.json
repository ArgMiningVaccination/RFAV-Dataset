Evaluate the safety profile of a single-dose vaccine boost at day 7 post-injection of COH04S1. (Phase II) III. Determine whether the COH04S1 dose levels tested (1.0x107 or 1.0x108) generate promising immune responses (>5-fold increase of Spike IgG over baseline) after single-dose booster injection, and select a promising dose to use for further study. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Longitudinal evaluation of humoral immunity. (Phase I) II. Quality and properties of cellular and humoral immunity elicited as a result of the vaccination. (Phase I) III. Explore the role of two injections versus one injection, and evaluate a placebo group. (Phase I) III. Evaluate T cell-based antigen-specific immune responses at day 28 post-injection of single-dose COH04S1 vaccine boost. (Phase II) IV. Evaluate SARS-CoV-2 S and N-specific Th1 vs Th2 polarization. (Phase II) V. Assess levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and their activity against variants of concern (VOC) or variants of high consequence (VHC). (Phase II) VI. Estimate the durability of antibody-based immune responses in a 12-month time period. (Phase II) VII. Estimate the durability of T-cell-based immune responses in a 12-month time period. (Phase II) VIII. Estimate the incidence of COVID-19 Moderate and Severe disease during follow-up (12 months). (Phase II) IX. Evaluate the potential relationship between duration of immunity and COVID infection (incidence) over the 12-month study period. (Phase II) X. Summarize outcomes, primary and secondary endpoints, based on pre-study mRNA vaccine received. (Phase II) EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I. Surveillance for incidental coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection during follow-up (1 year). (Phase I) II.
