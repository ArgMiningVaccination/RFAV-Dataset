List of Supplements and things that will help conceive **WARNING LONG** I found this and thought I would share, there were some things I was not aware of like you shouldnt take a multivitamin because it contains vit A. Dont know if this all works but I figured if it cant hurt why not. Angel Bumps' Pregnancy/Fertility Protocol!!! Be warned... here is the LONGEST list you will ever see, but if I didn't explain what each thing was for, then you'd only question it, naturally! So, I have put a short explanation of what each thing is used for and why and you can come to your own conclusions. I suggest you check the stuff out on the internet or via your clinic or GP before you take any of it, to ensure you have peace of mind that it is all safe for you to take!! It took about a year to gather all this information and it is copied and pasted in my digital diary which takes up about 50 pages of information, so believe me, this is the SHORTENED version! LOL! Here goes.... I've posted this to other people and on other fertility sites, but I thought it also might help you all: Just to let you know: a family member of mine tried for 2 and a half years before she got pregnant. In the end, she started using ovulation kits and got pregnant straight away. She was soooo sure of the date she ovulated, due to the dates of her period, but she was wrong. All she needed to buy was simple ovulation kits! Honestly. I was never pregnant prior to trying IVF (to my knowledge) - for 20 years, until I changed my diet and started taking supplements seriously. There are very basic things you can also do to encourage sperm to meet the egg, for the egg to then fertilize and then for the embryonic cells to first of all multiply and implant, but you need to be eating the right things and taking the right supplements. Here is a list of stuff I took: You can buy from Holland & Barrett, Boots, ASDA, [www.naturesbest.co.uk](//www.naturesbest.co.uk/), etc: ___________________________________________________________ ___________________________ Take Evening Primrose Oil (High Strength) from first day of period for 14 days, then stop at ovulation and DON'T take for another 14 days or until your period comes again. EPO can cause your period to start, that is why you only take it up until ovulation, not after. It's a stop and start supplement not to be taken permanently. If pregnant, don't take. But keep using this procedure until you do become pregnant! Evening Primrose Oil is a herb that is often used specifically to help increase cervical mucus. Evening primrose oil is an essential fatty acid that is also an anti-inflammatory. Evening primrose oil will not only help to increase cervical mucus, it can also help to increase the quality and effectiveness of cervical mucus, and produce more \"egg-white cervical mucus.\" GQCM can help the sperm reach the egg easier. It can make the uterus a less 'hostile' place. Taken over time, it can help reduce the narrowing of vessels and promotes blood flow. If you are not trying naturally, i.e.: having fertility treatment, then you can take throughout your treatment non-stop, but PLEASE stop in the 2WW, as it can bring on uterine contractions and therefore make you bleed/have your period. ___________________________________________________________ ___________________________ If you are trying to conceive naturally, you may wish to try cough medicine - sounds daft, but the theory is right: Robitussin and it's Effect on Cervical Mucus Robitussin works on the cervical mucus and increases your chances of getting pregnant. The sperm can swim up to meet the egg much more easily when your mucus is slippery! Robitussin is a popular brand of cough syrup and it might be surprising to consider its relation with fertility. But the fact is that this expectorant is used to loosen and thin mucus of a different kind too, called cervical mucus, in women. Robitussin is only a specific brand and any expectorant that contains guaifenesin as the only active ingredient can be used in its place. Generic versions are most likely available as well. Be sure to carefully inspect the ingredients list to make sure the ONLY active ingredient as guaifenesin. Any other ingredients can diminish the effect you are looking for. What is the recommended dose of Robitussin (or other cough medicine that only contains guaifenesin as the active ingredient? The recommended dose for improving cervical mucus is two teaspoons (200 mg) taken orally three times per day. Recommended dosage is two teaspoons (200 mg) taken orally three times per day. If mucus still appears thick, you can take as the maximum dosage as listed on the label of the cough medicine. Water intake should be increased to encourage cervical mucus production and a full glass should take with each dose of guaifenesin. If you're taking Clomid (clomiphene citrate, Serophene) as an ovulation inductor, it may help to know that it can cause hostile mucus in 30 percent or more of women using it. Higher doses of Clomid tend to be more associated with less cervical fluid and a thinner uterine lining, than the 50 mg dose and Robitussin can help to reverse this. What cycle days should I take Robitussin (cough medicine that only contains guaifenesin as the active ingredient)? Most doctors suggest taking Robitussin five days before and including the day of ovulation for a total of 6 days during your cycle.This helps provide the optimal environment to help the sperm survive and get to where they need to go.If you take Clomid, waiting until the day after the last Clomid pill is taken before starting Robitussin is suggested.
