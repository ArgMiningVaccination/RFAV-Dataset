Your cells constantly send out messages to other parts of your body. These messages from the cells and systems are communicated through your nerves like a self-enclosed internet. Your brain is connected through the spinal cord to this nerve information highway that runs through your entire body. Your spinal column is the structure that supports the nerve pathways. Your body's drive for perfect health is challenged by stresses from psychological and environmental traumas and toxicity. The life force energy of your molecules gets used in reacting to these outside interferences (viruses, chemicals, injuries, etc.). When your energy is blocked or slowed down, your body does not have clear communication between all of its systems, organs and tissues. Chiropractic healing sees symptoms as messages from parts of your body that nerves are suffering from interference in their electrical impulses. How does it work? Accidents, falls, tension, and overwork stress your body and cause irritation to your spinal nerve roots. Just as the electrical system in your home needs occasional maintenance to keep the power flowing, your nervous system needs periodic adjustments to keep your brain's message pathways to your body clear. Chiropractic care focuses on ensuring these signals are working by identifying and correcting areas of nerve interference in your spine. Chiropractic care involves a cross-section of tools and techniques to looks at the whole ecosystem of your body. Looking at your nutritional needs, personal goals, lifestyle changes and environmental factors can help you to enjoy optimum health that your life force energy desires for you. Will Chiropractic help you? If you have a chronic problem with: seasonal allergies, sinus trouble, bronchial conditions, chronic cough, sore throat, hay fever, asthma, fatigue a visit to your chiropractor could help you learn strategies for total recovery. If past injuries or traumas to your body have affected you with: joint pain, limited range of motion in your shoulders, swelling or stiffness in your ankles, knees, hips, wrists or elbows, leg cramps, tingling and numbness, neck or back pain, disc problems, headaches you could improve with chiropractic adjustments to the alignment of your spine. If your body experiences conditions such as: digestive problems, colitis, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, gas, insomnia, anxiety, depression, dizziness (vertigo), poor circulation, bursitis, arthritis, neuralgia, rheumatism, your brain impulses may not be reaching the affected areas of your body without interference. Call Dr. Clarke for a conversation about what you can do to feel better. What is the Spinal Column? Your spine acts as a support structure for the network of nerve pathways carrying messages to and from the tissues, muscles, bones and organs of your body. Beginning at the base of your skull, in your neck, a series of vertebrae, or small bones, are stacked one upon the other to make up your spinal column. Your spinal column ends with your tailbone in the area between where your legs connect to your hips. Your spinal cord, the grand central pathway for all nerve signals to your brain, resides inside the spinal column. Thirty-one pairs of nerves form a message highway going out to parts of your body from openings in each vertebra. When environmental forces affect your spine and the nerves that connect the spinal cord and brain to the other parts of your body, communication slows down. If one of the vertebrae gets slightly out of line, the signals through the nerves are affected. This mis-alignment of one or more vertebrae is called subluxation. Chiropractic techniques re-align the vertebrae to restore free communication through the nerve network. "}
