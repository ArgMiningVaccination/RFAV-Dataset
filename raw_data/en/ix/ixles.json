Our Partners By obtaining further training through the American Fitness Association's approved Barre Training Program at VIDA Fitness, Dona has obtained her General Fitness Instructor Certification through the National Association of Science Medicine This 120 hour plus curriculum and exam additionally certified her to hone in on assisting students at a deeper level with their fitness goals. Dona currently teaches Barre classes at various VIDA Fitness locations throughout the DC area, incorporating fun music and upbeat energy, combined with the continued focus on achieving a deep burn! Dona was trained at reformation fitness to comprehensively lean how to utilize the reformer apparatus and it's unique features in accessing a full body workout. The reformer bed is inspired by the early machinations of Joseph Pilates, who invented different apparatus' to assist soldiers in their rehabilitation process. Today these highly versatile and unique beds provide a low impact - full body workout unlike anything else in the workout world. Dona was trained by the owners of Reformation Fitness, two Balance Body certified coaches, who have a breadth and wealth of knowledge around how to train on the machines. Dona has been working / coaching with Reformation Fitness studio in Capitol Hill for a number of years, and continues to notice the impact between the physical and emotional interconnectedness of health through this inspiring workout. Physical movement and strength training provide tremendous benefits to an individual's health and sense of well-being. Teaching for BarreTech studios, under the tutelage of owner Amy Barnes, showed Dona that physical fitness can be incorporated into one's life, regardless of age, body type and fitness level. Through BarreTech's curriculum, Dona was able to help students achieve improvements in their physical and emotional health. Through her classes, students learned to focus on increased flexibility and strength through a combination of balletic movements, Yoga, Pilates and weight training. Dona's Barre instruction and training has since continued at VIDA Fitness. Mastering movement and rhythms can be a healing and empowering experience. Through her dance experience and teaching at Saffron Dance under the tutelage of owner and artistic director Saphira, Dona had experienced first hand that it was never too early or too late to start incorporating movement and dance into one's life. Through the use of patience and guidance, Dona encouraged students to find their inner strengths, to be bold and to be confident in becoming whomever it is they wanted to be. Though COVID forced the shut down of this wonderful school, Dona hopes to one day find other dance \"homes\" to promote what this wonderful establishment introduced into her health practice. "}
