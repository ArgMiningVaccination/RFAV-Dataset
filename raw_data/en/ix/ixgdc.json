To mark the occasion, we held a variety of celebrations looking back at how the NHS and its staff has saved and transformed so many lives. W e also looked to the future, which is very much centred on much closer working between health and care partners. During 2018/19, we are pleased to say that our work to integrate our services made great strides. In May 2018, the North Cumbria Health and Care System was confirmed by NHS England as part of the next wave of Integrated Care Systems (ICS), putting our area at the forefront of national policy. This has given us the green light to further integrate health and care services across organisational boundaries, making it easier for teams to work together for the benefit of patients and communities. O ne of the ways we are working to join up health and adult social care services in north Cumbri a is in the development of eight Integrated Care Communities (ICCs) to enable closer working, help people to stay well and provide more out of hospital care. The first phase of ICCs aimed to increase the capacity of community teams to keep more people at home and support people to leave hospital sooner. This has already had a significant impact with hundreds of people avoiding a hospital stay. A s part of our system working, we have also been progressing the merger with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (NCUH) which is set to take place in October 2019. We are already working as a joint Board across the two organisations and our teams are working closely together so this next step feels like a natural progression. As part of the joint Board, Professor Robin Talbot is now joint Chair of both Trusts. A t the same time, there has been a significant amount of work to address the future of mental health, learning disability and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). In line with commission ing intentions and in order to improve the quality of services delivered to patients in Cumbria, the Board of Directors agreed in December 2018, that transferring services in north Cumbria to Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW), who are rated as outstanding by the CQC, would provide the best outcome for patients in the long term. T he process in south Cumbria concluded shortly after the year end in April 2019 when it was agreed that services in south Cumbria would transfer to Lancashire C are NHS Foundation Trust (LCFT). The Trust worked with Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group and regional and national bodies to put in place an improvement plan with the support of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW), to ensure t hat critical areas such as CAMHS are fully supported, and to provide a clear road map for services to be transformed in south Cumbria and across the whole of the Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care System footprint. All of the organisations are now working 7 Performance Report Overview The purpose of the Overview is to give the user a short summary that provides them with sufficient information to understand the organisation, its purpose, the key risks to the achievement of its objectives and how it has performed during the year. The O rganisation Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust provides over 60 community and mental health services to a population of half a million people. We employ around 4000 staff and, every year, a fifth of the population use our services. We have been a Foundation Trust since 2007. This means that we are part of the NHS but have a significant amount of freedom in the way we deliver our services. Decision- making is done at a local level, which means we can be more responsive to the needs of the people of C umbria. We have members and governors who are local people that input into how we shape our services. You can find out more about the Trust, its services and how to contact us on the Trust's website: www .cumbriapartnership.nhs.uk Over the last year we have continued on our journey to system working across North Cumbria, this year, work has included a significant programme of development in terms of joint ways of working between our Trust and North Cumbri a University Hospital NHS Trust (NCUH) , whilst also recognising the statutory duties of both Trusts as separate legal entities. This work has included the development of joint meetings, policies and procedures . Further development of joint ways of working across the both Trusts, prior to the merger in October 2019, now feed in to the system governance arrangements. We continue to work with partner organisations to ensure high quality mental health provision across Cumbria and as such mental health, learni ng disability and CAMHS services within south Cumbria will be transferring to Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust (LCFT) and those services in north Cumbria to transfer to Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW) on 1 October 2019. In March 2019 we officially launched our brand new set of values shared across both Trusts and NHS North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group which are: Kindness - Kindness and compassion cost nothing, yet accomplish a great deal Respect - We are respectful to everyone and are open, honest and fair - respect behaviours Ambition - We set goals to achieve the best for our patients, teams, organisation and our partners Collaboration - We are stronger and better working together with and for our patients 9 We are currently focusing on ways in which these values can become more embedded into practice; activities to support this include the review of appraisal documentation to ensure the values are built into discussions with members of staff. We want to bui ld a new integrated health and care system together, using our collective capabilities for a healthier and happier population and w e are committed to the four long term goals we have agreed jointly with our system partners : Working closely with patients, General Practitioners (GPs) and a wide range of other health and social care agencies across Cumbria, including Adult Social Care and the voluntary sector, we deliver commu nity-based healthcare through Care Groups as follows: Integrated Families (intergrated with North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust women's and childrens services) o Children's Community Nursing o Health Visiting o Public Health and Wellbeing Nurses o Allied health professions such as physiotherapy and speech and language therapy o Children Looked After o Community Paediatrics o Children's Audiology Mental Health o Adult Mental Health o Childrens Mental Health (CAMHS o Adult Learning Disability Nursing o Childrens Learning Disability Nursing o Autism Community and Specialist o Community Nursing (e.g. District Nursing) o Community Hospitals 10 o Allied health professions such as physiotherapy and podiatry o Community Dentistry o Palliative Care o Neurology o Physical Health Psychology o Sexual Health o Acquired Brain Injury Team Over recent years we have undertaken an annual self -assessment against NHS Improvement's (NHSI) Well Led Framework which informs our evaluation of our quality governance arrangements. In Quarter 3 we commissioned a peer -review against NHSI's Well Led framework , led by Northumberla nd Tyne and Wear Foundation Trust, which was undertaken between October 2018 and February 2019. The next external review of our quality governance arrangements will take place during 2020. Delivery of improvement actions has been monitored through relevant governance forums and with board level oversight. Further details can be found in the Annual Governance Statement and in the Quality Report. Key risks and associated controls Key risks to the delivery of our objectives and associated controls are set out in our Board Assurance Framework (BAF). The BAF is reviewed on a quarterly basis, with the framing of top strategic risks being reviewed on at least an annual basis, usually during quarter 3. Details of the key risks can be found in the Annual Governanc e Statement. Significant operational and clinical risks Risks are identified, managed and monitored through our governance frameworks, in accordance with the Risk Management Policy and the aligned performance framework. Risk reporting and measurement are actioned through our Outcomes Framework, quality and safety dashboards, and via the risk management information system (Ulysses) - all of which enables a line of sight to risk management performance at al l levels throughout the Trust. Examples of signific ant operational and clinical risks affecting us can be found in the Annual Governance Statement. Statement on going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the coming year. The 2019/20 plan includes receipts of Department of Health and Social Care revenue support loans of \u00a34.8m, the Trust also has \u00a31.3m of revenue support loans due for repayment during 2019/20. The Directors consider it reasonable to expect cash support to be available and for the Trust to continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Directors recognise the significant level of risk within the 2019/20 plan, in particular, the level of internal a nd system CIP's needed to achieve the control total. The Trust is working to merge with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust and is also going to divest its mental health services to Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust and 11 Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. The Trust is working with North Cumbria CCG, key local partners, liaising with wider stakeholders and NHS Improvement as it looks to generate the service and financial efficiencies needed to transform the Cumbrian Health Econom y. After making enquiries, the Directors have adopted a going concern basis in preparing these accounts as they do not intend to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of the NHS Foundation Trust without the transfer of services to another entity, nor do they believe there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Performance Analysis Measuring performance We measure our performance through a mix of key performance indicators and metrics relating to quality, safety, financial performance, and compliance. Board- level performance reports include metrics relating to compliance against the former Monitor risk assessment framework and current NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework (SOF), and also metrics that enable us to monitor our quality governance. This report is now in a joint performance report monitoring the performance of the NCUH and CPFT in a developing System aligned report. Performance is monitored and managed through the Joint Trust Management Board and overseen by the Board Co mmittee , Finance Investment and Performance Committee . We measure our performance against against the core CQC domains of responsive, caring, effective, safe and well led. These are included across the core SOF domains and across the operating plan objectives. Performance during 2018/19 We use the following performance indicators within our Board level performance reports 12 NHS Improvement 's Single Oversight Framework (SOF) targets We have informed our Regulators and Commissioners of our progress against their performance frameworks throughout the year, and have provided them with details of our improvement plans and trajectories for compliance. Internally improvement plans are managed through the Care Group Boards which are as a sub group of the Clinical Management Group, and are closely monitored at Board level through the Finance Investment and Performance Committee . Workforce performance Recruitment and the use of temporary staff We, along with our partners in the Cumbria health and social care system, continue to face significant challenges in the ability to recruit people into Cumbria with the right skills and experience to fill vacancies i n our specialist roles. We continue to work together with our local partners and with leaders in the regional major transformation programmes to find workable solutions to this challenging problem. Throughout the year we have worked collaboratively with No rth Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (NCUH) on a number of attraction initiatives. Examples include: Attendance at various national recruitment fayres with partners including attendance at the B ritish Medical Journal careers fair, 20 + university nursing events and a number of nurse j ob fai rs including various Health Service Journal events MeasureNational StandardLatest National average YTD (to Feb-19 to 16/17Compared to 17/18 A&E% of patients who waits 4 hours A&E (Type 3 only)95% 98.9%* 54.4% People with common mental health conditions referred to the programme will be treated within 6 weeks of 75% 89.4% 58.9% 73.6% 72.3% 99.7% People with common mental health conditions referred to the programme will be treated within 18 weeks of 95% 98.7% 99.0% 99.2% 99.7% 100.0% % of patients Referral to Treatment92% 87.0% 86.0% 97.2% 90.8% 96.3% % of patients receiving weeks of referral99% 97.7% 98.5% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% EIPPeople experiencing a first episode of psychosis treated with a NICE approved care package within two weeks of 50% 76.70% 55.60% timesTrust actuals RAG comparisons Comparisons key:Same as or better than Slightly worse than (within 2%) 13 Local recruitment events Use of social media t o promote specialist vacancies International recruitment for clinical posts (including successful trips to Poland f or nurses and India for doctors) On-site Collaborative Nurse/Midwife and Paramedic Recruitment Days, held in conjunction with the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust and University of Cumbria. Joint BMJ Adverts We have actively sought to recruit into v acant posts during the year, but where vacancies exist we ensure safe staffing levels by first looking to use bank staff, before approaching temporary recruitment agencies. Since April 2018 our recruitment agency spend and management has been managed by the NCUH in -house team. This team's work has been recognised by NHSI who described the team's work as a 'national exemplar' and the team has recently been nominated for a HPMA award. During 2018/19 we have delivered agency spend savings of \u00a3616k, with NC UH delivering a saving of \u00a32.32 million. Although saving money and delivering efficiencies is a priority processes are committed to patient safety improvements and the team has worked closely with NHS Counter -Fraud to advise on reference and time- sheeting security. The booking of agency worker s is now linked to the requirement to action permenant or fixed term recruitment to ensure that the most cost -effective staffing solution is identified. Sickness absence Sickness absence is reported at B oard level on a monthly basis. Our sickness absence level has been above our internal target level of 4% throughout the year. Sickness absence rates are consistently higher in clinical roles than in non- clinical roles; whilst long term sickness absence accounts for t he majority of the overall days lost through sickness. Anxiety/stress/depression or other psychiatric illness is the top reason for sickness absence. We have an Atte ndance Management policy and a number of programmes in place to support staff. Staff survey The response rate for the 2018 NHS staff survey was high, 49% compared to a national average of 41%. The results from the Staff Survey show that staff engagement is the same as similar Trusts (7.0); staff recommendation of the Trust as a place to receive treatment is slightly higher than average (66.4%) and recommendation as a place to work is lower than average (57.9%). You can find further details about the staff survey results, and other ways we engage with our staff, in the Staff Report. 14 Training Performance against our mandatory training programmes is managed and monitored by the Board and sub- Committee s. We set ou rselves a target of achieving 85% compliance against our Tier 1 mandatory training which is training that is mandatory for all staff. Compliance against this target is measured and reported upon on a monthly basis. We achieved above the 85% target co nsistenly month on month with comp liance increasing from a rate of 85.9% in April 18 to 90.9% at the end of February 19. Appraisals We have a values based approach to appraisal's supported through training for managers which aims to ensure: All staff to have a meaningful appraisal that is linked to our values and translates the work of the Trust to individual objectives All staff to ha ve a personal development plan (PDP) Supporting performance thoug h a coaching culture We have an appraisal window which links with the business planning cycle to ensure objectives are aligned to our priorities and staff can understand how they are contributing. We increased our target s for all staff to have an appraisal within the last 12 months from 80% to 85% and achieved 82% in year. Delivery of 2018/19 Annual Business Plan Our 2018 /19 Annual Business Plan, which was developed in accordance with NHS Improvement's requirements was produced as a joint plan with North Cumbria University Hospital s NHS Trust. The Board received quarterly updates on delivery against the plan, the majority of the business plan objectives are on target. The few that were not were largely as a result of slippages outside of our direct control, and will continue into the next financial year. Performance against the 2018/18 plan is summarised as follows : Care Group / Support Service Red Amber Green/ Complete Not Started / no mi lestones to complete Grand total Children and Families 0 2 2 1 5 Community 1 3 3 0 7 Medicine 0 3 0 6 9 Mental Health Care Group 0 1 2 0 3 Surgery 0 2 1 0 3 Support Services 1 4 8 0 13 Grand total 2 15 16 7 40 15 Financial performance The financial climate continued to be challenging during 2018/19. Our net deficit for the year (excluding impairments, donation and transfer by absorption) was \u00a35.0m against a control total of \u00a32.1m, this was as a result of an adjustment made under the loc al risk sharing arrangement of \u00a35.4m. Before making this adjustment we would have achieved a surplus of \u00a32.5m. The financial challenge will continue during 2019/ 20 and for the foreseeable future. This is common to all health and social care partners. We have accepted NHSI's control total for 2019/20 and plan to incur an income and expenditure breakeven position. Achievement of this plan and delivery of sustainable services in the long term will be challenging and will require significant efficiencies fr om both internal programmes and system wide transformational change. In recent years we have utilised revenue support loans from the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to fund its operating deficits. Further such loans will be required until w e are able to stabilise our financial position. A summary of 2018/19 actual and 2019/20 plan is set out below. \u00a3 million 2018/19 Actual 2019/20 Plan Income & expenditure Income 160.4 165.5 Operating expenditure 165.6 163.3 EBITDA (5.2) 2.2 Depreciation, dividend & interest 1.8 2.2 Net surplus/(deficit) before exceptional items (7.0) 0.0 Exceptional items 0.6 0.0 Net surplus/(deficit) (7.6) 0.0 Capital expenditure 7.0 5.5 Closing cash balance 7.2 3.2 Revenue support loan balance 4.1 8.9 Details of our financial performance for 2018/19 are set out in the annual accounts that accompany this Annual Report. Environmental considerations We are committed to being an environmentally friendly and socially responsible organisation and recognises that some of our activities can have a significant impact on the environment. We continue to take action to ensure these activities are managed 16 Directors' Report NHS Improvement's Well -Led Framework As an NHS Foundation Trust, we are required to comply with the arrangements set out by our independent regulator, NHS Improvement (NHSI), in Monitor's NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance (2010, revised 2014). The Code of Governance requires us to have a comprehensive framework in place to ensure we are managed and governed properly. We strive to comply with the provisions of the Code and will continue to observe the spirit of the Code in everything we do. Our business is managed by the Board of Direct ors (the Board), which exercises all the powers of the Trust subject to any contrary provisions of the National Health Service Act 2006 and Health and Social Care Act 2012. The Board is responsible for approving the Annual Report and Accounts. In preparing the Annual Plan, they take into account the views of the Governors Council which contains information about the Trust's forward planning. The Board of Directors gives specific attention to: Active monitoring of quality indicators Assurance based on evidence Contact with frontline services Formal consideration of our compliance with NHSI's Well Led Framework and Code of Governance The Quality Report describes our quality plans in more detail and outlines our achievement of quality over a number of specif ic areas. You can find out more about our quality governance, the challenges encountered and action taken during 2018/19 in the Annual Governance Statement. The balance between Executive and Non- Executive Directors on the Board remains in line with the Code of Governance for NHS Foundation Trusts and with our Standing Orders. There were a number of changes to Board membership during the year which can be found in the Remuneration Report. You can find out more about the background and experience of all individual Board members as at 31 March 2019 later in this report. All NEDs, the Chief Executive and a maximum of six other Executive Directors were able to exercise one full vote in 2018/19. The Chair has a second, casting vote on occasions where dec isions are tied. The Board meets formally in public at least every quarter and monthly in private. There were no extra- ordinary meetings of the Board held during the year in addition to scheduled 19 meetings. A summary of decisions made by the Board is provi ded at each public Board of Directors meeting. The Board is responsible for: Exercising powers and the performance of the Trust Providing active leadership of the Trust within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed Compliance with the NHS Provider Licence issued by NHSI, the sector regulator for health services in England Compliance with the Trust's Constitution Providing high quality and safe healthcare services, education, training and research Implementing effective governance measures Ensuring the Trust exercises its functions effectively, efficiently and economically Setting the Trust's vision, values and standards of conduct and ensuring that its obligations to its Members, service users and other st akeholders are understood and met Setting Trust policy Setting strategy for service development and improvement Preparing a statement of accounts for each financial year Managing performance. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for it that is de tailed within our Standing Orders and the Reservation and Delegation of Powers , and St anding Financial Instructions. This clarifies which type of document requires approval by the Board and which can be approved and executed by executive management , under a delegated authority. The Board may also delegate executive powers to Committee s or through the Chief Executive to individual officers. To undertake detailed consideration of specific areas of operation, the Board utilised the following Committee s thro ughout the reporting period: Audit & Risk (A&R) Committee Quality and Safety (Q&S) Committee Finance, Investment and Performance (FIP) Committee Charitable Funds Committee Remuneration Committee All NEDs are members of at least one Board level Committee . Executive Directors' involvement in Board level Committee s relates to their particular operational responsibilities. As a unitary board, all Executive and NEDs have joint responsibility for every decision of the Board and share the same liability. This does not impact upon the particular responsibilities of the Chief Executive as Accountable Officer to Parliament, for ensuring that the Trust operates consistently within national policy and public service values. 20 All Directors have responsibility for the preparation of the financial statements. The Directors consider whether the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for service users, regulators and stakeholders to asses s our performance, business model and strategy. As part of the evolution of the N orth Cumbria Integrated Health and Care System, all Executive Directors have responsibility for both the Trust and NCUH. During the year three of our seven N on-Executive Directors (N EDs) held appointments in both T rusts . In April 2019 a joint Chair was appointed to both Trusts, taking the current number of NEDs with responsibilities for both Trusts to four. Formal confirmation has been received from NHSI that 'cross -direct orships' do not compromise independence as conflicts should be minim al as the interests of the two T rusts should in most cases align. All NEDs are therefore considered to be independent in character and judgement and have no other cross directorships or s ignificant links which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgements. Arrangements are in place to manage any potential conflicts associated with 'joint' NED appointments. The Chair had no other significant commitment during the year and therefore there was no requirement to report on this issue to the Governors Council. You can find out more about our collaborative working with NCUH in the Annual Governance Statement section of this annual report. All Directors on the Boar d and the Lead Governor on the Governors Council are required to meet the 'fit and proper persons' test as described in the NHS Provider Licence issued by NHSI. You can view the updated Register of Board of Director Interests on our website https://www.cumbriapartnership.nhs.uk/the- trust/publications/declarations -of-interest Table 3.1 shows members of the Board, their roles and attendance at Board and Governors Council general meetings during the year. Regular attendance at meetings of the Governors Council provides the opportunity for members of the Board to gain an understanding of the views of governors and m embers. The Board and Governors Council undertake a programme of joint visits to Trust services. T his programme enables NEDs and g overnors to listen to the views of staff and observe service delivery. The Chair is responsible for ensuring that NEDs have the necessary skill set and experience. The C hief Executive is responsible for the performance appraisals of Executive Directors. The performance of the Chief Executive and NEDs is reviewed by the Chair, and the performance of the Chair is reviewed by a combination of the NEDs, governors and Executiv e Directors. The Senior Independent Director leads the Chair process with the arrangements agreed by the Governors Council. All NED vacancies are managed by the Governors Council 's Nominations Committee to ensure the Board has the necessary skills and experience required and that the Board is well balanced. The terms of office for both Chair and NEDs is reviewed regularly to ensure succession planning is adequate and effective. 21 All Executive Director positions, covering issues of recruitment, accountabil ity and performance, are managed by the Chief Executive in line with the Trust's organisational policies. The current appointment terms of Non- Executive Directors, and the contract start dates of Executive Directors and their remuneration can be found in t he Remuneration Report . The appointment of a NED may be terminated in line with guidance issued by our regulator NHSI. The accounting policies for pensions and other retirement benefits are set out in note 1.8 to the accounts.

Income Cost allocation and charging As a Public Sector Information Holder and where appropriate in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (Fees and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations the Trust levies charges for the provision of information. The charges levied are compliant with the Re- Use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005. We have complied with the costs allocation and charging requirements set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance. Political or charitable donations We have not made any political or charitable donations during 2018/19. Better payment practice code In July 2015, the Trust renewed its signatory to the Prompt Payment Code. The Prompt Payment Code sets standards for payment practices and best practice and is administered by the Chartered Institute of Credit Management. Compliance with the principles of the code is monitored and enforced by the Prompt Payment Code Compliance Board. The Code covers prompt payment, as well as wider payment procedures. As a signatory of the code, the Trust undertakes to pay suppliers on time and in accordance with agreed terms; to give clear guidanc e to suppliers advising them promptly if there is any reason why an invoice will not be paid to the agreed terms; and to encourage good practice. During the year, the Trust was not required to pay any interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (I nterest) Act 1998. Quality governance During the year we have built upon the work described in previous years' annual reports to improve and integrate our governance arrangements with NCUH. This has included refreshing our meetings structures and further developing our quality and safety dashboards so that our managers have access to virtually real -time risk and safety related information which aids effective clinical and quality governance. Our 2018/19 self -assessment against the Well Led framework com menced March 2019 and is due to be approved by the Board in June 2019. During the year a Well Led 'peer 32 review' by Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW) also took place. We are currently working on implementing recommendations from that r eview. Delivery of improvement actions will be monitored through relevant governance forums, with board level oversight of many acti ons through the Quality and Safety Committee and Finance Investment and Performance Committee . Further details on how w had regard for NHSI's Well Led framework can be found in the Annual Governance Statement. 2018/19 is 'year 3' of the 3- year well led review cycle agreed by Board in 2016 during which an external well led assessment was to be undertaken. The Well Led Peer review by NTW partially addresses this, however a full external review is required. This is expected will take place later in 2019/20. The 2018/19 internal audit programme considered aspects of quality governance such as risk management, board assurance framework, governance framework, policy management and safety alerts, all of which are intrinsic to the well led framework. Progress with improvement actions identified from audits are monitored by the Audit and Risk Committee . During 2018/19, as part of alignment and integration with NCUH a joint performance management framework was introduced. Throughout 2018/19 the Board received quarterly updates on progress against the 2018/19 annual business plan, which was a joint plan wit h NCUH. The Board also received integrated performance reports on a monthly basis, which compared and analysed information relating workforce, finance and quality. Further details on how the performance management framework and our performance during the year can be found in the Performance Report. Throughout the year we have reported compliance against NHSI's SOF in accordance with NHSI's reporting requirements. There have been no exceptions to report during the year. We meet with NHSI on a quarterly basis to review performance and quality. You can find out more about our quality governance in the Annual Governance Statement. Details of our performance in relation to key health targets, our financial position, use of resources, achievement of CQUIN (Com missioning for Quality and Innovation) and other locally agreed targets, and progress against our business plan objectives for 2018/19 can be found in the Performance Report. Details of how we are improving information for patients and carers and how we ha ndle complaints, and also how we have responded to patient and staff surveys can be found in the Report. The Board agreed the 2017/18 annual report, including annual accounts and quality report at its meeting in May 2018. The 2017/18 annual report was submitted to NHSI and laid before Parliament within the required timeframes, and was presented to Members and the general public at our Annual Members Meeting in September 2018. There are no material inconsistencies between our Annual Governance Statement , the corporate governance statement, the Quality Report and Annual Report, reports arising 33 from CQC planned and responsive reviews , and action plans we have developed in response to the CQC's reports. In November 2017 we underwent a formal Well Led inspection by the CQC. The report of that inspection was published by the CQC in January 2018. All of the services inspected were assessed as 'Good' for Caring. Overall we were rated as Requiring Improvement. Immediately following the inspection we implemented an improvement plan to respond to the issues raised by the CQC, which included 22 must -do actions and 51 highly recommended actions to improve our quality governance arrangements. One of the must - do actions related to the Well Led key line of enquiry. The Board received regular updates on progress against these actions throughout the year. The CQC will be undertaking their next Well Led inspection of the Trust in June 2019. In the Quality Report, you can find out more about CQC inspections, details of any new or significantly revised services, and how we have used information from internal and external sources, such as complaints, patient and staff surveys, and inspection reports, to improve our services. Strategic partnerships and integrated system -wide care We are a partner in the two major transformation programmes covering the Cumbria geographical footprint: Better Care Together in the south of the county; and the North Cumbria Integrated Health and Care System (IHCS). T hroughout 2018/19 we have worked with our partners on the development of plans for the Cumbria health economy. As part of plans developed during 2016/17 and 2017/18, on 1 April 2018 some of our community -based services operating in south Cumbria transferred to University Hospitals Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. In collaboration with our system partners and communities, Integrated Care Communities (ICCs) were introduced in Quarter 2 of 2018/19. ICCs see the existing primary, community health and care pr actitioners working together with their local communities as an integrated team to reduce duplication, build healthier communities and offer more care closer to home. The ICCs have delivered benefits in removing or reducing the number of overnight beds in some of our community hospitals and avoiding admissions to hospital enabling improved and different ways for patients to be cared for at home. Through the ICCs, and in collaboration with local Alliance groups, we have implemented changes to services deliv ered from our community hospitals, reducing or removing inpatient beds in accordance with decisions made by North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group in April 2018 following public consultation. During the latter part of Quarter 4 of 2017/18 our commiss ioners confirmed changes would be needed to our countywide mental health, learning disability and children and adolescent mental health services, which are to be delivered into the IHCSs covering north and s outh Cumbria. Throughout 2018/19 we have worked with our commissioners to improve the quality of these services and to ensure these changes happen safely and in the best interests of patients and staff. From 1 October 2019 these services in north Cumbria will 34 be delivered by Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and these services in south Cumbria will be delivered by Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust. Following these changes we will continue to deliver some services countywide, such as children's services, neurology and dental services. As referred to earlier, all Executive Directors and four Non- Executive Directors hold posts and have responsibilities across both CPFT and NCUH. 2018/19 has seen the alignment and integration of governance arrangements and of many clinical an d support services across both T rusts. Throughout all these changes to Board level leadership and governance, legal advice has been sought to ensure that statutory requirements continue to be met in terms of Accountable Officer responsibilities and requirements for us as a Foundation Trust and NCUH as an NHS Trust. To further cement our integrated working, in February 2019 the Organisational Form Transaction strategic case was approved by NHSI for both Trusts to merge into a single organisation. At the time of writing the Full Business Case for this transaction (which technically is an acquisition of NCUH by CPFT) is under preparation and is due to be formally agreed by the Board and submitted to NHSI by the end of June 2019. Engagement on the name of the new Trust h as taken place with our staff, members, governors, key stakeholders and the public. Subject to formal approvals from NHS Improvement, it is expected that the new Trust will be authorised as from 1 October 2019. The name of the T rust will be confirmed as pa rt of the authorisation process. We have worked with the Governors Council to consider the impacts of the merger and transfer of mental health, learning disability and children and adolescent mental health services on our C onstitution and composition of the Governors Council. Proposals have been agreed by Governors Council and are due to be approved by the Board in May 2019. Changes will take effect upon authorisation of the new Trust. We are a key partner in the System Leadership Board (SLB), working with system partners to develop and implement strategic transformation plans across the North Cumbria IHCS . Our Executive and Non- Executive Directors represent us at SLB meetings, although strategic decisions continue to require approv al by our Board. Consultation has begun on developing a system -wide clinical strategy, on which we will inform, engage, involve and where appropriate, consult with internal and external stakeholders on our service improvement and transformation plans. This includes local g roups and third sector organisations, as well as the Local Authority's Health Scrutiny Committee . We will also continue to hear patient and staff stories at our Board meetings to ensure that the patient voice is at the heart of everything we do. Creating local partnerships Over the course of the year we have participated in a number of events and community conversations with the population of Cumbria and Morecambe Bay to help ensure that the NHS is aware of local health priorities and can work to support them where possible. We 35 have also engaged with, and provided regular updates to, the Local Authority 's Health Scrutiny Committee on merger plans and transfer of mental health, learning disabilities and children and adolescent mental health services . Statement as to Disclosure to auditors (s418) The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Trust's auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Trust's auditors are aware of that information. Income disclosures required by Section 43(2A) of the N HS Act 2006 Provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England During 2018/19, income from the provision of goods and services for the purpose of health services in England was greater than the income from the provision of g oods and services for other purposes. Other income Other income is 1.0% of total income in 2018/19 (0.46% 2017/18) and as such, has no material impact on the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England . During the year we have not generated additional income by levying fees and charges for its services where the full cost of providing those services exceeds \u00a31 million or where the income generated has not been material to the accounts . 36 Remuneration Report Section One - Annual statement on remuneration The purpose of the Board's Remuneration Committee is to develop, apply and monitor the policy on Executive terms, conditions and remuneration. The aim is to ensure that there is a transparent process for determining pay for the Chief Executive and other Executive Directors.

The remit covers salary (including any performance- related elements/bonuses or additional payments), benefits (e.g. lease cars, pensions) and contracted terms of employment (e.g. service contracts, terminations).

Both Trusts also continued the joint consultation process to develop and agree workforce related policies across both Trusts to ensure consistency in how staff are treated across both organisations. The first policy agreed was the Joint Organisational Change Policy and subsequently all of the main workforce related policies have been developed and agreed including Absence Management, Disciplinary, Grievance and Pay Protection. A ll revised policies went through local Equality Impact Assessment processes, and the HR team work in conjunction with the occupational health service and line managers to ensure any reasonable adjustments which are required to either sustain a staff member in post, or assist a return to work are put in place where appropriate as quickly as possible. 51 We continue to operate an equal opportunities policy and ha ve maintained our Disability Confident status which replaced the Two Ticks Positive Action Scheme in 2016. We have been awarded level 2 Disability Confident - Employer status and are committed to ensuring we meet the requirements of the scheme which includes continuing to support candidates that identify themselves as having a disability apply for posts under the guaranteed interview scheme. During the financial year 201 8/19 staff consultation, engagement and involvement has continued through the well -established and well attended monthly Joint Partnership Forum. This is a joint forum which represents both Trusts. Significant staff consultation and engagement has been targeted around the integration of services across both Trusts with the first phase commencing in 2018/ 19 in relation to support services. Integration of other services, including clinical services, w ill continue throughout 2019. Trade Union facility t ime We are currently working closely with staff representatives on the Joint Partnership Forum to collate and publish the data required under the regulations . Staff engagement Our core objective is to embed the right culture and make the organisation a great pl ace to work. Staff engagement is essential because we know that when staff are happy and fully engaged they provide the best possible care for our patients. 'This is Us' is our approach to staff engagement. Staff have the opportunity to meet with the CEO each quarter, in a variety of locations, to hear about our plans, raise any concerns and ask questions. The annual business plan and priorities are shared at the start of the financial year and cascaded to individuals through 'This is me', values based appraisal. Staff are also kept informed through a weekly CEO Blog, a newly developed staff intranet portal, email and 'Trust Talk' printed magazine. NHS Staff Survey The NHS Staff Survey is the largest survey of staff opinion in the UK; it is carried out annually to gather the views on staff experience at work in ten key indicators. The survey is administered electronically and completely anonymous. Indicators are meas ured on a scale of 10 and we are benchmarked against the average score of other similar t rusts. The response rate for the 2018 NHS staff survey was high, 49% compared to a national average of 41%. The scores for each indicator, together with comparison ag ainst the average for combined mental health / Learning disability and community t rusts are presented in the table below: 52 Indicators 2018/19 2017/18 2016/17 Trust Average Trust Average Trust Average Equality, diversity and inclusion 9.2 9.2 9.4 9.2 9.3 9.2 Health and wellbeing 5.9 6.1 6.1 6.1 5.9 6.2 Immediate managers 7.1 7.2 7.2 7.1 6.9 7.1 Morale 6.2 6.2 x x x x Quality of appraisals 5.5 5.5 5.7 5.4 5.3 5.4 Quality of care 7.2 7.4 7.5 7.4 7.4 7.5 Safe environment - bullying and harassment 8.2 8.2 8.3 8.3 7.7 8.2 Safe environment - violence 9.6 9.5 9.5 9.5 9.4 9.5 Safety culture 6.7 6.8 6.7 6.7 6.5 6.7 Staff engagement 7.0 7.0 7.1 7.0 7.1 7.0 The results from the Staff Survey show that staff eng agement is the same as similar t rusts (7.0); staff recommendation of the Trust as a place to receive treatment is slightly higher than average (66.4%) and recommendation as a place to work is lower than average (57.9%). Indicators for safe environment from violence and bullying and harassment , staff morale, equality and diversity and quality of appraisal are average or above av erage when compared to similar t rusts. The survey shows that staff feel safe to speak out and do not feel discriminated against at work. They receive more training than similar t rusts and report high rates of annual appraisal with quality of appraisal similar to other trusts. We benchmarked below average in the health and wellbeing, immediate management, quality of care and safety culture indicators. Staff have particularly highlighted their lack of involvement in decision making and inability to undertake improvements in their area of work. They also express uncertainty in who the senior managers are and lack of communication. They do not feel the organisation takes positive action on health and wellbeing. Since the last NHS staff survey we have achieved the bronze Health and Wellbeing at Work award which recognises the achievements of managers and health advocates in promoting health and supporting staff wellbeing. 23 staff health advocates delivered a twelve month campaign of health promotional activities based on the results of a staff health needs assessment, including awareness of enhancing sleep and reducing alcohol consumption. We changed our occupational health service provider and now all staff and their families have access to an employee assist programme. Closer working and integr ation with NCUH over the past 12 months has brought about change and aligned governance arrangements . Local pulse surveys, which monitor staff engagement throughout the year, indicate that clarity and work relationships have potential to impact on staff engagement. 53 Future Priorities and Targets The results of the NHS Staff survey are reviewed in light of feedback from pulse surveys and exit interviews and themes from issues raised with the Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. These themes inform our organisation al development plan and initiatives. In 2019/20 we will continue to support staff health and wellbeing and continue to work towards achieving the silver Health and Wellbeing at work award. Our other priorities include: Enhancing opportunities for more fl exible working. Whilst survey results show that opportunities for flexible working are improving, they are still below average when compared to other t rusts. An Engaging for Improvement project will see HR and staff working together to explore options for flexible workin g and better work life balance. Opportunities for flexible working - NHS staff survey 2018 2015 2016 and positive behaviours at work. Staff have been involved in the development of a new set of organisational values. These values and a supporting behaviours framework was launched in April 2019 and forms the basis of a new appraisal process. Personal experience of harassment, bullying or abuse at work from managers - NHS staff survey 2018 2015 2016 or Maintain a focus on communication This will be part icularly important through 2019/ 20 as we progress towards a merged organisation with NCUH. We will build on the 'This is Us' engagement programme and development of the staff intranet portal. Staff feedback will continue to be monitored through quarterly pulse checks and progress reported to the Quality and Safety Committee , a sub -Committee of the Board of Directors .

This duty is also included within the Trust Constitution at section 6.4. In order to ensure governors are equipped with the skills and knowledge they require to fulfil the ir role, governors are provided with training and development opportunities throughout their tenure . The training and development programme continues to be adapted to meet the needs of the governors. Communications between the Board of Di rectors, Governor s Council and m embers The Board of Directors (t he Board) and Governors Council (GC) work closely together. All members of the Board have an open invitation to attend the GC meetings. Execut ive and Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) are invited to make formal presentations at these meetings ( 6 meetings in year) for the purpose of obtaining information on the Trust's performance of its functions and the Directors' performance of their duties and to hear the views of the governors, members and the public. There are also adhoc meetings and discussions between individual B oard members and governors on specific subjects of interest . The Senior Independent Director (SID) attends the GC meeting to listen to their views in order to help develop a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of governors. The SID also attends/chairs the Nominations Committee when considering the Chair appraisal or Chair appointment. The Chair ensures that the views of governors and members are communicated to the Board as a whole through the Lead Governor sitting at the Board table and the Executive and Non- Executive Directors attending the GC meetings. At Board meetings the Lead Governor is able t o ask questions of Non- Executive and Executives Directors throughout the meeting and can escalate any good practice or concerns raised by the GC or members.

In the event of any unresolved dispute between the Governors Council and the Board of Directors, the Chair will: Take such steps as the Chair considers appropriate to try to reach a common and clear understanding of t he issues in dispute Consider whether independent advice will help to resolve the dispute and if appropriate arrange for independent advice to be made av ailable to the Foundation Trust If the dispute continues to be unresolved, ensure that an appropriate record of it is made in the minutes of a m eeting of the Governors Council and in the minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors. Ensures that an appropriate record of any unresolved dispute is made in our annual report for the relevant period including a summary of the issues in dispute and the action taken by the Board and the GC to attempt to resolve the dispute. 71 Nominations Committee Report The Nominations Committee is a subCommittee of the Governors Council and it s primary function is to ensure that the Board includes an appropriate number of independent, skilled, experienced and effective NEDs. The Committee must also ensure that the levels of remuneration for the Chair and other NEDs reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles. The Committee must work to ensure that appointments to the Board: Are made on merit, against objective criteria Meet the fit and proper persons test described in the NHS Provider Licence issued by NHS Improvement Have due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board and the requirements of the Trust, and that appointees have enough time available to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The Committee should satisfy itself that plans are in place for orderly succession for Non - Executive appointments , including the Chair, to the B oard and that the Board maintains an appropriate balance of skills and experience. Professor Robin Talbot, Chair is the Chair of the Committee . The Vice Chair is t he Senior Independent Director (SID) Heike Horsburgh, Non- Executive Director. The SID is invited to attend when considering the Chair's appraisal and chairs the meeting when considering the Chair's appointment. The Committee membership includes three Governors: Jane Smith (Staff Governor Allerdale and Copeland/Lead Governor), Linda Radcliffe (Public Governor Allerdale) and Keith Amey (Public Governor Copeland/Deputy Lead Governor ). There are two Governors in reserve; Jacqueline Nicol, Public Governor Eden and Elizabeth Freeman, Public Governor Carlisle. The Committee , met eight times during the year to consider the following areas : Board succession planning NED appointments Chair appointment Amendments to the process for appointing/reappointing the Chair and NEDs Remuneration review No Directors were invited to attend the Committee in the ye ar. Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) A ppointment The Committee considered Non- Executive Director appointments in line with the approved process for appointment/reappointment of the Chair and NEDs. In April 2018 the Committee considered the need to recruit t wo vacant NED positions on the Board together with two Associate Directors which aimed to support succession planning working across 72 to both the Trust and North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (NCUH) . Gina Tiller, Chair of NCUH was involved in the s hortlisting of the Associate NED posts but following a recruitment campaign, no candidates were shortlisted. The Committee undertook the recruitment process in line with the agreed procedure and identified preferred candidates for the NED positions which were recommended to the Governors Council meeting on 5 July 2018. The GC unanimously approved the appointments of Malcolm Cook and G eorge Liston, for 2 years to 31 July 2020. Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) Re -appointment In November 2018, the Committee considered the re- appointment of Heike Horsburgh for 1 year to the 31 January 2020. The Governors Council approved the extension. Chair in Common Appointment The recruitment process was a joint process with NHS Improvement (NHSI) who are the responsible body for recruiting Non- Executive Directors, including Chairs, to NHS Trusts. The vac ancy arose because Gina Tiller was retiring as Chair of NCUH with effect from 31 March 2019. As part of the integration agenda in North Cumbria, the t rusts are in the process of forming a single NHS provider organisation. The post of Chair in Common leads both Boards and the Governors Council of our Trust to ensure the trusts are guided by a shared ambition to transform services and improve outcomes for local communities that we serve. The Chair plays a significant role in designing and developing the architecture for the integrated care system. The matter of independence relating to the appointment of a Chair in Common for our Trust and NCUH was explored and agreed with NHSI. Whilst the Trust's SID chaired the Nominations Committee to agree the recruitment process for the appointment in conjunction with NHSI, it was agreed that the SID would not be involved in the interviews. The interview process was chaired by NHSI and included an independent panel member together with members of the Nominations Committee. The Committee undertook the recruitment process in line with the agreed procedure and recommended the preferred candidate as Professor Robin Talbot for the appointment for 2 years to 31 March 2021 with a r emuneration of \u00a350,901 per annum which will be paid 50/50 by both t rusts. The Governors Council approved the appointment on 21 February 2019. Non-Executive Director Remuneration Review The Committee undertook a review of NED remuneration during the year and recommended that no changes should be made to the existing remuneration levels. The Committee agreed to undertake a further review as part of the potential merger business case work or if not then, within 12 months. 73 Membership Report What is membership? All Foundation Trusts have a duty to engage with their local communities and encourage local people to become Mem bers and to take steps to ensure that their membership is representative of the communities they serve. We are committed to an engaged and vibrant membership community. Anyone who lives in the area or who works for us , and is 14 years or older, can apply to become a m ember (exclusions apply as detailed in our Constitution).

Membership Engagement Strategy Our ambition is to have a membership base which is engaged and actively involved in co-producing future service desig n and delivery, reflective of the needs of patients and the local community. This means our focus is less on recruiting members and more on engaging with them. Our vision: We want to build a new integrated health and care system together, using our collective capabilities for a healthier and happier population. In April 2019 we launched our brand new set of values shared across our Trust, North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group, and North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust. This signals a clear op portunity for real engagement with our members in communities, our patients and staff. The Governors Council has a duty to represent the interests of the members of the Trust as a whole and the interests of the public and feed back to their communities. Our strategy set out the ways in which the Governors Council and the Trust should engage with our membership during 2018 which will be refreshed in 2019 to Cumbria Population at 31 March 2019 % of Population 75 support governors engaging with members and the public to contribute to coproduction in our developi ng integration health and care system. We have over 10,000 public Members, of which currently one third is active. We aim to have as many actively participating members as possible and with this in mind there is a drive to improve engagement. Details of e ngagement this year can be found in the Governors Council Report. Membership monitoring We need to ensure proportional representation of members from our local population in Cumbria. The target in 2018/19 was to maintain 2% of the population of Cumbria as Members, however this was not achieved and is currently 1.8%. A new 'beinvolved' membership campaign was launched at the joint Annual meeting in September 2018 to increase engagement of members and the public on coproduction and the integration of health and care systems in Cumbria. The Board monitors the level and effectiveness of membership engagement through the presentation of the GC activity report on a quarterly basis by the Lead Governor. There are no specific recruitment plans in place to increase the numbers of members in Lancashire and North East of England other than through the general communication routes mentioned above. Further consideration will be given as part of the strategy refresh.

The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and improvement capability (well -led) Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or s uspected breach of its licence. Segmentation This segmentation informati on is the Trust's position at 31 March 2019. Current sementation information for NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has been placed in segment 2, which is defined as 'providers offered targeted support'. Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here.

I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS foundation trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realis ed, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts . Capacity to handle risk and risk management arrangements The Chief Executive has overall accountability for risk management and discharges that duty through the Executive Team and their respective portfolios. During 2018/19 we have worked increasing ly collaboratively with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (NCUH) and together we have introduced shared governance and leadership structures across all of our services. Senior clinical leaders are in place throughout each of our care groups. They are responsible for driving improvements to quality and safety, and actively support staff in the identification and management of identified risks. Care groups are supported by staff within Corporate and Support Service teams who are specialists in vari ous aspects of risk management, and who are a central resource for training, advice and guidance. During the year we have integrated most of our support service teams with those in NCUH and have aligned our systems and processes so that, collectively, our Corporate and Support Service teams provide support across both Trusts. A 'best of both' principle was adopted in the work to refresh and align our quality governance, clinical risk management and leadership frameworks to ensure good practice in both Tr usts formed the basis of our aligned arrangements to identify, manage, escalate 79 and report risks, as appropriate to the scale and nature of the risk. The Board of Directors (the Board) has line of sight to the management of significant operational and strategic risks through the Board Assurance Framework and through the functioning of its Committee and governance frameworks. Risk management is part of our training programme. In addition to subject -specific training and core skills training, which make up the overall training programme, we deliver risk management training for team leaders, which covers the essentials of risk management. This includes learning from incidents and complaints through appropriate level investigations, and duties as a manager under health and safety law. Policies and procedures to support and enable risk management are available to all staff on our intranet site. We benefit from good practice through a range of learning and improvement mechanisms, including: Robust investigation processes Peer review Clinical audits Professional and personal development The application of evidence- based practice Quality improvement tools, such as the Cumbria Production System Investigation of complaints, incidents and near misses is overseen by our System Executive Chief Nurse. Quality, safety and performance matters are cascaded and escalated through governance frameworks. Improving the quality of care and safety are the drivi ng principles of our quality governance arrangements. The Risk and Control Framework Board Membership There were a number of changes to Board membership during the year. Substantive appointments were made to the System Executive Chief Nurse, Executive Director of Workforce & Organisational Development, Executive Chief Operating Officer Officer, Executive Medical Director and E xecutive Director of Strategy. All Executive Directors have the remit across both Trusts. An Interim Executive Director of Mental Health, Learning Disabilities and CAMHS (non- voting Director) was also appointed during the year to manage the transition of mental health, learning disabilities and CAMHS services to alternative providers. Two Non- Executive Directors were appointed into vacant posts and have roles across both Trusts bringing the total number of Non- Executive Directors appointed to both Trusts to three. In February 2019, the Governors Council, agreed the appointment of Prof. Robin Talbot as Chair of both Trusts for a two- year term, to take effect on 1 April 2019 following the retirement of NCUH Chair. These changes reflect and 80 demonstrate our commitment in moving toward an integrated health and care system, but do not diminish our responsibilities and accountabilities as a NHS Foundation Trust. As at 23 April 2019 we have: Seven Non- Executive Directors (the Chair plus six other Non- Executive Directors, three of whom also have NED roles within NCUH) Seven Executive Directors, six of whom have voting rights No Executive Director or Non- Executive Director vacancies The balance between Executive and Non- Executive Directors on the Board remains in line with the Code of Governance for NHS Foundation Trusts and our Constitution and Standing Orders. Further details about Board members and changes to Board membership during the year can be found in the Directors Report and the Remuneration Report. During Quarter 4 of 2017/18 a review was undertaken of the corporate governance structures that support Board Committee effectiven ess in order to prepare for and implement aligned board -level governance arrangements across both trusts which took effect in April 2018. During Quarters 1 and 2 activity focussed on the alignment of clinical and corporate governance meetings structures to support the aligned board level arrangements. These took full effect from October 2018. At the time of writing, following agreement from the Governors Council in November 2018 and approval of the Strategic Case by NHS Improvement (NHSI) in February 201 9, activity is underway to prepare for both Trusts to merge to become a single organisation. The aim is that the new Trust will 'go- live' in October 2019 following approval of the Full Business Case by the Board in June 2019, and subject to successful prog ress through the Transactions process with NHSI. As this transaction is technically an acquisition of NCUH by CPFT the merged Trust (name not yet confirmed at time of writing) will be a Foundation Trust. A programme management approach has been adopted t o prepare for and manage the merger transaction. Work streams led by Executive Directors deliver the required activity and report progress into the Programme Board which is chaired by the Chief Executive. The Governors Council are engaged in the process and have been involved in the review and development of the Constitution for the new Trust. At the time of writing a further review is ongoing to explore opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of the Trusts' governance framework, taking into consider ation feedback received in March 2019 from NHS Improvement as part of their supportive 'Moving to Good' programme, as well as for integrating aspects of corporate governance with the North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group as part of moves toward an int egrated health and care system. These reviews are likely to result in some changes to the 81 governance framework and associated meetings structures which will be implemented during 2019/20 having due regard to impacts on, and from, merger and CCG integration activities. Meetings that have been in place during 2018/19, and any changes or adjustments to their arrangements within the year, are set out below. Board and Board level Committee The Board is supported by a governance structure as follows, which deals with various components of corporate governance and risk. With the exception of the Audit and Risk Committee and Charitable Funds Committee all meetings described below happen in an aligned manner with NCUH (meeting at the same place, at the same time). These aligned arrangements recognise the statutory duties of both Trusts as separate legal entities whilst also enabling efficiencies through avoiding duplication of senior man agers' at tendance at meetings. Quality and Safety Committee (Q&S) - the designated Board Committee which oversees quality and safety issues. It is chaired by a Non- Executive Director (NED) and has Executive and NED membership. The Q&S Committee monitored clinical risk management performance throughout the year and made recommendations to the Board as appropriate. Finance Investment and Performance Committee (FIP) - the designated Board Committee which oversees financial, corporate performance and investment issues . It is chaired by a NED and has Executive and NED membership. The FIP Committee monitored risks to operational and financial performance throughout the year and made recommendations to the Board as appropriate. Charitable Funds Committee - this designate d Board Committee which oversees the management of Charitable Funds held by the Trust. Audit & Risk Committee (A&R) - an independent Committee and senior Board Committee , with all members NEDs. The A&R Committee has responsibility for overseeing risk management and internal control. The A&R Committee agreed audit plans with our internal and external auditors and received progress updates and audit opinions throughout the year. Remuneration Committee - wholly NED membership. Mental Health Legislation Commi ttee - membership is Mental Health Act Managers, and is chaired by a Non- Executive Director. In December 2018 the Board of directors agreed to introduce this meeting as a formal Board level sub- Committee . At the time of writing transition arrangements are underway for the first meeting of this Committee to take place led by the Executive Director of Mental Health. Executive Leadership Group - membership is Executive Directors, led by the Chief Executive. In practice, due to the joint roles held by the Chie f Executive and a number of other Executive Directors across both the Trust and NCUHT, this meeting takes place as a joint Executive Team meeting. The Joint Company Secretary also attends these meetings. 82 High level governance meetings that support Board C ommittee effectiveness Clinical Management Group (CMG) (formerly Trust Management Board (TMB)) - the senior operational management group led by the Chief Executive and attended by Executive Directors, senior operational and clinical leaders within care groups and Heads of Support Services. CMG monitors risks to operational, clinical and financial performance and escalates issues and risks to Board level Committee s as appropriate. Trust Wide Clinical Governance Group (TWCGG) - the senior forum for clinical governance, led by the Deputy Director of Nursing and Quality (April 2018 - September 2018) and System Executive Chief Nurse (October 2018 - April 2019). This group monitors risks to quality and safety and provides updates to our Q&S Committee . Representation at the meeting includes the Medical Director, senior clinicians within care groups and senior managers within support services. The change in leadership of this group part way through the year arose following the substantive appointment of the System Executive Chief Nurse. In April 2019 this meeting was 'stood down' with alternative arrangements taking effect from May 2019 as part of changes to the governance framework. Joint Leadership Development Group - led by the Chief Executive and including Execu tive Directors and senior managerial and clinical leaders, with a specific focus on the development and implementation of our strategy. During the year membership of this group expanded to also include senior managers from the North Cumbria Clinical Commis sioning Group. Compliance Board - led by the Executive Chief Operating Officer and including Executive Directors and senior managerial and clinical leaders, with a specific focus on CQC compliance. During 2018/19 the effectiveness of our Board and Committee s was evaluated through a survey involving Board members and members of each Board Committee , and also through consideration of the Committee s' performance against their work plans. This evaluation indicated each Committee had met and fulfilled their functions in accordance with their Terms of Reference although identified the need to review the future format of board effectiveness surveys. Risk Management Strategy The annual review of our Risk Management Strategy was undertaken with the Board agreeing the updated Risk Management Strategy in November 2018. The Risk Management Strategy will be reviewed again during the first half of 2019/20 as part of further alignment activity with NCUH and the move toward an integrated health and care system. The strategy sets out our integrated approach to risk governance, which incorporates: Strategic planning activities 83 Business planning activities Quality Governance Framework Assurance Framework Governance Assurance and Accountability Framework Central to our integrated approach to risk governance is risk appetite. In June 2018 we agreed a joint risk appetite statement, joint strategic objectives and joint strategic risks. In setting out our appetite for risk, we use a risk appetite framework based upon th at promoted by the Good Governance Institute but which has been expanded to include wider range of risk domains that reflect complex sustainability challenges currently facing the NHS. Board members' individual risk appetites inform a collective debate on the organisational risk appetite which is then agreed by the Board. The System Executive Chief Nurse is accountable for ensuring appropriate systems and processes are in place to enable the implementation of our Risk Management Strategy. Our Risk Manag ement Strategy is implemented through the Risk Management Policy which sets out the framework for how risks are identified, evaluated and controlled. Operational risks are managed on a day -to-day basis by staff through our governance structures. The Risk Management Strategy is also delivered through other policies and procedures that support the activities mentioned above, including: Policies on specific risk areas, including policies and procedures with respect to countering fraud and corruption Policies for the reporting and investigation of incidents, complaints, concerns, and claims A risk -based training programme based on an annual analysis of skills and competencies required to support the delivery of safe and effective services Induction programmes for our staff and governors Training delivered by a combination of in- house experts and external partners, that gives the flexibility to provide tailored training to meet the needs of individuals with additional risk management responsibilities Reporting t o the Board and its Committee on quality governance matters, including patient safety, patient experience, performance against key performance indicators and other regulatory and compliance requirements. Risk Management Policy The Risk Management Policy, last reviewed during 2016/17, sets out our approach to the identification, evaluation, assessment, management, reporting and monitoring of risks. In addition, it also sets out how risks are to be escalated through our governance frameworks. Training on th e Risk Management Policy was delivered to team leads during the year as part of our risk management training programme. The Board Development 84 programme during the year has also incorporated risk management training for board members through activity to rev iew and update strategic risks that underpin the Board Assurance Framework (BAF), review and development of the risk appetite statement, and most recently in March 2019, a review of the risk and assurance escalation flows to inform the development governance framework. During 2018/19 elements of our risk management processes started to become aligned with those of NCUH, with the aim that during 2019/20 they will become fully aligned. This includes the bringing together of both Trusts' risk management poli cies into a single joint policy. We are continually seeking ways in which to enhance the quality of information available to frontline services to support their decision making around risk management. Quality and safety dashboards, which have been developed in liaison with our clinical leads, enable our leaders to actively identify and respond to quality and safety risks within their services. Further enhancements to the content, accessibility and functionality of dashboards were made during the year and the use of dashboards within governance forums is becoming embedded. A continual improvement approach is taken to enhance the capabilities of our risk management information system (Ulysses). Our Quality and Safety Systems Group (formerly Ulysses systems group) meets regularly throughout the year to discuss improvement opportunities and to ensure the system enables us to meet our statutory obligations with accuracy. During the year, our Integrated Governance Manual was refreshed to recognise how we have aligned our governance and perfor mance management frameworks with NCUH, and also sets out our joint arrangements for priority setting, business planning and our aligned Board Assurance Framework. Quality governance Quality governance is a key activity of the Board to ensure essential levels of quality and safety are met. External sources of assurance include: Internal and external auditors Care Quality Commission NHS Litigation Authority Other visits and inspecti ons from regulatory agencies. Internal sources of assurance include: 85 Activities undertaken by Quality and Safety Leads within care groups, Clinical Governance Team within the Quality & Nursing Directorate, and the Corporate Governance Department Performa nce metrics Non-executive and governor joint visiting programme Incident reporting Patient and carer feedback, including patient stories at the Board Over recent years we have undertaken an annual self -assessment against NHSI's Well Led Framework which informs our evaluation of our quality governance arrangements. Our self-assessment against the Well Led framework, conducted during Quarter 4 of 2017/18, took into consideration the findings and recommendations from the CQC's inspection and our progress with improvement actions identified in our 2016/17 self -assessment. In Quarter 3 of 2018/19 we commissioned a peer -review against NHSI's Well Led framework, led by Northumberland Tyne and Wear, and which was undertaken between October 2018 and February 2019. Delivery of improvement actions has been monitored through relevant governance forums and with Board level oversight. Our 2018/19 annual self-assessment against the Well Led framework commenced in March 2019, with the outcome of that assessment due to b e formally considered by the Board in June 2019. The self-assessment takes into consideration feedback from the external peer review. Areas identified for improvement included strengthening arrangements for workforce planning, strengthening our arrangements for corporate risk management, and strengthening our quality impact assessment (EQIA) arrangements to understand whether impacts identified within EQIAs materialised as expected. Our last formal Well Led external review was undertaken by Deloitte in 2015. The timeframe for our next formal external review is likely to be during 2019/20. We last underwent a formal Well Led inspection by the CQC in November 2017 and will be inspected again in June 2019. The CQC inspection report assessed us as 'requires improvement' overall with 22 'must do' actions requiring immediat e attention. Details of how we have responded to their recommendations can be found in the Quality Report. Risks lo gged within our risk registers continue to be managed and regularly monitored through our governance frameworks. Scrutiny of the corporate risk register is undertaken monthly by the Clinical Management Group (CMG). Monthly monitoring is also undertaken to ensure risks within risk registers are reviewed and updated in a timely manner. As at 23 April 2019 10.2% of 'open' risks within our risks registers were overdue for review, compared with 4.31% on 31 March 2018. This aspect of risk register management is now incorporated into our performance management framework and is a regular aspect of quality governance within care groups and support services. 86 During the year we have continued to strengthen our operational and strategic risk management processes through the inclusion within our BAF reports, of a visual representation of how risks within the corporate risk register impact upon, or are impacted by, strategic risks within the BAF. This, together with developments to our quality and safety dashboards and r eporting on risk management to aid understanding and thematic analysis of how risks within risk registers have changed over time, enable a better understanding of our risk profile. The BAF continues to be shared with our care group and support service leadership teams after each quarterly update to enable cascading throughout the Trust of how the most significant risks to our objectives are being managed. Longer term actions which collectively will strengthen the quality of our risk management arrangement s during 2019/20 include building on work commenced in 2018/19 to refresh risk management training programmes and guidance documents, reinvigorating governance processes within our care groups and support services, further developing our performance and sa fety dashboards, and updating the Ulysses risk management system. The Q&S Committee oversees progress and effectiveness of initiatives to address the CQC's must do actions. As part of our integration with NCUH, some changes were made during the year to care group structures. Some of our care groups now incorporate services from both Trusts, an example of this is the Children and Family Care Group. Activity to align quality governance arrangements has also taken place during the year through alignment of policies and meetings structures. Further integration and alignment work will be undertaken during 2019/20 to refocus clinical governance arrangements within our integrated structures and to embed quality improvement as the driving principle of our governance frameworks. Staff surveys and staff engagement activities give us rich information that we are using to inform our development programmes such as leadership and staff recognition. The Board receives performance reports on agreed safety and quality key performance indicators in accordance with the integrated performance management framework. To comply with the governance conditions of the Provider Licence, we are required to provide a Corporate Governance Statement to NHSI. The Corporate Governance Statement relating to 2018/19 was presented to the Board for formal acceptance in May 2019. The Corporate Governance Statement sets out any risks to our compliance with the governance conditions, along with the actions taken or being taken to maintain futur e compliance. The statement sets out a number of key questions essential for quality governance, with evidence gathered through self -assessment or review. The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with our Provider Licence conditions, which he discharges through the Executive Team. The FIP Committee seeks assurance on compliance with the licence conditions on behalf of the Board of Directors. Risks to performance are managed and monitored through CMG. 87 Throughout the year we have maintained good working relations with NHSI and have ensured they have been notified of any significant risks to compliance or service continuity. No exception reports have been required during 2018/19. We expect to comply with all of the Provider Lic ence conditions in 2019/20. Should there be any indications to the contrary we will ensure NHSI are notified as soon as they become apparent. NHSI is regularly appraised of our financial position. Further information on our quality governance arrangements can be found in the Quality Report. Incident reporting A positive approach to incident reporting is communicated through our policies and procedures. We continue to be consistently within the top third of benchmark trusts in NHS Organisation Patient Safety Incident Reports, in respect of reports of patient safety incidents, with most of our incidents reported falling within the no/low harm categories. We encourage the reporting of incidents or concerns and use as a tool to learn and improve. We have a clear focus on open and honest reporting of incidents, with investigation into an incident proportional to the level of harm or potential harm, as detailed in the Trust's Being Open/Duty of Candour and Serious Incident policies. Our approved Raising Concerns (Whistleblowing) policy is published on our website. The Audit & Risk Committee oversees our Raising Concerns process and our Freedom to Speak Up Guardian provides regular updates to the Board. Risk reporting Risk management is fundamental to how we operate. Our risk appetite is articulated in our Risk Management Strategy. Risks are identified and evaluated using a 5 x 5 risk grading matrix, and recorded and reported in accordance with the Risk Management Polic y. Top strategic risks are managed through the Board Assurance Framework (BAF). Work activities of the Board and Board level Committee are aligned to the BAF in order to enable line of sight to the management of strategic risks. All operational risk s are recorded in our risk management information system (Ulysses). Those risks recorded within Ulysses collectively form our risk register. The risks recorded on our risk register which scored 15- 25 i.e. high risks, are also identified on the corporate risk register. An Executive Director or other senior manager is formally accountable for each recorded risk on our risk register. Individual responsibilities include ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place for effective risk management and mitigation. During Quarter 1 the Boards of both Trusts agreed joint strategic objectives, joint strategic risks and an aligned approach to the Board Assurance Framework (BAF). The first 'joint' BAF was agreed in July 2018 and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. 88 The BAF is subject to formal review by the A&R Committee every six months and quarterly by the Board of Directors, Q&S Committee and FIP Committee . The CMG has responsibilities for risk management performance and receives monthly updates on the management of risks on the corporate risk register. The BAF review process, which takes place on a quarterly basis, incorporates a review of the risks on the corporate risk register. The management of risks is a routine item for discussion at each of the care groups' clinical governance forums. The Q&S Committee receive annual reports from each care group about their clinical governance arrangements and Care Quality Commission (CQC) compliance. Any significant risks identified from these reviews are managed as per th e agreed accountabilities and responsibilities framework. The Clinical Governance team within the Quality and Nursing Directorate coordinate arrangements for monitoring and overseeing CQC registration and compliance requirements. Public stakeholders are involved in identifying and managing risks through membership of the Governors Council and by attending specific service users' and carers' groups in the Trust. The Governors Council is provided with performance information and is involved in the annual planning process. All service users, carers and visitors are encouraged to provide feedback on the service received and offer suggestions for improvement. Data quality We have recognised for some time that data quality is an underpinning issue in most things that we and this has been highlighted by both our Internal and External Auditors over recent years. In July 2016, the A&R Committee endorsed a three- year Data Quality Strategy to systematically improve data quality across all of our information systems. The A&R Committee received updates on progress against the strategy throughout 2018/19 and the internal audit programme included audits on data quality which demonstrated positive improvements. Details of the steps we have taken to address data quality are provided in the Quality Report. Top strategic risks We take assurance that our quality governance arrangements are effective from a range of sources including audits by our Internal Auditors, and reviews by external bodies such as the CQC. We recognis e that balancing high quality care with long term financial sustainability and delivering integrated care are significant and challenging strategic risks. These are integral to our BAF. We are working with our partners in the IHCS on major transformation programmes which span the Cumbria footprint to find workable solutions to these very challenging strategic risks. Examples of transformational schemes include the future provision of mental health services across Cumbria which we are working with our commi ssioners and regional partners to progress, and partnership working with GP practices to enable a more sustainable model for primary care across north Cumbria. 89 In June 2018, in collaboration with the Board of NCUH, our Board reviewed the top strategic ri sks and major operational and clinical risks facing the organisations, and agreed the following top strategic risks which form the basis of our aligned Board Assurance Framework. In January 2019 the Board agreed the inclusion of an additional risk (Risk 10) within the BAF relating to the impacts on support services from transferring mental health services to alternative providers in line with Commissioner Intentions. Risk 1 Leadership and workforce is not sufficient to deliver the scale and pace of transformative change Risk 2 Cultural change to improve quality and empower people is not sustained Risk 3 Engagement with the public and partners is not effective in achieving positive change that improves or transforms services Risk 4 Quality of se rvices (experience, safety, outcomes) are not improved because programmes to transform, integrate and save have adverse quality impacts Risk 5 Financial sustainability is not achieved as the effectiveness of cost reduction plans and implementation of new service models does not deliver the anticipated financial benefits set out in our long term plans Risk 6 Health and Health Service improvement plans are impeded by dependency on key partners who are not sufficiently ready / able to support our plans Risk 7 Vulnerable services become too unstable to continue during the implementation of wider transformation programmes across Cumbria and North East Risk 8 Infrastructure developments are not sufficiently enabling of transformation Risk 9 Fragility within primary care impacts our ability to effectively manage patient flow Risk 10 Support services are insufficiently resilient to effectively support the Trust following transfer of mental health services to an alternative provider The Board Assurance Framework is reviewed on a quarterly basis, with the framing of top strategic risks being reviewed on at least an annual basis, usually during Quarter 3. Significant operational and clinical risks Risks are identified, managed and monitored through our governance frameworks, in accordance with the Risk Management Policy and the aligned performance framework. Risk reporting and measurement are actioned through our Outcomes Framework, quality and safe ty dashboards, and via the risk management information system (Ulysses) - all of 90 which enable line of sight to risk management performance at all levels throughout the Trust. Examples of significant operational and clinical risks affecting us include: ability to ensure service continuity in services that are fragile due to challenges in recruitment to specialist roles, such as in some of our district nursing services short and medium term disruption to the resilience of support services associated with the transfer of mental health, learning disabilities and children & adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to alternative providers. delays in patients accessing specialist dental services due to lack of availability in specialists to support the deliver y of care during treatments suitability of some of our patient and staff environments, such as our Kentmere ward in Kendal. Oakwood ward on our Carleton Clinic site and Valley View in Whitehaven all of which have their own particular issues which are complex to resolve. Policy Management As part of our increasingly integrated working with NCUH, both Trusts are working together to implement aligned processes for policy management. Initial work commenced during Quarter 4 of 2017/18 and has continued throug hout 2018/19. The aim is for fully integrated arrangements by the end of Quarter 1 of 2019/20. Activity has taken place throughout 2018/19 to align policies with NCUH, and where appropriate to have joint policies spanning both Trusts. This work continues into 2019/20 and may result in adjustments and extension to review timeframes for some policies. During 2018/19 we continued to see improvements in the number of policies which were due for review. Policies become due for review throughout the year and ar rangements are in place to initiate timely review. The number due for review as at 1 April 2019 was 27. This compares to 36 as at 31 March 2018. Policy management performance is monitored by Trust Wide Clinical Governance Group (TWCGG) and the Compliance Board, with oversight provided by A&R Committee . Information on how we have responded to the CQC inspection relating to the management and implementation of some policies is provided within the Quality Report. Quality Impact Assessments As part of our collaborative working with NCUH, an aligned approach to undertaking quality impact assessments was agreed by the Q&S Committee in April 2018 and has been applied throughout the year. The approach to undertaking quality impact assessments takes a holistic approach to assessing the impacts of major change schemes, including those proposed within our efficiency programme. The impact assessment approach enables decisions to be made based upon a balance of risks to quality, equality and the clinical and financial sustainability of services. The process is jointly led by the System Executive Chief Nurse and Executive Medical Director and overseen by the Q&S Committee . It is also integrated into our business planning process, which evolved during the year to integrate and incorporate the trust's approach to workforce planning. 91 Board level assurance on the timely undertaking of impact assessments is provided through the Q&S Committee who also have a role in the EQIA approvals process. During 2019/20 the EQIA process will be strengthened further through undertaking evaluations of post-change impacts compared with anticipated impacts. Workforce strategies The Q&S Committee receive routine 'hard truths' nurse staffing reports throughout the year, including fill rates and care hours per patient day (CHPPD). The People Plan for the North Cumbria Integrated Health and Care System, approved by the Board in March 2019, sets out the strategic delivery approach to ensure a sustainable workforce. It also states the annual del ivery plan priorities for 2019/20. Priorities for 2019/20 include developing an attraction plan and improving recruitment processes, also designing an effective, inclusive and engaged workforce through local plans that meet the needs of the population buil t on multi professional working and new roles. Delivery of the People Plan will be overseen through the Q&S Committee . We use the population centric model for workforce planning and have a draft workforce plan. The model hospital approach is being used to identify opportunities for workforce efficiencies, although this is at an early stage of development and will be incorporated into our workforce planning approach during 2019/20. A workforce planning group is in place, chaired by the Executive Director of Workforce & OD and has representation from primary care, nursing and Allied Health Professions. Our lead officer for workforce planning is a member of the workforce planning group. A workforce planning summit is planned to take place during 2019 and will involve a wide range of stakeholders. In summary, we have staffing governance processes in place although these are currently immature and will be strengthened to become embedded over 2019/20. Business conduct / conflicts of interest The foundation trust has published an up- to-date register of interests for decision- making staff within the past twelve months, as required by the ' Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS guidance: https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/managing -conflicts -of-interest - in-the-nhs-guidance- for-staff-and-organisations/ . Our Standards of Business Conduct policy was updated in 2018 to reflect changes to legislative requirements and to become a joint policy with NCUH. Policy requirements are being implemented on a phased approach during 2018/19 and 2019/20. This commenced with an update of Board members' and the Lead and Deputy Lead Governors' declarations in Quarter 3 of 2018/19, medical and senior clinical and non- clinical decision makers in Quarter 4 of 2018/19, with declarations for the remainder of individuals and groups stated 92 within our policy being updated during 2019/20. Information on our 'declarations of interest' internet page will be updated on a progressive basis during the phased implementation period. Delivery of the phased implementation plan is being overseen by the A&R Committee . Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requi rements of the Care Quality Commission. NHS Pension Scheme As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied wi th. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Equality, Diversity and Human Rights Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. Environmental Issues The foundation trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requir ements are complied with. Further details can be found in the Performance Report. Emergency preparedness Our emergency planning and business continuity consider organisational resilience and our ability to respond/recover from incidents and disruption. V ery high and high risks in the current version of the Cumbria Community Risk Register are covered by either our contingency planning, or wider health or multi -agency planning to which we contribute. We work collaboratively and share information appropriat ely with responder organisations in furtherance of multi -agency co- operation and co- ordination. We seek to comply with the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 regime and align with the international standard for business continuity, BS ISO 22301:2012 and its guidance, BS ISO 22313:2012. Under NHS England's Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response (EPRR) guidance, we must: have a suitable and up -to-date incident response plan which sets out how it would respond to and recover from a major incident/emergency affecting local communities or the delivery of its services; and 93 adopt business continuity plans to enable it to maintain or recover the delivery of its critical services in the event of significant disruption. We comply with NHS Englan d's requirements by providing an EPRR structure and implementing a business continuity management system through which we will endeavour to respond to critical incidents (which may include so- called 'unusual' incidents) and emergencies as well as maintaini ng its critical functions, ordinary functions and contractual obligations as far as reasonably practicable. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources We closely monitor budgetary control and expenditure through the Financial Delivery Group, Clinical Management Group and, at Board level, through the FIP Committee . A dedicated programme management team support the identification and delivery of schemes which improve efficiency and positively impact our overall financial efficiency efforts. The Executive Director of Finance, Digital & Estates presents finance reports to both the FIP Committee and the Board. Through our Standing Orders (SOs), Standing Fi nancial Instructions (SFIs) and Scheme of Delegation the Board has created clarity regarding delegated auth ority levels across the Trust. Executive Directors and managers have responsibility for the effective management and deployment of their staff and ot her resources to optimise the efficiency of each area of our operations. The Board receives both performance and financial reports at each of its public meetings in addition to reports from the Chairs of its Committee s, to which it has delegated powers and responsibilities. When required, the Board receives further assurance provided by its internal and external auditors. The 2 -year financial plan for 2017/18 and 2018/19 was developed based on a number of assumptions about the degree of financial recovery that could be delivered over the two year period. We recognised there were risks to the delivery of the 2- year plan which we alerted NHSI of through caveats within the 2- year operational plan and through separate correspondence and routine contacts. Through concerted efforts driving efficiencies during the year and through our collaborative working with system partners, whilst our adjusted year -end financial out -turn was under achievement against our financial control total, through our risk sharing agreements the north Cumbria system will receive, with bonuses, approximately \u00a321.2m from the Provider Sustainability Fund for 2018/19. We acted within an agreed risk sharing arrangement within the year. Until mo nth 11, the Trust was forecasting delivery ag ainst the agreed position. However, in month 12 the Trust reported a year end deficit of \u00a37.632m. After adjusting for items excluded in the control total calculation (such as impairments, donations, transfers by absorption) the Trust 94 therefore reported th at its deficit position was \u00a35m. This is \u00a32.9m higher than the agreed control total. As a result the Trust did not receive the full allocation of Provider Support Fund. The lost income was \u00a31.4m. The increased deficit position arose because of the Trust ag reeing a lower than planned contract income with the local Clinical Commissioning Group. This decision was based on the 2018/19 Operational Plan which provided for a system wide risk share agreement. This decision by the Trust allowed the Cumbria system to achieve greater benefits than the \u00a31.4m PSF funding that the Trust could have earned. The risk sharing is agreed formally by the Board through our annual planning process and reviewed through the year by the System Leadership Board of which we are a parti cipant. T he financial plan for 2019/20 has been developed in conjunction with NCUH and North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group and was agreed by both Boards in March 2019. There are significant risks to the delivery of the financial plan and many of the caveats notified to NHSI for the 2018/19 financial plan remain relevant into 2019/20. W e were rated as being placed in Segment 2 under NHSI's SOF at 22 April 2019. You can find further details about ratings in the NHS Improvements Single Oversight Framework Report. W e have continued to reduce reliance on agency staff during the year where possible and controls are in place to control expenditure on agency workers. Board- level oversight of expenditure on agency workers is undertaken by the FIP Committee as part of the Board level performance reports. Information is also readily available to front line managers through quality and safety dashboards. I nformation governance (IG) and data security We reported two incidents via the Data Security and Protection Toolkit to the Regulator during 2018/19. One incident related to a clinical letter sent to the wrong address, the other related to health assessment information sent to the wrong patient. Both incidents were investigated and investigation reports sent to the Information Commissioners Office with recommendations completed for improvement. We are committed to learning from all incidents with a view to preventing recurrence in the future. You can find further details about our Information Governance and data security arrangements in the Quality Report. A nnual Quality Report The Directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS Foundation Trust Boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . W e have arrangements in place to assure the Board that the Quality Report presents a balanced view and that there are controls in place to ensure the accuracy of data. 95 Overseeing the Quality Report preparation and content was the responsibility of the System Executive Chief Nurse during 2018/19. We recognise t hat good quality data is essential for the delivery of safe and effective care to our patients as well as enabling us to manage services and performance. To support this, we have in place a strategy with supporting policies and procedures which govern the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of data at the point of capture and when reporting either for internal or external purposes. A governance framework is in place which oversees data quality performance from operational services through to Board level . Data quality performance is overseen by the Information Governance department. Key performance indicators (KPI) are subject to data quality and data validation processes. Performance is routinely reported and regularly reviewed at all levels within local and corporate governance structures in accordance with our performance and governance frameworks. This includes monthly review by the Board and review at each meeting of the Governors Council. A balanced view of our data quality is obtained through comparing and analysing data accuracy from checks undertaken by front line staff and service managers, and through independent audits undertaken by our internal and external auditors. We currently use a number of separate electronic and paper patient record systems to record clinical information and produce reports. This includes EMIS and RiO electronic patient record systems which are used in our Care Groups. Checks are in place to provide assurance that the data from these systems is accurate. Assurances have been provided during the year through the internal audit programme and our data validation checks and monitoring processes that our data quality has improved through implementation of our Data Quality Strategy. Our suite of policies and procedural documents are reviewed as part of an ongoing review programme to reflect changes to legislation and best practice and, more recently, to reflect aligned governance arrangements with NCUH. The Clinical Policies sub group continued to meet in 2018/19 to ensure clinical policies were reviewed in a timely manner. During Quarter 2 its remit was widened to include the ratification of all policies (not just clinical policies) and is now referred to as the Policy Management Grou p (PMG). The work to review policies is ongoing and is overseen by the A&R Committee . Our governance framework sets out responsibilities and accountabilities for performance and governance at all levels within the Trust. This is underpinned by the Outcomes and Performance Framework, which comprises performance indicators and metrics by which we measure and monitor our performance with local, regional and national standards and targets. The Outcomes and Performance Framework populates a set of dashboards w hich enable our staff and managers to identify, monitor and improve the quality of data derived from patient information systems. The dashboards, which continue to evolve, also provide the 96 basis for assuring the Board on the quality, accuracy and completeness of data and enable triangulation of safety data. In Quarter 2, as part of the alignment of governance arrangements with NCUH, the aligned Performance & Delivery Group was formed to identify, monitor and manage risks to performance. The Group which is a sub group of Clinical Management Group, met intermittently throughout 2018/19, as much of its business was undertaken in practice through care groups' 6 -weekly performance review meetings. The ongoing role and function of the Performance & Delivery Group will be considered as part of the governance framework review being undertaken during Quarter 1 of 2019/20. Our organisational development and service improvement functions, which are now embedded, support our leadership teams with implementing quality improvements. A suite of tools and training on quality improvement methodologies is also available to all staff. We achieved a number of quality improvements during the year, including further development and roll out of quality and safety dashboards w ithin integrated care groups to improve quality governance, and improvements introduced through research and development, such as improving hospital discharge arrangements for people who are homeless. Further details about these and other quality highlight s, and also details about our performance and achievement of key performance indicators can be found in the Quality Report . Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal cont rol. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS foundation trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the Quality Report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the Audit & Risk Committee (A&R), Quality and Safety Committee (Q&S), and Fi nance Investment and Performance Committee (FIP) and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The System Executive Chief Nurse is responsible for developing and delivering the clinical audit programme and for ensuring the audit programme supports a process of continual improvement. The Trust Wide Clinical Governance Group (TWCGG) which reports into the Q&S Committee oversees the clinical audit programme. The Q&S Committee receives monthly updates from the TWCGG on the management of risks to quality and safety. 97 Voluntary Disclosure E quality Reporting This Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) report provides information on how both Cumbria P artnership NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) and North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (NCUH) is meeting their legal duties set out in the Equality Act 2010, the Public Sector Equality Duty 2011 and the Human Rights Act 1998 which aim to: Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other unlawful conduct Advance equality of opportunity between people of different groups; and Foster good relationships between people who share a protected characteristic andthose who do not T he nine Characteristics which are protected by the Equality Act 2010 are: 1. Age 2. Disability3. Gender reassignment4. Marriage or civil partnership 5. Pregnancy and maternity 6. Race7. Religion or belief8. Sex 9. Sexual orientation T he people who use our services have diverse needs therefore to enable us to deliver quality care to every patient every time we must hear the voice of the patient and understand their individual need; creating the right culture and environment for quality care to flourish and all our staff to achieve their potential. Our equality goals and objectives provide a framework for this to happen: G oal 1: Better health outcomes for all Goal 2: Improved patient access and experience Goal 3: Empowered, engaged and well supported staff Goal 4: Inclusive leadership at all levels T his report provides an update on the progress we have made in both Trusts towards these goals during 201 8/19, and includes workforce and patient statistical information relating to specific protected groups. T he information within this report will inform improvements for joint EDI development within both Trusts in 2019/20 . 99 Compliance E quality Delivery System Objectives The Equality Delivery System (EDS2) requires NHS organisations to develop and agree equality objectives. An annual self -assessment is undertaken to measure progress against these objectives followed by a Stakeholder Engagement event to grade performance and collectively develop equality objectives for the following year. W e have joint Actions Plans for EDS2 and Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) which have been aligned to avoid duplication and enable a consistent approach to achievement of outcomes. G oal Description of Outcome Achieved by Equality Objective Better Health Outcomes Patient and staff stories from a range of different protected characteristics are heard at joint Board level meetings with identified impact/outcomes November 2018 1, 3 & 4 Improved Patient Access and Experience Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES) completed within the required standards and timescales, engaging with different community groups and partner organisations to ensure representation and promote equality of opportunity March 2019 1, 2 & 3 Work with BME community groups to understand barriers to recruitment and promote opportunities for attraction and employment of people from diverse ethnic backgrounds December 2018 1, 2 & 3 Representative and Supported Workforce Develop a Transgender Policy and implement across CPFT & NCUHT with a supported roll out and training plan July 2018 1, 2 & 3 Develop and implement Staff Netw orks across CPFT & NCUHT with a supporting communications plan and measurable outcomes October 2018 1 & 3 Inclusive Leadership at all levels Work closely with system partners to create joint Equality Objectives as North Cumbria Health & Care Partners June 2018 1, 2, 3 & 4 T he table below shows the grading achieved following our EDS2 Stakeholder Grading event in November 2017. This will be updated following the joint stakeholder grading event which took place in April 2019. 100 GOAL OBJECTIVE SCORE 1. Develop a single Equality Impact Assessment process, applied consistently across the Trust implemented with a supported roll out. Achieving 2. The Trust is represented at Strategic Refugee Meetings and Health Sub Groups to ensure the needs of Syrian refugees are identified with plans developed to identify their needs and promote access. Achieving 3. EDI networks developed to focus on different protected characteristics Developing 4. Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) completed within the required standards and timescales, engaging with different cultural staff groups to ensure representation and promote equality of opportunity. Achieving 5. Patient stories are included and heard at Board level meetings Achieving 6. Board Development session to consider how the Trust Board can demonstrate inclusive leadership, accountability and the impact of decisions u pon people from protected groups. Achieving Gender Pay Gap Analysis Following government consultation, it became mandatory from 31 March 2017 for public sectors organisations with over 250 employees to report annually on their gender pay gap. Both Trusts meet the mandatory requirements of the gender pay gap analysis by publishing the reports on our websites and submitting data on to the government website. T he gender pay gap describes the difference between the average earning of all the women in an organisation compared to the average earnings of all the men in that organisation. This is not the same as equal pay, which is about ensuring men and women doing the same or comparable jobs are paid the same. Our Clinical E xcellence Awards apply to consultant level medical and dental staff, these are defined as a bonus within the gender pay definitions. As a healthcare provider a high proportion of the workforce is female, this is reflected in the national NHS workforce with 77% being female. E DI incidents and Complaints The table below outlines EDI incidents January 2018 - 19. There has been an increase in EDI related incidents since last year (3) which is considered a positive step forward with staff being more aware and supported of the need to come forward and report incidents. 101 Type of Incident Description 1 Gender Reassignment Inappropriate Language from a member of staff 2 Race Inappropriate language and behaviour from a member of staff 3 Disability Building access for group meeting not accessible 4 Disability Unable to transfer patient 5 Disability Unable to transfer patient 6 Race Racially abusive language from a patient 7 Race Racially abusive language from a patient 8 Disability Unable to transfer patient E quality Impact Assessments (EIA's) An Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) should be undertaken for all proposed changes, to assess whether they may cause a detrimental impact upon people with protected characteristics. Both Trusts undertake EIA's and a revised process has been developed to ensure a consistent joint approach and that assessments are undertaken as effectively as possible. In addition, all reports seeking Committee approval must attach the completed EIA to ensure any potential detrimental impact upon people with protected characteristics or under -represented groups have been appropriately assessed. W orkforce Equality, Diversity and Inclusion related HR cases at CPFT Disciplinary Investigations: We had 22 employees entered into formal disciplinary investigations. Of these, 0 were in relation to discrimination. (2 cases were for staff of a non-white British ethnicity) Grievance Procedure: We had 52 formal grievance cases. Of these, 0 were in relation to discrimination. (2 cases were for staff of a non- white British ethnicity) Capabi lity Procedure: We had 5 employees entered into capability. Of these, 0 were in relation to discrimination. P olicies and Procedures Trusts A joint Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy has been developed and once approved and implemented will replace the existing policies for the individual Trusts. This year we also implemented our Gender Identity and Inclusion Policy which was rolled out together with Gender Awareness Training sessions across Cumbria. Tr aining, Development and Awareness Sessions Both Trusts require all staff to compete mandatory e- learning training for Equality and Diversity. In April 2018 w e introduced the core skills framework provided by skills for health. With the launch of the Transgender policy , Gender Identity and Awareness Training was made available, 7 sessions took place across the county. With the high uptake on the course has received more sessions will be scheduled for 2019. 102 Cultural Diversity Awareness Project We are progressing a Cultural Awareness Project across both Trusts. This project incorporates recommended actions following a recent Cultural Review, which has received widespread support from our local and regional Trades Unions. Some of these areas include delivering diversity awareness training, reviewing faith and spiritual provision, further promotion of Staff Networks and delivery of two cultural orientation/welcome days, linking our current and future workforce with local community groups. W orkforce Equality Standards In accordance with NHS England's requirements, both Trust s completed the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) for 2018 , providing both data and narrative around race equality issues within their workforce. Although figures are increasing, the Black, Minority, Ethnic (BME) population of Cumbria is low, with an overall BME of 1.4%. This full WRES reports can be found on our websites . T he Disability Workforce Equality Standard (WDES) comes into effect in 2019 which requires trusts to provide data and narrative around disability equality issues within the workforce. Both Trusts are working with NHS England on what is required. We will be attending the National Disability Summit and the Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES) Workshop to prepare for the implementation of the Workforce D isability Equality Standard later this year. A ccessible Information Standard (AIS) From the 1 August 2016 all publicly funded health and social care organisations are legally required to adhere to the standard requirements. These standards are to identify, record, flag, share and act on the information and communication support needs of patients, service users, carers and parents with a disability, impairment or sensory loss. A joint working group was established with staff, service user and partner involvement to progress a number of different workstreams. The project has made a number of significant achievements including the implementation of BrowseAloud and a Digital Patient Information library. As work continues, the emphasis for 2019 is upon system working and sharing best practice. Culture, Communities and Partnership E DI Representatives EDI Representatives are employees and governors within both Trusts who are passionate about promoting equality, diversity and inclusion within their everyday work. The number of representatives is continually increasing and currently stands at over 200, this figure has nearly tripled since last year. We continue to develop our Staff Networks to encourage those with an interest in promoting awareness, raising issues and supporting events around a particular area: Armed Forces, LGBT, Accessibility and Cultural Diversity. 103 Community Events We work with a number of different community groups across Cumbria. Over the past 12 months we have both sponsored and attended community events including the Unity Festival, Cumbria Pride, Culture Bazaar, IDAHOT day, and the Diverse Cumbria Awards, attending as \"NHS in Cumbria\". We work closely with a local BME organisation AWAZ to understand how to better engage with people from BME and under -represented communities, to promote work opportunities and understand barriers experienced by different communities, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We also work with national and local partners to support the county's Military Veterans in accessing services and promoting work opportunities when transitioning into civilian life and supporting the Step into Health Programme. P ublic Sector Partnerships and Integrated Working We are represented at regional and national EDI events, working together with NHS employers, NHS England and the Leadership Academy. Regional and local EDI groups also include the Carlisle Equality & Diversity Partnership and the EDI Network Group for Cumbria and the North East. O ur Trust is also a member of enei (Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion) and joint membership is currently being explored. We are key members of the Cumbria Public Sector Partnership, together with Cumbria Constabulary, Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group and Cumbria County Council. Working together with shared equality objectives to identify, understand and meet the EDI needs of public, patients and service users within the county. Membership of the Group has been extended to include other public sector partner across the c ounty. National BAME Programmes We are actively promoting national programmes to develop our future leaders from BAME backgrounds. Applications have been submitted for the Leadership Academy's Ready Now Programme and a member of staff was successful in achieving a place on the national Windrush Programme offered through the Florence Nightingale Foundation. V olunteer Workforce We greatly value our volunteer workforce and the support they provide to our patients and staff, however, we are also aware that there are very few volunteers from BAME or diverse backgrounds. Therefore, we are actively engaging with community groups and other Voluntary providers across Cumbria to promote volunteering opportunities and encourage those from diverse and minority backgrounds to join. S yrian Refugee Families Together with our other Health Partners across Cumbria we are continuing to work together with Cumbria County Council to support Syrian refugee families as they settle in Cumbria. 104 Brexit We are working together with Health and Care Partners to plan and prepare for Brexit and are working to support our staff with EU nationality through the necessary processes. Aw ards In 2018 our Trust was shortlisted for a national Inclusion Award and received commendation for our progressing inclusion work. Workforce EDI Data G ender The NHS workforce is made up of 23% Male and 77% Female. When our figures are compared they are within a 10% margin. 93% of our Nursing and Midwifery Staff are female and 44% of t he Medical and Dental Consultant staff are also female. Ag e Our workforce information shows that we have an ageing workforce with 21% being over the age of 55 and 51% over 45. E thnicity We currently employ in the region of 4200 staff, 96% of which described themselves as White. As the BM E rate within the county is low, our figures correspond with the county statistics. R eligion A large majority of employees have chosen not to disclose their religion, c urrently 25%, with Christianity ranking highest at 51%. Other religions and cultures are represented within the organisation, however the numbers are very sparse. S exual Orientation Similarly to religion, a large majority of have chosen not to disclose their sexual orientation which is currently at 21%. There are very low indication rates of gay, lesbian and bisexual with the highest disclosing rate being heterosexual at 75% . D isability - Existing Staff The 'not declared' rate has decreased by 4% from last year to 16% and only a minor number of the workforce declare themselves as having a disability , currently 4%. This leaves us with a 76% majority of the workforce that consider they do not to have a disability. 105 Patient EDI Data E thnicity The ethnicity profile of patients within CPFT services incl udes both Inpatient and Outpatient. The data shows a high proportion of patients from White- British backgrounds and a small number from a range of different backgrounds. This is in line with the counties ethnicity profile of a majority White - British population at 96.5% (2011 census). Ethnicity % White - British 52.00% Not stated 37.41% Any other white background 6.76% White - Any other White Background 1.45% White - Irish 0.54% Other Ethnic Group - Any other ethnic group 0.54% Mixed - Any other mixed background 0.38% Mixed - White and Asian 0.23% Mixed - White and Black Caribbean 0.18% Mixed - White and Black African 0.14% Asian/Asian Brit - Bangladeshi 0.13% Other Ethnic Groups - Chinese 0.11% Asian/Asian Brit - Indian 0.11% Asian/Asian Brit - Any other Asian background 0.12% Asian/Asian Brit - Pakistani 0.09% Any other ethnic group 0.08% Black/Blk Brit - African 0.08% Any other mixed background 0.07% Chinese 0.06% Black/Blk Brit - Caribbean 0.06% Black or Black British - Any other Black background 0.06% White and Asian 0.05% Indian 0.02% Any other Asian background 0.02% British 0.02% Caribbean 0.01% Pakistani 0.01% African 0.01% White and Black Caribbean 0.01% Any other Black background 0.01% White and Black African 0.00% 106 Age Cumbria as a county is described as having a 'super -ageing' population with 2016 estimates of 23.5% of the population aged 65+ (Cumbria Observatory). By 2029 it is estimated that more than half the population in parts of Cumbria will be 50+ (Office for National Statistics). With an aging population in Cumbria this leads to an increase in demand for frailty services. As shown below over 50% of activity was for patients aged highest % of religion recorded was Church of England for both inpatient and outpatients. High proportions were classified as unknown, this will be explored over the next 12 months. Religion Total Religion Total NULL 65.34% Baptist 0.03% Church of England 11.83% Zen Buddhist 0.03% Patient Religion Unknown 6.88% Mormon 0.03% Roman Catholic 4.08% Pagan 0.03% Atheist 3.12% Presbyterian 0.01% United Reform 0.14% Buddhist 0.01% Religion (Other Not Listed) 0.13% Free Church 0.01% Not Religious 0.11% Humanist 0.01% Church of Scotland 0.08% Old Catholic 0.00% 0.03% Ismaili Muslim 0.00% Protestant 0.04% Modern Slavery Act As of October 2015 all commercial organisations carrying on business in the UK with a turnover of \u00a336m or more have to complete a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year. The Modern Slavery Act consolidates offences relating to traf ficking and slavery (both in the UK and overseas). As a large business we need to publicly state each year the actions we are taking to ensure our suppliers are slavery free. We are working within the act. 107 QUALITY REPORT 2018/19 T his Quality Report is set out in accordance with the Quality Account Regulations and NHS Improvement, the sector regulator for health services in England and includes the following parts: Part 1: Statement on quality from the Chief Executive of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundati on Trust (the Trust) Over the last year we have continued on our journey to system working across North Cumbria, this year, work has included a significant programme of development in terms of joint ways of working across Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) and North Cumbria University Hospital NHS Trust (NCUH). This work has included the development of joint meetings, policies and procedures. For example we now have in place a joint Being Open and Duty of Candour policy which underpins our thinking around Just Culture and is supported by joint Duty of Candour training. T he further development of joint ways of working across the two organisations, prior to the merger in October 2019 now feed up in to the system governance arrangements which include meetings such as the System Quality Assurance Committee (SQAC). W e conti nue to work with partner organisations to ensure high quality mental health provision across Cumbria and as such mental health, learning disability and CAMHS services within the South of Cumbria will be transferring to Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust (LCFT) and those services in the North to Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW). Mental health services will transfer to these neighbouring Trusts on 1 October 2019. A s an organisation we have focused on ensuring our preparedness for any regulatory CQC inspections through the monitoring of the completion of the 'Must Do' and 'Should Do' actions which were highlighted through the CQC inspection which took place in 2017. Progress against these actions is monitored through the Joint Compliance Board (which is emerging into a Quality Improvement Group) and an auditing programme is in place to ensure improvements are sustained. We are hopeful that the CQC recognises the progress that we have made as an organisation at the forthcoming CQC Well Led inspection which is due to take place in June 2019. I n March 2019 we officially launched our brand new set of values shared across Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, NHS North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group, and North Cumbria University Ho spitals NHS Trust, they are: Kindness Respect Ambition Collaboration 108 We are currently focusing on ways in which these values can become more embedded into practice; activities to support this include the review of appraisal documentation to ensure the values are built into discussions with members of staff. W e remain committed to the four long term goals we have set: To consistently deliver the highest quality of services we can; To ensure we are fulfilling the potential of all of our staff, patient s, families and carers; To improve and transform services with our partners; To be relentlessly efficient and effective to ensure we are financially sustainable. T he key highlights as detailed in this quality report for 2018/19 include: Development of a system wide suicide prevention plan with associated multi - agency action plan Skills - based training on risk management and suicide prevention (STORM) training now provided to over 300 staff Consistently achieving significantly better that the national average in terms of harmfree care as monitored through the Classic Safety Thermometer Implementation of the Mental Health and Medication Safety Thermometers Further developed a suite of Quality and Safety Dashboard which are used from the ward to the board in terms of the identification and triangulation of key concerns Developed a joint e learning Duty of Candour training for all staff to complete, which includes a focus on Just Culture and Human Factors O ur focus for 2019/20, based on our strategic plans, feedback from our patients, staff and our communities, and from our CQC regulatory inspections will be: The development of a system wide 5 year Quality Strategy and associated Plan, which has four key aims: 1.Focus on culture: journey to Just and improvement culture 2.Continuously seek out a reduce patient harm 3.Deliver what matters most to patients, families and carers through positiveexperiences when accessing our services 4.Evidence our ongoing improvement journey through getting to 'Good' and strivin g for 'Outstanding' in CQC ratings Continue to focus and learn from incidents and events to continuously improve theservices that we provide Strengthening our clinical governance arrangements both as a merged organisationand the system 109 Part 2: Priorities fo r improvement and statements of assurance from the Board of Directors 2.1 Priorities for improvement Progress against 2018/19 priorities for improvement set out in last year's Quality Report: Current Leadership & Governance Arrangements Executive lead is System Executive Chief Nurse for both Trusts on behalf of the Board. Each of the Associate Directors of Nursing is accountable for the progress and activity against trust wide key priority areas. Progress and development/ improvement are through the care groups supported and monitored by the Head of Clinical Governance and Clinical Governance Team. Repor ting is via the care group and aligned Trust Wide Clinical Governance groups. Priority area for quality and nursing as set out in the 2017/18 business plan objectives, and agreed by Board of Directors in March 2017. Quality Priority 2018/2019 Progress Preventing people from dying prematurely as a consequence of suicide Rationale: In Cumbria, on average, one person dies each week as a result of suicide accounting for around 50 suicides per year. Rates of suicide in males are more than three times higher than in females in Cumbria. Nationally, male and female suicide rates are greater in those aged 45-49 years. Suicide in England re mains one of the leading causes of premature death. Nationally the target is to reduce suicides by 10% to 2020 Current Progress: Continue to complete data collection on suspected suicides for people known to our services and triangulate with other relevant information. This has now been added as an action from the Mortality Review Meeting so that suspected suicides can be added to the reporting process. Progress update The agreed process and information sharing to support the process have been an issue wi th a request by central governance to \"put this on hold\" for further discussion in the next mortality review meeting. The next mortality review meeting is not yet planned due to this moving from a single organisation meeting to a joint meeting. The process is therefore 111 not yet working fully as agreed, causing delays in data collection process. Action - requested date for next mortality review meeting; discussed in joint suicide prevention meeting. A joint rev iew from across organisational real -time data has been undertaken and is being presented at a multiagency meeting in response to concerns relating to the high number of deaths by suspected suicide and drug related deaths of females in Copeland. This report was completed by 31/03/2019 and presented at th e SQAC meeting in April. The report author has noted gaps in the report due to the above issues. Continue to support implementation of the Integrated Care System ( ICS) plan for suicide prevention (CPFT/NCUHT suicide prevention plan is intrinsically linked to this). This will be monitored through the Cumbria Multi -Agency Suicide Prevention Leadership Group. Progress update The system wide North East & North Cumbria zero suicide ambition - Every Life Matters plan was signed off in the January 2019 regional steering group. Summa ry of the related work streams Enabler work streams 1. Leadership - To develop a regional and sub- regional framework, linking local activity to national with wide engagement. (Leadership) 2. Communication and engagement - To enable the successful delivery of the plan at all levels across the region. (Leadership) 3. Research - To work in collaboration with university partners to carry out an applied research project linked to the implementation of an agreed aspect of the plan. (Intelligence) ICS priority work streams - These work streams will bring together good practice across the region: 1. Develop system wide competency. (Prevention) 2. Real time alerts and better use of data. (Intelligence) 3. Learning from deaths and near misses. (Intelligence) 4. Targeting High Risk groups (Prevention/Intervention) 5. Postvention support. (Postvention) Sub- regional / local priority work streams: 1. Delivering safer services - based on the 10 key elements to improve safety. (Intervention) 112 2. Developing safer communities. ( Prevention) The Cumbria multiagency plan and updated strategy was signed off in the Cumbria Multiagency suicide prevention leadership group in January 2019 - this strategy, led by Public Health, is currently going for ratification at the Health an d Wellbeing Board . Our plan was reviewed in the November meeting and the zero suicide plan for 2019/20 was agreed at the March 2019 meeting. This plan is based on the national confidential enquiry 20 year review and 10 recommendations for safer services which we have self -assessed against in 2018. The zero suicide plan for MH inpatients has been picked up by the MH care group. STORM training for 24 CAMHs staff was completed in January 2019 with further training planned. Monthly STORM program of training for Adult MH continues, with some difficulty releasing staff for training/cancelation by staff causing some training sessions to be cancelled due to poor attendance. A program of suicide alertness training for non -specialist MH staff continues with good attendance. A suicide prevention training coordinator is now in post to support the program of training. Implement National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide findings as per plan. The outstanding actions from previous audits have been collated/up dated (January 19) and incorporated into our overarching Suicide Prevention Plan. Progress update The 2018 National confidential enquiry audit action plan has been signed off as complete. Following publication of the 2018 inquiry report the 2019 action plan has been developed and was agreed in March. Actions from the audit plan are monitored through the steering group and are based on the 10 recommendations for safer services. Showcase film from our suicide prevention conference. Progress - complete. T he film has now been received and shared through the SP steering group for wider sharing across teams. Phase 1 of the ICC project (Designing a Suicide safety culture in ICC's) is complete and the proposal for phase 2 implementation is being presented at t he Mental Health ICC steering Group. 113 Progress update Suicide prevention lead will attend a workshop planned for 11 April 2019 developing the model primary care MH and suicide prevention has been included following discussions and presentations relating to the model over the previous quarter. Develop post -vention staff support plan. Engagement for improvement plan. Progress - This project is now complete following multiagency workshops. The proposal is being written up and presented at a CLIC event in May 2019. This is being linked with the ICS work stream to implement post vention support for people affected by suicide, including staff. Next Steps Complete the real time alert report and implement the agreed pathway to support this - ongoing. To complete, i mplement and monitor the zero suicide for MH inpatients plan. To present and implement the staff support engagement for improvement project. Continue to progress integration of CPFT SP plan across wider system to ensure services are fully engaged with the wider program of priority areas for improvement. To review the governance framework for suicide prevention reporting to enable appropriate engagement and assurance is in place across services. Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm Rationale: It is well recognised that patients can experience avoidable harm within health care settings. Avoidable harm is best described as that which could have been avoided through the actions of health care staff. Examples of avoidable harm include pressure ul cers, falls, venous thromboembolism (VTE), medication errors and hospital acquired infections. It is important to note that not all of these incidents necessarily cause harm and not all occurrences are avoidable. Current Progress: Harm Free Care The l atest Harm Free Care data published on the NHS Safety Thermometer is for February 2019 below is a summary of our performance compared with all organisations: 114 We have consistently performed above the national average on the majority of the safety indicators to date, however there has been a noticeable deterioration of performance against the national average for the last three months. From September the process for data entry changed, with each individual team having to input their own data directly onto the national safety thermometer site, with no ability for the senior team, Risk Management or BI to check completeness of submission and intervene if not complete. A Q uarter 4 audit has flagged that submission rates from some teams has reduced and this may in part explain the deterioration. Urgent actions have been put in place to rectify this for April 2019. However the care group has seen an increase in low grade pressure ulcer reporting across the system, most noticeably i n Workington Care Home sector. The D istrict Nurse team in Workington believe this to be multifaceted, with a new care home manager in one of the largest homes focused on pressure ulcers, training from the TVNs in the Workington area and the React to Red packs being distributed by the CCG across North Cumbria. The Quality and Safety Leads continue to scrutinise each pressure ulcer incident form and are looking for further trends. Community Hospitals are now routinely inputting to the NHS Medication Safety Thermometer, this commenced in January 2019. FALLS Work continues to embed all of the development work around the Prevention and Management of Slips, Trips and Falls as outlined in the All Organisations Feb 19 % CPFT % Feb 2019 CPFT % Jan 19 CPFT % Dec 18 Harm Free Care 93.9 93.3 94 91.8 Harm Free Care (New) 97.8 100 97.8 97.5 Pressure Ulcers (All) 4.6 6.7 5.2 7.5 Pressure Ulcers (New) 1 0 1.4 1.4 All Falls 1.6 2 .9 0.4 Falls with Harm 0.5 0 .5 0 Catheterisation 14.4 14.1 8.6 11.1 Catheter Acquired UTI 0.7 0 0 1.1 VTE 0.5 0 0 0 115 Trust Policy POL/001/048. We continue to embed the Falls Risk Assessment and Management Plan (FRAMP) within all of our inpatient units (community, mental health and learning disability units) and in the patient's home, as well as continuing to embed supportive initiatives born out of our SIRI investigations, such as our Call don't Fall prompts. The Community Care Group has reviewed all of the 147 falls in a Community Hospital between September 2018 and February 2019 inclusive. The majority of these were classified as low harm, demonstrating the month on month improvement we are making to reduce falls with harm. Of the 4 falls that were categorised as moderate or serious harm, all were reviewed and one proceeded to SIRI. There were no particular common themes from these falls - contributing factors included mental frailty and dementia and underlying pathological factors. The fall that resulted in a SIRI has led to a facilities review of washing and drying of wet floors which has been shared across all care groups from both Trusts . Plans going forward into the new financial year include: CPFT Q&S leads to join the falls steering Group Plan for a joint fall policy for both Trusts Falls CQUIN target to be considered New sensor pads sourced Success: The FRAMP is now well established on the wards and staff are using this well. Patients medications are reviewed and where possible medication is discontinued to reduce falls risk. Wards consistent with incident reporting for falls and application of DoC Pressure Ulcers Work continues to embed all the recent developments around Pressure Ulcer and the CPFT Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Management Policy (July 2017- Aug 2020) POL/001/069 has been updated. Pressure ulcers in the community care group continue to be the largest group of incidents being reported, due to the fact that t he policy requires all levels of pressure harm to be incident reported. The majority of pressure ulcer incidents reported are low harm, with moderate and severe harm incidents resulting in an investigation being 116 carried out by the team to draw out learn ing and any improvement to practice. Common learning areas from the 72 hour Themes include: Failure to use or delay in use of clinical tools Poor communication between practitioners and providers Delay in reporting A shift of much more complex poorly patients being successfully managed in the community setting resulting in admission avoidance and early discharge Future plans include: Consideration of the required TVN model across the integrated organisation Standardisation of training and audit Need to share learning, review of policies & products to standardise practice and development of new initiatives Continue embedding A.V.O.I.D and support the CCG roll out of the React to Red packs in residential and nursing home settings Monitor the trends as more care is delivered in the home environment Success over the last quarter: Some residential homes have remained pressure harm free for over a year Community Teams are starting to report green pressure ulcer safety crosses monthly, indicating the prog ress made in preventing avoidable harms Infection Prevention On the back of the Clinical Skills training, the Infection Prevention Team have supported the update from National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) to NEWS2 across all services and the roll out of es sential equipment to carry out NEWS2 in the community setting. Antiseptic Non Touch Technique ( ANTT ) continues to be embedded across all services and is arguably, coupled with the work to introduce HOUDINI (catheter protocol) and Catheter Passports, responsible for our improved safety and continued low and below national rate of catheter acquired infections within the community setting, as demonstrated in the safety ther mometer graph below (red line): 117 Local outbreaks count of infection such as Norovirus may cause potential harm and possible other health care associated infection when acquired on wards. All incidents are assessed using root cause analysis, findings and subsequent action plans are presen ted at the Quality and Safety Committee and the Infection Prevention Committee . The implementation of the subsequent actions are managed through individual Care Group Governance mechanisms. Diabetes and Insulin Administration The newly developed insuli n booklet and administration record have now been embedded by teams across the county and in our inpatient settings. Progress and incident data continues to be monitored and feed into future evaluation of the work and the new medication dashboard allows us to monitor trends around insulin administration errors more effectively. There has been a 12 month review of the insulin booklets and insulin incidents completed in March 2019. This report will be ratified via the Community Care Group Governance meeti ng in April 2019. The Summary findings include: Over the last 12 months in North Cumbria there were approx. 246,000 community nursing contacts with patients. The current number of daily insulin visits to administer insulin in North Cumbria Community nursi ng teams is 235 visits per day. A total of 68 Insulin incidents were reported between January 2018- January 2019 by the community care group: an incident rate of 0.0008% of all insulin visits. All 68 incidents were individually screened and the key themes were: Prescription Dispensing Administration, (omission or additional, incorrect insulin administration). Two of the 68 incidents resulted in 72 hr reviews being generated and duty of candour being applied. None of those 68 insulin incidents proceeded to SIRI investigations. In this review 60% of the insulin errors were near misses due to staff detecting a risk, raising their concerns and not going ahead with administering the insulin as initially indicated. 118 BI Quality and Safety Dashboards We continue to embed the Quality & Safety Dashboards and the ability to measure preventable harm in real time at the click of a button on every desktop. New power BI, quality and safety dashboards which can be accessed by all staff and provide system wide data which can be drilled down from organisational level to care group, service and team are in place across all the community, mental health and children's services. The dashboards provide real -time data across the ra nge of clinical governance topics including: risk, incidents, training, clinical audit, complaints and compliments. Real time data around all incidents with specific focus and individual dashboards for safeguarding, mortality, falls, pressure ulcers and m edication incidents provide clinicians and managers with a detailed visual tool to monitor patient safety issues and trends. These dashboards recently provided the community care group with an early warning to a deteriorating position in a district nurs ing team, enabling the care group to take swift supportive action to prevent further deterioration and patient harm, by rapidly identifying the situation and implementing supportive business continuity measures to protect, patients and staff. Next Steps As we move into the new financial year the focus will be on how we combine the learning and best practice from CPFT with the learning and best practice in NCUH and bring all of the patient safety work together in a more co- ordinated way so that learning and actions are system based, cross pathways on the new care group footing rather than on an organisational footprint. Building health resilience in children and young people Rationale: The health and resilience of children and young people is important not only for health and wellbeing in childhood but significantly for adulthood too. Nationally we know that the level of emotional resilience in young people has changed with increasing rates of mental ill health evidenced through self-harm. The same pict ure is seen in Cumbria with increasing demand for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servi ces (CAMHS) seen year on year. Therefore developing emotional resilience is a key priority for the County and, as the provider of universal child health services through to 119 specialist (tier 3) CAMHS, the Trust has a significant role to play within a multi- agency strategy. The health needs of Children Looked After (CLA) - this group of children is the most vulnerable in the county and most at risk in relation to physic al health and emotional health. This group of children are also at increased risk of childhood sexual exploitation which is an area that we continue to focus on in the year ahead. Current Progress: A robust weekly data collection continues to be in plac e for looked after children with a focus on quality performance and patient experience. A CLA Health and Emotional Well -Being annual report for 2017/18 was completed and submitted to the Quality and Safety Committee in November 2018. A further data update was also submitted to the QSC in February 2019. This provides fuller and more detailed information than can be presented within this report chapter. Initial Health Assessments (IHAs) completed for CLA - there continue to be some challenges getting the IHAs completed in the last quarter. Performance for IHAs continues to be variable and is dependent on the number of available foster placements within Cumbria and the notification and consent received from the County Council. Whilst performance in Septe mber and October 2018 was over target the position has deteriorated with 9 of the 15 children in January 2019 placed out of Cumbria. The late notification of children becoming looked after can be a factor in delayed assessments as well as factors such as: Delays in receiving the consents from the Social Workers. Foster carers or family carers failing to attend the appointment. Some young people have refused to attend for assessment. Delays in being allocated an IHA appointment for Cumbrian CLA placed in other Local Authorities. The CLA service continues to be fully integrated into the Strengthening Families team. To help address some of these issues all relevant staff are now trained in undertaking the necessary reviews and meeting health statutory responsibilities. The new allocation of CLA slots in all paediatrician clinics is established and with the exception of the West team there is more than sufficient capacity to meet the demand. Wherever possible the Clinical Director (CD) and Associate Medical Direc tor (AMD) also provide urgent appointments to see children where there has been late notification or repeated cancellation or Did Not 120 Attend (DNA). Two qualified nurses have also now completed their IHA training and are undertaking their supervised practic e, once full competence is achieved this will provide further flexibility for sibling groups and to visit children placed in neighbouring counties. Performance continues to be managed on a weekly basis by the Clinical Service Manager and Performance Manag er with monthly oversight at the Care Group Governance meeting. There remains a challenge in achieving more integration with Social care which has been escalated to a system level and is fully supported by the Designated nurses from both North and South Cl inical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). This also includes addressing issues with Cumbria County Council (CCC) regarding the Egress email account system and an Information Sharing Agreement between CPFT and CCC has been updated accordingly, but still requires CCC sign off. Limited and reduced access to the ICS system for the Strengthening Families (SF) team has now been jointly agreed and will remain limited to the health information only. IHAs completed for October, November, December 2018 (Q3) were at 85.63% overall performance which is an improvement from Q2 which was 64.7%. With the agreed processes in place, continued close monitoring, and the plan for improved receipt of consent information for IHAs it is expected that the IHA performance will improve and remain at a satisfactory level. In Cumbria we have a joint pathway between Health and Social Care to achieve the early identification of emotional health and wellbeing needs through the use of 'Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires so early help can be implemented following discussions with Social Worker, Carer and other Professionals working with the child or young person. An SDQ is completed within 3 months of the Child or Young Person becoming Looked After, as early identification and support of any problems helps to improve outcomes. In pre- school children all children in Cumbria are assessed and reviewed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social and Emotional to identify the emotional health of the young child. The analytical narrative of this is included in the review health assessment and the resulting health care plan. This informs part of the quality assurance process. Throughout this financial year steps continue to be in place to ensure CLA are 'fast -tracked' for both initial assess ments and for therapy within the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). This will continue as usual despite the recent changes regarding the CAMHS service now sitting within the Mental Health (MH) Care 121 Group and no longer within children and fami lies. This will need to be further assessed as the care group is on a trajectory to be aligned with the North Tyne and Wear MH Trust by October 2019. The Standard 'routine' CAMHS CHOICE (initial assessment) appointments have an in service target of 35 days, and CLA are still receiving a service within 15 working days with urgent cases being assessed in 24 hours by the CAMHS Crisis, Assessment and Intervention service (CAIS). The implementation of a single point of access for Tier 2 and 3 children's men tal health services with a standard operating procedure continues to be in place for the County. There has also been an issue with no process for escalation of DNAs. The process for DNA has been reviewed by the responsible strategic Paediatrician lead for CLA. The standard operating procedure (SOP) was written to include the required process and incorporated support from Cumbria County Council to populate and implement. For young people who DNA, follow up is now via the telephone and health information is then sent to a young person over the age of 14, or earlier if the young person has expressed a wish to receive information directly, with details of how to contact the CLA Health Team. The SF practitioner will liaise with Social Workers, carers, birth f amilies, health professionals and key workers to ascertain the young people's health needs. This has led to some examples of good practice where joint visits with social workers for example, are undertaken, which have successfully led to completion of init ial and review health assessments. All other actions from the last quarterly report were completed. Additional Information: During this year we have introduced an action on the health care plans of all children and young people who have IHAs in Cumbria, following agreement from Cumbrian GPs. The carer will be asked to make an appointment with the GP to discuss the Initial Health Assessment and discuss with the GP any concerns they have about the child or young person's health within 6 weeks of the assess ment being completed. This has been of value for carers who have looked after children who have enduring health needs. We are also moving towards using a RiO (Trust electronic patient record system) generated Patient Tracker List (PTL) each week to monitor the performance status of each child's IHA, and have divided this data into 3 main areas - Cumb rian children placed in Cumbria; Cumbria n children placed out of county; and non- Cumbrian children placed into Cumbria. 122 Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) CSE cont inues to be a priority Safeguarding Children's Board (LSCB): A CSE 'chapter' is held on our Safeguarding intranet for access by all our staff and information is also available on the Cumbria LSCB website and CSE is integral in Safeguardi ng training. Practitioners working with young people also attend the Cumbria LSCB CSE face to face training. There is also a CSE tracker function now available on the electronic patient record RiO. Risk assessments for CSE are fundamental in Sexual Health services and the Spotting the Signs assessment is available and used by practitioners. Reporting of CSE incidents and concerns is via Ulysses and this would alert the Safeguarding team and Children and Family care group management team. The practitioner ca n then be supported and receive supervision support as required. The LSCB CSE oversight group is attended by Specialist Nurse for Safeguarding and Safeguarding Lead for Sexual Health. This highlights children that are deemed high risk from a Police and Children Social Care perspective. Alerts are put on health care systems which allows staff to identify if there is a plan of support around the young person so that practitioners can link with the support team as necessary. The strategic LSCB CSE group is att ended by the designated nurse for safeguarding. The CSE LSCB Working group is attended by the Named Nurse for Safeguarding Children. Support for management and highlighting complex CSE cases are discussed with the safeguarding team and complex cases that need to be escalated would either follow the LSCB escalation guidance and/or be discussed with the Designated Nurse. Children and Families Care Group Patient Experience: The Trust's Patient Experience Team (PET) have been producing monthly reports for car e groups which includes the data and information on the compliments and complaints received which is both quantitative and qualitative. A shorter version 'report on a page' and most importantly the lessons learned/changes to practice from complaints is also on the Care Group Governance meeting agenda each month and disseminated to the Integrated team managers meeting for the frontline staff meetings. The Quality & Safety dashboards have also been significantly improved to include compliments as well as complaints. In addition to this there is now an allocated complaints lead within the care group for oversight of any learning and actions completed as the result of 123 a complaint so that the care group can be assured that all actions are completed and to give assurance of ongoing service development and quality improvements accordingly. Next Steps : The Strengthening Families team will continue to monitor performance weekly and any drop in performance identified will be highlighted to the Specialist Nurses for further action. A training needs analysis was undertaken to identify the training needs of the team. CAMHS and Childrens Learning Disability Services were formally transferred under the management of the mental health care group as of the 1 November 2018 with a plan for this care group to be formally held within the Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW) on 1 October 2019. Ensuring people have appropriate and timely access to services based on need Rationale: 'Appropriate access' means \"are people getting direct access to the right service for their needs?\" Across our services we have worked hard to enable timely access to our services. This has been prioritised due to the increasing demand on services and the universal issue of recruitment difficulties in Cumbria - especially for specialist roles. Current Progress: There are a range of access standards across the Trust derived either from the NHS Constitution, our regulators, or developed locally through CQUIN schemes. At present we do not report access standards for all Trust services. The Trust was not required to set and achieve improvement trajectories for A&E 4hr wait, Referral to Treatment (18wks) or Referral to Diagnostics (6wks), but was expected t o maintain the national standards achieved in the previous year (17/18). We achieved this i n 2018/19, however it should be noted that the Trust's Type 3 A&E performance has been reported combined with NCUH since September 2017. Mental Health Early Intervention in Psychosis team have to achieve the national standard of 50% for Referral to Treatment in 2 weeks of referral for the 2018/19 year. CAMHS Urgent access has maintained performance over target throughout the 2018/19 year, in what has been a challenging year for the service due to capacity issues and increasing demand. 124 CAMHS are establishing the Eating Disorder pathway and improving data capture to enable more accurate reporting of the CYP -ED RTT targets in the coming year. Following the changes to the data capture definitions used by clinicians agreed with commissioners in February 2018, the First Step service has achieved stable performance for 6 week Referral to Treatment above the national 75% target for the full 2018/19 year. Community/Spec ialist We have achieved performance above the 95% target for A&E 4 hour wait, performing consistently above 98% during 2018/19. It should be noted that the Trust's Type 3 A&E performance has been reported combined with NCUH since September 2017. Referral to Treatment (RTT) position for consultant -led services has sustained performance over the 92% threshold over the full 2018/19 year, with the majority of the services reported from the Community & Specialist care group. The new North Cumbria Musculoskelet al service has been included in 2018/19 performance. Achievement of the target by Neurosciences continues to be challenging due to continued resource issues, the service continues to rely on locum consultant workforce. As a result, although the Trust overall has performed over the national standard, performance has deteriorated during 2018/19. Children and Families The Consultant -led Paediatrics service has sustained RTT performance over the 92% threshold, and consistently over 96% in 2018/19 . Performance for CLA Initial Health Assessments has been challenging in 2018/19, and has struggled to achieve the 85% commissioner set target in most months of 2018/19. This indicator is subject to some factors which are beyond the Trust's control (e.g. timescale for IHA for Cumbrian children placed out of county, large fluctuations in numbers becoming looked after month- to-month etc). The Children's Audiology service has continued to achieve the national standard of 99% Referral to Diagnostic, dropping under the target by only 0.1% once in the full 2018/19 year. Next Steps: CAMHS are currently working closely with NTW on a recovery plan, and discussions are starting with Commissioners regarding the relaxing of the current commissioner set Access targets in favour of a focus on Referral to Treatment times for this service. 125 CAMHS Eating Disorder Referral to Treatment data capture continues to be developed with the Service to improve reportable data for commissioners and national statistics. Services subject to Access ta rgets continue to work closely with the Business Intelligence and Data Quality teams to assure their data for inclusion in performance indicators. Ensuring people have a positive experience of care through better use of feedback and patient involvement and engagement Rationale: We collect a lot of feedback from our patients and carers on their levels of satisfaction with our services. We also use a range of approaches to engage with patients and carers led by our Patient Experience Team. We recognise and endeavour to use patient feedback as a core quality indicator. We need to aim to work with patients as partners both in their own care and in service design and delivery. Current Progress: Patient stories shared to the Board each month. In April there was a focused Board story related to least restrictive interventions to raise the profile of both staff and patient experience to the Board. The Triangle of Care initiative has been approved and signed up too, with current trajectory ahead of target. The MHLD and CAMHS teams have completed the self -assessment and identifying team carer's champions. Quarter 1 in 2019 will see this being rolled out to community services although the CHMART are already undertaking this work which has almost completed. A carer's conference is being considered for 2019. This work is being joined up with the third sector network in Cumbria for a systems approach with Cumbria Volunteer network. The Participation Strategy is currently on hold as this will now be system wide following the ICS arrangements. The complaints dashboard is now accessible to care groups giving overview of the responsiveness to complaints and the ability to identify and address any trends and is now embedded across the care group. Bespoke complaints training is being delivered to care groups to support complaint responses being improved and completed within the timescales. Within MHLD, a second cohort of staff from CAMHS and LD have undertaken the training with good feedback. There is a significant improvement in compliance with the completion of complaints investigations within the specified timescales and also the quality of reports and letters to the complainant has improved. Changes to the policy of SIRI and complaints has been made following feedback from carers and families which has made it 126 simpler when a complaint is received at the same time as a SIRI has been declared. Within MHLD, the community survey has been completed for 2018 and is on track from 2019, which has g iven the opportunity for bespoke feedback across the community services. This year, the service has also completed an inpatient survey. Bespoke networks within MHLD have developed systems and processes to collect experience as opposed to feedback. This has helped shape service priorities. An extended Listening Event schedule was also put in place to support the due diligence process within MHLD. The PET visit the MHLD wards independently to take specific patient feedback during patient's admission and this has made a significant difference to being able to address patients concerns. Community ward meetings have helped to shape ward improvements. The summary on a page of complaint and compliment information alongside the FFT has been helpful for teams to revi ew as part of their team and governance meetings within MHLD. There has been work undertaken by CMHART in relation to the FFT as patients have traditionally engaged with the community survey rather than the FFT. As a result of this work we are seeing an increase in FTT feedback which has been helpful to teams. There are bespoke pieces of work in relation to how we engage with services users. This has begun in LD services and is planned to start for CAMHS. Next Steps: Next steps include supporting a posit ive culture change and moving from collecting patient feedback to using feedback as part of service improv ement. This work commencing in Q uarter 1, 2019/20 will be based on the ladder of participation- moving from capturing patient satisfaction to co - production o Quarter 1 - scoping and options paper to capture network priorities area o Quarter 2 - network survey to capture where each care group and network leadership team currently are on the ladder of participation. o Quarter 3 - Share results with TWCGG/ Board and agree top 3 priorities and implementation plan for each care group. o Quarter 4 - review, amend and adapt leaflets available across the organisations. The second priority is the role out of the Triangle of Care phase 2 which will help to support tha t we are ensuring involvement of 127 families and carers as appropriate when assessing and planning care. During this phase it is planned to complete a carer's conference in partnership with the third sector. A programme of Learning Disability access reviews (was audit) continues, led by the Associate Director of Nursing for Specialist Services and the Quality Governance Projects Manager. These reviews have been developed to identify potential opportunities to improve access for people with a learning disabili ty to all services. This work also supports the assurance process associated with Learning Disability Access NHS Improvement indicator. A Public Governor, who has a learning disability, takes part in the audit process. Feedback from these reviews has been really positive and staff have engaged well with them. The term audit was changed to 'review' to ensure that they are seen as a joint process between the reviewing team and staff teams. Our focus for 2019/20, based on our strategic plans, feedback from our patients, staff and our communities, and from our CQC regulatory inspections will be: The development of a system wide 5 year Quality Strategy and associated 2019/20 Plan, which has four key aims: o Focus on culture: journey to Just and improvemen t culture o Continuously seek out a reduce patient harm o Deliver what matters most to patients, families and carers through positive experiences when accessing our services Evidence our ongoing improvement journey through getting to 'Good' and striving for 'Outstanding' in CQC ratings Continue to focus and learn from incidents and events to continuously improve the services that we provide; Strengthening our clinical governance arrangements both as a merged organisation and the system; Develop and implement Nursing, Midwifery and AHP strategy Duty of C andour The Trust has in place a policy and process which meet the statutory requirements of Regulation 20 of the Health and Social Care Act (2008) Regulated Activities (2014). Here is a link to the Trust's Be ing Open and Duty of Candour policy: https://cdn.cumbriapartnership.nhs.uk/uploads/policy - documents/Being_Open_and_Duty_of_Candour_Policy_POL- CLIN- 001.docx_.pdf The objective of the Trust's policy is to ensure that following an incident where harm or a near miss to a patient has occurred, there is appropriate communication, investigation and support provided for the patient, their relatives and staff. The type and level of 128 communication and support provided will be dependent on the severity and nature of the incident. Freedom to Speak Up Guardian Freedom to Speak up Guardians have a pivotal role in helping to raise the profile of speaking up and raising concerns in their own organisation, and provide a supportive, confidential advice and support service to staff. The FTSU process is to act as conduit to raise concerns in an appropriate forum and is not there to replace other mechanisms for staff to raise concerns, such as through their line manager, through incident reporting, and through the Raising a Concern or Whistleblowing process. Following the guidelines of the FTSU report, the FTSU Guardian role is independent of management and able to hold the Trust Bo ard to account. They are supported by the Trust Board to create an open culture which is based on listening and learning and not blaming In the Trust, there is a dedicated FTSU Guardian, and the role is supported by nominated FTSU Ambassadors. Lessons co ntinue to be learnt and feedback gathered from those who have used the FTSU Guardian service to raise concerns particularly about patient safety and behaviours. To raise awareness of the role and to further support staff there is: Dedicated e mail addres s to contact the FTSU Guardian. Permanent screensaver reminder of FTSU service Corporate presentation available for all staff to use with their teams Promotional leaflet New promotional posters to be placed around both organisations Appointment of ambassadors Work continues to develop the open and transparent culture that is necessary to encourage staff to raise matters, and for speaking up to be business as usual. The resulting number of formal cases suggests that staff feel comfortable to raise matters and that informal resolution is achieved in most cases. It is important to remain focused on feedback from individuals who have raised, and relevant stakeholders within the process, to ensure the current policy captures the spirit of the Trust's values, and staff feel they can raise concerns or issues without fear of victimisation, blame or reprisal. Anonymous surveys are conducted where people who have raised concerns can respond to a series of questions, including whether they were subjected to any detri mental behaviour following the concern being raised; whether they felt that by following the process there was a positive outcome; and also if they feel that they would feel confident to raise a concern through this route again. 129 Rota Gaps We are currently implementing our People Plan for the developing IHCS for North Cumbria. Development of this strategic delivery plan over 2019 - 2025 will be undertaken through co- production by the whole system, with the first action plan for 2019- 20 aligned with the curr ent business planning cycle. This strongly links workforce with service and financial plans, focussed upon the merging Trusts and associated organisations. We have taken care in the strategy to ensure that we are not simply trying to solve the problems of 2019 or 2020. Instead, the strategy identifies the objectives which need to be achieved to ensure that we have the optimum number of workforce, with the best mix of skills, for the issues that will exist in 2025. The objectives therefore must allow for flexibility in how they will be implemented over the next five years. Engagement has taken place with Care Groups and System Leaders to ensure that transformational Business Cases are balanced with operational pressures affecting service delivery and patient flow, to develop a programme of workforce activity over the short and medium terms . Our approach to managing bank, agency and locum spend has been nationally recognised as an exemplar leading to a reduction in our temporary workforce and s ignificant cost improvements. This work is now being considered wider into Community and Primary Care, to provide alternative workforce models to support traditional roles and fill workforce gaps. A recent recruitment campaign has also resulted in the successful appointment of a number of International Clinical Fellows who will arrive in June 2019 to help fill our longstanding vacancies and support our existing medical workforce. With increasing workloads and a workforce seeking flexible working patterns, we need to consider different skill mixes and roles for the workforce of the future in order to meet changes in the complexity of conditions and patient outcomes. Gaps in our workforce lead to over reliance on agency and bank staff, which places further pressure on permanent teams to provide continuity, safety and assurance and at increased cost. In response to national skills shortages and the local rural/geographical challenges we face, transform ation and redesign of our services will be critical to ensure we continue to deliver sustainable, high quality services for our patients with the resources we have. This will be supported by targeted attraction campaigns, an overhaul of our recruitment processes and effective on- boarding, which are all currently being developed. 130 Mortality Review - Learning from Deaths There is a dedicated trust wide Mortality Review Steering Group in place and a trust policy in place to support learning from deaths: https://cdn.cumbriapartnership.nhs.uk/uploads/policy -documents/Learning_from_D eaths_Policy_POL- 001-078.pdf Quarterly reporting to the Board of Directors around Mortality continues.

As of 1 April 2018, the Trust now captures all deaths on Ulysses, as per the Learning f rom Deaths Policy. ** Each care group uses a SJR and SIRI template to be able to identify if there are any contributory factors or root causes for the incident. The avoidability score (table below) is used to determine how avoidable the death was and an explanation around this. SJR avo idability ratings are discussed and agreed by the Care Group Senior Leadership Teams, and reviewed by the Mortality Review Steering Group. As of 1 April 2018, all SIRI investigation panels will decide on this scoring, and a record kept of the scores and ra tionale. Score 3 or below would be regarded as meeting criteria for 27.3 and 27.8 above: a) Please indicate using the scoring system below: Score 1 Definitely avoidable Score 2 Strong evidence of avoidability Score 3 Probably avoidable (more than 50 /50) Score 4 Possibly avoidable but not very likely (less than 50/50) Score 5 Slight evidence of avoidability Score 6 Definitely not avoidable (b) Please include a brief explanation below: 133 Key Findings from Structured Judgement Reviews completed (Q1 - Q4 2018/2019): Learning from reported deaths is coordinated through the steering group, which is attended by representatives from all care groups. Specific points of learning following SJR's and investigations are managed and monitored through the care group clinical governance arrangements. 27.4 Summary of learning and notable practice include: Community Services Care Group All of the SJRs highlighted some really good End of Life Care (EoL) care including: o Rapid and thorough intervention o Thoughtful and compassionate communication o Evidence Based MDT care o Support to family o Where problems accessing consultant appointments arose, patient and family were supported to resolve issues o Open visiting in place o Assessment of capacity in place o Worked with residential care to reduce physical risks (pressure ulcers, wound care and mobility) o Good evidence of DNACPR discussions Specialist Services Care Group SJRs - all on patients on specialist palliative care unit, reviewed by mul tiple medical professionals and all with a confirmed palliative diagnosis. Observations - really good communication with families, care is responsive to needs. Some patients have a complex journey with multiple admissions/handovers. We have a number of re ferral forms/pathways in place. Teams respond to the referrals in a timely manner - within 48 hours in all cases reviewed, 72 hour report / SIRI - The Diabetes team are aware of incidents of young people with Type 1 diabetes in Cumbria who have died of D KA, since 2016. Commonalities in the DKA deaths include them being looked after children, evidence of self -neglect, potential abuse, very low BMI. The third case was at a transition point from leaving home to independent living and had learning difficulties and other physical health needs. Mental Health Teams have identified that referral processes into their services can be complicated and will re share referral pathways regarding primary point of access. Mental Health Care Group Communication with famil ies and the GP was good and in one example very proactive care from the CHMART who continued to have contact whilst in the acute settings. 27.5 Actions taken during the reporting period, and those actions proposed going forwards, from what has been learned from SJR's and Investigations undertaken: 134 Community As well as the SJRs we have completed 72 hour review's on a number of deaths The quality of incident reporting has been monitored and has been noted to be improving Teams supported thorough the quality and safety leads with reporting and reviewing of deaths To share widely through care group governance meetings Specialist To review rebooking system processes in Physical Health Psychology to ensure appointments are offer ed within accepted timescal es. Our Acquired Brain Injury and Physical Health Psychology Service utilise differing risk assessment which could be beneficial to other services. A recommendation regarding the development of a pathway regarding the management of people with persistent pain and long term mental health conditions and acknowledges the potential risk of suicide at all stages was made, discussions are underway across services to progress this. Mental Health Reminding about care plans need to include physical care. This is already included in the care planning training that is being rolled out within the care group. 27.6 Assessment of the impact of actions taken: Community Services An improving picture of both reporting and the quality of the incident reports Specialist Services Following SIRI recommendation, Diabetes Team now have access to RIO patient data system to enable better communication and sharing of information with Mental Health Services. Mental Health Positive action taken by the care group in relation to p hysical health care monitoring. Next Steps - To develop a joint reporting and monitoring process between the Trust and North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust. 2.2 Statements of assurance from the Board of Directors Statement of coverage During 2018/19 the Trust provided and/or sub- contracted the following NHS services: 135 All general community services, including: Children's services General community nursing and palliative care services Inpatient community services on 6 sites Rehabilitati on services Community outpatient services Diabetes services Various services focused on health promotion and healthy lifestyles Mental health services for common and severe problems, including inpatient mental health services on five sites Learning disability services, including inpatient services on one site Acquired brain injury services Dementia services, including inpatient services on two sites. There are numerous community based teams across the Trust, as per the list above, and these are spli t across four care groups. The number of community services based on speciality within each care group are: Community Services - 17 Mental Health Community - 8 Children and Families - 12 Specialist - 8 We have reviewed all the data available to us on the quality of care in all of these relevant health services . As of April 2018, transfer of all south Cumbria based community health and palliative care services to University Hospitals Morecambe Bay Trust took place, which reduced the number of sites the services operated from, as reflected in the information above. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2018/19 represents 100% of the total income generated from the provision of relevant health services by Cumbria Partnership N HS Foundation Trust for 2018/19. Participation in clinical audits and national confidential inquiries During 2018/19, 9 national clinical audits and 2 national confidential enquiries covered relevant health services that we provide. During that period, we participated in 64% of national clinical audits and 100% of national confidential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries which it was eligible to participate in. The table that follows lists the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that we were eligible to participate in during 2018/19. 136 Eligible to Participate In Participated Learning Disabilities Mortality Review (LeDeR) Programme Yes Maternal, Newborn and Infant Clinical Outcome Review Programme (MBBRACE): Maternal morbidity confidential enquiries - Admission with post -partum psychosis in women with a history of bipolar disorder or previous post -partum psychosis Yes (NCE) National Audit of Care at the End of Life (NACEL) Yes National Audit of Intermediate Care No National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression (NCAAD) Yes National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression (NCAAD) Spotlight on Psychological Therapies Yes National Clinical Audit of Psychosis (NCAP) Spotlight on Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) Yes National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide (NCISH) by People with Mental Illness Yes (NCE) National Diabetes Foot Care Audit (NDFA) Yes National Diabetes In Patient Audit (NaDIA) No National Diabetes in Pregnancy Audit (NPID) Yes Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 16b: Rapid tranquillisation Yes Topic Health (POMH -UK) Topic 6d: Assessment of the side effects of depot antipsychotics No Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 7f: Monitoring of patients prescribed lithium No Sentinel Stroke National Audit programme (SSNAP) No The following table shows the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries in 2018/19 that we participated in and for which data collection was completed during 2017/18. The table also shows the number of cases submitted to each audit or enquiry as a percentage of the number of the registered cases required by the terms of that audit or enquiry. National clinical audits for which the trust was eligible Registered to participate? No of cases as a % of required Learning Disabilities Mortalit y Review (LeDeR) Programme Yes 9 of 9 (100%) North CCG Reviews: 3 of 3 (100%) South CCG Reviews: 6 of 6 (100%) 137 Maternal, Newborn and Infant Clinical Outcome Review Programme (MBBRACE): Maternal morbidity confidential enquiries - Admission with post-partum psychosis in women with a history of bipolar disorder or previous post - partum psychosis Yes 0 of 0 - 100% No cases were relevant to the Trust. National Audit of Care at the End of Life (NACEL) Yes 71 of 71 - 100% National Audit of Intermediat e Care (NAIC) No The Community health Triumvirate regard this national clinical audit as labour intensive and past participation has not added value due to the diversity of the integrated services provided by the Trust. Available resources are being channelled into supporting exciting and challenging developments in Cumbria, including establishing the Integrated Care Communities (ICCs) and the Community Hospital Re- development Programme. National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression (NCAAD) Yes 20 of 7 8 - 26% National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression (NCAAD) Spotlight on Psychological Therapies Yes 25 of 25 - 100% National Clinical Audit of Psychosis (NCAP) Spotlight on Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) Yes 96 of 96 forms - 100% National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide (NCISH) by People with Mental Illness Yes 5 of 5 (100%) suicide questionnaires returned 0 of 0 (100%) homicide questionnaires returned 0 of 0 (100%) Sudden Unexpected Deaths (SUDs) questionnaires returned National Diabetes Footcare Audit (NDFA): Fourth Round Yes 171 of 171 (100%) 138 National Diabetes in Pregnancy Audit (NPID) Yes 8 of 8 (100%) Submission tied into Morecambe Bay. National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (NaDIA) No Around the time this audit commencing there was a depleted staffing resource available, which has now been addressed, but prevented the Specialist Services Care Group from taking part. Despite this the audit remains in the Trust systems to ensure learning and potential actions take place once published nationally. Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 16b: Rapid tranquillisation Yes 59 of 59 Mental Health (POMH -UK) Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 6d: Assessment of the side effects of depot antipsychotics No This was not participated in this cycle as the trust did well in the previous round of the audit. Also funding has been identified to increase Pharmacy support to the community mental health teams, which will include monitoring of depot medications, including medicines reconciliation and identifying patients prescribed high dose antipsychotics. Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 7f : Monitoring of patients prescribed lithium No The Trust did not participate in this audit due to pressures on medical staff time and clinical work needed to be prioritised. Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) No The Specialist Services Care Group opted not to take part in this audit due to a lack of administration resource to support the daily input required and the difficulty in separating our submission from that of the North Cumbria University Hospitals submissions. Also, the NICE Stroke b aseline tool is reviewed annually along with regular review of internal data. 139 National Audit Reports The reports of 13 national clinical audits were reviewed by us in 2018/19 and we intend to take the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided: National Clinical Audit of Psychosis (NCAP) This audit collected data about the care provided to a large, random sample of patients from all the main provider organisations in England and Wales. The national findings show improvements in aspects of physical healthcare for these patients and in presc ribing practice. The provision of information about medication to patients remains poor nationally, and the availability of psychological therapies remains low. More needs to be done to assist patients into employment. In response to this national audit re port the trust is raising awareness of the key findings through a staff newsletter and presentation and feedback to clinicians in the Clinical Governance Group. We have secured funding for further specialist cognitive behavioural therapy - psychosis traini ng (CBT -P), and this is accompanied by the roll out of additional in house training focusing on psychosis. We have identified a lead to develop employment services and is part of a joint bid across the sustainability and transformation partnership with two other NHS trusts to gain funding for specialist employment workers for secondary care mental health services, these are already in place within Early Intervention services. Also we are delivering training to raise greater awareness of the importance of w orking with families and carers and clarifying the system for offering and documenting carers' assessments. National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD): Chronic Neurodisability, focusing on cerebral palsy study: \"Chronic Neurodisability: Each and Every Need\" This audit largely related to Acute Trusts rather than our Trust . However, four forms were completed covering the Trust geographical area and some learning was gained from the relevant national report elements. The act ions included a number of improvement proposals to the electronic patient record system, the development of patient passports to ensure readily accessible information, the development of a patient -held emergency health care plan and ensuring that weight and nutritional status are recorded at every healthcare encounter. National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness (NCISH) Following a benchmarking exercise carried out in summer 2018 as an action from the last round of NCISH, and based on this new report, it has been agreed that the focus of this year's (2019/20) action plan will link to the \"10 ways to improve safety\". None of the areas in the benchmarking exercise were red. The ones that were amber were used to identi fy areas for development which are reflected in the Suicide Prevention Action Plan. National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness (NCISH): the management and risk of patients with personality disorder prior to suici de and homicide 140 In response to this national report we have audited the prescribing of antipsychotics to people with personality disorder diagnoses, has introduced staff supervision/reflection groups, and developed standard operating procedures within the Personality Disorder Pathway. National Diabetes Foot Care Audit: Third Round (NDFA) This report covered eligible people with diabetes who were seen by a foot care service with a new ulceration. We scored better than the national average for bacterial infection rates, time to assessment, twelve week outcome recording, ulcer free by twelve weeks and low hospital admission rates. Actions put into place included increasing the participation from the community podiatry team, checking the coding of diabetic foot disease patients, sharing the findings with the Lead Vascular Consultant to raise awareness of low revascularisation rates and consideration of setting up a follow up diabetic clinic. National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide (NCISH): The a ssessment of risk and safety in mental health services The 'Assessment of clinical risk in mental health service - An NCISH report' was published in October 2018. We took part in this national audit by providing details of the clinical risk assessment too l that is used. We use the Grist clinical risk assessment tool in the Mental Health services care group. The national audit set out to describe the range of clinical assessment tools that are used across the UK, to compare these to best practice and to seek the views of clinicians, service users and carers on the tools and possible improvements. We were one of the 85 mental health providers to respond to the audit (representing all NHS Mental he alth providers across the UK). The national report does not provide individual trust or tool data so it cannot be used as a benchmarking report. The report does highlight some problems with risk assessment tools in general and also presents some recommendations for improvement s. This local report compares our use of the Grist with the national report's identified problems and areas for improvement. This comparison shows that the practice within the Mental Health care group is good when compared to the 6 clinical messages highlighted in the report. The areas in need of further improvement that the report highlights are the greater inclusion of family and carers in the risk assessment, formulation and management process and regular clinical supervision of working with risk. Both of these areas are already known to be in need of improvement and work was already underway to improve. National Parkinson's Audit This UK -wide audit took a multi -professional approach. We took part in the physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language elements of the audit. The audi t engages services to measure the quality of their practice, within their model of care provision and trigger service improvement plans. An organisational audit tool and a patient data tool was completed for each profession. Questionnaires were distributed to patients to collect data for the Patient Reported Experience Measure (PREM). 141 In comparison with national return rates our services were around average. No local reports were received due to the small numbers of patients seen during the data collection period, Occupational therapy saw 3 eligible patients, physiotherapy saw 5 and Speech and language therapy saw 2. General findings from all services show there have been improvements in many areas since 2015 but there are areas identified that require improvement, including specialised multidisciplinary working. A new 8 week course will be developed and introduced for newly diagnosed patients and funding has been secured for staff to attend a PD warrior course. National Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulm onary Disease (COPD) Audit Programme (NACAP) Pulmonary Rehabilitation Audit The National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Audit Programme's Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) clinical audit 2017 ran from 3 January 2017 to 31 July 2017, for patients who attended their initial PR assessment (or if not assessed, began PR) between 3 January 2017 and 31 March 2017. Local reports were received for 5 areas, Solway, West (Allerdale & Copeland), Carlisle, Furness and South Lakes. The reports for Furness and S outh lakes have been passed to Morecambe Bay University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as the staff transferred earlier this year. The data below compares the service level results with the national results from the 2017 audit. Audit data pertaining to 7,476 patients was received from 184 services nationally (out of the 195 identified - 79% of all el igible patients). All our teams were above this national average with West 90%, Solway 100% and Carli sle 100% of eligible patients. Muscle strength was recorded for 27% of patients nationally this was a large improvement from the 2015 audit results of 15%. The second national priority set by the audit is to use practice walks for all patients, we fully comply with this. Actions arising from this audit include inc reasing consistency across North and West teams by introducing practice tests for the Carlisle patients and raising awareness of recording data for West teams. Physiotherapy Hip Fracture Sprint Audit The Royal College of Physicians commissioned this audi t as part of the Falls and Fragility Fracture Audit Programme (FFFAP). Each physiotherapist treating hip fracture patients completed a national hip fracture database (NHFD) audit form. The national main findings showed a large proportion of patients who have hip fractures do not get referred onto further rehabilitation in the commu nity when they leave hospital. To improve services for these patients we have started an 'engaging for improvement' project. Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 15b: Prescribing valproate for bipolar disorder In response to this national report we are going to present the findings at a teaching session for clinicians from Psychiatry, Learning Disabilities, Neurology and Pharmacy to ensure that all clinicians are aware of the \"Valproate checklist for women of childbearing age\" on the electronic patient system; 'RiO', and make printed copies of information sheets available to clinicians for clinic appointments. 142 POMH -UK Quality Improvement Programme. Topic 16b: re-audit. Rapid tranquillisation in the context of the pharmacological management of acutely - disturbed behaviour. A total of 59 cases were submitted for this national audit. We performed better than the national average in the treatment target (oral medic ation should be offered before intramuscular or intravenous) - for 61% of cases only oral medication was used (compared with 43% of the national cases). We achieved 100% in Standard 1a, which is about having a prompt debrief following rapid tranquillization, and scored better than the national average in Standards 1b and 1c, which cover updating the care plan, and Standard 3a, which is about monitoring the person at least every hour following rapid tranquillization. In response to this national report the f ollowing actions have been taken: the findings were presented at a clinical teaching session; the rapid tranquillisation policy was reviewed, updated and expanded; and a national joint treatment algorithm was adopt ed and launched for use in the T rust. POM H-UK Quality Improvement Programme. Baseline Topic 18a: The use of clozapine. A total of 195 cases were submitted for this national audit. Variations in practice were found in physical health checks and annual reviews. The actions that have been or will be taken by us as a result of this audit include: presentation of the findings by the lead pharmacist for mental health to the community health team leads, presentation to the trust's Quality and Safety Leads, and a further audit using a sub- set of the quest ions with the aim of reviewing the implementation of clozapine care plans on RiO. Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH -UK) Topic 17a: The Use of Depot / Long Acting Injectable (LA) Antipsychotic Medication for Relapse Prevention In this audit o f people on continuing depot/long -acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medications, relevant clinical findings included: the most common rationale for initiation of the depot/LAI was to improve medication adherence; all the local cases had a Care Plan; only around a third had a clinical plan documented to address default from treatment. Actions are being taken to alert staff to the key findings through a staff newsletter, through caseload supervision, and a leadership team meeting. Local clinical audits The reports of 99 local clinical audits were reviewed by us in 2018/19, and we intend to take the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided. Children and Families Care Group Records Audit of Safeguarding Supervision Following the int roduction of a new safeguarding supervision process within the Children and Families Care Group, an electronic staff survey was created to ensure that the policy is embedded and evidence of Supervision is taking place. 120 staff practitioners completed the survey. The results were mixed, showing that 90% of staff had received 143 Management Supervision in the past 2 months and 100% of staff knew who to contact should they need Safeguarding support and advice. However, recording of Safeguarding Supervision on th e electronic system was low at 66%. Actions taken in response included the electronic system to be updated to include a supervision document and staff guidance on recording, on genograms and significant events. Child Looked- After Records Audit to /identif y and Remove Duplicate Records Incorrectly Created due to Change of Demographic Details. An issue was identified around duplicate records for clients who are 'Child Looked- After' (CLA) within the Trust. 128 adopted clients were identified to be audited and 36 records were identified requiring immediate actions that were initiated and monitored internally by the CLA administration team. This meant that the audit identified that 28% of the adopted client records in the Electronic Patient Record either had or had the potential for a duplicate record being created. Actions taken in response included a new service Standard Operating Procedure to be in place, CLA admin team now receive monthly data on clients known to be adopted by Cumbria County Council, a new health summary sheet to be ratified by Governance Senior Leadership Team and alerts have now been added to the electronic systems. Audit of Autism Diagnosis Pathway The audit commenced following the introduction of a new Autism Assessment Pathway in June 2017 and was needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Multi -Agency Assessment Pathway and coherence with NICE guidelines CG128. The results showed that 30% less autism assessments concluded in 2018. Positive outcomes of the audit were the development of an autism assessment tracker. In West Cumbria time from referral to assessment decision improved and most families receive a face to face feedback with a standardised report. Actions included to clarify the process for initiating autism assessments, stand ardising the use of the autism pathway and autism assessment tracking by all community paediatricians, a booking systemic overhaul, improving the draft letter storage process and further understanding of reasons for low pre- school diagnosis rates in the So uth of the county. Community Health Care Group Self-Administration of Medicines on Community Inpatient Wards Each community ward was visited by a member of the pharmacy team. The nurse in charge of the ward was interviewed and the medication charts reviewed to identify prescribing of items potentially suitable for self -administration. For those items identified, pharmacy staff found the item, ascertained if it is correctly labelled and searched the electronic record (EMIS) for information on consent and recording of self -administration. The audit identified that on all the wards, the nurse in charge was aware of the self - administration of medicines policy and could locate it, but although all the wards had trained some staff members on the policy, none of them had trained all of their staff. Only three wards (Copeland, Workington and Cockermouth) have medicines storage which is 144 suitable for self -administration (i.e. individual patient bedside lockers). 48 items from the limited list of medications (Creams, inhalers, eye drops, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), nasal sprays (GTN) items were prescribed at the t ime of the visit. Of these 15 were being self -administered by patients, 6 could not be found and 22 were inaccurately labelled. None of the patients self -administering had a completed consent form in the notes or pharmacy record of self -administration in the notes. All of the above is now being addressed. The self -administration of medicines policy has been updated and the pharmacy team have improved recording of self -administration during the medication reconciliation process and review patient's use of self -administered items during inpatient stays. National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and Observations Following incidents within the Community Health Care Group, opportunities to record observations had been missed. The audit captures where we are with staff understanding and compliance of taking observations and general awareness of NEWS (national early warning system). This audit is to be used as a benchmark of information. 284 staff in community nursing and community rehabilitation teams, working in A llerdale, Copeland Eden and Carlisle were invited to complete a questionnaire. There were 132 (46%) responses to the survey. The majority of staff responding to the survey completed observations as part of their role and have been supplied with equipment t o undertake the observations. Staff correctly identified when NEWS should be used and when the NEWS should be repeated. The number of staff who reported they had never had training in NEWS was 55 (41%) this is currently being addressed by providing access to training for all staff. Diabetic Booklet Audit The audit was devised to understand the use of the diabetic booklet. The audit tool was sent to each Community Nursing Team in Allerdale, Copeland, Carlisle and Eden. The audit showed that the diabetic blue booklet is in use for the majority of patients (89%) whose notes were audited. 11% (6) of patients did not have the diabetic blue booklet in use. There were three sections on the front page of the diabetic booklet that were not always competed; allergi es (28%), type of diabetes (32%) and blood glucose aim range (43%). These sections should be completed by the GP when prescribing the insulin. For 96% of patients audited the blood glucose reading was recorded at each visit. For 83% of patients the site of injection was not rotated on a weekly basis. In the majority of cases it was stated that the site was rotated more frequently than weekly; often left and right repeatedly. It is recommended that the audit should be repeated in 12 months' time to ensur e that the diabetic booklet is fully embedded in all teams and a thematic review of incidents should also be considered. Mental Health Care Group Audit of prescription of antipsychotics within personality disorder diagnoses (CMHART) 145 Antipsychotic prescri bing to people with diagnoses of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) / Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Mixed EUPD with Antisocial Personality Disorder was audited across Cumbria. The frequency of antipsychotic prescription (55%) was slightly lower than the national average (65%). However, the requirements set out by the NICE guidelines were not completely followed. For example, in 32% of cases, where antipsychotics were recommended specifically for personal ity disorder the rationale was not noted. The recommendation of not using antipsychotics for more than 4 weeks in Borderline Personality disorder was only 13.5% (national average 5%). Actions taken or planned include: a doctors' teaching session has been h eld where the findings were presented and discussed, a web link to information for service users has been added to the team SharePoint, information on the NICE guidance has been circulated in the CMHART newsletter. Re-audit of Safeguarding Audit in First Step Most of the 197 cases reviewed in this audit were self -referrals, which continues to be the predominant route into the service. In only 14 cases was there any information provided by the GP about safeguarding. 95% of assessments had the safeguarding s ection completed, although the amount documented within the section varied. Planned actions include: sharing the findings widely within and outside First Step, ensure staff record dates of birth of children rather than ages, validation of safeguarding information received by contacting relevant other professionals, and focussing re- audit on patients who have parental responsibility. Re-audit of Suicide Risk Assessment in the Memory & Later Life Services This re -audit looked at 61 care records. The findings showed improvement in the routine assessment and documentation of patients' risk of self -harm or suicide at initial assessment compared to the previous audit. 94% of cases had a GRiST completed for the current treatment episode, although only 78% were com pleted within the recommended time frame of 48 hours. The frequency (50%) and quality of formulations show that staff would benefit from further guidance/practice regarding the completion of risk formulations within the 5 Ps fra mework. Actions taken include: The continued roll out of Memory and Later Life specific risk training across the network Feedback of overall findings to team leaders in a network governance meeting An offer of individual feedback to team leaders regarding their own team's performance in the audit. Specialist Services Care Group Audit of internal referrals (from the Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS) to the Medical Staff) within the Specialist Care Team (West) An audit was designed as there had been a perception of, at times, high and unpredictable medical workload from the hospital support (liaison) part of the medical rol e in West 146 Cumberland Hospital. This was causing a strain on scarce medical time, particularly with a longstanding medical vacancy. Workload data across the whole service in Cumbria highlighted excess numbers of both direct and indirect West medical consultations, compa red to South and East Cumbria. Reasons for the high and unpredictable workload in West were felt to be multifactorial but otherwise poorly understood. CQC had recognised the responsiveness of the service but asked about how the team dealt with fluctuations in workload and what the capacity was per day for the hospital team ref errals. There was no data at the ti me to answer these questions. The audit was therefore designed to capture qualitative and quantitative data around referrals to give a greater understanding and identify areas for improvement. Initially data was analysed about the number of referrals at West Cumberland Hospital. The medical workload for outreach consultations varied between a minimum of 3 and maximum of 12 per week over the 13 week per iod analysed, mean number 7.6. There were a total of 101 outreach consultations in the 13 week period. Individual days varied between 0 and a maximum of 5 consultations. Thursday was the busiest day with 29 consultations and the lowest number was on a Wednesday 11. Next busiest was Tuesday 23. Monday and Friday both had 19. A referral form was designed to give more information regarding reason for refer ral and more qualitative information such as complexity. This was expanded to be used for all referrals to the medical team which included the community CNS. There was a difference in reason for referral between hospital and community CNS. For hospital CNS main reason for referral was assessment for Loweswater admission (Specialist Palliative Care beds at West Cumberland Hospital), followed by medical complexity e.g. multiple comorbidities. Gaps in CNS cover at West Cumberland Hospital were identified. In t erms of complexity of referral, the majority were of medium complexity with a smaller number highly complex - demonstrating appropriate requesting of support from the medical team with complex patients. The audit therefore gave a unique insight into referr al dynamics of the team with qualitative and quantitative data around referrals. As a result of this audit a weekly Community Review Meeting with the Consultant and Community CNS team (later expanded to include the hospital CNS) was set up to provide addit ional support/ education within the team. A more robust plan was developed to cover hospital CNS gaps. Greater clarity on the Hospital Palliative Care outreach service at West Cumberland Hospital with a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to clarify response times and cover arrangements. Teaching on medical complexity was identified as a priority for the team and the first education session took place on 30/10/2018 jointly with the diabetes team. Audit of Community Learning Disability Mental Health Pharmac ological Interventions The audit was in response to the recent NICE guidance being published regarding mental health problems in people with learning disabilities (NG54). The audit looked at ensuring that the community teams are working in accordance to best practice outlined in the guidance. 147 The key findings were mainly positive regarding psychiatric clinic letters with high adherence levels to identified best practice. However, it was noted that improvement, now being addressed, was required for reducing or discontinuing pharmacological interventions and establishing the most effective lowest dosages. The Prescribing and Monitoring of Emergency Rescue Medication (Buccal Midazolam or Rectal Diazepam) for People with Prolonged or Recurring Seizures - Are G uidelines Being Followed? Due to some concerns being raised about the safe prescribing and monitoring of Emergency Rescue Medication (Buccal Midazolam or Rectal Diazepam) for people with prolonged or recurring seizures amongst Cumbrian patients, an audit o f a selection of Emergency Rescue Medication plans was conducted to investigate if guidelines are being followed. Emergency Rescue Medication Plans were collected from staff members from within the Cumbria Neurology Service and the Cumbria Community Learning Disability Teams. In total 28 plans were audited. The findings were largely positive with the majority of plans being completed according to guidelines. Once analysed the main findings led to actions being recommended around the development and updating of the Emergency Rescue Medication plan template. Central Support Services Audit of a Sample of Patient Safety Incidents Which Resulted in Moderate or Greater Harm to Identify Good Practice, Issues or Gaps with Compliance with the Duty of Candour This Trust -wide audit aimed to determine the baseline compliance position against the Care Quality Commission Regulation 20 for Duty of Candour. This regulation requires that when a notifiable patient safety incident occurs and results in moderate or greater harm that certain actions are triggered. A sample of 40 incidents were critically reviewed and all were correctly identified as requiring Duty of Candour or not. Where Duty of Candour did apply there was evidence that the appropriate letter has been prepared and provided to the patient or relative. However, a high percentage of the letters were not attached to the internal monitoring system, Ulysses. This finding was reflected within our new joint Duty of Candour Policy and supportive approaches introduced to ensure staff are aware and able to meet the requirement. NICE Guidance The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is the independent organisation responsible for developing national guidance, standards and information on providing hi gh-quality health and social care, and preventing and treating ill health. NICE guidance helps deliver the best possible care based on the best available evidence. We are committed to quality improvement and support and monitor the assessment of NICE 148 guidan ce across all of our services. Systems are in place to ensure clinicians are informed of new and updated guidance, and are supported to use the NICE produced tools to ensure assessment of our services against the evidence- based national standards NICE guidance outlines. All published NICE guidance is continually reviewed by clinicians appointed as NICE Leads across our services. New and updated guidance is published each month by NICE and the Trust considers each publication for relevancy to the services we provide. Relevant guidance is prioritised, allocated to a clinician for assessment before a Committee sign off. If actions are deemed necessary these are monitored and reported on with evidence of completion to show resulting improvements. 91 guideline assessments have been ratified and an additional 379 NICE Technology Appraisals on medicines have been reviewed through Medicines Management Committee s to date. Participation in clinical research The number of patients receiving relevant health services, provided or sub- contracted by the Trust in 2018/19 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics Committee was 722. A total of 35 different studies were recruited to. There is a well -established relationship between research activity within NHS organisations and a range of outcomes. A recent review reports a positive association between engagement in research by healthcare organisations and improvements in healthcare performance within the specialities engaging in research. Two papers, recently published in the journals Public Health and Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, by members of our research team have shown that clinical research activity may have numerous indirect positive effects on the functioning of a hospital. In summary, the paper shows that increased levels of clinical research activity are linked with better care quality commission ratings, increased speciality clinical trial activity is linked wit h reduced mortality, that these relationships are primarily associated with interventional research (clinical trials) activity and that, although the associations are more pronounced for teaching hospital trusts, the link between clinical trials activity and mortality and CQC ratings still persists for non- teaching hospital trusts. Our Research and Innovation Strategy identifies four core aims towards becoming an increasingly research engaged organisation: 1. To increase the opportunities for people in Cumbri a to participate in well governance clinical research (a core 'right' in the NHS constitutions) 2. To maintain the highest standards and governance of research activity in the Trust 3. To increase the research awareness of staff working in the Trust 4. To support r esearch active staff to develop research activity that could lead to innovation and/or funded grant applications 149 The Research & Development (R&D) team consists of 12 staff, equating to 9.5 WTE. These staff are funded both from the North East and North Cum bria CRN (NENC CRN) and from commercial studies income. Following discussion with the NENC CRN and executive teams of CPFT and NCUH there is an agreement to bring the R&D teams from both Trusts together as a single department . Professor Dave Dagnan has be en joint R&D Director for both T rusts since April 2017. Strategic Aims: 1. To increase the opportunities for people in Cumbria to participate in well governanced clinical research (a core 'right' in the NHS constitutions) The R&D Department's core functi on is to recruit participants into research studies which are included in the National Institute for Health Research's (NIHR) portfolio. To be eligible for inclusion on the portfolio a research project must meet certain standards (commercial and academic s tudies that are of good scientific quality, peer -reviewed and funded from a competitive funding stream). As of 15 May 2019, our recruitment figure stands at 722 participants into 35 different portfolio studies. This is a decrease from this time last year which has largely been caused by a lack of portfolio studies in areas which we cover. However, there has been a significant shift in terms of the type of research undertaken. In the past it focused primarily on observational research, whereas this year the share of interventional research has increased. Table 1 summarises recruitment activity since 2010 by financial year. The study identified in 2013 -15 (Catfish) was an unusually large study looking at the effects of fluoridisation in Cumbria which distorted underlying trends, and so the data is reported both with and without this study. Year Patient Accrual Number of studies 2010 -11 176 12 2011 -12 124 19 2012 -13 210 23 2013 -14 1435 (366 without Catfish) 24 2014 -15 1235 (595 without Catfish) 25 2015 -16 663 23 2016 -17 1049 27 2017 -18 924 35 2018 -19 722 35 Footnote: recruitment to studies takes place from 1 April - 31 March each year. As there can be a slight delay between the actual recruitment of people to studies and recording on the national performance management system, this may result in some changes to the figures in the table above for previous year. Studies can be classified in a number of different ways. Firstly, they are listed as commercial or non- commercial. A commercial study is a study where a commercial company has developed the study protocol and fully funded the additional costs of hosting the trial within the NHS. We currently have 4 commercial studies open to recruitment, with 57 recruits to date, an increase on this time last year. This activity has particularly 150 contributed to strategic aim 4: To support research active staff to develop res earch activity that could lead to innovation and/or funded grant applications. Studies can also be classified as observational, interventional or CTIMPS (Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product). We currently have 16 observational portfolio studies and 8 interventional portfolio studies open to recruitment. A higher proportion of our recruits now come from interventional studies which carry a greater weighting in terms of recruitment figures. We have 1 CTIMP currently open. The table below summarises recruitment by study and shows the broad range of services within which we run studies which includes mental health, older adults, neurology, diabetes, sexual health, continence services and primary care.

To maintain the highest standards and governance of research activity in the Trust The R& D department reviews both portfolio and non- portfolio studies (which include both educational and some of our 'home- grown' projects). From April 2018 we have approved 22 studies - an increase on this time last year. These include 4 Investigator Initiated T rials (IITs) which we have developed ourselves and which contribute to Strategic Aim 4. All four of these studies are included on the national NIHR portfolio. We are committed to processing and appraising new research projects in line with England- wide processes. Whereas in the past there was a two tier system involving first National Research Ethics Service (NRES) review and then NHS Trust -specific review (Trust appr oval), the process of obtaining the green light for a new research project now involves NRES and Health Research Approval (HRA) followed by Trust confirmation. The HRA essentially provides the assurances that in the past each NHS t rust in the country would give, and t rusts now adopt the HRA opinion offering an opinion on our capability and capacity to host each study. 152 In addition to meeting national standards for Research Governance Targets the North East and North Cumbria CRN set an additional continuous i mprovement objective for the second year running to have 100% of the information recorded in LPMS (the Local Portfolio Management System) complete and accurate. We achieved 100% compliance. 3. To increase the research awareness of staff working in the Tr ust The R&D team has a core role in 'horizon scanning' for national studies that would fit into the clinical portfolio of the trust. The R&D team then liaise with clinical teams to discuss to discuss the potential for them to participate in the st udies for their clinical area. This process requires established relationships between the R&D team staff and key clinical teams and services. The team continues to develop and maintain these links with the clinical teams. The R&D team continues to organise an annual R&D conference to showcase activity within the Trust and its partners. This year's con ference was held on the 11 May 2018. It was well attended and received very positive feedback. This was the first conference for the combined CPFT/NCUH R&D departmen t. 4. To support research active staff to develop research activity that could lead to innovation and/or funded grant applications We continue to support research interested and research active staff in developing their own projects where appropriate whi ch also supports Strategic Aim 4. We aim to provide support to clinicians in line with the Royal College of Physicians position paper 'Research for All', whereby we will ensure that: All new staff with research experience or interest are offered a meeting with R&D to discuss how their research interests can be facilitated. Ensure all staff are aware of relevant portfolio studies for which they could be PIs and to ensure maximum support from R&D Department for participation We use R&D funding streams to ens ure that support is available to staff to develop research and evaluation interests and collaborations We ensure that the support from the R&D department and associated teams in developing research and evaluation design, ethical and other approvals and funding applications are advertised. Achievements and impact We have also managed a very successful project to increase research activity within primary care in the region. We have taken an innovative approach to this whereby our research department employs a GP who is then able to facilitate the introduction of research within interested GP practices across the region. We are now a significant contributor to primary care research within the NECRN region. We have significantly increased research engagement w ithin the Memory Services over the course of the last year. There is now a research champion within each of the 6 153 memory matters teams and research now form part of the dementia pathway. This means that everyone who is assessed by the memory services is now asked about whether or not they are interested in taking part in research, which increases opportunities for patients and facilitates recruitment to studies in this area. Some research studies have potential for immediate impacts upon service delivery and some studies establish an evidence base that will impact upon clinical practice over longer periods of time. One study which had an immediate impact for patients was the 'Improving Hospital Discharge Arrangements for People who are Homeless' . An outcom e of this study was the introduction of mental health ward staff to the homeless prevention worker within the council. Prior to this there had been no clear pathway for discharging patients with housing issues. This study immediately meant that the process for discharging people with housing or homelessness issues was improved. Another study with the potential to quickly have an impact on patient outcomes is the PARAGON study. Primary headache disorders, including migraine, cluster headache, and occipital neuralgia, are some of the most debilitating conditions that impact negatively on patients themselves and the wider economy. A subset of patients does not respond to currently available prophylaxis and rescue medication. Nerve block medication treatment is offered to these treatment -resistant patients. Greater occipital nerve block (GON block) is an established nerve block procedure that has a favourable safety profile and is cost - effective - the active ingredients used are a mix of local anaesthetic agent and steroid. The exact effectiveness and the optimal method for delivering GON block is not clear due to a relative lack of evidence from gold- standard randomised controlled trials and variety in the applied GON block procedure. Initial pilot data on GON block patients, and related evidence from use of anaesthetics in dentistry, suggests that lying a patient down for ten minutes after the procedure enhances the effectiveness of the GON block and thereby leads to an increase in the achieved headache- free per iod. This present study (an IIT led by Dr Jitka Vanderpol, Consultant Neurologist , CPFT in collaboration with the developers of an application that will be used for data collection) seeks to use a prospective, randomised, multi -centre approach to determine whether the patient's position straight after injection of the GON block medicine influences the patient -reported outcomes regarding headache symptoms afterwards. Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) A proportion of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trusts income in 2018 /19 was conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals agreed between the Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with, for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework. 154 Further details of the agreed goals for 2018/19 and for the following 12- month period are available electronically at https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/04/cquin- guidance- 2018- 19.pdf For income available was \u00a33.4m. The negotiated settlement for 2017/18 was \u00a32.9m which represents 85% of the available total. The value of NHSE CQUIN available was \u00a370k and this was all achieved. Changes to the national contract by NHS England mean that our latest contract is for two years spanning 2017 - 2019. All CQUIN schemes are therefore; two years in length in addition the detail of the schemes has been nationally mandated. CQUIN schemes for 2017 - 2019 are: Improvement of health and wellbeing of NHS staff Healthy food for NHS staff, visitors and patients Improving the uptake of flu vaccinations for frontline clinical staff Improving Physical healthcare to reduce premature mortality in people with SMI: Cardio Metabolic Assessment and treatment for Patients with Psychoses Improving Physical healthcare to reduce premature mortality in people with SMI: Collaboration with primary care clinicians Preventing ill health by risky behaviours - alcohol and tobacco: Tobacco and Alcohol screening Improving the assessment of wounds Personalised care and support pla nning Supporting proactive and safe discharge Improving services for people with mental health needs who present to A&E Transitions out of Children and Young People's Mental Health Services (CYPMHS) Performance for year 2 (2018/19) will not be confir med until the end of Quarter 1 2019/20. Registration and regulation from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and Ofsted The Trust is required to register with the CQC and its current registration status is 'full registration with no conditions'. The Trust is currently registered with the CQC to provide the following regulated activities. Assessment or medical treatment for persons detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 - we can only carry out these activities at: Carleton Clinic, Carlisle Dova Unit, Barrow Kentmere Ward, Westmorland General Hospital Ramsey Unit, Barrow Yewdale Unit, Whitehaven. 155 Diagnostic and screening procedures - we can only carry out these activities at: Alston Hospital Brampton Hospital Cockermouth Hospital Workington Hospital Maryport Hospital Voreda House Family planning - we can only carry out these activities via Trust Headquarters, Voreda House. Surgical procedures - we can only carry out these activities via Trust Headquarters, Voreda House. Treatment of disease or injury - we can only carry out these activities at: Alston Hospital Brampton Hospital Cockermouth Hospital Carleton Unit Dova Unit, Barrow Haverigg Prison Kentmere Ward, Westmorland General Hospital Keswick Hospital Penrith Hospital Ramsey Unit, Barrow Wigton Hospital Workington Hospital Yewdale Unit, Whitehaven Maryport Hospital Voreda House The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action against the Trust during 2018/2019. Care Quality Commission registration 156 During 2018/19 we had a process in place for undertaking the assessment of Care Quality Commission registration requirements. The work which has taken place during this time period included the following: Non-Executive Director/Governor Visits - these visits take place on a regular basis to our services and are facilitated by our Corporate Governance Team. Any issues raised from these visits are discussed at the care groups Clinical Governance Meetings and the Quality and Safety Committee . Annual Care Group Clinical Gover nance Reports - these provide assurance against the systems, processes and outcomes in relation to: o Governance structures o Listening and responding to patient experiences o Patient Safety Incidents o Risk management o Staffing and staff management o Education, t raining and continuing professional development o Clinical audit o Evidence based care and effectiveness o Clinical Information The central Quality, Safety and Safeguarding Team have conducted an assessment of evidence in relation to the CQC new guidance and ins pection process which includes assessment against the CQC's Fundamental Standards and Key Lines of Enquiry (KLOE). Support for clinical teams from our Quality, Safety and Safeguarding Team to embed required improvements following CQC inspections which hig hlight any issues and concerns. Introduction of a joint Trust (CPFT & NCUH) assurance process for CQC standards, which includes a relaunch of 15 Steps Assessments, across CPFT, with rollout taking place as of February 2019. Continued embedding of a Joint C ompliance Board, which has oversight of CQC regulatory activity, actions and improvement planning. Re-introduced monthly engagem ent meetings between CPFT, NCUH and CQC inspectors to share any learning, development and improvement and any issues arising. Regulatory inspections The Trust has not participated in any special reviews or investigations by the CQC during the reporting period. Copies of any published inspection reports are available for review on the CQC website www.cqc.org.uk . Findings and actions from the 2017 inspection are being progressed, with 19 of the 22 Must Do actions being completed. All actions are monitored through the Joint Compliance Board, and there is regular reporting of progress to meetings of the Quality & Safety Committee and Board of Directors. 157 Each of our care groups have in place a Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) to capture all improvement work that is underway or planned, and these include the findings and act ions from the CQC inspections. The plans are monitored through monthly meetings with the care groups, chaired by the System Executive Chief Nurse and System Executive Chief Operations Officer, and exception provided to the Joint Compliance Board. The Trust current CQC ratings Our overview ratings for the Trust and our services can be found on our website . The matrix below shows the overall trust wide ratings: CQC Inspection Notification On the 29 January 2019 we received notification that the CQC were beginning to plan the next inspection. The initial provider information request (PIR) was submitted in February, and we have received the dates for the provider level Well Led inspection from the CQC, due to take place on 24 and 25 June 2019. Unannounced inspections to core services are due to pre- ceed the Well Led inspection. A preparation plan has been developed in readiness for the upcoming inspection activity, which is monitored through the Joint Compliance Board. CQC Local Area Systems Review Commissioned by the Secretaries of State for Health and for Communities and Local Government the CQC were required to undertake a local system review in Cumbria. The local area was one of a number chosen across England that would feed into a wider national report. The main review in Cumbria took place from the 12 - 16 February 2018. The final report following this review, whic h was looking at how people move between health and social care, including delayed transfers of care, with a particular focus on people over 65 years old, and people with dementia, was received in May 2018 and includes the findings and recommendations for the local area. A Quality Summit with the CQC and the Local Area took place on the 21 st May 2018, and a completed action plan to address the recommendations was submitted. Findings and actions are not specific to the Trust, however the action plan prog ress is being monitored through the Cumbria Health and Wellbeing Board. Over all Trust Ratings: 158 Joint CQC / Ofsted inspections - SEND On the 11 March 2019 we received one week's notice of the inspection of SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities), which is a joint inspection by Ofsted and the CQC, for children and young people from 0- 25 years. This was an inspection of the local area, so involved education and health commissioning and providers. The inspection lasted for a week, and started on 18 March 2019. Two CQC ins pectors were part of the overall inspection team who interviewed staff, held focus groups, visited early years settings and reviewed case notes (through sampling). During the high level feedback on the 22 March examples of notable practice were highlighted, along with some recommendations for improvements to be made. The report is due to follow around May 2019, with planned re- inspection of these areas in around 18 months' time . Ofsted inspections The Trust did not receive any direct external inspections from Ofsted during 2018/19. Hospital Episodes Statistics data The Trust submitted records during April 2018 to February 2019 (data from March - April 2018 not yet published) to the Secondary Uses service for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics wh ich are included in the latest published data. The percentage of records in the published data: which included the patient's valid NHS number was: o 100% for admitted patient care (National 99.4%); o 99.7% for outpatient care (National 99.6%); and o 94.7% for accident and emergency care (National 97.6%) which included the patient's valid General Medical Practice Code was: o 99.9% for admitted patient care (National 99.9%); o 99.7% for outpatient care (National 99.8%); and o 99.9% for accident and emergency care (National 99.3%) Information Governance (IG) Information Governance is to do with the way we process and handle information. It covers personal information (relating to patients/service users and employees) and also corporate information (for example financi al and accounting records). By embedding Information Governance in the culture of the Trust, we can provide assurance to the public and our regulators that we comply with relevant legislation and central guidance; that information is handled appropr iately , lawfully and securely. The Information Governance vision is that we \"Enable high quality care by facilitating the ethical, legal, effective & appropriate use of accurate & reliable information that maintains confidentiality, integrity & availability\" . This has been a busy year as there has been numerous changes in the standards that we need to adhere to in order to help us comply with the data laws. These include: 159 The Data Security and Protection (DSP) Toolkit - From April 2018, the new Data Secur ity Protection Toolkit (DSP Toolkit) replaced the Information Governance Toolkit. It forms part of a new framework for assuring that organisations are implementing the ten data security standards and meeting their statutory obligations on data protection and data security. Final publication assessment scores reported by organisations are used by the Care Quality Commission for use as part of the Well Led inspection. The new Toolkit includes compliance with GDPR. The General Data Protection Regulation (GD PR) was implemented on the 25 May 2018. Alongside this Regulation is the Data Protection Bill (published in September 2017) which introduced a number of changes to the GDPR requirements which are extensive. There is a raft of other legislative requirements to following (i.e. NIS Directive). Compliance with the Information Commissioner's 12 step approach to GDPR together with receipt of associated guidance from the Article 29 Working Party) and receipt of spec ific health IG guidance from NHS England, IG Alliance. National Data Opt Out Programme - organisations need to be compliant by 31 March 2020. The Trust is leading the way as one of the pilot sites working with NHS Digital in preparation. The Trust has added the national data opt -out to their record of processing activities (ROPA) as part of their GDPR work and provided valuable feedback on NHS Digital's Compliance Implementation Guide which will be available to all organisations nationally soon. We submi tted as compliant against all mandatory assertions contained within the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. Improvement plans are in place to further enhance compliance in 2019 - 2020. This was independently verified by Audit One auditors. Information G overnance and Cyber Security incidents We take our responsibilities for the protection of patient and staff information seriously. Breaches of confidentiality or loss of personal data are reported and investigated through our Incident Reporting procedure and assurance processes. During the reporting period, the Information Governance Team has recorded 973 IG incidents between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. We use the national Incident Reporting Tool within the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. Incidents are coded in line with the SIRI guide \"Guide to the Notification of data security and protection incidents - reporting incidents post the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulations (25 May 2018) and the NIS Directive (10 May 2018). Any incident must be graded according to the significance of the breach and the likelihood of those serious consequences occurring. The incident must be graded according to the impact on the individual or groups of individuals and not the organisation. We reported the following incidents via the Data Security and Protec tion Toolkit to its Regulators: 160 Date of Incident Reference number Summary of Incident Outcome Status 07/06/2018 196 An individual called the Communications Helpdesk on 1 June 2018 (17:00) to make a complaint about a video which included her talking about pressure ulcers, her full name, her place of work, and her job title being published online and shared on social...

The meeting is chaired by the joint Executive Director of Finance & Estates (our Senior Information Risk 163 Owner) and is attended by our Caldicott Guardian (for CPFT and NCUH). Other r egular attendees are representatives from the care groups, providing the much needed clinical input. In addition, the Head of IG chairs a monthly IG Performance Group with operational managers. Some of our key successes in 2018- 19 include: General Data Protection Regulations came into force on 25 May 2019. To support compliance we have: Developed awareness programme for all staff with the Board trained by NHS Digital with IG staff achieving Certification or GDPR Practitioner status New Individual Rights process developed Single Subject Access request process in place with plans to integrate further in 2019 - 2020 Record of Processing activities mapping tool developed and in pilot stage Contractor documentation package developed for use by Procurement Team Single coding process of IG incidents in line with national guidance Single Data Protection Imp act Assessment process in place Appointment of Data Protection Officer for both Trusts Integration: Appointment of Senior Joint IG roles Joint Trust policies in place Alignment of staff under single management arrangements pending future re- structure in 2019 Working with Integrated Care Communities to support new ways of working Data Security and Protection Toolkit: Successful completion of the inaugural year of Data Security and Protection Toolkit All mandatory requirements met with improvement plans in place for areas such as security due to NCUH infrastructure and procurement contracting process.

Data Quality Statement The Trust will be taking the following actions to improve data quality, the review and continued implementation of our Data Quality Strategy; continued cycle of internally performed audit of performance indicators for assurance in the validity of reported performance; acting upon the advice and recommendations made by external auditors . A sustained focus on data quality within our electronic patient record systems is a key enabler of our Strategy. Our clinicians and managers recognise that poor data quality impacts on patient care as well as the credibility of information and has a negative effect on efforts to improve information management. Reporting against core relevant acute indicators Indicator - Care Programme Approach (CPA) follow up: proportion of discharges from hospital followed up within seven days (target 95%) The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons. We have in place detailed data definitions, standard operating procedures concerning the collection and collation of information from our systems and data validation reports, reviews and audits to provide assurance of the data. The Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this indi cator and so the quality of its services, by continuing the provision of daily performance position to the relevant services, facilitating and encouraging regular validation of the records included in this indicator. The Trust will also continue to conduc t regular audits of the processes used and its paper records to verify that this indicator is accurate. Where performance is impacted by capacity and service related issues, these will be escalated via the appropriate Care Group governance route and discussed with Commissioners where required. 166 Indicator - The percentage of admissions to acute wards for which the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team acted as a gatekeeper during the reporting period.

Indicator - The number and, where available, rate of patient safety incidents reported within the Trust during the reporting period that resulted in severe harm and death. Relative performance of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust: Severity of Harm None Low Moderate Severe Death Time Frame No. of Incidents Reported to NRLS N % N % N % N % N % CPFT Q3-Q4 2017- 2018 1500 504 33.6% 914 based upon figures provided on the NPSA website (based on 55 reporting Trusts) The calculation of the rate per 1000 bed days is performed by the national agency. The denominator used for the Trust excludes non Mental Heal th bed days. The data that is included for this national performance measure uses a comparator against Mental Health organisations and therefore the figures included do not provide a clear picture in regards to incident reporting and levels of harm from patient safety incidents in our Trust services. The figures shown above also include patient safety incidents which relate to community hospitals, community services, children and young people services and specialist services. The \"Organisation patient safety incident reports\" are published every 6 months with the most recent figures on incidents that occurred from 1 April 2018 to 30 September 2018 being published in March 2019. 2018/19 Q3 and Q4 information will be published in September 2019. https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/organisation- patient -safety -incident -reports -data/ The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons. We have in place detailed data definitions, standard operating procedures concerning the collection and collation of information from our systems and data validation reports, reviews and audits to provide assurance of the data. We have taken the following actions to improve this indicator and so the quality of its services by i mproving the processes around the reporting of incidents and completion of investigations : We are committed to supporting and embedding a positive reporting culture to enable us to learn when things have gone wrong. Over the last year that has continued to be a clear focus on the investigation, learning and improvement from incidents which have occurred in our services and to support other healthcare organisations across the system, through collaborative and joint learning events. In the NHS 'Learning From Mistakes League' (published in March 2016) we were rated as 'good' for the levels of openness and transparency in regards 171 to patient safety incidents. We are als o an active partner in the North East and Cumbria 'Alliance' for learning from deaths. An established Mortality Review Group is in place, which links with the already well established processes in place within our care groups and meets the recommendations set out in the Mazars' Review of Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Deaths at Southern Health NHS FT. At a support service level there has been continued work completed by the Incident and Risk Management Team to support our staff to report incidents , register risks and encourage their review at team meetings, supervisions and appraisal. Development of a patient safety forum where trends and emerging themes from incidents and risks are reviewed by the Head of Clinical Governance, Clinical Risk and Patient Safety Manager, Care Group Associate Directors of Nursing, the Medical Director and the Learning Lessons Facilitator(s). Collectively key staff attend the Quality and Safety Systems Group (was Ulysses Systems Group) to discuss current project managem ent arrangements of module changes and updates to support the ongoing use of the system and ensuring we meet our statutory obligations with accuracy. Further embedding within the care groups of the Quality and Safety Dashboards that incorporate the Incide nt and Risk dashboards. Continued development of the dashboards to allow staff with more user friendly and visual way of reviewing their quality and safety information. Our patient experience We have in place a range of options to capture patient experience from people using our services to pass on their concerns, feedback, compliments and comments. Working with our Patient Experience Involvement Group (PEIG), our Patient Experience Team has captured the views of over 8517 patients, service users and car ers during 2018/19. All survey findings and recommendations are reported monthly to the relevant care groups, Executive Team and Board of Directors; and quarterly to the Quality & Safety Committee . Feedback is received from/via the following sources: Com plaints, Compliments and Comments cards Face to face/telephone/post/email and SMS texts Surveys of all our 19 inpatient wards at the bimonthly 'Here for You' visits and on discharge Surveys of people who use our community services via the following questi onnaires: Adult Community; Minor Injury; Community Mental Health; Friends and Family question; Child and Parent Patient Story to the Board National Community Mental Health Survey National patient feedback sites Trust web page Trust and the Patient Experience Team social networking sites 172 Corporate website contacts Communications helpdesk contacts Patient Advice and Liaison services Partnership working with other agencies, industry and events in the workplace.

One of the priority areas for the patient experience team and care groups is to ensure that the highest possible number of patients and families are able to provide feedback on the services that we provide as for some of the above services, the percentages above only relate to a small number of returns. 173 Friends and Family Test Question (FFT) The National Friends and Family Test question has been added to all our questionnaires as per National Guidance. Members of the Patient Exper ience Team are alerted immediately by email if there is a negative response to the FFT question. This is then shared with the service / team lead for them to respond to and the alert on Meridian (system used to capture patient experience) is updated. We have received 5819 completed FFT questions, of which contained 5004 free text comments to support their answer. Examples of findings from the FFT question are as follows: 88.65% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Mental Health inpatient ward to friends and family 94.16% of patients are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Community inpatient ward to friends and family 97.23% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the First Step Service to friends and family 99.05% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Health Visiting Service to friends and family 95.45% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Children's Speech and Language Therapy Service to friends and family 97.62% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Minor Injury Unit to friends and family 99.53% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Community Pulmonary Rehabilitation Service to friends and family 100% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Specialist Palliative Care Service to friends and family 99.46% of people are extremely likely or likely to recommend the Dental Service to friends and family. Mandated National Mental Health Survey 2018 The Men tal Health Community Survey 2018 is part of a series of annual surveys required by the CQC for all NHS Mental Health Trusts in England. We commissioned Quality Health to undertake the Mental Health Community Survey 2018. The survey is based on a sample of all service users who were seen between 1 September 2017 and 30 November 2017.A total of our 850 patients were sent a questionnaire. 820 were eligible for the survey, of which 229 returned a completed questionnaire, givin g a response rate of 27.93%. This survey has highlighted many positive aspects of the service user experience. Key facts about the 229 service users who responded to the survey: 73.45% of respondents have been told who is in charge of organising their care and services 174 25.46% of respondents had been in contact with NHS mental health services for less than 1 year, 72.96% of respondents in the last 12 months had a formal meeting with someone from NHS mental health services to discuss how their care was working 62.81% of respondents knew who to contact out of office hours if they had a crisis 73.66% stated that they always felt that in the last 12 months that they were treated with respect and dignity by NHS mental health services and 21.43% said yes, sometimes 39.30% of respondents were male and 60.70% were female. 10.04% were under 35, 13.54% were aged 36- 50, 23.14% were aged 51- 65 and 53.28% were aged 65 and over. Any other public and patient involvement activities We have in place arrangements for service user and carer involvement through the Patient Experience Involvement Group (PEIG) which is made up of both mental health and community service users and carers. In 2018/19 our service users and carers (PEIG) have been involved in the following: Sitting on interview panels: following our policy for a service user or carer representative, trained in interviewing, to sit on all Band 6 and above interviews as part of the panel Supporting the Diabetes User Group Corporate meetings: service users and carers attend meetings to contribute and share their thoughts and ideas e.g. Infection Prevention, Clinical Effectiveness and Audit Committee Here for You ward visits: service users and carers are involved in the month ly ward visits facilitated by the Patient Experience Team. Development of leaflets: service users and carers provide constructive feedback on new or updated leaflets to ensure that the information is accessible Patient Led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) assessments: service users and carers take part in annual assessments to give the Trust a clear picture of how their environment is seen by those using it, and how we can improve it Being an integral part of learning disability (LD) audits in terms of access to services. This supports the Monitor LD Access Indicator. Volunteers The Patient Experience Team currently co- ordinate all new volunteer requests . Volunteers are managed and supervised by team leaders or ward managers. Although the rol e of the Volunteer will vary from team to team, examples of t heir activities are as follows: Assisting with the discharge questionnaire on inpatient wards Befriending on our wards and visiting those patients who don't receive any visitors Delivering speech after stroke support groups in the Speech and Language Service in Carlisle and Allerdale Supporting patients at meal times on Community inpatient wards 175 Supporting staff with administration tasks on Mental Health inpatient wards As Assistant psychology vol unteer within the Memory and Later Life service Support the Medical Education Department to recruit volunteers to support them in delivering the training outcomes to the student medical doctors. Work is continuing to raise the profile and promote volunteering at various events including local job fairs, members meetings. Collaborative/Interagency working Throughout the Trust there are numerous examples of work that is taking place with third sector organisations and statutory organisations, some examples although not exhaustive are as follows: Local Healthwatch People First Advocacy Age Concern Cortland's Trust Mind Governors of the Trust Multi -organisational Learning Event Acute Trusts Cumbria Council for Voluntary Service Alzheimer's Society Bi-polar UK British Lung Association CCG and the other NHS providers in Cumbria Carer Support Groups. Patient stories to the Board of Directors Patient stories to the Board have continued to be a feature on quarterly public meetings during 2018/19, although some were not heard due to late cancellation by the patients involved. A patient, service user or carer has been invited to attend to share their experience of the services they have been accessing. The people invited can be identified in a number of ways: From pr omotion within a service area e.g. poster displays, information leaflets or staff asking people if they want to take part Incident forms Serious Untoward Incidents/Deaths Complaints Suggestions from clinical or operational management staff Experience of care feedback e.g. compliments, comments, questionnaire feedback These people have accessed the following services: 176 Memory Matters & Later Life Services - Ruskin Unit - Through the voice of the Ward Manager, the wife of an older person with highly complex needs shared the experience of the seeing her husband receive care which at times was managed by the use of restrictive interventions. A specialist Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) was not available but the Multi -Disciplinary Team (MDT) worked with the patient and his family to provide care which has resulted in significant improvement. His wife's words were read and photos of the man behind the illness were shown. The staff example was shared by a Nurse who was asked to attend PICU a part of a response to an emergency BLICK being activated on the Carleton Clinic Site. The Police were called to attend and offered to take the patient into custody to provide a safe environment. The B oard heard what informed the Nurse to put the patient 's needs first and to decide to manage his care needs by nursing him on the unit. Dental Services, Carlisle - a parent shared her experience of her son's delay in receiving dental treatment in Furness, the young boy, 6 years old had toothache and required teeth extractions. The waiting list in Furness was lengthy therefore the parent was offered an appointment in Carlisle, which she accepted. Her son's teeth were removed and it was a good experience for both apart from the son waking up from the anaesthetic without his mot her present and he became upset. Our staff experience Our core objective is to embed the right culture and make the organisation a great place to work. Staff engagement is essential because we know that when staff are happy and fully engaged they provide the best possible care for our patients. 'This is Us' is the Trust's approach to staff engagement. Staff have the opportunity to meet with the CEO each quarter, in a variety of locations, to hear about the Trusts plans, raise any concerns and ask questions. The annual business plan and priorities are shared at the start of the financial year and cascaded to individuals through 'This is me', values based appraisal. Staff are also kept informed through a weekly CEO Blog, a newly developed staff intranet portal, email and 'Trust Talk' printed magazine. NHS Staff Survey The NHS Staff Survey is the largest survey of staff opinion in the UK; it is carried out annually to gather the views on staff experience at work in ten key indicators. The survey is ad ministered electronically and completely anonymous. Indicators are measured on a scale of 10 and we are benchmarked against the average score of other similar trusts. The response rate for the 2018 NHS staff survey was high, 49% compared to a national average of 41%. The scores for each indicator, together with comparison against the average for combined mental health / Learning disability and community t rusts are presented in the table below: 177 Indicators 2018/19 2017/18 2016/17 Trust Average Trust Average Trust Average Equality, diversity and inclusion 9.2 9.2 9.4 9.2 9.3 9.2 Health and wellbeing 5.9 6.1 6.1 6.1 5.9 6.2 Immediate managers 7.1 7.2 7.2 7.1 6.9 7.1 Morale 6.2 6.2 x x x x Quality of appraisals 5.5 5.5 5.7 5.4 5.3 5.4 Quality of care 7.2 7.4 7.5 7.4 7.4 7.5 Safe environment - bullying and harassment 8.2 8.2 8.3 8.3 7.7 8.2 Safe environment - violence 9.6 9.5 9.5 9.5 9.4 9.5 Safety culture 6.7 6.8 6.7 6.7 6.5 6.7 Staff engagement 7.0 7.0 7.1 7.0 7.1 7.0 *There is no comparable data for 2017/18 and 2016/17 for the Morale indicator, as this was a new indicator for the 2018/19 survey. The results from the Staff Survey show that staff engagement is the same as similar Trusts (7.0); staff recommendation of the Trust as a place to r eceive treatment is slightly higher than average and recommendation as a place to work is lower than average. Results for all scores are lower than in 2017 when staff engag ement was reported as 7.1. Indicator 2017/18 2018/19 Staff recommendation of the Trust as a place to receive treatment 72.6% 66.4% Staff recommendation as a place to work 61.7% 57.9% Indicators for safe environment from violence and bullying and harassment, staff morale, equality and diversity and quality of appraisal are average or above av erage when compared to similar t rusts. The survey shows that staff feel safe to speak out and do not feel discriminated against at work. They receive more training than similar t rusts and report high rates of annual appraisal with quality of appraisal similar to other trusts. We benchmarked below average in the health and wellbeing, immediate management, quality of care and safety culture indicators. Staff have particularly highlighted their lack of involvement in decision making and inability to undertake improvements in their area of work. They also express uncertainty in who the senior managers are and lack of communication. They do not feel the organisation takes positive action on health and wellbeing. Since the last NHS staff survey we have achieved the bronze Health and Wellbeing at Work award which recognises the achievements of managers and health advocates in promoting health and supporting staff wellbeing. 23 staff health advocates delivered a twelve month campaign of health promotional activities based on the results of a staff health needs assessment, including awareness of enhancing sleep and reducing alcohol consumption. We changed our occupational health service provider and now all staff and their families have access to an employee assist programme. 178 Closer working and integration with NCUH over the past 12 months has brought about change and aligned governance arrangements. Local pulse surveys, which monitor staff engagement throughout the year, indicate that clarity and work relationships have potential to impact on staff engagement. Future Priorities and Targets The results of the NHS Staff survey are reviewed in light of feedback from pulse surveys and exit interviews and themes from issues raised with the Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. These themes inform our organisational development plan and initiatives. In 2019/20 we will continue to support staff health and wellbeing and continue to work towards achieving the silver Heal th and Wellbeing at work award. Our other priorities include: Enhancing opportunities for more flexible working. Whilst survey results show that opportunities for flexible working are improving, they are still below average when compared to other t rusts. An Engaging for Improvement project will see HR and staff working together to explore options for flexible workin g and better work life balance. Opportunities for flexible working - NHS staff survey 2018 2015 2016 and positive behaviours at work. Staff have been involved in the development of a new set of organisational values. These values and a supporting behaviours framework was launched in April 2019 and forms the basis of a new appraisal process. Personal experience of harassment, bullying or abuse at work from managers - NHS staff survey 2018 2015 2016 focus on communication This will be part icularly important through 2019/ 20 as we progress towards a merged organisation with NCUH. We will build on the 'This is Us' engagement programme and development of the staff intranet portal. Staff feedback will continue to be monitored through quarterly pulse checks and pr ogress reported to the Quality & Safety Committee , a Board Committee ..

Community Health care group - Patients complained about the care and treatment provided. Complaints received about staff member's attitude towards them. Specialist Services care group - Patients complained about their experience of Dental Services, and the treatment that was provided. Patients complaints about the Neurology Services, and t he treatment that they have been provided with. Examples of improvements following a complaint: CAMHS Consultants to ensure that all appointments are inputted on the RiO electronic system and this was addressed by the Medical Director. School Immunisation Service has identified that the triaging of the forms needs to be thorough and the teams are now highlighting the consent response Yes with green highlighter to ensure that no nasal flu vaccines are given when consent hasn't been provided. Community Inpatient Wards now ensure that discharge checklists are fully completed. The North Cumbria MSK Service reviewed their Policy to include the process of sending a discharge letter to patients and they now consider if patients should be disch arged after one missed appointment. More rubber dam clamps were made available to clinicians in the Dental Service following an incident of a young person having their tooth chipped during treatment. Ramsey Unit have implemented a process where the Named N urse arranges to meet with family members within 5 days of admission to share information regarding their loved one. Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) For the period of 2018/19 - 8 cases were under review by the PHSO, these are from years 2014/15, and 2017/18. The number and details of these cases are as follows: 5 Cases - remain ongoing. 3 Cases - have been fully investigated and are now closed, the outcome being 2 not upheld and 1 partially upheld. Future priorities From the feedback received in 2018/19 the following priorities have been identified for 2019/2020 to further improve our complaints process: To continue to embed the learning lesson's process and the learning from complaint investigations. 181 Reduce the time it takes to complete the complaints process to enable the complainant to have a satisfactory resolution to their issues as soon as possible. To develop a joint Complaints Handling Pol icy with NCUH. Compliments We received and recorded 1236 compliments in 2018/19. This is a decrease from 2017/18 when 2432 were received. During 2018/19 we received 7102 free text comments through the Friends and Family Test and other comment fields on t he questionnaires. Health, safety and security We recognise and accept our duty towards ensuring the health, safety and welfare of all our employees and people who use our services and premises. As far as is practicable, we ensure that all work is carried out in the safest possible manner without undue risk to staff, patients an d others. We place a high value on both the physical and psychological wellbeing of our staff and service users. We will ensure health and safety legislative compliance as a minimum standard, and will endeavour to achieve recognised good practice standards wherever practicable. The Health and Safety, Security Departments were part of the first wave of shared services in preparation for the developing changes of healthcare provision in Cumbria. Both departments have been brought under the common headship of the Corporate Resilience and Safety portfolio represented at the Board by the System Executive Director of Finance & Estates . The Workforce and Organisational Development directorate cover the staff wellbeing element of health and safety including stress. The joint Corporate Health and Safety, Security Committee meets on a monthly basis and includes union health and safety representation. The number of incidents reported, along with the harm levels recorded for incidents relating to Health and Safety/ Security (inclusive of Violence and Aggression) are shown in the table below. * As there may be more than one person involved in an incident, harm statistics can exceed the total number of incidents. Incident Type 0 No Harm / Injury 1 Low Harm / Injury 2 Moderate Harm / Injury 3 Severe Harm / Injury Death Unknown / Not stated Total Number of Incidents* Health and Safety 41 56 18 1 0 11 127 Manual Handling 2 24 8 0 0 21 55 Security 57 3 0 0 0 1 61 Violence/ Aggression 709 332 76 3 0 13 1133 182 All incidents for health and safety, manual handling, security and violence and aggression are reviewed. Incidents are followed up dependent on a range of factors including actual harm, the potential for harm, identification of a trend, identification of a potential trust wide issue, RIDDOR reportable incident, or at the request of managers. In addition the following work was carried out relating to Health and Safety and Security in 2018/19. Specialist reviews/ environmental assessments/ specialist advice - 51 New estates projects (specialist health, safety and security advice) - 2 Policy/Strategy reviews - 6 A new Joint Health and Safety Policy was agreed and ratified in August 2018. The framework of the policy is based upon the Health and Safety Management Framework described in Health and Safety Guidance (HSG) 65 Plan, Do, Check, Act . The policy was launched through the Continuous Service Improvement 9 th wave in November 2018. This is to address the H ealth & Safety Risk EST1718 -01 on the Corporat e Risk Register to ensure robust health and safety management process. A program of developing joint policies for all the existing H & S, Security policies across both Trusts has been agreed with Corporate Governance. To launch the joint policies, a programme was submitted to the Continuous Service Improvement Team. This has been accepted in November 2018 as part of the Engaging for Improvement Wave 9 scheme. Examples where specialist reviews, environmental assessments or providing specialist advice have led to tangible improvements to safety and security include: The identification and resolution of issues at an early stage in building refurbishment/design projects to ensure the design offers a safe and secure workplace Collaborative working with manager s to develop and implement workable and sustainable solutions to address issues or concerns raised by staff. Violence and Aggression As part of a national program of focussed inspections, our Mental Health services were inspected on 27 November 2018 by the HSE. Inspectors visited Dane Garth at Furness General Hospital and Carlton Clinic Carlisle. The outcome is that the services inspected were compliant. The inspectors commended staff on the innovative approach in reduci ng the risk of violence and aggression. They noted training had been well received by staff. They made comment on the use of the \"live\" dashboard to monitor and improve outcomes. Musculo- Skeletal Disorders As part of a national program of focussed inspect ions by the HSE our Mental Health services were inspected on 28 November 2018. Inspectors visited Carlton Clinic Carlisle. The outcome is that the services inspected were compliant. They made comment that there was evidence that the staff training given was been practiced at ward level. 183 Part 3: Other information relevant to the quality of our services The following tables provide information against a range of performance indicators. The indicators have been included as they reflect th e Trusts national, statutory and local reporting requirements. Quality and Safety are a key focus within our performance measures. Indicator Period TargetTrend points (% from target) AE 4 hour waits (Type 3) Mar-19 99.2% (CPFT) (rolling 3 months)Feb-19 18 915 1408 month and volumeOperational performance (Single Oversight Framework metrics) 184 Indicator Period Target Trend Never events - rolling 6 months (CPFT) Mar-19 0 0 0 237 Patient Safety Alerts not completed (CPFT) Mar-19 0 0 0 64 Potential under-reporting of patient safety incidents rate (rolling 6 months) (CPFT)Sep-18 53.6 N/ap 55.57 <16 yr old admissions to adult MH wards (bed days) (CPFT)Mar-19 0 0 0 4Safe Year to DateLatest national comparisonQuality of care (Single Oversight Framework metrics) Actual Indicator Period Target Trend CPA 7 day follow ups (CPFT) Mar-19 95% 92.5% Year to DateLatest national comparisonEffective 185 Indicator Period Target Trend FFT Staff % recommend to to work (CPFT) 2018 61% 62% N/apActual Year to DateLatest national comparisonOrganisational Health (Single Oversight Framework metrics) 186 Performance during 2018/19 Key Highlights We have achieved the 4 hour wait target 95% for A&E ; the 6 week referral to diagnostic 99% standard in paediatric audiology ; Referral to Treatment 18 week 92% standard; the EIP 50% standard; and both 6 week and 18 week IAPT standards this financial year (Apr il 2018 to March 2019). Areas for improvement 1. Inappropriate Out of Area Placement (OAP) bed days - Out of Area Placements has been challenging in 2018/19 due to bed pressures, compounded by an increasing level of Delayed Transfers of Care for the Mental Health care group. OAPs are closely managed in a joint arrangement with the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) . Each placement is discussed and agreed with the CCG prior to placing the patient. 2. Care Programme Approach (CPA) patients receiving follow -up contact within seven days of discharge - The M ental Health care group monitor the completion of 7 Day Follow Ups closely, with daily performance validation processes in place with the Business Intell igence and Data Quality teams. The main theme for under p erformance so far this financial year has been patient engagement (i.e. refusal of appointments, disengagement with service etc). Focus in 2019/20 is on reducing down to 72 hours as per CQUIN targets . 3. MHSDS Data Quality Maturity Index (DQMI) - The Mental Health care group are closely monitoring performance against the new and additional experimental data quality indicators for the Mental Healt h Minimum Dataset in the DQMI. Performance is expected to dip as the new indicators are added in to the overall score and the Business Intelligence team are engaged with NHS Digital as developments are m ade and metadata shared with t rusts. Internally reporting is already underway to locally monitor the indicators, which will be improved if NHS Digital are able to release their script and logic behind each indicator. LD access indicator The indicator shown above relates to access to healthcare services for people with a diagnosis of learning disability. The Learning Disability Protocol and Awareness packs continue to be updated on an annual basis, which provide staff with key information and guidance to help them to support people who access their services, who have, or they suspect t o have, a learning disability. The updated self -assessment and protocol pac ks were well received by care groups, and the new documentation makes a more effective way of being able to identify improvements and areas of best practice, for sharing. To continue to provide further depth and assurance around the information captured within the self -assessment, the bi -annual audit programme changed in April 2018 to a quarterly review programme. The programme to all care groups is well received and an increase in 187 frequency provides greater service coverage and visibility. The review programme is supported by a service user representative who takes an active role in the completion of these reviews. Findings of the reviews are fed and monitored through the care group and aligned trustwide governance arrangements. Some of the benefits and improvements from this work include: Greater awareness of the LD access self -assessment by teams. Involvement of a service user representative in the process, who can help develop services by giving feedback on accessibility. Promotion of the LD Protocol and Awareness packs to support staff in supporting people who access their services who have a learning disability. Services having greater awareness of the support that is available across the Trust, such as through the LD teams. Raising the profile of le arning disability - reports that go through care group and trustwide level governance structures. Provides the Trust with a greater level of assurance around access and support for people with a learning disability. 188 Annex 1: St atements from commissioners, local Healthwatch organisations and overview and scrutiny Committee s NHS Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Grou p Moor Lane Mills, Moor Lane Lancaster, Lancashire, Corroborative Statement from North Cumbria & Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) on Bay CCG (MBCCG) welcome the opportunity to review and comment on the Quality Account 2018/19 for Cumbria Partnership Trust (CPFT). As commissioners, both NCCCG and MBCCG are committed to commissioning high quality services from CPFT and take seriously their responsibility to the general public to ensure that patient's needs are met by the provision of safe high quality services and that the views and expectations of patients and the public are listened to and acted upon. The Quality Review process has changed this year as the Integrated Health and Care System has developed; incorporating the Acute, Mental Health and Community Trusts. A monthly Integrated Healthcare Partnership Quality Assurance Committee was established to provide Senior Staff in both organisations, with NHSE, NHSI, CQC and other partners, the forum to seek assurance about quality. This has developed through the year and has become a System Quality Assurance Committee , providing the opportunity to monitor, review and discuss quality issues. This Committee provides oversight for the quality agenda in both North Cumbria University Hospitals and Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust, as staff have been starting to work together on continuous improvement across the services. In addition to this, NCCCG in collaboration with MBCCG as appropriate, carried out commissioner -led unannounced assurance visits to 189 monitor the quality of the services provided and to encourage continuous quality improvement. The CCGs would like to commend the hard work, commitment and resilience of CPFT staff, and the efforts that have led to the Care Quality Commission's finding that in the 'Caring domain' 12 of the 14 core services were good, with 2 core services rated as outstanding. The CCGs note that the overall Trust rating remains 'Requires Improvement'. The Quality Account provides an open account of the achievements made in the past year and describes the priorities for 2019/20 and is an important contribution to public accountability in relation to quality. The CCGs appreciate the amount of work involved in producing this report and commends the openness within it. We note the quality improvement priorities in 2018/19 and going forward into 2019/20, in preventing people dying prematurely and the development of the 'real time' alert system of unexpected deaths. This has already led to early work taking place following the system recognising a cohort of similar suicides in one of the localities. We note the work on harm - free care and the development of a Quality & Safety Dashboard, giving staff the ability to measure preventable harm in 'real time'. We note the progress on meeting the timely access targets, that the CAMHS Service is working with Northumberland Tyne & Wear Trust on a recovery plan and that the CAMHS Eating Disorder Service will improve data capture and reporting. The report provides detail on people having a positive experience of care, noting there are 'Patient Stories' at each Trust Board Meeting and the change in emphasis to using patients feedback as part of service improvements. The report provides detail on the results from the Mortality Review process and the results of the audit reports and programmes Trust staff were involved within the year. We note the Trust's Key areas for improvement during 2019/20: To reduce the number of people being sent out of Cumbria County for their care and reinforcing the management of the joint arrangement for improving this. To improve the follow up of patients discharged from Mental Health Services within 7 days. MBCCG recognised the collaboration undertaken between University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in safely integrating hospital and community services across South Cumbria from April 1 2018. MBCCG now acknowledges the Board approval to integrate Mental Health Services within Morecambe Bay. This integration aims to bring the Health and Care System together in line with the Better Care Together 2 Strategy working in a much more integrated and 'joined up' way to improve patient care and experience. It will also support to reduce duplication and allowing the services to offer more consistent care across the whole of Morecambe Bay. MBCCG note the work already started to improve the quality of Mental Health and Learning Disability Services. 190 Overall the report is well written and presented and is reflective of quality activity across the organisation. As required under the Quality Report Regulations, staff within the CCG have checked the accuracy of data relevant to the contract. In so far as we have been able to check the factual details, the CCG's view is that the report is materially accurate. It is clearly presented in the format required by NHS England and the information it contains accurately represents the Trust's quality profile. North Cumbria CCG looks forward to continuing to work with CPFT as the Integrated Health and Care Service becomes established and the involvement of Northumberland Tyne and Wear gets on to a more formal footing, to support and assure the improvements of the quality of services commissioned in 2019/20. North Cumbria and Morecambe Bay CCG looks forward to continuing to work with CPFT to support and assure the improvement of the quality of services commissioned in 2019/20. Yours sincerely Anna Stabler Director of Nursing & Quality North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group Margaret Williams Chief Executive Nurse Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group 191 Cumbria County Council Cumbria Health Scrutiny Committee Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust Quality Accounts Feedback 2019 The Cumbria Health Scrutiny Committee welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Cumbria Partnership Trust's Draft Quality Accounts for 2018/19. Members understand the format and layout of the document is set for the Trust but still felt that the document is challenging for the wider public including as it does a great deal of technical language. Members felt that the report accurately reflects t he evidence submitted to the Cumbria Health Scrutiny Committee and Lead Health Scrutiny Members over the past twelve months. The Committee welcomed the improvements in staff satisfaction this is no small achievement given some of the changes taking place s uch as the proposed merger with the North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust and the transfer of Mental Health Services. The Committee has been working closely with the Trust on its review of Mental Health Services and will continue to monitor and scrutini se the transfer of Mental Health Services later this year Overall, we appreciate the co- operation received and look forward to continuing to work with the Trust during the coming year. Cllr Claire Driver Chair Cumbria Health Scrutiny Committee 9 th May 2019 Serving the people of Cumbria cumbria.gov.uk 192 Healthwatch Cumbria to Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust Quality Accounts Report for 2018 -19 30th April 2019 Introduction : Healthwatch Cumbria is pleased to be able to submit the following considered response to Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Quality Accounts Report for 2018- 19. Part 1: Statement on quality from the Chief Executive Commencing with a succinct des cription of the organisational changes the Statement sets a clear vision of the Trust values and culture and the aspiration to have a positive and open culture both within the Trust and with communities and partners, this we recognise, welcome and continue to support. The tone of the whole document is summarised within the remainder of the Statement, namely the commitment to deliver high quality care and to improve and transform services with partners and the clear aspiration to improve the Care Quality Commission (CQC) rating across all services. Part 2: Priorities for improvement and statements of assurance from the Board of Directors Progress against 2017/18 priorities for improvement The detailed and clear narrative in respect of the Quali ty Priorities 2018/2019 describing the rationale, progress, actions, learning and next steps is exceptionally good and very informative. Responding to the 2017/18 Quality Accounts Healthwatch Cumbria referred 193 to tangible improvements and the cycle of learning and improvement, we are pleased to see this theme continuing through 2018/19. The value and impact of engagement in research is well described and again demonstrates emphasis of improvement from learning approach that the Trust has adopted. We note that additional consideration (2) of the NHS Improvement letter 17 th December 2018 Quality accounts: reporting arrangements 2019/19, ahead of legislation requested Trusts to provide details of ways that staff can speak up (including whistle- blowers) and how they ensure such staff do not suf fer detriment as a result has been addressed with measures including the role of the Freedom to Speak Up Guardians and the Raising a Concern process. In accordance with the current NHS reporting requirements, mandatory quality indicators requiring inclusion in the Quality Account we believe the Trust has fulfilled this requirement. Information received by Healthwatch Cumbria (HWC) from service users and their families and carers regarding serv ices provided by Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust (CPFT ) is consistent with the data, statements and comments contained in the Quality Account. Healthwatch Cumbria is aware that the Trust is actively collaborating with other organisations and listening to public opinion, plus utilising co -production methodology to help public services and communities to develop alternative service models, actions we fully support. Overall, we would say that this is a well balanced document in that it acknowledges areas of improvement needed and the remedial measures being taken to address these. The emphasis on culture change, increased involvement of the public, staff and partner organisations to develop continuous improvement is integral to the document. We welcome, and would like to find ways of supporting this in practice. Sue Stevenson Chief Operating Officer Healthwatch Cumbria 194 Annex 2: Statement of Directors' responsibilities for the quality report T he quality report must include a statement of directors' responsibilities, in the following form of words: T he directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quali ty Accounts) Regulations to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year.

Robin Talbot, Chair 23 May 2019 P rof. Stephen Eames, Chief Executive 23 May 2019 196 197198199200Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 1 Annex 1 CUMBRIA PARTNERSHIP NHS FOUNDATION TRUST Annual accounts for the year ended 31 March 2019 2Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 3 Annual Governance Statement Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS foundation trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS foundation trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle risk and risk management arrangements The Chief Executive has overall accountability for risk management and discharges that duty through the Executive Team and their respective portfolios. During 2018/19 we have worked increasingly collaboratively with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (NCUH) and together we have introduced shared governance and leadership structures across all of our services. Senior clinical leaders are in place throughout each of our care groups. They are responsible for driving improvements to quality and safety, and actively support staff in the identification and management of identified risks. Care groups are supported by staff within Corporate and Support Service teams who are specialists . in various aspects of risk management, and who are a central resource for training, advice and guidance . During the year we have integrated most of our support service teams with those in NCUH and have aligned our systems and processes so that, collectively, our Corporate and Support Service teams provide support across both Trusts. A 'best of both' principle was adopted in the work to refresh and align our quality governance, clinical risk management and leadership frameworks to ensure good practice in both Trusts formed the basis of our aligned arrangements to identify, manage, escalate and report risks, as appropriate to the scale and nature of the risk. The Board of Directors (the Board) has line of sight to the management of significant operational and strategic risks through the Board Assurance Framework and through the functioning of its Committee and governance frameworks. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 4 Risk management is part of our training programme. In addition to subject-specific training and core skills training, which make up the overall training programme, we deliver risk management training for team leaders, which covers the essentials of risk management. This includes learning from incidents and complaints through appropriate level investigations, and duties as a manager under health and safety law. Policies and procedures to support and enable risk management are available to all staff on our intranet site . We benefit from good practice through a range of learning and improvement mechanisms, including: Robust investigation processes Peer review Clinical audits Professional and personal development The application of evidence-based practice Quality improvement tools, such as the Cumbria Production System Investigation of complaints, incidents and near misses is overseen by our System Executive Chief Nurse. Quality, safety and performance matters are cascaded and escalated through governance frameworks. Improving the quality of care and safety are the driving principles of our quality governance arrangements. The Risk and Control Framework Board Membership There were a number of changes to Board membership during the year. Substantive appointments were made to the System Executive Chief Nurse, Executive Director of Workforce & Organisational Development, Executive Chief Operating Officer, Executive Medical Direct or and Executive Director of Strategy. All Executive Directors have the remit across both Trusts. An Interim Executive Director of Mental Health, Learning Disabilities and CAMHS (non-voting Director) was also appointed during the year to manage the transition of mental health, learning disabilities and CAMHS services to alternative providers. Two Non-Executive Directors were appointed into vacant posts and have roles across both Trusts bringing the total number of Non- Executive Directors appointed to both Trusts to three. In February 2019, the Governors Council, agreed the appointment of Prof. Robin Talbot as Chair of both Trusts for a two-year term, to take effect on 1 April 2019 following the retirement of NCUH Chair. These changes reflect and demonstrate our commitment in moving toward an integrated health and care system, but do not diminish our responsibilities and accountabilities as a NHS Foundation Trust. As at 23 April 2019 we have: Seven Non-Executive Directors (the Chair plus six other Non-Executive Directors, three of whom also have NED roles within NCUH) Seven Executive Directors, six of whom have voting rights No Executive Director or Non-Executive Director vacanciesCumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 5 The balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors on the Board remains in line with the Code of Governance for NHS Foundation Trusts and our Constitution and Standing Orders. Further details about Board members and changes to Board membership during the year can be found in the Directors Report and the Remuneration Report. During Quarter 4 of 2017/18 a review was undertaken of the corporate governance structures that support Board Committee effectiveness in order to prepare for and implement aligned board-level governance arrangements across both trusts which took effect in April 2018. During Quarters 1 and 2 activity focussed on the alignment of clinical and corporate governance meetings structures to support the aligned board level arrangements. These took full effect from October 2018. At the time of writing, following agreement from the Governors Council in November 2018 and approval of the Strategic Case by NHS Improvement (NHSI) in February 2019, activity is underway to prepare for both Trusts to merge to become a single organisation. The aim is that the new Trust will 'go -live' in October 2019 fo llowing approval of the Full Business Case by the Board in June 2019, and subject to successful progress through the Transactions process with NHSI. As this transaction is technically an acquisition of NCUH by CPFT the merged Trust (name not yet confirmed at time of writing) will be a Foundation Trust. A programme management approach has been adopted to prepare for and manage the merger transaction. Work streams led by Executive Directors deliver the required activity and report progress into the Programme Board which is chaired by the Chief Executive. The Governors Council are engaged in the process and have been involved in the review and development of the Constitution for the new Trust. At the time of writing a further review is ongoing to explore opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of the Trusts' governance framework, taking into consideration feedback received in March 2019 from NHS Improvement as part of their supportive 'Moving to Good' programme, as well as for integrating aspects of corporate governance with the North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group as part of moves toward an integrated health and care system. These reviews are likely to result in some changes to the governance framework and associated meetings structures which will be implemented during 2019/20 having due regard to impacts on, and from, merger and CCG integration activities. Meetings that have been in place during 2018/19, and any changes or adjustments to their arrangements within the year, are set out below. Board and Board level Committee The Board is supported by a governance structure as follows, which deals with various components of corporate governance and risk. With the exception of the Audit and Risk Committee and Charitable Funds Committee all meetings described below happen in an aligned manner with NCUH (meeting at the same place, at the same time). These aligned arrangements recognise the statutory duties of both Trusts as separate legal entities whilst also enabling efficiencies through avoiding duplication of senior managers' at tendance at meetings. Quality and Safety Committee (Q&S) - the designated Board Committee which oversees quality and safety issues. It is chaired by a Non-Executive Director (NED) and has ExecutiveCumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 6 and NED membership. The Q&S Committee monitored clinical risk management performance throughout the year and made recommendations to the Board as appropriate. Finance Investment and Performance Committee (FIP) - the designated Board Committee which oversees financial, corporate performance and investment issues. It is chaired by a NED and has Executive and NED membership. The FIP Committee monitored risks to operational and financial performance throughout the year and made recommendations to the Board as appropriate. Charitable Funds Committee - this designated Board Committee which oversees the management of Charitable Funds held by the Trust. Audit & Risk Committee (A&R) - an independent Committee and senior Board Committee, with all members NEDs. The A&R Committee has responsibility for overseeing risk management and internal control. The A&R Committee agreed audit plans with our internal and external auditors and received progress updates and audit opinions throughout the year. Remuneration Committee - wholly NED membership. Mental Health Legislation Committee - membership is Mental Health Act Managers, and is chaired by a Non-Executive Director. In December 2018 the Board of directors agreed to introduce this meeting as a formal Board level sub-Committee. At the time of writing transition arrangements are underway for the first meeting of this Committee to take place led by the Executive Director of Mental Health. Executive Leadership Group - membership is Executive Directors, led by the Chief Executive. In practice, due to the joint roles held by the Chief Executive and a number of other Executive Directors across both the Trust and NCUHT, this meeting takes place as a joint Executive Team meeting. The Joint Company Secretary also attends these meetings. High level governance meetings that support Board Committee effectiveness Clinical Management Group (CMG) (formerly Trust Management Board (TMB)) - the senior operational management group led by the Chief Executive and attended by Executive Directors, senior operational and clinical leaders within care groups and Heads of Support Services. CMG monitors risks to operational, clinical and financial performance and escalates issues and risks to Board level Committees as appropriate. Trust Wide Clinical Governance Group (TWCGG) - the senior forum for clinical governance, led by the Deputy Director of Nursing and Quality (April 2018 - September 2018) and System Executive Chief Nurse (October 2018 - April 2019). This group monitors risks to quality and safety and provides updates to our Q&S Committee. Representation at the meeting includes the Medical Director, senior clinicians within care groups and senior managers within support services. The change in leadership of this group part way through the year arose following the substantive appointment of the System Executive Chief Nurse. In April 2019 this meeting was 'stood down' with alternative arrangements taking effect from May 2019 as part of changes to the governance framework.Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 7 Joint Leadership Development Group - led by the Chief Executive and including Executive Directors and senior managerial and clinical leaders, with a specific focus on the development and implementation of our strategy. During the year membership of this group expanded to also include senior managers from the North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group. Compliance Board - led by the Executive Chief Operating Officer and including Executive Directors and senior managerial and clinical leaders, with a specific focus on CQC compliance. During 2018/19 the effectiveness of our Board and Committees was evaluated through a survey involving Board members and members of each Board Committee, and also through consideration of the Committees' performance against their work plans. This evaluation indicated each Committee had met and fulfilled their functions in accordance with their Terms of Reference although identified the need to review the future format of board effectiveness surveys. Risk Management Strategy The annual review of our Risk Management Strategy was undertaken with the Board agreeing the updated Risk Management Strategy in November 2018. The Risk Management Strategy will be reviewed again during the first half of 2019/20 as part of further alignment activity with NCUH and the move toward an integrated health and care system. The strategy sets out our integrated approach to risk governance, which incorporates: Strategic planning activities Business planning activities Quality Governance Framework Assurance Framework Governance Assurance and Accountability Framework Central to our integrated approach to risk governance is risk appetite. In June 2018 we agreed a joint risk appetite statement, joint strategic objectives and joint strategic risks. In setting out our appetite for risk, we use a risk appetite framework based upon that promoted by the Good Governance Institute but which has been expanded to include wider range of risk domains that reflect complex sustainability challenges currently facing the NHS. Board members' individual risk appetites inform a collective debate on the organisational risk appetite which is then agreed by the Board. The System Executive Chief Nurse is accountable for ensuring appropriate systems and processes are in place to enable the implementation of our Risk Management Strategy. Our Risk Management Strategy is implemented through the Risk Management Policy which sets out the framework for how risks are identified, evaluated and controlled. Operational risks are managed on a day- to-day basis by staff through our governance structures. The Risk Management Strategy is also delivered through other policies and procedures that support the activities mentioned above, including: Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 8 Policies on specific risk areas, including policies and procedures with respect to countering fraud and corruption Policies for the reporting and investigation of incidents, complaints, concerns, and claims A risk-based training programme based on an annual analysis of skills and competencies required to support the delivery of safe and effective services Induction programmes for our staff and governors Training delivered by a combination of in-house experts and external partners, that gives the flexibility to provide tailored training to meet the needs of individuals with additional risk management responsibilities Reporting to the Board and its Committee on quality governance matters, including patient safety, patient experience, performance against key performance indicators and other regulatory and compliance requirements. Risk Management Policy The Risk Management Policy, last reviewed during 2016/17, sets out our approach to the identification, evaluation, assessment, management, reporting and monitoring of risks. In addition, it also sets out how risks are to be escalated through our governance frameworks. Training on the Risk Management Policy was delivered to team leads during the year as part of our risk management training programme. The Board Development programme during the year has also incorporated risk management training for board members through activity to review and update strategic risks that underpin the Board Assurance Framework (BAF), review and development of the risk appetite statement, and most recently in March 2019, a review of the risk and assurance escalation flows to inform the development governance framework. During 2018/19 elements of our risk management processes started to become aligned with those of NCUH, with the aim that during 2019/20 they will become fully aligned. This includes the bringing together of both Trusts' risk management policies into a single joint policy. We are continually seeking ways in which to enhance the quality of information available to frontline services to support their decision making around risk management. Quality and safety dashboards, which have been developed in liaison with our clinical leads, enable our leaders to actively identify and respond to quality and safety risks within their services. Further enhancements to the content, accessibility and functionality of dashboards were made during the year and the use of dashboards within governance forums is becoming embedded. A continual improvement approach is taken to enhance the capabilities of our risk management information system (Ulysses). Our Quality and Safety Systems Group (formerly Ulysses systems group) meets regularly throughout the year to discuss improvement opportunities and to ensure the system enables us to meet our statutory obligations with accuracy. During the year, our Integrated Governance Manual was refreshed to recognise how we have aligned our governance and performance management frameworks with NCUH, and also sets out our joint arrangements for priority setting, business planning and our aligned Board Assurance Framework. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 9 Quality governance Quality governance is a key activity of the Board to ensure essential levels of quality and safety are met. External sources of assurance include: Internal and external auditors Care Quality Commission NHS Litigation Authority Other visits and inspections from regulatory agencies. Internal sources of assurance include: Activities undertaken by Quality and Safety Leads within care groups, Clinical Governance Team within the Quality & Nursing Directorate, and the Corporate Governance Department Performance metri cs Non-executive and governor joint visiting programme Incident reporting Patient and carer feedback, including patient stories at the Board Over recent years we have undertaken an annual self- assessment against NHSI's Well Led Framework which informs our evaluation of our quality governance arrangements. Our self- assessment against the Well Led framework, conducted during Quarter 4 of 2017/18, took into consideration the findings and recommendations from the CQC's inspection and our progress with improvement actions identified in our 2016/17 self-assessment. In Quarter 3 of 2018/19 we commissioned a peer- review against NHSI's Well Led framew ork, led by Northumberland Tyne and Wear, and which was undertaken between October 2018 and February 2019. Delivery of improvement actions has been monitored through relevant governance forums and with Board level oversight. Our 2018/19 annual self-assessment against the Well Led framework commenced in March 2019, with the outcome of that assessment due to be formally considered by the Board in June 2019. The self-assessment takes into consideration feedback from the external peer review. Areas identified for improvement included strengthening arrangements for workforce planning, strengthening our arrangements for corporate risk management, and strengthening our quality impact assessment (EQIA) arrangements to understand whether impacts identified within EQIAs materialised as expected. Our last formal Well Led external review was undertaken by Deloitte in 2015. The timeframe for our next formal external review is likely to be during 2019/20. We last underwent a formal Well Led inspection by the CQC in November 2017 and will be inspected again in June 2019. The CQC inspection report assessed us as 'requires improvement' overall with 22 'must do' actions requiring immediate attention. Details of how we have responded to their recommendations can be found in the Quality Report. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 10 Risks logged within our risk registers continue to be managed and regularly monitored through our governance frameworks. Scrutiny of the corporate risk register is undertaken monthly by the Clinical Management Group (CMG). Monthly monitoring is also undertaken to ensure risks within risk registers are reviewed and updated in a timely manner. As at 23 April 2019 10.2% of 'open' risks within our risks registers were overdue for review, compared with 4.31% on 31 March 2018. This aspect of risk register management is now incorporated into our performance management framework and is a regular aspect of quality governance within care groups and support services. During the year we have continued to strengthen our operational and strategic risk management processes through the inclusion within our BAF reports, of a visual representation of how risks within the corporate risk register impact upon, or are impacted by, strategic risks within the BAF. This, together with developments to our quality and safety dashboards and reporting on risk management to aid understanding and thematic analysis of how risks within risk registers have changed over time, enable a better understanding of our risk profile. The BAF continues to be shared with our care group and support service leadership teams after each quarterly update to enable cascading throughout the Trust of how the most significant risks to our objectives are being managed. Longer term actions which collectively will strengthen the quality of our risk management arrangements during 2019/20 include building on work commenced in 2018/19 to refresh risk management training programmes and guidance documents, reinvigorating governance processes within our care groups and support services, further developing our performance and safety dashboards, and updating the Ulysses risk management system. The Q&S Committee oversees progress and effectiveness of initiatives to address the CQC's must do actions. As part of our integration with NCUH, some changes were made during the year to care group structures. Some of our care groups now incorporate services from both Trusts, an example of this is the Children and Family Care Group. Activity to align quality governance arrangements has also taken place during the year through alignment of policies and meetings structures. Further integration and alignment work will be undertaken during 2019/20 to refocus clinical governance arrangements within our integrated structures and to embed quality improvement as the driving principle of our governance frameworks. Staff surveys and staff engagement activities give us rich information that we are using to inform our development programmes such as leadership and staff recognition. The Board receives performance reports on agreed safety and quality key performance indicators in accordance with the integrated performance management framework. To comply with the governance conditions of the Provider Licence, we are required to provide a Corporate Governance Statement to NHSI. The Corporate Governance Statement relating to 2018/19 was presented to the Board for formal acceptance in May 2019. The Corporate Governance Statement sets out any risks to our compliance with the governance conditions, along with the actions taken or being taken to maintain future compliance. The statement sets out a number of key questions essential for quality governance, with evidence gathered through self- assessment or review. The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with our Provider Licence conditions, which he discharges through the Executive Team. The FIP Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 11 Committee seeks assurance on compliance with the licence conditions on behalf of the Board of Directors. Risks to performance are managed and monitored through CMG. Throughout the year we have maintained good working relations with NHSI and have ensured they have been notified of any significant risks to compliance or service continuity. No exception reports have been required during 2018/19. We expect to comply with all of the Provider Licence conditions in 2019/20. Should there be any indications to the contrary we will ensure NHSI are notified as soon as they become apparent. NHSI is regularly appraised of our financial position. Further information on our quality governance arrangements can be found in the Quality Report. Incident reporting A positive approach to incident reporting is communicated through our policies and procedures. We continue to be consistently within the top third of benchmark trusts in NHS Organisation Patient Safety Incident Reports, in respect of reports of patient safety incidents, with most of our incidents reported falling within the no/low harm categories. We encourage the reporting of incidents or concerns and use as a tool to learn and improve. We have a clear focus on open and honest reporting of incidents, with investigation into an incident proportional to the level of harm or potential harm, as detailed in the Trust's Being Open/Duty of Candour and Serious Incident policies. Our approved Raising Concerns (Whistleblowing) policy is published on our website. The Audit & Risk Committee oversees our Raising Concerns process and our Freedom to Speak Up Guardian provides regular updates to the Board. Risk reporting Risk management is fundamental to how we operate. Our risk appetite is articulated in our Risk Management Strategy. Risks are identified and evaluated using a 5 x 5 risk grading matrix, and recorded and reported in accordance with the Risk Management Policy. Top strategic risks are managed through the Board Assurance Framework (BAF). Work activities of the Board and Board level Committee are aligned to the BAF in order to enable line of sight to the management of strategic risks. All operational risks are recorded in our risk management information system (Ulysses). Those risks recorded within Ulysses collectively form our risk register. The risks recorded on our risk register which scored 15-25 i.e. high risks, are also identified on the corporate risk register. An Executive Director or other senior manager is formally accountable for each recorded risk on our risk register. Individual responsibilities include ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place for effective risk management and mitigation. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 12 During Quarter 1 the Boards of both Trusts agreed joint strategic objectives, joint strategic risks and an aligned approach to the Board Assurance Framework (BAF). The first 'joint' BAF was agreed in July 2018 and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. The BAF is subject to formal review by the A&R Committee every six months and quarterly by the Board of Directors, Q&S Committee and FIP Committee. The CMG has responsibilities for risk management performance and receives monthly updates on the management of risks on the corporate risk register. The BAF review process, which takes place on a quarterly basis, incorporates a review of the risks on the corporate risk register. The management of risks is a routine item for discussion at each of the care groups' clinica l governance forums. The Q&S Committee receive annual reports from each care group about their clinical governance arrangements and Care Quality Commission (CQC) compliance. Any significant risks identified from these reviews are managed as per the agreed accountabilities and responsibilities framework. The Clinical Governance team within the Quality and Nursing Directorate coordinate arrangements for monitoring and overseeing CQC registration and compliance requirements. Public stakeholders are involved in identifying and managing risks through membership of the Governors Council and by attending specific service users' and carers' groups in the Trust. The Governors Council is provided with performance information and is involved in the annual planning process. All service users, carers and visitors are encouraged to provide feedback on the service received and offer suggestions for improvement. Data quality We have recognised for some time that data quality is an underpinning issue in most things that we and this has been highlighted by both our Internal and External Auditors over recent years. In July 2016, the A&R Committee endorsed a three-year Data Quality Strategy to systematically improve data quality across all of our information systems. The A&R Committee received updates on progress against the strategy throughout 2018/19 and the internal audit programme included audits on data quality which demonstrated positive improvements. Details of the steps we have taken to address data quality are provided in the Quality Report. Top strategic risks We take assurance that our quality governance arrangements are effective from a range of sources including audits by our Internal Auditors, and reviews by external bodies such as the CQC. We recognise that balancing high quality care with long term financial sustainability and delivering integrated care are significant and challenging strategic risks. These are integral to our BAF. We are working with our partners in the IHCS on major transformation programmes which span the Cumbria footprint to find workable solutions to these very challenging strategic risks. Examples of transformational schemes include the future provision of mental health services across Cumbria which we are working with our commissioners and regional partners to progress, and partnership working with GP practices to enable a more sustainable model for primary care across north Cumbria. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 13 In June 2018, in collaboration with the Board of NCUH, our Board reviewed the top strategic risks and major operational and clinical risks facing the organisations, and agreed the following top strategic risks which form the basis of our aligned Board Assurance Framework. In January 2019 the Board agreed the inclusion of an additional risk (Risk 10) within the BAF relating to the impacts on support services from transferring mental health services to alternative providers in line with Commissioner Intentions. Risk 1 Leadership and workforce is not sufficient to deliver the scale and pace of transformative change Risk 2 Cultural change to improve quality and empower people is not sustained Risk 3 Engagement with the public and partners is not effective in achieving positive change that improves or transforms services Risk 4 Quality of services (experience, safety, outcomes) are not improved because programmes to transform, integrate and save have adverse quality impacts Risk 5 Financial sustainability is not achieved as the effectiveness of cost reduction plans and implementation of new service models does not deliver the anticipated financial benefits set out in our long term plans Risk 6 Health and Health Service improvement plans are impeded by dependency on key partners who are not sufficiently ready / able to support our plans Risk 7 Vulnerable services become too unstable to continue during the implementation of wider transformation programmes across Cumbria and North East Risk 8 Infrastructure developments are not sufficiently enabling of transformation Risk 9 Fragility within primary care impacts our ability to effectively manage patient flow Risk 10 Support services are insufficiently resilient to effectively support the Trust following transfer of mental health services to an alternative provider The Board Assurance Framework is reviewed on a quarterly basis, with the framing of top strategic risks being reviewed on at least an annual basis, usually during Quarter 3. Significant operational and clinical risks Risks are identified, managed and monitored through our governance frameworks, in accordance with the Risk Management Policy and the aligned performance framework. Risk reporting and measurement are actioned through our Outcomes Framework, quality and safety dashboards, and via the risk management information system (Ulysses) - all of which enable line of sight to risk management performance at all levels throughout the Trust. Examples of significant operational and clinical risks affecting us include: Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 14 ability to ensure service continuity in services that are fragile due to challenges in recruitment to specialist roles, such as in some of our district nursing services short and medium term disruption to the resilience of support services associated with the transfer of mental health, learning disabilities and children & adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to alternative providers. delays in patients accessing specialist dental services due to lack of availability in specialists to support the delivery of care during treatments suitability of some of our patient and staff environments, such as our Kentmere ward in Kendal. Oakwood ward on our Carleton Clinic site and Valley View in Whitehaven all of which have their own particular issues which are complex to resolve. Policy Management As part of our increasingly integrated working with NCUH, both Trusts are working together to implement aligned processes for policy management. Initial work commenced during Quarter 4 of 2017/18 and has continued throughout 2018/19. The aim is for fully integrated arrangements by the end of Quarter 1 of 2019/20. Activity has taken place throughout 2018/19 to align policies with NCUH, and where appropriate to have joint policies spanning both Trusts. This work continues into 2019/20 and may result in adjustments and extension to review timeframes for some policies. During 2018/19 we continued to see improvements in the number of policies which were due for review. Policies become due for review throughout the year and arrangements are in place to initiate timely review. The number due for review as at 1 April 2019 was 27. This compares to 36 as at 31 March 2018. Policy management performance is monitored by Trust Wide Clinical Governance Group (TWCGG) and the Compliance Board, with oversight provided by A&R Committee. Information on how we have responded to the CQC inspection relating to the management and implementation of some policies is provided within the Quality Report. Quality Impact Assessments As part of our collaborative working with NCUH, an aligned approach to undertaking quality impact assessments was agreed by the Q&S Committee in April 2018 and has been applied throughout the year. The approach to undertaking quality impact assessments takes a holistic approach to assessing the impacts of major change schemes, including those proposed within our efficiency programme. The impact assessment approach enables decisions to be made based upon a balance of risks to quality, equality and the clinical and financial sustainability of services. The process is jointly led by the System Executive Chief Nurse and Executive Medical Director and overseen by the Q&S Committee. It is also integrated into our business planning process, which evolved during the year to integrate and incorporate the trust's ap proach to workforce planning. Board level assurance on the timely undertaking of impact assessments is provided through the Q&S Committee who also have a role in the EQIA approvals process. During 2019/20 the EQIA process will be strengthened further through undertaking evaluations of post-change impacts compared with anticipated impacts. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 15 Workforce strategies The Q&S Committee receive routine 'hard truths' nurse staffing reports throughout the year, including fill rates and care hours per patient day (CHPPD). The People Plan for the North Cumbria Integrated Health and Care System, approved by the Board in March 2019, sets out the strategic delivery approach to ensure a sustainable workforce. It also states the annual delivery plan priorities for 2019/20. Priorities for 2019/20 include developing an attraction plan and improving recruitment processes, also designing an effective, inclusive and engaged workforce through local plans that meet the needs of the population built on multi professional working and new roles. Delivery of the People Plan will be overseen through the Q&S Committee. We use the population centric model for workforce planning and have a draft workforce plan. The model hospital approach is being used to identify opportunities for workforce efficiencies, although this is at an early stage of development and will be incorporated into our workforce planning approach during 2019/20. A workforce planning group is in place, chaired by the Executive Director of Workforce & OD and has representation from primary care, nursing and Allied Health Professions. Our lead officer for workforce planning is a member of the workforce planning group. A workforce planning summit is planned to take place during 2019 and will involve a wide range of stakeholders. In summary, we have staffing governance processes in place although these are currently immature and will be strengthened to become embedded over 2019/20. Business conduct / conflicts of interest The foundation trust has published an up- to-date register of interests for decision-making staff within the past twelve months, as required by the ' Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS guidance: https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/managing-conflicts -of-interest- in-the-nhs - guidance-for-staff-and-organisations/ . Our Standards of Business Conduct policy was updated in 2018 to reflect changes to legislative requirements and to become a joint policy with NCUH. Policy requirements are being implemented on a phased approach during 2018/19 and 2019/20. This commenced with an update of Board members' and the Lead and Deputy Lead Governors' declarations in Quarter 3 of 2018/19, medical and senior clinical and non-clinical decision makers in Quarter 4 of 2018/19, with declarations for the remainder of individuals and groups stated within our policy being updated during 2019/20. Information on our 'declarations of interest' internet page will be updated on a progressive basis during the phased implementation period. Delivery of the phased implementation plan is being overseen by the A&R Committee. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 16 NHS Pension Scheme As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contrib utions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Equality, Diversity and Human Rights Control measur es are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. Environmental Issues The foundation trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. Further details can be found in the Performance Report. Emergency preparedness Our emergency planning and business continuity consider organisational resilience and our ability to respond/recover from incidents and disruption. Very high and high risks in the current version of the Cumbria Community Risk Register are covered by either our contingency planning, or wider health or multi-agency planning to which we contribute. We work collaboratively and share information appropriately with responder organisations in furtherance of multi-agency co- operation and co-ordination. We seek to comply with the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 regime and align with the international standard for business continuity, BS ISO 22301:2012 and its guidance, BS ISO 22313:2012. Under NHS England's Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response (EPRR) guidance, we must: have a suitable and up- to-date incident response plan which sets out how it would respond to and recover from a major incident/emergency affecting local communities or the delivery of its services; and adopt business continuity plans to enable it to maintain or recover the delivery of its critical services in the event of significant disruption. We comply with NHS England's requirements by providing an EPRR structure and implementing a business continuity management system through which we will endeavour to respond to critical incidents (which may include so- called 'unusual' incidents) and emergencies as well as maintaining its critical functions, ordinary functions and contractual obligations as far as reasonably practicable. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 17 Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources We closely monitor budgetary control and expenditure through the Financial Delivery Group, Clinical Management Group and, at Board level, through the FIP Committee. A dedicated programme management team support the identification and delivery of schemes which improve efficiency and positively impact our overall financial efficiency efforts. The Executive Director of Finance, Digital & Estates presents finance reports to both the FIP Committee and the Board. Through our Standing Orders (SOs), Standing Financial Instructions (SFIs) and Scheme of Delegation the Board has created clarity regarding delegated authority levels across the Trust. Executive Directors and managers have responsibility for the effective management and deployment of their staff and other resources to optimise the efficiency of each area of our operations. The Board receives both performance and financial reports at each of its public meetings in addition to reports from the Chairs of its Committees, to which it has delegated powers and responsibilities. When required, the Board receives further assurance provided by its internal and external auditors. The 2-year financial plan for 2017/18 and 2018/19 was developed based on a number of assumptions about the degree of financial recovery that could be delivered over the two year period. We recognised there were risks to the delivery of the 2-year plan which we alerted NHSI of through caveats within the 2-year operational plan and through separate correspondence and routine contacts. Through concerted efforts driving efficiencies during the year and through our collaborative working with system partners, whilst our adjusted year-end financial out-turn was under achievement against our financial control total, through our risk sharing agreements the north Cumbria system will receive, with bonuses, approximately \u00a321.2m from the Provider Sustainability Fund for 2018/19. We acted within an agreed risk sharing arrangement within the year. Until month 11, the Trust was forecasting delivery against the agreed position. However, in month 12 the Trust reported a year end deficit of \u00a37.632m. After adjusting for items excluded in the control total calculation (such as impairments, donations, transfers by absorption) the Trust therefore reported that its deficit position was \u00a35m. This is \u00a32.9m higher than the agreed control total. As a result the Trust did not receive the full allocation of Provider Support Fund. The lost income was \u00a31.4m. The increased deficit position arose because of the Trust agreeing to a lower than planned contract income with the local Clinical Commissioning Group. This decision was based on the 2018/19 Operational Plan which provided for a system wide risk share agreement. This decision by the Trust allowed the Cumbria system to achieve greater benefits than the \u00a31.4m PSF funding that the Trust could have earned. The risk sharing is agreed formally by the Board through our annual planning process and reviewed through the year by the System Leadership Board of which we are a participant. The financial plan for 2019/20 has been developed in conjunction with NCUH and North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group and was agreed by both Boards in March 2019. The re are significant Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 18 risks to the delivery of the financial plan and many of the caveats notified to NHSI for the 2018/19 financial plan remain relevant into 2019/20. We were rated as being placed in Segment 2 under NHSI's SOF at 22 April 2019. You can find further details about ratings in the NHS Improvements Single Oversight Framework Report. We have continued to reduce reliance on agency staff during the year where possible and controls are in place to control expenditure on agency workers. Board-level oversight of expenditure on agency workers is undertaken by the FIP Committee as part of the Board level performance reports. Information is also readily available to front line managers through quality and safety dashboards. Information governance (IG) and data security We reported two incidents via the Data Security and Protection Toolkit to the Regulator during 2018/19. One incident related to a clinical letter sent to the wrong address, the other related to health assessment information sent to the wrong patient. Both incidents were investigated and investigation reports sent to the Information Commissioners Office with recommendations completed for improvement. We are committed to learning from all incidents with a view to preventing recurrence in the future. You can find further details about our Information Governance and data security arrangements in the Quality Report. Annual Quality Report The Directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS Foundation Trust Boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . We have arrangements in place to assure the Board that the Quality Report presents a balanced view and that there are controls in place to ensure the accuracy of data. Overseeing the Quality Report preparation and content was the responsibility of the System Executive Chief Nurse during 2018/19. We recognise that good quality data is essential for the delivery of safe and effective care to our patients as well as enabling us to manage services and performance. To support this, we have in place a strategy with supporting policies and procedures which govern the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of data at the point of capture and when reporting either for internal or external purposes. A governance framework is in place which oversees data quality performance from operational services through to Board level. Data quality performance is overseen by the Information Governance department. Key performance indicators (KPI) are subject to data quality and data validation processes. Performance is routinely reported and regularly reviewed at all levels within local and corporate governance structures in accordance with our performance and governance Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 19 frameworks. This includes monthly review by the Board and review at each meeting of the Governors Council. A balanced view of our data quality is obtained through comparing and analysing data accuracy from checks undertaken by front line staff and service managers, and through independent audits undertaken by our internal and external auditors. We currently use a number of separate electronic and paper patient record systems to record clinical information and produce reports. This includes EMIS and RiO electronic patient record systems which are used in our Care Groups. Checks are in place to provide assurance that the data from these systems is accurate. Assurances have been provided during the year through the internal audit programme and our data validation checks and monitoring processes that our data quality has improved through implementation of our Data Quality Strategy. Our suite of policies and procedural documents are reviewed as part of an ongoing review programme to reflect changes to legislation and best practice and, more recently, to reflect aligned governance arrangements with NCUH. The Clinical Policies sub group continued to meet in 2018/19 to ensure clinical policies were reviewed in a timely manner. During Quarter 2 its remit was widened to include the ratification of all policies (not just clinical policies) and is now referred to as the Policy Management Group (PMG). The work to review policies is ongoing and is overseen by the A&R Committee. Our governance framework sets out responsibilities and accountabilities for performance and governance at all levels within the Trust. This is underpinned by the Outcomes and Performance Framework, which comprises performance indicators and metrics by which we measure and monitor our performance with local, regional and national standards and targets. The Outcomes and Performance Framework populates a set of dashboards which enable our staff and managers to identify, monitor and improve the quality of data derived from patient information systems. The dashboards, which continue to evolve, also provide the basis for assuring the Board on the quality, accuracy and completeness of data and enable triangulation of safety data. In Quarter 2, as part of the alignment of governance arrangements with NCUH, the aligned Performance & Delivery Group was formed to identify, monitor and manage risks to performance. The Group which is a sub group of Clinical Management Group, met intermittently throughout 2018/19, as much of its business was undertaken in practice through care g roups' 6 -weekly performance review meetings. The ongoing role and function of the Performance & Delivery Group will be considered as part of the governance framework review being undertaken during Quarter 1 of 2019/20. Our organisational development and service improvement functions, which are now embedded, support our leadership teams with implementing quality improvements. A suite of tools and training on quality improvement methodologies is also available to all staff. We achieved a number of quality improvements during the year, including further development and roll out of quality and safety dashboards within integrated care groups to improve quality governance, and improvements introduced through research and development, such as improving Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 20 hospital discharge arrangements for people who are homeless. Further details about these and other quality highlights, and also details about our performance and achievement of key performance indicators can be found in the Quality Report . Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS foundation trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the Quality Report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the Audit & Risk Committee (A&R), Quality and Safety Committee (Q&S), and Finance Investment and Performance Committee (FIP) and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The System Executive Chief Nurse is responsible for developing and delivering the clinical audit programme and for ensuring the audit programme supports a process of continual improvement. The Trust Wide Clinical Governance Group (TWCGG) which reports into the Q&S Committee oversees the clinical audit programme. The Q&S Committee receives monthly updates from the TWCGG on the management of risks to quality and safety. The Q&S, FIP, A&R and Charitable Funds Committees each have activity schedules framed around enabling the Board to have line of sight to any significant risks to internal control. An annual evaluation of Committee effectiveness is undertaken for each of these Committees. This is a self- assessment by Committee members and regular attendees, the outcome of which is considered by the A&R Committee. We also has an active programme of internal and external audit. The audit programme, including recommendations from audits, is overseen by the A&R Committee which is a Committee of the Board. The focus of the internal and external audit programme is set to both support and complement our objectives and provide an assessment for the Board on areas of specific risk. The internal audit programme is developed having due regard to the risks and risk controls set out in the BAF and corporate risk register. Audit recommendations are framed around improving internal control and also identifying opportunities for creating added value from our current systems and processes. Any significant risks to internal control identified through the internal audit programme are assigned to a nominated Executive Director to resolve, and are monitored through CMG. Our internal auditors awarded substantial, good or reasonable assurance on all audits they undertook during the year, with the exception of our arrangements for business continuity which were awarded limited assurance during the year. We are actively working to review our care groups' and services business continuity arrangements an d updating business continuity plans is ongoing. Progress is being managed and monitored through our governance frameworks, with oversight by the A&R Committee. Progress on implementing recommendations from audits is overseen by the A&R Committee. 212223242526272829Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 30 STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2019 Year ended 31 March 201 9 Year ended 31 March 2018 NOTE \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Operating income from patient care activities 3 147,620 165,568 Other operating income 4.1 12,829 14,589 Total 160,449 180,157 Operating expenses ) (179,635) Operating deficit (5,233) 522 Finance costs: Finance income 266 26 Finance expense - financial liabilities (565) (582) Finance expense - unwinding of discount on provisions (4) (2) PDC Dividends payable (1,507) (1,582) Net finance costs (1,810) (2,140) Gain/ (losses) on disposal of assets 10.3 (4) (12) Gain/ (losses) from transfer by absorption 10.1 (585) - DEFICIT FOR THE YEAR (7,632) (1,630) Other comprehensive income Impairments on property plant and equipment 10.1 137 1,552 Revaluation gains on property, plant and equipment 10.1 - 2,300 TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/ (EXPENSE) FOR THE YEAR (7,495) 2,222 The values presented in the Trust's accounts have been rounded. 31Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 32 STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN TAXPAYERS' EQUITY Changes in Taxpayers' Equity for the year ended 31 March 201 9 Taxpayers' E quity Public Dividend Capital Income and Expenditure Reserve Revaluation Reserve Total \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 2018 34,758 12,596 9,295 56,649 Other transfers between reserves - 32 (32) - Total Comprehensive Income for the year: Retained deficit for the year - (7,632 ) - (7,632 ) Revaluation gains on property, plant and equipment - - 137 137 Public Dividend Capital Received 2,265 - - 2,265 Balance at 31 March 201 9 37,023 4,996 9,400 51,419 Changes in Taxpayers' Equity for the year ended 31 March 201 8 Taxpayers' Equity Public Dividend Capital Income and Expenditure Reserve Revaluation Reserve Total \u00a3000 \u00a3000 8,908 53,583 Other transfers between reserves - 3,000 (3,000) - Total Comprehensive Income for the year: Retained deficit for the year - (1,630) - (1,630) Revaluation gains on property, plant and equipment - - 3,852 3,852 Transfer to retained earnings on disposal of assets - 465 (465) - Public Dividend Capital Received 844 - - 844 Balance at 31 March 2018 34,758 12,596 9,295 56,649 Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 33 STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY - RESERVES Information on Reserves Public Dividend Capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. Additional PDC may also be issued to NHS Foundation Trusts by the Department of Health and Social Care. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the NHS Foundation Trust, is payable to the Department of Health and Social Care as the public dividend capital dividend. Revaluation Reserve Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential. Income and Expenditure Reserve The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the NHS Foundation Trust.

Consequently, the following financial statements have been prep ared in accordance with the GAM 2018 /19 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, a s determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. 1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.2 Going concern basis After making enqui ries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the coming year. The 2019/20 plan includes receipts of Department of Health and Social Care revenue support loans of \u00a3 4.8m , the Trust also has \u00a31.3m of revenue support loans due for repayment during 2019/20. T he Directors consider it reasonable to expect cash support to be available and for the Trust to continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Directors recognise the significant level of risk within the 2019/20 plan, in particular, the level of internal and system CIP's needed to achieve the control total . . The Trust is working to merge with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust and is also going to divest its mental health services to Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust and Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. The Trust is working with North Cumbria CCG, key local partners, liaising with wider stakeholders and NHS Improvement as i t looks to generate the service and financial efficiencies needed to transform the Cumbrian Health Economy. After making enquiries, the Directors have adopted a going concern basis in preparing these accounts as they do not intend to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of the NHS Foundation Trust without the transfer of services to another entity , nor do they believe there is no realistic alternative but to do so. 1.3 Consolidation Joint ventures Joint ventures are arrangements i n which the T rust has joint control with one or more other parties, and where it has the rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The Trust entered into a joint venture with the partners of Waterloo House Surgery and University Hospital of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust with each organisation having one third control over the GP Practice . Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 36 Limited Company The Trust on the 26 January 2018 established a dormant company called North Cumbria Primary Care Ltd. This company may be used in the future as a vehicle to support primary care . 1.4.1 Revenue from contracts with customers Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for under IFRS 15. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not cla ssified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). As directed by the GAM, the transition to IFRS 15 in 2018/19 has been completed in accordance with paragraph C3 (b) of the Standard: applying the Standard retrospectively but recognising the cumu lative effects at the date of initial application (1 April 2018). Revenue in respect of goods/services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allocated to those performance obl igations. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where the Trust's entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional a contract receivable will be recognised. Where enti tlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset will be recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be satisfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. Revenue from NHS contracts Revenue is recognised to the extent that collection of consideration is probable. Where contract challenges from commissioners are expected to be upheld, the Trust ref lects this in the transaction price and derecognises the relevant portion of income. Where the Trust is aware of a penalty based on contractual performance, the Trust reflects this in the transaction price for its recognition of revenue. Revenue is reduced by the value of the penalty. The Trust receives income from commissioners under Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) schemes. The se are national schemes which could affect how care is provided to patients. That is, the CQUIN payments are not considered distinct performance obligations in their own right; instead they form part of the transaction price for performance obligations under the contract. 1.4.2 Revenue grants and other contributions to expenditure Government grants are grants fro m government bodies other than income from commissioners or Trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. The value of the benefit r eceived when accessing funds from the Government's apprenticeship service is recognised as income at the point of receipt of the training service. Where these funds are paid directly to an accredited training provider, the corresponding notional expense is also recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit. 1.4.3 Other income Income from the sale of non -current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 37 1.5 Expenditure on employee benefits Short -term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment -related payments such as security costs and apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement relating to employees on sick and maternity leave which has n ot been taken by employees at the end of the period is recogni sed in the financial statements. Pension costs Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit sc hemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State for Health in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the under lying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the account ing period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period betwe en formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing s uitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2019, is based on valuation data as 31 March 2018, updated to 31 March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this ac tuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme a ctuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation The pur pose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019. The Department of Health and Social Care have recently laid Scheme Regulations conf irming that the employer contribution rate will increase to 20.6% of pensionable pay from this date. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 38 The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to test the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the 2012 valuation. Followin g a judgment from the Court of Appeal in December 2018 Government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process pending conclusion of the continuing legal process. 1.6 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non -current asset such as property , plant and equipment. 1.7 Property, Plant and Equipment Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to , or service potential be provided to, the Trust; it is expected to be used for more than one financial year; the cost of the item can be measured reliably; individually has a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or forms a group of assets which individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, collectively have a cost of at least \u00a35,000, where the assets are functionally interdependent, they had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control ; or form part of the initial setting -up cost of a new building or refurbishment of a ward or unit, irrespective of their individual or collective cost. Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly differ ent asset lives, e.g. plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful lives. Valuation All property, plant and equipment is measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attrib utable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All assets are measured subsequently at fair value. Land and buildings used for the Trust's services or for administrative purposes are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at their revalued amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Revaluation s are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying amounts are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Current value in existing use are determined as follows: land and non-specialised buildings - market value for existing use ; specialised buildings - depreciated replacement cost ; Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 39 non-operational properties - market value . The Trust has adopted the HM Treasury standard approach to depreciated replacement cost valuations based on modern equivalent assets. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees but not borrowing costs, which are recognised as expenses i mmediately. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought into use. IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred t o replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The ca rrying amount of the part replaced is de -recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in whi ch it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'Held for Sale ' cease to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is brou ght into use. Depreciation is charged on property with respect to the remaining useful life as recommended by a professional valuer. Depreciation on other categories of fixed assets is charged on cost evenly over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Years Plant and Machinery 10 Transport Equipment 7 Information Technology 5 (Equipment) Information Technology 7 (Infrastructure) Furniture and fittings 3 (Ward environment) Furniture and fittings 5 (Office environment) The Trust will apply the new RICS guidance on asset lives from period starting 1st April 2019. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 40 De-recognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'Held for Sale' once all of the following criteria are met: the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales; the sale must be highly probable i.e.: - management are committed to a plan to sell the asset; - an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sa le; - the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price; - the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'Held for Sale'; and - the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will b e abandoned or significant changes made to it. Following reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Depreciation ceases to be charged and the assets are not revalued, except where the fair value less costs to sell falls below the carrying amount. Assets are de -recognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for re cognition as 'Held for Sale' and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset's useful life is adjusted. The asset is de -recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. Revaluation g ains and losses Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has been previously recognised in operating expenditure, in which case they are recognised in operating expenses . Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losse s recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income'. Impairments In accordance with the DH SC GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amou nt equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstanc es that gave rise to the loss are reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if th e impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is tra nsferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 41 Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. Donated , government grant and other grant funded fixed assets Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met. The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. Private finance initiative (PFI) HM Treasury has determined that government bodies shall account for infrastructure PFI sc hemes where the government body controls the use of the infrastructure and the residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the arrangement as service concession arrangements, following the principles of the requirements of IFRIC 12. The Trust the refore recognises the PFI asset as an item of property, plant and equipment together with a liability to pay for it. The services received under the contract are recorded as operating expenses. The annual unitary payment is separated into the following c omponent parts, using appropriate estimation techniques where necessary: a) Payment for the fair value of services received; b) Payment for the PFI asset, including finance costs; and c) Payment for the replacement of components of the asset during the c ontract 'lifecycle replacement'. Services received The fair value of services received in the year is recorded under the relevant expenditure headings within 'operating expenses'. PFI asset The PFI assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment, when they come into use. The assets are measured initially at fair value in accordance with the principles of IAS 17. Subsequently, the assets are measured at fair value, which is kept up to date in accordance with the Trust's approach for each relevant class of asset in accordance with the principles of IAS 16. PFI liability A PFI liability is recognised at the same time as the PFI assets are recognised. It is measured initially at the same amount as the fair value of the PFI assets and is s ubsequently measured as a finance lease liability in accordance with IAS 17. An annual finance cost is calculated by applying the implicit interest rate in the lease to the opening lease liability for the period, and is charged to 'Finance Costs' within th e Statement of Comprehensive Income. The element of the annual unitary payment that is allocated as a finance lease rental is applied to meet the annual finance cost and to repay the lease liability over the contract term. An element of the annual unitary payment increase due to cumulative indexation is allocated to the finance Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 42 lease. In accordance with IAS 17, this amount is not included in the minimum lease payments, but is instead treated as contingent rent and is expensed as incurred. In substance, this amount is a finance cost in respect of the liability and the expense is presented as a contingent finance cost in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Lifecycle replacement Components of the asset replaced by the operator during the contract ('lifecy cle replacement') are capitalised where they meet the Trust's criteria for capital expenditure. They are capitalised at the time they are provided by the operator and are measured initially at their fair value. The element of the annual unitary payment all ocated to lifecycle replacement is predetermined for each year of the contract from the operator's planned programme of lifecycle replacement. Where the lifecycle component is provided earlier or later than expected, a short -term finance lease liability or prepayment is recognised respectively. Where the fair value of the lifecycle component is less than the amount determined in the contract, the difference is recognised as an expense when the replacement is provided. If the fair value is greater than the a mount determined in the contract, the difference is treated as a 'free' asset and a deferred income balance is recognised. The deferred income is released to the operating income over the shorter of the remaining contract period or the useful economic life of the replacement component. Assets contributed by the Trust to the operator for use in the scheme Assets contributed for use in the scheme continue to be recognised as items of property, plant and equipment in the Trust's Statement of Financial Posit ion. 1.8 Intangible assets Intangible assets are non -monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Software Software which is integral to the operation of hardware e.g. an operat ing system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware e.g. application software, is cap italised as an intangible asset. Measurement Intangible assets are reco gnised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or 'fair value less costs to sell'. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 43 Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of econom ic or service delivery benefits: Years Intangible assets Software 7 1.9 Inventories The cost of all consumable goods is charged to operating e xpenses at the date of purchase. Any stock holdings are not material in value either individually or in aggregate. 1.10 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are in vestments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of Trust's cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. 1.11 Financial assets and f inancial l iabilities Recognition Financial assets and financi al liabilities arise where the Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument, and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The GAM expands the definition of a contr act to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by ONS. This includes the purchase or sale of non -financial item s (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements, are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, i.e., when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. Classification and Measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through income an d expenditure. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices or valuation techniques. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 44 Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights an d obligations under lease arrangements and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment (for financial ass ets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised co st of a financial liability. Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive In come and a financing income or expense . In the case of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Impairment of financial assets For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets or assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Trust recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is initially measured at an amount equal to 12 -month expected credit losses (stage 1) and subsequently at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk assessed for the financial asset significantly increases (stage 2). For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discount ed at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged to operating expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Positio n. De-recognition Financial assets are de -recognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 1.12 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operati ng leases. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 45 Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the T rust, the asset is recorded as p roperty, plant and e quipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The implicit interest rate is that which produces a constant periodic rate of interest in t he outstanding liability. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item of property plant and equipment. The annual rental charge is split between the repayment of the liability a nd a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to finance costs in the Statement of Comprehens ive Income. The lease liability is de -recognised when the liability is discharged, c ancelled or expires. Operating leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straight -line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the pe riod in which they are incurred. Leases of land Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. 1.13 Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant the estimated risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using HM Treasury's discount rate of 1.56% in real terms, except for early retirement provisions and injury benefit provisions which both use the HM Treasury's pension discount rate of 0. 29% (201 7/18: 0.1%) in real terms. Clinical Negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return settles all the clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolu tion is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of the clinical negligence provisions carried by the NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is disclosed in note 1 7 but is no t recognised in the Trust's accounts. Non -clinical risk pooling The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Re solution and in return receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 46 'excesses' payable in respect of particular claims, are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises . 1.14 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed in note 18 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in note 18, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits wi ll arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.15 Public Dividend Capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the Trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the NHS Foundation Trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the NHS Foundation Trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for: (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets), (ii) average daily cash balanc es held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short - term working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. In accordanc e with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the \"pre -audit\" version of the annual accounts. The divide nd thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result of the audit of the annual accounts. 1.16 Value added tax Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are state d net of VAT. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 47 1.17 Corporation tax Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is a Health Service body within the meaning of s519A ICTA 1988 and accordingly is exempt from taxation in respect of income and capital gains within categories covered by this. There is a power for the Treasury to disapply the exemption in relation to the specified activities of a Foundation Trust (s519A (3) to (8) ICTA 1988). Accordingly, the Trust is potentially within the scope of Corporation Tax in respect of activiti es which are not related to, or ancillary to, the provision of healthcare, and where the profits therefrom exceed \u00a350,000 per annum. There is no tax liability arising in respect of the current financial year. 1.18 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the Trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in note 2 0 in accordance with the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM 1.19 Losses a nd special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the Health Service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subje ct to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in ex penditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had NHS Foundation Trusts not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). However the lo sses and special payments note is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. 1.20 Transfers of functions to and from other NHS bodies For functions th at have been transferred to the Trust from another NHS body, the assets and liabilities transferred are recognised in the accounts as at the date of transfer. The assets and liabilities are not adjusted to fair value prior to recognition. The net gain / lo ss corresponding to the net assets/ liabilities transferred is recognised within income / expenses , but not within operating activities. For property, plant and equipment assets and intangible assets, the cost and accumulated depreciation / amortisation balances from the transferring entity's accounts are preserved on recognition in the Trust's accounts. Where the transferring body recognis ed revaluation reserve balances attributable to the assets, the Trust makes a transfer from its income and expenditure reserve to its revaluation reserve to maintain transparency within public sector accounts. For functions that the Trust has transferred to another NHS body, the assets and liabilities transferred are de-recognised from the accounts as at the date of transfer. The net loss / gain corresponding to the net assets / liabilities transferred is recognised within expenses / income, but not with in operating activities. Any revaluation reserve balances attributable to assets de -recognised are transferred to the income and expenditure reserve. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 48 1.21 Critical accounting judgements in applying accounting policies In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historica l experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Workington Community Hospital was constructed under the Private Finance Initiati ve (PFI) and meets the criteria for inclusion in the accounts as a finance lease as the Trust bears the risks and rewards of ownership see note 1 6.4. The Trust will apply the new RICS guidance on asset lives from period starting 1st April 2019. The Trust joined the Cumbria E -lift programme as of the 31 March 2017 and has valued its estate on a net of VAT basis from 2016/17. The Trust has exercised judgement based on guidance within the Annual Reporting Manual not to consolidate its Charitable Funds based on grounds of materiality. 1.22 Key sources of estimation uncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of cau sing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: The Trust has conducted a review of land, buildings, dwellings and assets held for sale using independent qualified valuers, and revaluations and impairments have been made where required. Following the publication of new guidance from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the asset lives of the Trust's Buildings and dwellings will be amended , the Trust estimates this impact to be approximately \u00a3378k in 2019/20 . Provisions have been made in line with management's best estimates and in line with IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The Trust's dispute with its Priva te Finance Initiative provider is still ongoing and, in addition to the asset recognised in 2018/19, a contingent asset is recognised in line with IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Li abilities and Contingent Assets. 1.23 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2018/19. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 49 1.24 Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or adopted The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC which have not been applied by the Trust in these financial statements. The Trust is in the process of assessing the impact on the financial statements from the adoption of IFRS 16. IFRS 14 ' Regulatory Deferral Accounts' ( Not yet EU endorsed *) IFRS 16 'Leases' (Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 Janua ry 2019 but not yet adopted by the FREM ) IFRS17 'Insurance Contracts' (Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 20 21) IFRIC23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments' (Application required for accounting periods beginn ing on or after 1 January 2019) *The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group recommended in October 2015 that the Standard should not be endorsed as it is unlikely to be adopted by many EU countries.

All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete fi nancial information is available. Segment results that are reported to the Board include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly comprise income and costs for non-clinical service provision and activities to support operating segments. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - Accounts 1 April 201 8 to 31 March 201 9 51 The Board of Dir ectors is considered to be the 'Chief Operating Decision Maker ' of the Trust in the context of IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' definition. The net expenditure of each operating segment refer s to the operating expenditure , less directly attributable income. The Trust has six reportable segments, as identified in the table above, which represent the categor ies of healthcare services provide d by the Trust and the operations and nursing management structures . The performance of these segments is reviewed monthly by the Trust's Board of Directors. Segmental assets and liabilities are not reported internally to the Board, and are therefore not d isclosed in this note. Categories of segments: Income that cannot be allocated to individual activities and segments have been determined by reference to the operating expenses of the Care Group or Directorate. Operating expenditure of these activities is reported where this expenditure exceeds the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments. Where two or more operating segments meet the aggregation criteria their operating expenditure has been reported under one segment. Other non -segme ntal expenditure incl udes the costs of providing non - clinical services as well as costs to support the activities of healthcare segments. 3.

Financial Instruments 19.1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Trust if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Trust's debtors and cash balances. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maxi mum credit exposure. Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sh eet date, as disclosed in note 19 .3, was \u00a3 17,758k (\u00a313,491k at 31 March 201 8) being the total of the carrying amount of financial assets. 19.2 Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Trust's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The main potential market risk to the Trust is interest rate risk; the Trust has fixed 1.5% interest rate loans with the Department of Health and Social Care.
