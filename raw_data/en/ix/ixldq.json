Th e dramatic increase in opioid prescription s within the past decade in the United States has contributed to the opioid epidemic the country currently faces, magnifying the need for longer term so lutions to treat pain (Rudd et al., 2016). The substantial burden of pain and the on- going opioid crisis have attracted increased attention in medic al and public policy communities, resulting in a revolution in thinking about how pain is managed, said Daniel Cherkin, senior investigator (emeritus) at the Kai- ser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. This new t hinking acknowledges the complexity and biopsychosocial nature of the p ain ex- perience and the need for multif aceted pain management approach es with both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies, a recomm enda- tion of the 2011 Institu te of Medicine report Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Preventi on, Care, Education, and Research (IOM, 2011b) and the National Academies report Pain Management and the Opioid Epidemic: Balancing Societal and Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use (NASEM, 2017). For example, Cherkin said the American College of Physicians re - cently recommended a dramatically new approach to managing back pain that begins with nonpharmacological treatments as first-line ca re (Qaseem et al., 2017). Nonpharmacological approaches are also emphasize d in the 1The planning committee's role was limited to planning the works hop, and the Proceed- ings of a Workshop was prepared by the workshop rapporteurs as a factual summary of what occurred at the workshop.

An important challenge is to find strategies to implement these guidelines effectively and efficiently in real-world prac tice, said Cherkin. Echoing the emphasis on implementation, Anthony Delitt o, dean of the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences and profess or of phys- ical therapy at the University of Pittsburgh, added that implem enting what is known now could make a big dent in addressing the challenges associ- ated with pain management. Emerging models of grated, patient-centered, evidence-based, multimodal, interdisc iplinary medical, psychological, and so cial aspects of care\u2014a concept promoted by the National Pain Strateg y\u2014have been shown to decrease pain and increase function and will be i mportant, said Robert Kerns, professor of psychiatry, neurology, and psyc hology at Yale University. The magnitude and urgency of the twin problems of chronic pain and opioid addiction, combined with the changing landscape of pain manage- ment, prompted the National Acad emies of Sciences, Engineering, a n d Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders a nd its Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional Education to con- vene a workshop on December 4-5, 2018, in Washington, DC. The w ork- shop brought together a diverse group of stakeholders to discus s the current status of nonpharmacological approaches to pain managem ent, gaps, and future directions. WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES The workshop was designed to provide participants with an under - standing of the evidence currently available on the effectivene ss and safety of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management, as well as infor- mation about emerging models of care for people living with chr onic pain. In addition, the workshop explored barriers, opportunities, and policy changes needed to facilitate implementation of integrated syste ms of care that include nonpharmacological treatments (see Box 1-1). Works hop 2Defined in the National Pain Strategy as care provided by a tea m of health professionals from diverse fields who coordina te their skills and resources t o meet patient goals.

Invited presentations and discussions will be designed to: Review the current state of evidence on the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments and integrative health mod- els for pain management, as well as available evidence on use patterns and patient interest. Examples may include acu- puncture, manual therapies, physical therapy and exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, tai chi, yoga, meditation, and noninvasive neurostimulation. Consider multimodal approaches and potential synergies be- tween pharmacological and no npharmacological approaches to pain management. Consider multimodal approaches and potential synergies be- tween devices and nonpharmacological approaches to pain management. Discuss research gaps and key questions for further research. Examine health professions' current approaches for educat- ing students, trainees, and practicing clinicians on nonphar- macological pain management, and discuss potential next steps to improve training and education within and across health professions. Explore policies, such as those related to reimbursement, that would enable broader dissemination and implementation of evidence-based nonpharmacological treatments when appropriate. The committee will develop the agenda for the workshop, select and invite speakers and discussants, and moderate the discussio ns. A proceedings of the presentations and discussions at the worksho p will be prepared by a designated rapporteur in accordance with Natio nal Academies' institutional guidelines.

ORGANIZATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS Chapter 2 provides context to the workshop, including perspecti ves from people living with pain and from providers about how pain is cur- rently managed, and opportuniti es to reduce disparities. Chapte r 3 exam- ines the evidence available fo r nonpharmacological approaches t o pain management and discusses future research priorities identified by individ- ual workshop participants. Emer ging models of care, including s tepped, stratified, integrative, and multimodal care models, as well as the use of technology to encourage self-management, are discussed in Chapt er 4. Chapter 5 highlights major current research initiatives support ed by fed- eral agencies and a nongovernmental institute in the United Sta tes that fo- cus on pain management and reducing opioid use. Gaps in the edu cation and training of health professionals in pain management are dis cussed in Chapter 6, along with opportunities to address these gaps withi n and across health professions to encourage the adoption and appropriate us e of evi- dence-based approaches. Chapter 7 explores potential policy sol utions to address barriers to the delivery of effective pain care. In Cha pter 8, work- shop participants consider poten tial next evidence-based nonpha rmacological approaches in pain care. 3For an in-depth discussion about p ain management for people wit h serious illness, see the forthcoming proceedings from the complementary workshop on Pain and Symptom Management for People with Serious Illness in the Context of th e Opioid Epidemic, hosted on November 29, 2018, by the National Academies' Roundtable on Quality Care for Peo- ple with Serious Illness.

Practitioners, like patients, face a significant gap in measuri ng and understanding pain, and in assessing the effectiveness and po- tential harms of treatments (Ryan). Effective pain management requi res understanding and treating the multidimensional, including biopsychosocial, aspects of pai n (George, Turk). Placebo responses and interindivi dual variability in pain thres h- olds and response to treatment may confound evaluations of the effectiveness of pain treat ments (Kroenke, Turk). Currently available methods of assessing pain do not fully capt ure an individual's experience of pain (Turk). Claims-based data show that non pharmacological therapies for pain account for only a small percentage of total costs (Elton) . When a pain patient's first point of contact is a physical ther apist, chiropractor, or acupuncturist, the odds of early and long-term ex- posure to opiates is mark edly reduced (Elton). Low-income populations experience higher rates of pain, disabil - ity, and comorbidities, but have less access to pain management resources, including nonpharmacological treatments (Thorn).

According to Christin Veasley, director of the Chronic Pain Research Alliance, chroni c pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contribut or to the rising number of suicides (Petrosky et al., 2018). Yet both Vea sley and Daniel Cherkin noted that a subs tantial gap exists between the scientific and clinical understanding of pain and the decisions people mak e about how to manage their pain. This gap, said Veasley, arises from m ultiple factors: an insufficient workfor ce address chronic pain; the paucity of team-based medical homes; the classification of pain disorders by symp- toms rather than mechanisms; the lack of objective measures of pain; insufficient high-quality evidence about the efficacy of both p harmacolog- ical (e.g., opioids) and nonpharmacological (e.g., massage) tre atments for pain; and insufficient data on risks, benefits, and cost-effect iveness of the various treatment alternatives. Patients living with chronic pain face several decisional dilem mas, said Veasley. These include (1) how to evaluate which nonpharma cologi- cal treatment options may work when, for some approaches, littl e evidence exists to inform this decision; (2) how to choose the optimal c ombination of safe and effective treatmen ts; and (3) how to choose the opt imal modal- ity, type, or technique within each selected treatment (e.g., t he type of mas- sage that would be most likely to provide pain relief). Veasley suggested that by developing research questions based on the decisional d ilemmas faced by patients, the field could generate an evidence base, i mprove re- imbursement, improve outcomes, and reduce uncertainty. One reason for the low level of evidence available for nonpharm aco- logical approaches to pain management is the variability in fre quency, du- ration, and type among studies, said Veasley. Another problem i s that in order to systematically and quantitatively review data from stu dies, out- comes must be assessed in a comparable manner, which is complic ated by the fact that chronic pain may vary substantially from day to d ay and week to week and by limitations of the scales used for assessing pai n. The fre- quent presence of comorbidities adds further complications give n that pa- tients may be receiving many different therapies for pain and n onpain conditions. All of thi s variability makes it hard to know exact ly what is or is not working.

For example, managing pain in a person with new-onset ost eoarthri- tis is going to be very different from managing the pain of a p erson with diabetic neuropathy who also h as obesity and a sleep disorder. Mark Ryan, a family physician at Virginia Commonwealth Univer- sity, added that providers face other challenges when trying to manage patients' pain. The national conve rsation on pain management di d not begin to shift until the early 2000s, shortly after Ryan began his residency. The Joint Commission established standards for assessing and tr eating pain in 2001 (Baker, 2017; Phillips, 2000), but Ryan said it wa s challeng- ing to assess pain using the scale that asks a patient to rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10, rather than using metrics that assess global function, qual- ity of life, or other relevant aspects of the pain experience. Practitioners, like patients, face a significant gap in measuring and understa nding pain, and in assessing the effectiveness and potential harms of treat ments. More- over, treatment in the early 2000s was almost completely focuse d on med- ication, he said. The idea of integrative and comprehensive car e that includes behavioral health and physical therapy was not include d as part of physician training. When Ryan moved to a rural practice in 2003, other challenges b e- came evident, including the lack of local resources for pain ma nagement and limited access to pain management specialists. Now in his c urrent po- sition in Richmond, Virginia, h e faces different challenges\u2014for example, 40 percent of new adult patients in his practice lack insurance , are covered by the system's indigent care plan, and have limited access to nonpharma- cological therapies. Although he can make referrals for physica l therapy or other services, patients face practical barriers that limit access to those services, such as transportation challenges and concerns about taking time off work to go to appointments on a consistent basis. Outside o f the health system, even insured patients face significant challenges. Exam ples in- clude pain management programs that limit the type of insurance they ac- cept, specialists who focus primarily on procedures such as ner ve blocks or epidural injections, and the lack of an integrated pain serv ice. Concerns about opioid use have e xacerbated the difficulties pro viders experience in caring for patients with pain, said Ryan. Taken t ogether, these challenges have led to dissatisfied and unhappy patients with signif- icant concerns, and dissatisfied, unhappy providers who lack th e tools they need to manage their patients' pain appropriately.

Ryan expressed his hope that the workshop would identify action able and practical strategies to address pain management in primary care set- tings, outline evidence-based and effective approaches to chron ic pain management that do not rely on opioids or other medications, an d encour- age research focused on improving chronic pain management in pr imary care settings. He also advocated for efforts to improve provide r-patient communication regarding treatments and goals for managing chron ic pain using collaborative and holistic approaches that encourage shar ed decision making. Veasley added that a paradigm shift is needed wherein all relev ant stakeholders come together at the genesis of a research project and work collaboratively throughout it to bridge the translational divid e between basic science and patient care. In addition, research aims that matter to decision makers\u2014including, patients, clinicians, and payers\u2014are needed to ensure successful execution of rigorous science and to promo te the adoption of findings into clinical care. BACKGROUND ON PAIN AND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL PAIN MANAGEMENT A recent analysis of the burden of disease in the United States found that 5 chronic pain conditions account for more disability than the 12 lead- ing medical conditions (see Figure 2-1), said Kurt Kroenke, cha ncellor's professor of medicine at Indiana University and a research scie ntist at the Regenstrief Institute (Murray et al., 2013). If depression and anxiety are added to the list of pain cond itions, which are comorbid in 30 to 50 percent of people with chronic pain, the burden is even greater. Moreov er, most peo- ple with chronic pain have pain in multiple body sites (Kroenke et al., 2013). The burden of pain comes not only from the individual perceptio n of pain itself, but from how it affects other aspects of life, inc luding social roles, vocation, and health care seeking, said Steven George. U nderstanding this complexity is an essential first step in both treating and managing pain.

Understanding Pain and Pain Management George described pain using the analogy of an onion, with the l ayers being nociception, individual experience, and impact (see Figure 2-2) . At the center of the onion is nociception, the nervous system's respon se to painful stimuli. Nociception is embedded within other layers of the oni on that comprise the individual's experience of pain such as the belief s, emotions, and coping strategies that int roduce tremendous variability in how pain is experienced. All of these factors contribute to the impact pain has on other aspects of a person's life. It was no surprise, George added, t hat when the Institute of Medicine published its report Relieving Pain in America they concluded that pain is a major driver of health care, disabilit y, and reduced quality of life (IOM, 2011b).

Treating pain is different from managing pain, said George. Ind ividual pain treatments target nociception, while pain management addre sses mul- tiple layers. Typically, a patient's first contact with a healt h care provider trained in conventional medicin e leads to diagnosis and drug tr eatment, with management of pain through nonpharmacological and other ap - proaches only introduced later. Recent changes in the guideline s for how pain is managed aim to shorten that interlude, moving nonpharma cological care closer to the first contact point through more cohesive an d integrated management pathways, said George. A large therapeutic armamentarium for pain exists, including me dica- tions, surgical procedures, physical modalities, and complement ary and multidisciplinary approaches, said Dennis Turk, director of the Center for Pain Research on Impact, Measure ment, & Effectiveness (C-PRIME) at the University of Washington. The problem, he said, is that for any of these approaches, evidence of effectiveness is modest (Moore, 2013). Kroenke added that the limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatme nts is true for both opioids and non-opioids (Krebs et al., 2018). While op ioids and non-opioids both showed modest benefits in a recent randomized con- trolled trial for people with m oderate to serve chronic pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis, opioids have higher rates of side effects. More over, Kroenke noted that in multiple trials for different types of chronic no n-neuropathic pain, there is insufficient evidence supporting cannabis as an analgesic (Hill, 2015; Nugent et al., 2017). Possible explanations for the lack of substantial benefits for pain treat- ments include an almost exclusive reliance on the biomedical mo del of pain and a focus on managing pain itself rather than managing t he person who has pain, said Turk. The bi omedical perspective assumes tha t pain is The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.WORKSHOP CONTEXT 11 a signal of injury or some structural pathology; that removal o f the prob- lem may be possible through some mechanical fix; and that treat ment con- sists of symptomatic relief alone. Turk used the example of fib romyalgia to illustrate the problem of approaching a pain condition with symptomatic treatment. A checklist of 43 symptoms is used to evaluate patie nts with fibromyalgia, and the average patient endorses 33 of these symp toms. A single treatment would almost certainly be insufficient to deal with the fatigue, pain, cognitive and emotional problems, and many other symp- toms reported by patients, he said. Placebo responses\u2014the perceived improvement in symptoms result- ing from an inactive treatment\u2014can also complicate evaluations of the ef- fectiveness of pain treatments. Kroenke said that placebos have been shown to reduce pain by 30 to 50 percent. Placebo responses hav e biolog- ical underpinnings mediated by ove rlapping pain circuits (Kroen ke and Cheville, 2017). Although placebo effects can undermine the abi lity to demonstrate effectiveness of the investigational treatment in c linical trials, Kroenke said these effects should be maximized in clinical prac tice. Other important factors contributing to the modest effectivenes s of pain treatments is interindividual variability in pain threshol ds, response to various treatments, and psychosocial characteristics that in fluence the experience of pain and the response to treatments, said Turk. P atients also vary in terms of the relationship between objective evidence of pathology and how intensely they experience pain (e.g., patients with the same extent of tissue pathology respond in widely different ways to the sam e interven- tions) (Gerbershagen et al., 20 13). Thus, objective pathology a lone makes it challenging to predict a person's pain experience and respon se to treat- ment. Furthermore, how much pain a person experiences does not neces- sarily equate to his or her func tional limitations, Turk added. Assessing an individual's pain is also fraught with problems, s aid Turk. Objective information, self-reports, functional performan ce, and be- havioral observations may all be useful, but are poorly correla ted with one another and highly variable fro m person to person. Turk argued that in assessing pain, biological factors are important, but must be c onsidered along with the individual's history, attitudes, beliefs, emotio ns, behaviors, and emotional and financial resources. Moreover, to maximize th erapeutic effectiveness, clinicians need to determine how best to facilit ate, encour- age, and motivate patients for sel f-management when a cure is n ot possi- ble. In addition, Turk said the field needs to develop and eval uate new treatments and regimens that address pain and comorbidities and prevent The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Providing Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches to Different Populations in the United States David Elton, senior vice president of clinical programs at Optu m, pre- sented claims data to describe u sage patterns for pharmacologic al and non- pharmacological pain treatments, noting that claims-based data do not fully reflect usage because they are blind to out-of-pocket exp enditures for many nonpharmacological therapies, such as acupuncture, chiropr actic services, and massage, and to non-covered services such as yoga , virtual reality, and mindfulness. Claims-based data are also affected b y other dis- tortions such as incorrect coding, capitation, and other factor s. Nonethe- less, and keeping these caveats in mind, Elton said the data fr om UnitedHealthcare/Optum show that spending on nonpharmacological therapies focused on pain across commercial, Medicare, and Medi caid en- rollees totaled about $3.4 billion, or 2.4 percent of all costs in 2017. He noted that Medicare and Medicai d populations encounter increase d cover- age constraints because most states provide limited to no cover age for ac- upuncture and chiropractic care. Using a technique that takes claims data and creates \"episodes of care\" as a means of understanding spending by diagnostic condition, E lton showed that musculoskeletal compl aints are responsible for abou t 16 per- cent of costs as well as most prescriptions for opioids and opi oid-containing medicines, with back pain being the most frequent complaint. Elton and colleagues have looked at how a person's first point of con- tact after the onset of back pai n influences the use of nonphar macological therapies and opioid use; although, Elton noted that they were not able to adjust for factors that might confound the association between the type of first contact point and opioid use. What they found was that wh en the first point of contact was a physical therapist, chiropractor, or acu puncturist, the odds of early and long-term exposure to opioids was markedl y re- duced. He added that while the guidelines suggest that chiropra ctic manip- ulation has an important role to play, patients receive this ca re only if they start with a chiropractor. The same is true for acupuncture, ma ssage, and other nonpharmacological therapies, said Elton, calling this an unaccepta- ble level of variation in care delivery. He added that patients ' decisions The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.WORKSHOP CONTEXT 13 about who will be their first point of contact vary considerabl y due to in- dividual preferences and how the pain manifests; however, all p roviders should be aware that these other therapies are indicated and pr eferred over opioids for most back pain. Elton added that an economic model on the value of these therap ies indicated that if the front-line use of chiropractic or physica l therapy could be increased from 30 to 50 percent in 2 years, more than $200 m illion could be saved per year. He suggested that simple changes in co verage and practice could achieve these savings, adding that he and his co lleagues will be testing this idea over the next couple of years. Reducing Disparities in Pain Management Managing pain is especially difficult in low-income populations for multiple reasons, said Beverly Thorn, professor emeritus of psy chology at the University of Alabama. Although these populations have high er rates of pain, disability, and comorbidities, they lack access to hea lth care re- sources and consequently get less treatment for pain, she said. Access lim- itations may also affect other subpopulations, said David Atkin s, director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and De- velopment Service. For example, while veterans often have physi cally de- manding jobs that increase the incidence of chronic pain, they may also be unable to take the time off for multiple sessions of acupunctur e, chiroprac- tic, or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Thorn noted that low-income populations are often excluded from clinical trials for various reasons, including low literacy. Gi ven that the conclusions drawn from randomized clinical trials with middle-i ncome participants may not generalize to the broader population, Thor n argued for research that focuses on modifying treatments for disadvant aged indi- viduals. For example, she and her colleagues have adapted CBT a nd self- management treatments by adapting the workbooks and other tools f o r people with low literacy. In a randomized clinical trial of thi s literacy- adapted and simplified group CBT approach compared with group p ain education or usual care, they showed that after treatment, part icipants in the modified CBT and group pain education arms had lower pain i ntensity scores and improved function compared with the usual care arm ( Thorn et al., 2018). Interestingly, she said, individuals with the lowes t literacy lev- els and lowest cognitive function received the most benefit fro m adapted CBT. Anthony Delitto added that m odifications of some nonpharma colog-The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Psychosocial factors strongly predict the transition from acute to chronic pain and the severity of pain (Chou). New guidelines support a shift from pharmacological to nonphar- macological approaches for the tr eatment of pain, and there is some fair- to good-quality evidence of effectiveness of some of those treatments (Chou). Cost-effectiveness studies suppor t the use of mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy in treating lowe r back pain (Herman). NOTE: These points were made by the individual speakers identif ied above; they are not intended to reflect a consensus among works hop participants. Over an approximate 10-year per iod from 2000 to 2010, there was an approximate four-fold increase in opioid prescribing, despite l imited short-term benefits, lack of da ta on long-term benefits, and cl ear evidence of serious harms, said Roger Chou, professor of medicine, medic al infor- matics, and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Scienc e Univer- sity School of Medicine. Other pharmacological treatments for p ain are also associated with similarly modest benefits, said Chou, with out the risk of overdose or opioid use disorder. A systematic review that he and col- leagues conducted found that of the many medications evaluated for the The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.16 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT treatment of low back pain, onl y nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, muscle relaxants, and duloxetine had small and mostly short-term effects (Chou et al., 2017). The limited effectiveness and pote ntial for harm from pharmacological treatments has fueled interest and sh ifted the emphasis of treatment toward nonpharmacological therapies. Howe ver, when the new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control an d Pre- vention (CDC) were published in 2016 recommending nonpharmacolo gi- cal therapy and nonopioid pharmaco logical therapy for chronic p ain (Dowell et al., 2016), Chou said there was minimal direct evide nce to sup- port the recommendation at that time. Nonetheless, he said the steering committee for the scientific review that had been conducted bel ieved the body of evidence was sufficient to support the recommendation. Another driver for emphasizing nonpharmacological approaches ha s been the evolution in the understanding of chronic pain from a biomedical to a biopsychosocial model, said Chou. For example, psychosocia l factors are known to predict more strongly the transition to chronic pa in and se- verity than biological factors assessed with imaging studies an d laboratory tests. Thus, he said, effective treatment strategies require ad dressing psy- chosocial contributors. In addition, improvements in function a s well as pain are required for a treatment to be considered effective (C hou and Shekelle, 2010; Gatchel et al., 2007). Chou cited the STarT Bac k trial as one that demonstrated improved outcomes using this approach. Th e study stratified patients according to psychosocial factors that infl uence their risk of developing chronic low back pain, and then used a stepp ed-care approach to deliver more intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in- formed physiotherapy aimed at reducing disability and improving function to those at higher risk (Hill et al., 2011). Chou described the various therapies he and his colleagues have con- sidered when developing guidelines for the nonpharmacological t reatment of pain: CBT, a psychological treatment that focuses on restructuring maladaptive thinking patterns and replacing them with healthier behaviors. Biofeedback, which uses sensors t hat provide feedback in order to help people control processes that are usually involuntary and thus help with relaxation and coping. Mind-body interventions, including meditation, relaxation, mindfulness-b ased stress reduction (MBSR), and movement- based therapies such as yoga and tai chi.

All rights reserved.EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS 17 Exercise therapies of many different types. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation that combines physical and bio psy- chosocial approaches. Classic integrative alternative or complementary therapies, in- cluding manipulation, acupuncture, and massage. Physical modalities such as ultrasound, transcutaneous electric al nerve stimulation (TENS), low-level laser therapy, traction, an d lumbar supports. To evaluate the evidence supporting these approaches, Chou and col- leagues focused on low back pain, the leading cause of disabili ty according to the 2013 Global Burden of Disease study and a condition repo rted by more than half of regular opioid users (Deyo et al., 2015; Vos et al., 2015). Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of low back pain ha s increased in recent years, said Chou, suggesting that the current biomedi cal approach of using more opioids, imaging, and surgery may not be working (Buser et al., 2018). EXAMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES Most of the evidence on the effectiveness of nonpharmacological pain treatments has been collected in patients with low back pain, s aid Chou. He noted several challenges associated with collecting these da ta, includ- ing the inability to mask treatments, variability in techniques and intensity of treatments, differences among providers, the small magnitude and du- ration of effects, interindividual variability including the pr esence behaviors, fear av the central nervous system, a nd concomi- tant use of opioids. Furthermore, data on functional effects ha ve been lim- ited. Studies of nonpharmacological approaches have also had me thodological limitations as well as factors related to professional bias, fo r example, if chiropractors, rather than neutral investigators, are the sole authors in- volved in studies of chiropractic interventions. Chou presented data from a review published in 2007 by the Amer ican College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Pain Society (APS) (Chou et al., 2007). In 2007, there was some fair- to good-quality ev idence of small to substantial benefits f or many of the nonpharmacologica l thera- pies, although the evidence for physical modalities was so poor that the The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.18 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT committee was unable to estimate the magnitude of benefit. The result of this analysis led to the ACP/APS low back pain guidelines, whic h were the first national guidelines to recommend spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, acupuncture, and progressive relaxation as treatment opti ons for low back pain. However, the analysis provided little guidance on th e optimal techniques, intensity, duration, timing, or sequence of therapi es, or on how to select a therapy for a particular individual, said Chou. The subsequent analysis publishe d in 2017 found more evidence t o support yoga, tai chi, and MBSR , but still found little evidenc e to support the use of physical modalities, said Chou (see Table 3-1). This analysis led to the publication of updated ACP clinical practice guideli nes, which recommended nonpharmacological therapies as the preferred treat ment for chronic back pain (Qaseem et al., 2017). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality asked Chou and c ol- leagues to conduct another review in 2018, this time focusing o n the dura- bility of effects for noninvasive, nonpharmacological treatment s for chronic pain. In this report (see Table 3-2), data from studies examining five common chronic pain conditions (low back pain, neck pain, osteoar- thritis, fibromyalgia, and tension headache) were included. Int erventions were compared against usual care, sham, attention control, or w ait list.

In this study, n o treat- ments were determined to have s ubstantial benefits; however, th ere was evidence for moderate long-term effects following a course of e xercise therapy and slight long-term effects following psychological th erapy (pri- marily CBT). Chou noted that for chronic low back pain, there w as some evidence of persistent benefits from multidisciplinary rehabili tation, but limited benefits for other chronic pain conditions and little e vidence to support the use of specific techniques, duration, intensity, or sequencing of therapies.1 Chou said little evidence showed whether the use of nonpharmaco log- ical therapies influenced opioid use and associated harms. Few harms were reported in trials of nonpharmacological treatment, including f ew serious harms with spinal manipulation, he added. David Elton reported similar findings when he and his colleagues analyzed data from people w ith neck pain who experienced cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (Kosloff et al., 2015). They concluded there was no association between the neck pain and spinal manipulation. Indeed, he said, patients with neck pa in were more likely to have a CVA following treatment by a primary care provider than a chiropractor. Few studies have looked at the effect of t hese treat- ments on depression and suic idality, Chou added. Daniel Cherkin commented that while the conclusion of most of t hese studies (Qaseem et al., 2017; Skelley et al., 2018) was that bo th pharma- cological and nonpharmacological treatments were ineffective or h a d small average effects, responder analyses suggest about 20 perc ent of pa- tients experience clinically meaningful improvements in functio nal out- comes. What we do not know, he said, is whether the same 20 per cent would benefit from many treatments or if a different 20 percent would benefit from each specific treatment. Kurt Kroenke agreed, but pointed out that while nonspecific eff ects may be discounted in trials, they are optimized in clinical pra ctice. He sug- gested that the nonspecific benefits of a treatment and the rol e of the ther- apeutic relationship are underestimated. Kroenke and his collea gues have found that in clinical trials, a thorough pain history of prior t r e atm e nt s takes about 15 minutes, which, in itself, may be the most usefu l step in 1Following the workshop, Andrew Vickers and colleagues (2018) pu blished a meta-analysis on the effectiven ess of acupuncture for chronic p ain management.

Sad ly, however, there is insufficient time for th at in clinical practice, he sa id. With regard to potential disparities, Chou said little evidence to under- stand differences in effectiveness among indigent or socioecono mically disadvantaged populations, despite variations in access and pre sence of comorbidities. Similarly, there is little evidence of age, race , or ethnicity effects, although patient expectations and beliefs can impact e ffectiveness and may be influenced by culture and where one lives. He agreed that more studies are needed to assess differential effectiveness in subp opulations. Sharing information with patients and clinicians from the syste matic evidence reviews that have been conducted has proved to be chal lenging because the reports are so long, said Chou. The Comparative Eff ectiveness Review No. 209, for example, is nearly 1,400 pages long (Skelly et al., 2018). He described two apps\u2014MAGICapp2 and Tableau3\u2014designed to make this information more accessible by allowing users to clic k on par- ticular conditions and outcomes da ta with different interventio ns. Chou said there are other efforts to make these data more informativ e and usable, including living systematic revie ws that allow evidence reviews to be continually updated, open-access reviews, and the use of novel analytic technologies. As reported in Chapter 2, Christin Veasley mentioned some of th e rea- sons for the lack of strong evidence to support the use of nonp harmaco- logical therapies. Chou added that few studies report levels of adherence to a treatment protocol, which can be a significant complicatin g factor. To move forward and develop the necessary evidence, Veasley said a number of questions need to be addressed, including whether a stepped or adaptive approach is needed to understand the efficacy of combined thera pies; whether there are core components across nonpharmacological int erven- tions that account for efficacy that could be standardized acro ss studies; which research models and study designs would provide the rigor needed to generate evidence in a timely manner; and how the field can evaluate the efficacy of many types of interventions across pain conditi ons. 2For more information about MAGICapp, see https://app.magicapp.o rg Feb- ruary 6, 2019). 3For more information about Tabl eau, see https://www.tableau.com (accessed February 6, 2019).

If health improves but costs increase, policy makers must then decide whether the additional health ben efits are worth the costs, inc luding both costs borne by patients, payers, and health systems as well as societal costs such as low productivity, she said (see Figure 3-1). A metric t hat health economists use to quantify the benefit of a treatment is qualit y-adjusted life- years (QALYs), which combine inc reases in both length and quali ty of life, said Herman. Anything below $50,000 per QALY is generally consi dered cost-effective, adding that some interventions may be cost savi ngs if, for example, a treatment reduces the need for surgery, imaging, or injections. In 2012, Herman and colleagues pub lished a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of complementa ry therapies and integrative c are (Herman et al., 2012). They reviewed studies that evaluated costs compa red with usual care from the perspective of a hospital, payer, employer, or society in general. Herman noted that economic outcomes cannot be gener alized across settings, but the information obtained in one setting ca n be adjusted to other settings through simula tion modeling. Of the 28 higher quality FIGURE 3-1 Cost-effectiveness decision matrix. SOURCE: Presented by Patricia Herman, December 4, 2018.

Five of th ese inter- ventions were found to result in cost savings, while the costs of most of the others ranged from $3,000 to $28,000 per QALY. Only one exc eeded the threshold. Evaluations of most of the low-cost interven- tions used a societal perspective that included productivity ga ins. Herman added that for some studies, costs might have been even lower i f health care cost reductions had been captured over a longer period. Another study using simulation modeling to assess the cost-effe ctiveness of cognitive and mind-body therapies for chronic low back pain was pub- lished in 2017 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Revie w (ICER) (Tice et al., 2017). Models such as this allow researchers to f ill in the gaps that exist with patient data to help understand the cost-effect iveness of in- terventions and to see where to target future studies, said Her man. From the perspective of the health car e system and in terms of impro vements in chronic pain, the ICER model indicated that two interventions\u2014M BSR and yoga\u2014were of high value and that two others\u2014acupuncture and CBT\u2014were of intermediate value. They recommended coverage for a ll four of those treatments, said Herman. At RAND, Herman and colleagues have been working on a model for chronic low back pain that incorporates actual patient data on health care costs, productivity costs, and health-related quality of life f or four health states: no pain, low-impact chronic pain, moderate-impact chron ic pain, and high-impact chronic pain. This model allowed the researcher s to carve out data from patients with different pain states to show that costs in the high-impact chronic pain group are most affected by various tre atments and to determine which treatments provide the most cost savings . Thus, said Herman, the biggest benefits from a societal perspective s hould come from providing this group of patients with a variety of nonphar macological interventions. POTENTIAL RESEARCH PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARD Chou suggested several priorities for future research on the ef fective- ness of nonpharmacological therapies, including Developing a better understanding of the l ong-term sustainabili ty of intervention effects; The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Access to multimodal care may be limited by social factors such as poverty, education, and ethnic ity as well as by coverage lim ita- tions (Kerns). The Department of Veterans Affairs has developed a stepped-care program that begins w ith self-care, followed by screening, asse ss- ment, self-management, secondary consultation, multidisciplinar y rehabilitation, and advanced diagnostics and interventions if needed (Fritz, Kligler, Shaw). Stratified or matched care, whi ch begin with assigning patients to risk groups based on their responses to a questionnaire, may sa ve costs by providing care only when needed (Shaw). Reordering or sequencing the way care is delivered by starting with triage from a trained practitione r who provides reassurance, ed u- cational materials, and advice o n self-management may improve pain management and reduce th e use of opioids (Fritz). Treating complex and high-impact chronic pain may involve non- pharmacological interventions, particularly when pain is exacer - bated by modifiable risk factors such as catastrophizing (Edwar ds). Complementary and integrative health approaches have grown in popularity and have shown effectiveness in relieving pain and i m- proving function (DeBar).

All rights reserved.26 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT Placebo effects can be real and powerful and may be harnessed i n pragmatic trials and studies of real-world pain treatment (DeBa r). An array of technologies can enable the collection of high-inte nsity longitudinal data and may improve access to care by delivering self-management approaches direc tly to patients, although more evidence is needed on their effectiveness (Heapy). Limited evidence supports the use of multimodal approaches that combine pharmacological and nonpharmacological modalities (Kroenke). Neuromodulation approaches have shown modest effects in treat- ing pain and may be improved if used in combination with other interventions (Wilson). NOTE: These points were made by the individual speakers identif ied above; they are not intended to reflect a consensus among works hop participants. The National Pain Strategy,1 which was developed by the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee in response to the Institu te of Medicine report Relieving Pain in America (IOM, 2011b), highlighted several challenges to accessing high-quality pain care, said Ro bert Kerns. These challenges include the fact that pain care is often not e vidence based or team based; that it is often limited to pharmacological trea tment deliv- ered by a single provider in a single setting; and that it is u sually procedure oriented and incentivized for specialty care. Another challenge , said Kerns, arises from the fact that people with pain often have ov erlapping chronic pain conditions and other medical morbidities, especial ly mental health and substance use disorders. To address these challenges, the National Pain Strategy promote d the concept of integrated, patient-centered, evidence-based, multimodal, inter - disciplinary care, with systematic coordination of medical, psy - chological, and social aspects of care delivered by primary car e, mental health, and sometimes specialty care providers. Various models of care may provide integrated care, said Kerns, including stepped care, risk stratification, matched care, collaborative care, care 1For more information about the National Pain Strategy, see http s://iprcc.nih. gov/ National-Pain-Strategy/Overvi ew (accessed February 6, 2019).

All rights reserved.EMERGING MODELS OF CARE 27 management, integrated care in a co-located setting, use of tel ecare and technology-assisted care, peer-delivered care by informal careg ivers, and whole-health approaches that promote the uptake of complementar y and integrative health (CIH) approaches. Kerns mentioned a recent study that reviewed evidence from nine di- verse models of multimodal appro aches to pain management (Peter son et al., 2018). All these models provi ded robust evidence of improv ements in measures of pain intensity and pain-related functioning. Most i mportantly, said Kerns, the review cited four key ingredients in effective models of care: (1) decision support to enhance provider education and tr eatment planning, (2) additional care c oordination resources, (3) impro ved patient education and activation, and (4) increased access to multimoda l care. He highlighted two studies that exemplify the high-quality evidenc e that has been obtained for multimodal pain approaches. The first of thes e\u2014collab- orative care delivered in five primary care clinics at one Depa rtment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical C enter\u2014showed significant improve - ments compared with usual treat ment with an intervention that i ncluded \"clinician education, patient assessment, education and activat ion, symp- tom monitoring, feedback and recommendations, and facilitation of spe- cialty care\" (Dobscha et al., 2009). The second, which used a s tepped-care approach for affective disorders and musculoskeletal pain inclu ded macotherapy, phone-delivered p ain self-management, and an inter vention like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), also showed robust eff ects, par- ticularly on depression outcomes, but also on pain intensity (K roenke et al., 2009). Although these studies provide strong evidence to support the e fficacy and effectiveness of multimodal approaches to pain management, Kerns cautioned that concerns remain about access. He advocated payin g more attention to the social determin ants of pain and pain managemen t. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently publi shed a study that showed a higher than average prevalence of chronic p ain and high-impact chronic pain among women, those previously but not cur- rently employed, less educated p ersons, those living in or near poverty or in rural settings, and those with public health insurance, afte r adjusting for age. Chronic pain was also more prevalent among non-Hispanic wh ites and veterans after adjusting for age (Dahlhamer et al., 2018). These social determinants are important to keep in mind, said Kerns, because they de- scribe the same groups of people who may be disadvantaged in te rms of accessing high-quality pain care.

All rights reserved.28 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT Kerns added that delivery of integrative approaches may also be hin- dered by limited coverage for certain modalities. For example, a recent analysis showed that only 3 out of 15 Medicaid plans covered ac upuncture or psychological interventions for low back pain (Heyward et al ., 2018). However, despite these challenges, Kerns said the VA, a highly integrated health system, has successfully implemented multimodal integrat ive ap- proaches; although, there is great variance across the system a nd still room for improvement (Carey et al., 2018). Kerns emphasized that suc cessful implementation of these approaches will be more challenging in private practice and community settings. Kerns called for more high quality research on the effectivenes s of pain interventions, particularly using integrated approaches an d reim- bursement innovations. More effective strategies are also neede d to dis- seminate and promote uptake of evidence-based findings into rou tine clin- ical practice, he said. Giving patients a voice in choosing the type of care they recei ve may improve compliance and outcomes; however, David Atkins mentione d the subset of patients who might not naturally gravitate to certain types of therapies, such as CBT, even t hough such approaches may be best suited to their needs. He asked how studies could be designed to test whether outcomes could be improved by particular strategies to match th erapies to subsets of patients based on their preferences or other charact eristics. Robert Edwards, a clinical psychologist in the Pain Management Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, said he co uld envision a study using something like cluster randomization tes ting where one group receives treatment based on their preferences and ano ther group receives treatment based on a risk assessment. The research que stion to be answered in that study would be whether the extra time and expe nse of assessment and phenotyping results in better long-term outcomes . Alicia Heapy, associate professor of psy chiatry at Yale University Sch ool of Medicine and associate director of the Pain Research, Informati cs, Multi- morbidities, and Education (PRIME) Center of Innovation at the VA Con- necticut Healthcare System, added that this model is consistent with the stepped-care approach, discussed below. Lynn DeBar, senior scientist at th e Kaiser Permanente Washingto n Health Research Institute, commented that among the biggest cha llenges encountered in a study aimed at bringing interdisciplinary care to patients on chronic opioid therapy were (1) getting patients interested enough in the kinds of treatments being offered, and (2) creating a cultu re of care The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EMERGING MODELS OF CARE 29 grounded in the biopsychosocial model. She added that the langu age prac- titioners use to talk about nonpharmacological therapies is imp ortant to ensure that patients believe they are being offered the best tr eatments pos- sible. The facts, she said, are not nearly as compelling as the powerful experiences people share. STEPPED CARE, STRATIFIED CARE, AND MATCHED CARE Stepped care has been used for many conditions, purportedly to pro- vide patients with low-risk, low-cost care early on, followed b y higher risk and more invasive treatments if symptoms persist, said William Shaw, as- sociate professor and chief in the Division of Occupational and Environ- mental Medicine at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Unfortu- nately, he said, stepped care often means starting with easy ca re such as pharmacological treatments before implementing more difficult a p- proaches such as psychological t reatment if the problem continu es. Shaw said the VA developed a stepped-care plan that begins with screening, assessment, and self- management, followed by seconda ry con- sultation with specialists in pain management and a third step of multidis- ciplinary rehabilitation or advanced diagnostics and interventi ons (Kerns et al., 2011). Julie Fritz, distinguished professor in the Depa rtment of Physical Therapy and Athletic Training in the College of Health , University of Utah, added that subsequently, another step was added at the beginning of the pathway that involves self-care. This step was added, ac cording to Benjamin Kligler, when it became apparent that pain management is most successful when people are empowered to take care of their heal th. Shaw noted that this approach works to limit costs and reduce iatrog enic effects in health care systems such as the VA that have complete contro l of care. However, for the treatment of acute and subacute back pain, the stepped- care model may make it difficult to start nonpharmacological tr eatments early, he said. The model presumes that it takes time to establ ish psycho- logical and other kinds of treatment approaches and ignores the fact that psychosocial risk factors can be assessed in a patient within h ours of back pain onset. A stratified-care model for musculoskeletal conditions may help solve this problem, said Shaw. This appr oach begins with the new-onse t patient completing a one-page self-report questionnaire that assesses t he risk of chronicity, disability, or other poor outcomes. Based on this s ingle meas- ure, patients can be assigned to low-, medium-, or high-risk gr oups that The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.30 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT receive conservative to more aggressive care, respectively. Thi s approach provides early intervention for high-risk cases and may prevent unneces- sary treatment, said Shaw. The best example of the stratified-care model, he said, is the STarT Back trial, in which participants filled out a nine-item questi onnaire and then were assigned to the three risk groups. Low-risk participa nts received advice on appropriate levels of activity, exercise, and self-he lp. Medium- and high-risk participants were referred for physical therapy a nd more in- tensive treatment. Outcomes for all treatment groups improved c ompared with the control group, said Shaw (Hill et al., 2011). The magi c of this approach, he said, was the cost savings that resulted from dete rmining at the outset who needed care and who did not. The disadvantage of this approach is that it may be difficult t o assign people to risk categories with this simple questionnaire. Shaw and col- leagues proposed a matched-care model that uses a more detailed ques- tionnaire to assess the nature o f risk based on specific types of risk factors, such as mood problems, functional limitations, or workplace iss ues. They then assign individuals to treatment groups that match their in dividual problems (Shaw et al., 2013). Shaw acknowledged that this appro ach, which is still in an experimental phase, requires substantial r esources and evidence that it improves outcomes. He suggested that a middle road is needed between specificity related to the nature of the patient 's problems and the feasibility of delivering care within the payer-based s ystems cur- rently in place. Edwards added th at many studies would be neede d before clinicians are able to match s pecific treatments to individual patients. FIRST CONTACT CARE The importance of first contact was mentioned by Steven George in Chapter 2 and was reinforced by Fritz, one of many researchers who con- tributed to a recent Lancet study focused on how to reorder the way care is delivered so that first-lin e treatments offe red for conditio ns such as low back pain are grounded in a biopsychosocial framework that enha nces self-management (Foster et al., 2018). Training providers to behave differently and reforming payment poli- cies are long-term strategies that might accomplish this goal, said Fritz. However, she advocated more strategic ways of reordering care, for ex- ample, by sequencing care and adding explicitly a step that pre cedes pri- mary care and is focused on sel f-management and self-care. For example, The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EMERGING MODELS OF CARE 31 a pilot study by the National He alth Service in the United King dom intro- duced a primary care triage and treatment practitioner\u2014typicall y a nurse or physiotherapist\u2014as the first contact for patients with spina l and/or radicular pain. This practitione r provided encouragement, reass urance, ed- ucational materials, and advice on self-management. Patients wi th signs of significant compression or inflammatory back pain were refer red to pri- mary or specialty care, while others who were nonresponsive to the first line of care or who had physical or psychological risk factors for poor prognosis were referred for evidence-based nonpharmacological t reatment (Foster et al., 2018). In the United States, Fritz said the first provider contacted f or low back pain is most often a chiropractor or primary care physician. Da ta show that receiving care from a nonphysician, reduces the risk of opioids being ei- ther initiated or used over time (Kosloff et al., 2013; Weeks a nd Goertz, 2016; Wheldon et al., 2018). Claim s data from her own instituti on also show that opioid prescription f ills and long-term use of opioid s are much lower when patients start their journey of care with a nonphysi cian pro- vider, said Fritz (Fritz et al., 2016). She acknowledged that selection bias may a play a role in these results, but emphasized the importance of understanding why patients cho ose a particular type of provider and how to encourage them to choose nonphy- sician providers more often. Fritz's research suggests that pat ients are will- ing to choose a physical therapist visit as the first of line c are if they can be ensured that their health care providers are working togethe r as a team and if their concerns are appropriately addressed. CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX AND HIGH-IMPACT CHRONIC PAIN Nonpharmacological interventions h ave shown promise in treating pa- tients with complex and high-impact chronic pain, said Edwards. One rea- son for this is that there are many clearly delineated risk fac tors for devel- oping and maintaining high-impact chronic pain, including psych osocial risk factors such as catastrophizing. In the context of pain, E dwards de- fined catastrophizing as a negative cognitive and emotional res ponse char- acterized by rumination about pain, magnification of the threat value of pain, and feelings of helplessness. Many studies have shown tha t the high- est catastrophizing patients get the least benefit from pharmac ological treatment and are most likely to discontinue treatment, he said (e.g., Toth The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.32 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT et al., 2014). Just as important, said Edwards, catastrophizing changes with treatment and shapes treatment-related outcomes. For example, i n one study examining the effectiveness of tai chi for reducing pain and disabil- ity, about one-third of the effect on pain and two-thirds of th e effect on disability were attributed to a reduction in catastrophizing (H all et al., 2016). Edwards and colleagues have been s tudying the neural mechanisms that may contribute to catastrophizing's effects on pain. They have found that patients who selectively activate brain networks associate d with catastrophizing also report the most severe daily pain and have the greatest self-reported catastrophizing (Lee et al., 2018). Catastrophizi ng also appears to contribute to the maladaptive network connectivity t hat is ob- served in patients experiencing chronic pain. Importantly, catastrophizing is a modifiable risk factor, noted Edwards. CBT, for example, has been shown to reduce both catastrophizing and pain in patients with fibromyalgia (Lazaridou et al., 2017). Some ev idence sug- gests that the benefits of CBT are greatest in patients with hi gh baseline catastrophizing scores, who are the most resistant to pharmacol ogical treatment (Schutze et al., 2018). Recent research indicates tha t high catastrophizing may be associated with enhanced benefit from ce rtain in- terventions and reduced benefit fro m others, which suggests tha t this phe- notype may be useful as a factor for selecting personalized tre atments, said Edwards (Schreiber et al., 2018). INTEGRATIVE CARE In 1991, the National Institutes of Health established the Offi ce of Al- ternative Medicine, which was renamed the National Center for C omple- mentary and Alternative Medici ne in 1998 and renamed again in 2 014 as the National Center for Complemen tary and Integrative Health (N CCIH). The evolution in the name of the center reflects the recognitio n that although interest in alternative approach es has increased over the past 20 years, there is an even greater interest in integrating them with conv entional care, said DeBar. Complementary approaches include the use of natural products an d mind and body practices (NCCIH, 2018). A 2012 survey by the Nat ional Health Interview Survey showed that among mind and body practic es, yoga, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, and meditation w e r e The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EMERGING MODELS OF CARE 33 most popular. Other mind and body approaches include acupunctur e, mas- sage, tai chi, and the Alexander technique2 (Clarke et al., 2015). A more recent study showed that these practices continue to grow in po pularity, said DeBar. From 2012 to 2017, the number of adults over age 18 using yoga grew from 9.5 to 14.3 percent (Clarke et al., 2018). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality set a somewhat higher bar in a recently published comparative effectiveness re view by looking at short-, intermediate-, and long-term treatment effec ts of these approaches, said DeBar. For low back pain, yoga, manipulation, massage, and acupuncture were shown to imp rove function and decrease pai n inten- sity at least in the 1- to 6-month range (Skelly et al., 2018). A limitation of this research, according to DeBar, is that many (if not most) p eople with pain have chronic overlapping pain conditions, yet researchers have tended to examine effectiveness in a siloed manner. One excepti on she cited was a study conducted by Davis and colleagues (2016), who demon- strated that the symptom cluster of sleep disturbance, pain, an xiety, de- pression, and low energy and fati gue\u2014the SPADE pentad\u2014correlate d with functional outcomes in a stepped-care intervention program . Complementary and integrative health modalities have also been stud- ied in more partitioned ways, disconnected from conventional ca re, said DeBar. For example, Cherkin a nd colleagues conducted a series o f rigor- ous clinical trials that examined the effectiveness, compared t o usual care, of acupuncture, massage, yoga, and mindfulness-based stress red uction for the treatment of low back pain (Cherkin et al., 2009, 2011, 201 6; Sherman et al., 2011). Interestingly, said DeBar, all these modalities showed similar impacts. She suggested that perhaps these effects derive from n on-specific contextual effects of the care experience rather than specific characteris- tics of the intervention. Which modality is selected may be les s important than what is available to patients in a particular area or what they are ex- cited about and will commit and a dhere to, said DeBar. There mi ght be ways to sequentially employ bot h active and passive modalities in clinical trials. DeBar said there have been some provocative studies indicating that the placebo effect is real and can be powerful both for pharmac ological and nonpharmacological therapies. She pointed to a study by Cru m and colleagues that demonstrated how in the real world, psychologic al and so- 2An educational process aimed at retraining poor movement and po sture habits.

All rights reserved.34 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT cial forces of healing contribute to and underlie the magnitude of a treat- ment effect (Crum et al., 2017). We should harness those effect s, said DeBar, particularly in pragmatic trials and studies of real-world trea tments. Karen Sherman, senior scientific investigator at the Kaiser Per ma- nente Washington Health Research Institute and affiliate profes sor of epi- demiology at the University of Washington School of Public Heal th, rec- ommended future research priorities for CIH. First, she advocat ed includ- ing more trials in older adults even though their interest in C IH may differ from younger adults. Chronic pain conditions associated with co morbid conditions are relatively more common in older adults, and stan dard treat- ments may work less effectively or be associated with worse sid e effects in seniors. Nonpharmacological a pproaches may reduce these adve rse events, said Sherman. Currently, many randomized controlled tri als of chronic pain treatments, including CIH interventions, exclude o lder adults, especially the oldest old and those who are institutionalized, she said, not- ing that CIH interventions may need to be modified for these po pulations. Sherman also recommended: Conducting studies on implementing and disseminating various mind-body and self-care therapie s, which can increase self-effi cacy, but often are unreimbursed and require sustained, consistent pr actice.

USING TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT ACCESS, SELF-MANAGEMENT, AND CARE PROCESSES A diverse array of technologies offer the potential to improve access to care by delivering self-management approaches to patients, a ccording to Heapy. These technologies range from text messaging and othe r mobile apps to virtual reality and artificial intelligence, and includ e wearable de- vices, interactive voice response systems, and telemedicine, sh e said. They have the capacity to collect high- intensity, longitudinal data, which Heapy said has been shown to be valid and reliable and less vulnerabl e to recall bias than data collected farther from the time the pain occurre d. Some of these technologies have adapted theory- and evidence-based inte rventions in which small to moderate effects have been demonstrated, such as CBT The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EMERGING MODELS OF CARE 35 and mindfulness approaches. Heapy described others as \"modular treat- ments,\" where multiple approaches are combined to promote self- monitoring, goal setting, skill acquisition, education, assessment, patient -provider communication, and social support. Superimposed on these divers e tech- nologies are differences in the amount of contact that patients have with clinicians. Heapy said that while these technologies appear promising, limi ted quality evidence is available regarding the effectiveness of th ese interven- tions relative to in-person care; which technologies are best o r which com- ponents are most important or effective; and to what extent cli nician contact increases engagement and improves outcomes and the nece ssary frequency of that contact (McGuire et al., 2017). Greater under standing of how these treatments work is al so needed, she said, as well as the temporal sequence of changes, causal factors that are related to changes , and com- mon mechanisms that may underlie the effectiveness of different treat- ments. To improve the quality of evidence, researchers have rec ommended conducting more randomized controlled trials with fewer single- arm stud- ies, reducing variability across studies to enable comparabilit y, and focus- ing on interventions with a theoretical basis, said Heapy (McGu ire et al., 2017; Sundararaman et al., 2017; Wethington et al., 2018). She added that cost-effectiveness studies are also needed of interventions usi ng these technologies. Heapy advocated including clinical experts and en d users in the development of technology-b ased treatments and adapting tre atments for special and underserved populations, including older adults . Little is known about how to implement technology-assisted trea t- ments for pain either to the patient directly or within a healt h system as part of routine care, said Heapy. Internet-based interventions for anxiety and depression are the most well developed. A recent study of I nternet- based CBT found general agreement among therapists and service manag- ers on the need for technology-assisted interventions to increa se access, but skepticism existed from re ferring providers about the quali ty of inter- ventions (Folker et al., 2018). There were also concerns about the need for additional therapist training to deliver these treatments. Heap y suggested that hybrid implementation and effectiveness trials might achie ve two aims with one trial. Many questions remain about how to advance the use of technolog y- assisted treatments and integrate these treatments into existin g care, said Heapy. Among these: Who will pay for these treatments? Will tre ating patients across state lines raise licensure issues? How can ris k be managed (e.g., for patients at risk for suicide)? How can patient data confidentiality The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.36 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT be ensured (Hill et al., 2018; Mc Guire et al., 2017)? Heapy add ed that there is a need to systematically examine barriers and facilitators t o treatment at the patient, provider, and system levels. Education and marketi ng are also needed to explain to patients how and why nonpharmacological ap - proaches such as CBT may help, and to providers why early refer ral is important, she said. Heapy added that partnerships will be need ed between investigators and commercial entities to address these concerns and de- velop a consensus, and that integrated health systems like the VA, the mil- itary health system, and Kaiser Permanente have an important ro le to play because they have the infrastruct ure, electronic health records , and large expert workforces capable of deve loping, testing, and implement ing novel treatments into care. MULTIMODAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT According to Kurt Kroenke, there is some, but limited, evidence to support combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological modali ties to treat pain. He cited several combination trials that focused on pain or pain and depression. A study tha t compared the combination of t he anti- depressant nortriptyline plus stress management to either thera py alone or placebo, for example, showed that the combination was marginall y more effective than monotherapy (Holroyd et al., 2001). The ESCAPE t rial (Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain) in veterans of th e Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts combined me dication with self-management strate- gies for the first 12 weeks, follo wed by 12 weeks of CBT. The r esults showed statistically significant reductions in pain-related dis ability and pain severity (Bair et al., 2015). Another study conducted by K roenke and colleagues compared analgesics, mood treatments, and self-manag ement to automated self-management only (see Kroenke et al., 2018, fo r study design and sample characteristics). Interestingly, they found t hat about one-third of participants in the usual care arm worsened over t he 12-month trial period compared with about one-sixth of participants in t he active arm, said Kroenke. This suggests that patients may actually be harmed if they are not offered the right combination of nonpharmacologica l and op- timized analgesia treatments, which he said is often not curren tly feasible in primary care. Kroenke noted that it is difficult to unbundle the effects of t he different components in a combination trial to assess synergistic effects . Other fac-The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Adding devices to the equation furt her compli- cates the situation. However, \"imperfect treatments do not just ify thera- peutic nihilism, and a broad menu of partially effective treatm ent options maximizes the chance of achieving at least partial amelioration of chronic pain,\" said Kroenke in a recent editorial and Cheville , 2017, p. 2366). He s uggested that future research on combined modalities should examine patient preferences, optimal sequencing, differential e ffective- ness for chronic pain versus site - or mechanism-specific pain, long-term effectiveness, and alternative trial designs. NEUROMODULATION Neuromodulation\u2014the alteration of nerve activity through target ed delivery of a stimulus to a specific neurologic site\u2014represents another nonpharmacological approach to the treatment of pain, said Rich ard Wilson, associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Case West- ern Reserve University and director of the Division of Neurolog ical Reha- bilitation at the MetroHealth Rehabilitation Institute of Ohio. The stimulus may be electric current or chem ical and can be delivered either invasively or non-invasively, he said, with the goal to reduce pain and im prove func- tion and quality of life. Among invasive approaches, Wilson said spinal cord stimulation is one of the most commonly used methods for pain control. In this modality, electrodes are surgically placed within the spinal canal in clo se proximity to the spinal cord and then connected to an implantable pulse g enerator. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation is a newer form in which the e lectrode is placed near the dorsal root ganglion to deliver more precise st imulation, he said. Other invasive methods he described include peripheral n e r v e stimulation (PNS), in which electrodes are placed underneath th e skin and connected to an implanted pulse generator. This approach, said Wilson, has been used to reduce chronic head pain. A less invasive opti on involves placement of an electrode underneath the skin and connecting it to an ex- ternal stimulator, which can provide long-term benefits. Brain stimulation may also be achieved through both invasive an d noninvasive approaches, said Wilson. In transcranial direct cur rent stimu-The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

A current fl owing be- tween two electrodes stimulates the brain tissue underneath. Wi th transcra- nial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a coil placed outside the skul l generates a current within brain tissue that can alter brain activity. Am ong invasive neuromodulatory approaches, deep brain stimulation requires neu rosurgery to plant an electrode within bra in tissue to deliver more preci se stimulation. Wilson said there is evidence supporting the use of tDCS and PN S to treat migraine, and for TMS to treat phantom limb pain, neuropa thic pain, and spinal cord injury (Boldt et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Corbett et al., 2018; O'Connell et al., 2018; Shirahige et al., 2016). Some evi dence also suggests that spinal cord stimulation may be more effective tha n other treatments for failed back surge ry syndrome (Frey et al., 2009) . All these approaches have modest or small effects, said Wilson. He suggested that a multimodal approach using interventions that t arget dif- ferent mechanisms or that have different mechanisms of action m ight pro- vide better pain relief. For example, exercise and neuromodulat ion reduce pain in different ways. To treat knee osteoarthritis, Wilson hy pothesized that exercise may reduce pain by improving biomechanics, alteri ng endog- enous pain mechanisms, and possibly promoting Concur- rent treatment with tDCS, meanwhile, may improve somatosensory function and stimulate the cortex. The hope is that these effects might be additive or synergistic, said Wilson; however, there is little evidence at this point to guide how to use these approaches in practice. He cited three randomized contro lled trials of combined modalit ies for pain. The first showed that spinal cord stimulation and physica l therapy were more effective than either approach alone in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (Kemler et al., 2000, 2004). Another tri al showed that tDCS plus aerobic exercise was better than either alone fo r fibromyal- gia. A third showed that tDCS plus exercise is better than exer cise and sham stimulation for low back pain. Wilson's lab has developed a tr eatment for hemiplegic shoulder pain after stroke that involves placing an electrode between the mid dle and pos- terior deltoids of the affected shoulder and delivering electri cal stimulation from an external stimulator every 30 seconds for 6 hours per da y for 3 weeks. They compared this approach to physical therapy designed to im- prove range of motion and strength and showed that both groups had re- duced pain, with greater improvement in the PNS group (Wilson e t al., 2014). As a next step, Wilson and colleagues are now conducting a ran- domized controlled trial to test combining these two approaches . One group will get the multimodal approach, another will get PNS an d sham The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

They have added other important outcomes to this trial to help them understand mechanisms and patient variables that influence response (e.g., catastro- phizing, fear avoidance, or anatomic abnormalities). Wilson mentioned one other example of multimodal research: a st udy comparing mirror therapy compared to tDCS for phantom limb pain (Pinto et al., 2016). Mirror therapy uses mirrors to create the illusi on of movement in the phantom limb, which leads to a reorganization of cortica l networks. Understanding mechanisms such as this will help investigators l earn how to improve these approaches in future trials and understand whi ch combi- nation of treatments will likely yield the greatest effects, sa id Wilson.

The Pain Management Collaboratory, a partnership of several federal agencies, has a robust clinical research program, inclu ding a focus on pragmatic trials, and has launched demonstration projects to study effectiveness and implementation (Kerns, Shurtleff). The NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research's mission includes advancing and coordinating the behavioral and social sciences at the NIH and s upports the integration of beha v- ioral and social sciences research into trans-NIH activities su ch as those addressing the opioid crisis through nonpharmacologic ap-proaches (Smith). The National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research funds research focused on how people adapt to disability, including t he use of technologies to enhance function and manage chronic pain (Cernich). The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute has two major initiatives focused on nonopioid treatment options for pain (Goertz).

All rights reserved.42 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT The Department of Veterans Affairs has a long history of provid - ing integrated care and supports a large research portfolio tha t in- cludes projects investigating nonpharmacological treatments for pain (Atkins). Pain-focused research priorities of the Department of Defense military health system include implementation of evidence-based and effective care into practi ce and reducing opioid misuse (Schoomaker). The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health recently issued a Request for A pplication that will support stu dies testing different models of care (Weber). NOTE: These points were made by the individual speakers identif ied above; they are not intended to reflect a consensus among works hop participants. In response to a mandate of the 2010 Patient Protection and Aff ordable Care Act, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) asked the Ins titute of Medicine (IOM) to examine the state of the science regarding pa in re- search, care, and education, which led to the 2011 IOM report Relieving Pain in America (IOM, 2011b). One of the outcomes of that report was the development of a National Pain Strategy1 and the creation of the Inter- agency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC).2 In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked the National Academies to pro- vide an update on the science of pain research, care, and educa tion; char- acterize the opioid epidemic and evidence on strategies to addr ess it; and identify actions and research qu estions needed to respond to th e epidemic since publication of the 2011 IOM report. In response to this r equest, the National Academies published the report Pain Management and the Opi- oid Epidemic: Balancing Societal a nd Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use (NASEM, 2017). The focus on pain at the federal level has resulted in many ini tiatives aimed at supporting research to advance pain management and com bat the opioid epidemic. Several partic ipants at the workshop highlight ed many of these efforts. 1For more information about the N ational Pain Strategy, see http s://iprcc.nih.gov/sites/ default/files/HHSNational_Pain_S trategy_508C.pdf (accessed Febr on IPRCC, see https://iprcc.nih.gov (acces sed February 6, 2019).

According to David Shurtleff, deputy director o f the Na- tional Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), a por- tion of the HEAL Initiative is an offshoot of the NIH Health Ca re Systems Research Collaboratory,4 a program established in 2012 to engage health care delivery organizations as research partners in pragmatic a nd imple- mentation studies (see Figure 5-1). The Collaboratory's experie nce in con- ducting clinical trials allowed NIH to move forward with the HE AL Pragmatic and Implementation Studies for the Management of Pain (PRISM) to reduce opioid prescribing. These projects must be em bedded in health care systems and are supported by a coordinating cent er that helps them design studies and reach milestones, said Shurtleff. They ad- dress three key issues: (1) systems change to improve adherence to evi- dence-based guidelines for pain m anagement; (2) integration of evidence- based approaches for pain management into health systems; and ( 3) in- forming national coverage deter mination decisions through partn erships with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The HEAL Initiative is divided into two components: First, to d evelop and implement therapies for opioid use disorders, including a f ocus on ne- onatal opioid withdrawal; and second, to better understand the neurobiol- ogy of pain and accelerate development of new approaches to tre at both acute and chronic pain, said Porter. On the pain side, the HEAL Initiative has devoted resources to build in frastructure and incentivize p artners to develop new analgesics, including small molecules, natural prod ucts, bio- logics, and devices. This infrast ructure will include human- an d animal- based tissue screening platform s to support early-stage drug de velopment; new and refined animal models that better reflect the human con dition; and clinical research networks to s upport clinical trials, said Por ter. Biomarker discovery and validation will be woven throughout all HEAL prog rams on 3For more information on the NIH HEAL Initiative, see https://ww w.nih.gov/research- training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative (accessed February 6, 2019). 4For more information on the NIH Collaboratory, see http://rethi nkingclinicaltrials.org (accessed February 6, 2019).

National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health NCCIH plays a prominent role in the pragmatic aspects of the HE AL Initiative, said Shurtleff. He described a clinical research pi peline that funds studies across the continuum from basic and mechanistic w ork through translational research, intervention, refinement, and o ptimization; efficacy and effectiveness; and pragmatic studies and dissemina tion. These studies are designed to elucidate how natural products an d mind- body treatments work, whether the impact can be measured reliab ly in hu- mans, what modifications might enh ance impact adherence, how tr eatment effectiveness compares with other treatments or controls, and h ow effective the treatment is likely to be in real-world conditions. Shurtle ff added that natural products account for about half of the NCCIH research i nvestment. Wendy Weber, branch chief for clinical research in the Compleme n- tary and Integrative Health Branc h, Division of Extramural Rese arch at NCCIH, mentioned a forthcoming Request for Applications that ha s since been announced, specifically calling for research studies withi n health sys- tems that will test different models to determine how best to c hange care to better adhere to the current guidelines, implement services, and over- come access barriers.8 NIH Pain Management Collaboratory The Pain Management Collaboratory9 is a partnership among NIH, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Veterans Aff airs (VA) that supports pain-focused pragmatic clinical trials of no npharmaco- logical approaches embedded in the VA and military health syste ms, said 7For more information on the NIH HEAL Pain Management Effectiven ess Research Network, see https://painconsor tium.nih.gov/Funding_Research/NI H-HEAL-Effectiveness- Research-Program-Pain (ac cessed February 6, 2019). 8For the RFAs associated with PRISM, see htt pts://nccih.nih.gov/ grants/heal (accessed February 13, 2018). 9For more information on the Pain Management Collaboratory, see https://pain managementcollaboratory.org (accessed February 6, 2019).

Shurtleff said they have successfully launched 11 demon- stration projects and are looking ahead to how they will implem ent new treatment approaches into care w hen and if they demonstrate eff ectiveness. Kerns noted that they have encountered a challenge related to t he ca- pacity for conducting this kind of research in primary care set tings within a large, integrated health syste m like the VA. Given the many c ompeting demands in these settings, organizational leaders, leaders in t he primary care setting, or clinicians and staff do not necessarily consid er research a priority, he said. Patient and clinician education and messagin g will be key factors to spark the interest of practicing clinicians and incr ease the likeli- hood that they will stay engaged with this research, Kerns adde d. Access issues add to the difficulty of designing pragmatic trials in m any of these health systems as well, said Fritz. Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research The NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research (OBSSR)10 was created by Congress in recognition of the importance of behavioral and social sciences to the NIH mission. OBSSR was cr eated more than 20 years ago to encourag e the advancement and coordin ation of behavioral and social sciences research at NIH. The current OBS SR stra- tegic priorities include increasing the synergy between basic a nd applied research; enhancing the methods, measures, and data infrastruct ures to en- courage a more cumulative \"behavioral and social sciences; and facilitat- ing the adoption of behavioral and social sciences research fin dings in health research and practice.\" OBSSR also helps to encourage an d support the integration of behavioral a nd social sciences into trans-NI H activities, including those addressing the opioid and pain crises; to commu nicate with various stakeholders about behavioral and social sciences research, said Wendy B. Smith, associate director of OBSSR. For example, in 2018 as part of the NIH Cutting Edge Series to Combat the Opioid Cri sis, OBSSR help lead the coordination of a meeting in collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), NCCIH, NINDS, and the Na- tional Institute on Minority Health and Disparities that invite d experts with a wide variety of experience and expertise to identify social a nd behavioral research contributions and priorities to help address the opioi d and pain 10For more information about OBSSR, including funding opportuniti es, see https:// obssr.od.nih.gov (acce ssed February 6, 2019).

This meeting included a panel focused on in corporating nonpharmacological approaches for the treatment of opioid abuse and chronic pain management and included discussions about the impo rtance of both implementing these new methods as well as de-implementi ng methods that are not found to be effective.11 To address the objectives of the OBSSR strategic priorities, the central functions of the Of fice include focusing on communicating results, coordinating efforts across institutes and centers, training the next generation of behavioral and soc ial scientists, shaping scientific policies and procedures to facilitate the OB SSR agenda, and conducting evaluation activities that help address importan t research gaps and track progress, Smith added. National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research Within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child H ealth and Human Development, the Nati onal Center for Medical Rehabili tation Research (NCMRR)12 funds rehabilitation research and coordinates re- lated efforts across NIH and other federal agencies, said Aliso n Cernich, director of NCMRR. People with disabilities are often prescribe d opioids for pain and are at higher risk for chronic pain due to inactiv ity, inability to move certain body parts, spasticity, and contractures, she s aid. Thus, NCMRR's research funding priorities include examining how peopl e adapt to disability by using devices and technologies that enha nce func- tion, manage chronic pain, and access effective nonpharmacologi cal treat- ments for pain such as fitness facilities. As an example of the importance of this research, Cernich noted that recent surveys indicate th at 78 to 80 percent of fitness facilities lack access for people with disab ilities, which not only prevents them from gaining the benefits of nonpharmaco logical and multimodal approaches to pain management, but also leads to social isolation. NCMRR also supports research aimed at identifying ob jective and real-world measures of pain and function, developing multim odal ap- proaches to managing pain and di sability, and promoting the con tinued effective treatment of pain when children make the transition t o adult care, said Cernich. 11For a summary of the OBSSR meeting Contributions of Social and Behavioral Re- search in Addressing the Opioid Crisis, see https://www.nih.gov /heal-initiative/full- summary-contributions-social-behavioral-research-addressing-opi oid-crisis NCMRR, including funding opportuniti es, see https:// www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/ncmrr (accessed February 6, 2019).

PCORI also is mandated to provide the public, patients, and cli nicians with information about the evidence gathered in funded studies and i mplement- ing the results of their research, said Goertz. PCORI has had two major initiatives focused on nonopioid treatm ent options, the prevention of unsafe prescribing, and the manageme nt of long-term prescription opioid use. As of November 2018, Goertz said PCORI had awarded nearly $94 million to fund comparative effect iveness research studies on managing or treating noncancer pain, includ ing the use of nonpharmacological therapies such as CBT, physical therapy, manual therapy, exercise, mindfulness, and acupuncture as well as educ ation, self- management, and system-level interventions such as integrative care coordination. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS The VA manages the largest federal health system in the United States, providing integrated care to 6 million patients each year at mo re than 160 hospitals and more than 1,000 other care sites, said David Atki ns. He added that because both chronic pain and opioid use are higher in military veterans than in other population groups, the VA is a good plac e to study pain care; for a large organization such as the VA, the biggest challenges is how to deliver evidence-based and patient-centered multimoda l care in a reliable, scalable, account able, and affordable way. Nonetheless, progress has been made, said Atkins. As of 2015, 9 3 per- cent of VA medical centers offer at least two CIH modalities, h e said, not- ing that chiropractic care has been standard in the VA for more than a decade. Massage and mindfulness a pproaches are also widely used by vet- 13For more information about PCORI, including funding opportuniti es, see https://www.pcori.org (accessed February 6, 2019).

In fiscal year 2018, the VA research portfolio consisted of 151 pro- jects, including studies exploring nonpharmacological approache s such as biobehavioral, technology, activity, and CIH-based intervention s. Atkins said that evidence gaps remain, particularly with regard to del ivering these interventions across a broad organization, identifying well-qua lified pro- viders, implementing multimodal care in a primary care setting, and demon- strating both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different therapies. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE The DoD military health system, which provides cradle-to-grave care for 9.5 million beneficiaries, i ncluding combat and noncombat p ersonnel, families, and retirees, also funds and conducts research and de velops and implements policies, according to Eric Schoomaker, Lieutenant G eneral, U.S. Army (retired) and former U.S. Army Surgeon General and Co m- manding General of the U.S. Army Medical Command. DoD research in- itiatives and priorities related to pain management focus on tr anslating and implementing evidence-based and effective care into practice an d tackling opioid overuse and misuse while recognizing the need for opioid s in com- bat settings, he said. Indeed, Schoomaker suggested that the sh ift in focus from pain to opioids over the past few years may need rethinkin g because more than 75 percent of patients with opioid use disorder start with prob- lems in pain management. He noted that DoD initiatives must ali gn with other federal agencies, especially the VA. Schoomaker referenced the 2010 DoD published task force report that recommended a comprehensive pain management strategy, citing go od evidence of effectiveness for CIH modalities, especially yoga a nd tai chi.14 He questioned why payers are still debating whether these modal ities should be covered and why the provider community has not embrac ed them, especially in light of the cumulative evidence of their e ffectiveness (as discussed in Chapter 3), th e absence of evidence for effect iveness for the most commonly used therapy for chronic pain\u2014chronic opioids \u2014and 14To read the Office of the Army Surgeon General's Pain Managemen t Task Force re- port, see http://www.dvc ipm.org/site/assets/files/1070/pain-tas k-force-final-report-may- 2010.pdf (accessed February 6, 2019).

Interprofessional education and collaboration are essential com - ponents of integrative medicine (Kligler). Several organizations have developed free curricula, including competency-based curricula, to facilitate interprofessional edu ca- tion (Darnall, Fishman, Kligler, Thomas). Addressing misconceptions and reducing stigma are important goals of interprofessional curricula (Thomas). Immersion programs, internships, and fellowships offer creative approaches to promote interprofe ssional pre- and post-licensure training (Anderson, Baker, Fishman). Turf, ignorance, and economics present barriers to the implemen - tation of collaborative, team-based, patient-centered, pain car e in clinical practice (Goldblatt). Many excellent models to promote collaborative practice exist i n- cluding those that involve interf aculty education, intra-agency col- laborations and exchange programs. In addition, there are progr ams that address social factors (or the social determinants) that a ffect the pain experience (Goldblatt, Harrell, Kligler, Watt-Watson).

All rights reserved.52 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT Throughout the workshop, many par ticipants emphasized the need to change health care practice to integrate nonpharmacological man agement of pain, with important implicati ons for implementation and dis semination that need to be considered, said Kim Dunleavy, clinical associa te professor and director of Professional Education and Community Engagement in the Department of Physical Therapy at the University of Florida. Ev ery group that has looked at the problem of inadequate or inappropriate p ain man- agement has recognized that clinicians receive inadequate pre- and post- licensure training about pain and the treatment of pain (IOM, 2 011b), said Scott Fishman, Fullerton Endowed Chair in Pain Medicine and pro fessor of anesthesiology and psychiatry at the University of Californi a, Davis. Adding to this problem are interprofessional and interdisciplin ary silos and the fact that while each discipline includes pain in its cu rricula, pain is not the primary focus of any of them, he said. Benjamin Klig ler con- curred about the importance of interprofessional education and collabora- tion, noting that they are essential components of integrative medicine. Integrative medicine, he said, reaffirms the important relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by e vidence, and uses all appropriate therapeutic lifestyle approaches and disciplines to achieve opt imal health and healing. 1 One of the biggest barriers to interprofessional education and health care is physicians who resist the idea of working collaboratively wi th other practitioners, said Kligler. Belinda Anderson, founding director of the Institute for Health and Wellness at Monmouth University, added that immersion approache s might be far more effective than didactic approaches in bringin g people from disparate professions together. Selling this idea to diffe rent profes- sions may require different strategies, she said. In addition t o informing practitioners from the various p rofessions about how and why a particular complementary approach may be beneficial, she said it is equall y im- portant to let them know about the training and qualifications of the prac- titioners of that approach. Creative approaches are also needed t o encourage CIH professionals to collaborate with mainstream prac titioners, 1For more information about integ rative medicine, see imconsorti um.org (accessed March 11, 2019). The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 53 she said. Educating patients about self-care and these differen t therapeutic interventions is also important, said Anderson. With medical information increasing at such a rapid rate, data over- load presents a significant challenge for providers. Thus, buil ding complex- ity and changeability into inter professional education curricul a through the use of big data approaches, artificial intelligence, and teleme dicine is es- sential, said Anderson. Learning health care systems that provi de feedback to practitioners about successful and unsuccessful intervention s may also help change behavior and practice, said David Shurtleff. INTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION MODELS Fishman advocated a competency-based education model that em- ploys competencies as goals. He led an interprofessional projec t that in- cluded physicians, nurses, pha rmacists, acupuncturists, physica l therapists, and other health care professionals to build consensus about co re compe- tencies for pain management. Based on the domains of the Intern ational Association for the Study of Pain Curricula, they developed and reached consensus about the competencies of the important goals for all students: Every student who graduates from a health professional program should know what pain is and how to recognize it and should understand how to safely and effectively treat pain within the scope of their pra ctice. In addi- tion, he said, they need to understand how the patient's contex t affects their pain (Fishman et al., 2013). Fishman said the model has b een em- braced by many national and international professional organiza tions. Fishman and colleagues were invite d by the National Board of Me di- cine Examiners to review the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam to see how well it aligned with the core competencies they identified (Fis hman et al., 2018). He and his team were surprised to find that 15 percent o f the ques- tions on the exam directly tested on pain. However, almost 90 p ercent of the questions that directly tested aspects of pain knowledge fo cused on recognition of pain. Fishman said that while recognizing pain i s obviously important, without understanding pain or how to treat it safely and effec- tively, or the context in which it occurs, may create the condi tions where clinicians reach for what is known and accessible, which typica lly means opioids and other pharmacological approaches. While he believes the Na- tional Board of Medicine Examiners will change the test as a re sult of this study, even more important is to convince accreditors of school s and li-The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.54 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT censing organizations to require that schools demonstrate they are educat- ing students with clear competency-based goals for comprehensiv e pain education within their curricula. Kligler and colleagues, with a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration, established the National Center for In tegrative Primary Healthcare (NCIPH)2 and developed a standardized curriculum in integrative primary health care. In developing this program, th ey looked at shared competencies across different professions, realizing right away that shared competencies exist because every one of those profe ssions put the patient first. The 30-hour online course they developed, ca lled Foun- dations in Integrative Health, identified a set of core compete ncies and developed educational materials in integrative health (Kligler et al., 2015). The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has developed a set of free ed- ucational materials for interdisciplinary pain teams and a cour se called Whole Health for Pain and Suffering.3 Beth Darnall, clinical professor in the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medici ne at Stan- ford University, added that the International Association for t he Study of Pain also has free curriculum outlines available online. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pain Consortium's Cente rs of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPEs)4 has also developed modules to promote prelicensure training on pain, according to the David T homas, leader of the program and health scientist administrator in the Division of Epidemiology, Services, and Prevention Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). One goal of these modules is to address m iscon- ceptions, such as the idea that pain is in your head, or that i f you treat a disease the pain goes away. Through the presentation of case st udies, the modules also hope to reduce the stigma around pain, including t he com- mon belief that patients who present with pain are drug seekers or simply complainers. The case studies approach also provides opportunities to learn about how to manage specific types of pain, said Thomas. For example, a t a sickle cell disease (SCD) meeting, Thomas heard the story of a woman coping with pain related to the disease. SCD, said Thomas, is a condition where racism and ignorance collide. The woman's story led to th e creation 2For more information about NCIPH, see http://nciph.org (accesse d February 6, 2019). 3For more information and to download a Whole Health for Pain an d Suffering course brochure, see https://wholehealth.w isc.edu/courses-training/who le-health-for-pain-and- suffering (accessed February 6, 2019). 4For more information about the CoEPEs, see https://painconsorti um.nih.gov/Funding_ Research/CoEPEs (accessed February 6, 2019).

Thomas said he believes that the gap in pain edu cation results from society's lack of caring for people in pain. Altho ugh empathy for people in pain goes down in medical school, he said, empath y can be taught, and can pay dividends in te rms of sustaining clinician' s interest in caring for people in pain (Chen et al., 2012; Hegazi and Wilson , 2013). Addressing Gaps in Pain Education To address the education gaps both in pre-licensure and post-li censure training, Fishman said we need to make some of the current NIH research funding available to study the impact of the education gap on t he current opioid crisis as well as the impact of retaining our students a nd clinicians. Accreditors also need to be brought on board. Otherwise, he sai d, there will be generations of clinicians on the front line, particular ly in primary care, who have not received adequate training in pain managemen t. To fill this gap, he and his colleagues at the University of California , Davis, have developed a fellowship program u sing telementoring for retraini ng pri- mary care clinicians; and to make this training more widely acc essible have also instituted a \"train the trainer\" primary care fellows hip. Health professions with curricula that cover all these competen cy do- mains still face challenges in training students to synthesize this infor- mation into a comprehensive way to treat patients with chronic pain, said Nancy Baker, associate professor of occupational therapy at Tuf ts Univer- sity. The best way to do this, she said, would be through inter nships; how- ever, such internships are rare, in part because there are few sites that focus on the treatment of chronic pain. In addition, when an occupati onal thera- pist does gain this expertise, there are few jobs available. Th is \"catch 22\" is a problem for many other health professions, said Baker. To address this challenge, she suggested crea ting post-professional training pr ograms to provide additional training for therapists with excellent skill s but little spe- cific training in pain. She and her colleagues at Tufts have cr eated an online training course for worki ng therapists to increase their understand- ing of chronic pain and how to treat it. Moving from Classroom to Practice In 2010, the Lancet Commission published a report on health pro fes- sionals for a new century, emphasizing the importance of patien t-centered, collaborative, team-based care, said Elizabeth Goldblatt (Frenk et al., The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.56 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT 2010). Shortly thereafter, she said, the IOM published a report on the fu- ture of nursing\u2014the largest segme nt of the health care workforc e\u2014which emphasized the need for all health professionals to practice up to their full scope of training (IOM, 2011a). Those seminal reports led to th e formation of the National Academies' Gl obal Forum on Innovation in Health Profes- sional Education, while at the same time the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC)5 was getting starting with its 6 original members that has now expanded to 21, and includes the Association of Chiropr actic Col- leges, said Goldblatt. To create team-based, patient-cente red pain care, all mainstream/conventional health professionals are now re- quired to receive training in interprofessional education and c ollaborative practice, according to Goldblatt. Practitioners of five CIH app roaches\u2014 acupuncture/East-Asian medicine, chiropractic, naturopathic med icine, massage therapy, and direct-entry midwifery\u2014are licensed and ha ve ac- creditation bodies recognized by the Department of Education. O thers such as yoga or Ayurveda medicine,6 while highly credible, are not yet licensed in the United States, said Goldblatt. Models are emerg ing to pro- mote integrated health care using blended classrooms and collab orative clinics where health care professionals can gain deep knowledge about other professions and learn how to work together. Goldblatt men tioned there is a wealth of informati on on the National Center for Int erprofessional Practice and Education (NEXUS) website, which provides evidence -based resources across the education-to-practice continuum.7 Practitioners in medical and allied health professions also nee d to learn self-care since many of these professionals (e.g., dental hygie nists, physi- cal therapists, and occupational therapists) suffer from chroni c occupa- tion-related pain, said Monika Gross with the Poise Project and Alexander Technique for Pain Management. S he also suggested creating a ne w class of health care professionals for persons skilled in advocacy an d translation. 5For more information about IPEC, see https://www.ipecollaborati ve.org/about- ipec.html (accessed February 6, 2019). 6Ayurveda medicine is the ancient Indian medical system that \"re lies on a natural and holistic approach to physical and mental health.\" It \"combines products (mainly derived from plants, but may also include animal, metal, and mineral), diet, exercise, and lifestyle.\" For more information, see https://nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurveda /introduction.htm (ac- cessed March 7, 2019). 7For more information about NEXUS, see https://nexusipe.org (acc essed February 6, 2019).

COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE: A TEAM-BASED APPROACH FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT Creating egalitarian collaborative teams to provide patient-cen tered care remains a challenge, said Goldblatt. Turf, ignorance, and economics (TIE) all present barriers, despite the benefits that collabora tive, team- based care can provide for patie nts and often can reduce stress for provid- ers. Evidence of the benefits gained from collaborative practic e can help build bridges across disciplines, said Goldblatt, adding that s uccessful teams require respect and trust for all practitioners on a team and a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations each one brings. The importance of collaborative practice in the treatment of pa in and addressing the opioid epidemic mirrors what became evident in t he early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, said Margaret Chesney, professo r of medicine at the University of Ca lifornia, San Francisco. Then, like now, there were dual epidemics\u2014treating patients while at the same t ime stop- ping the spread of the disease\u2014both of which demanded attention to a wide array of medical and social factors, said Chesney. Special ists in in- fectious disease, oncology, dermatology, pulmonology, and other s were called in for their expertise; and psychologists were also need ed to help patients manage the stress of coping with the disease. All prov iders be- came integral parts of the collaborative team, she said. Moreov er, because adherence to the complex and indi vidualized medication regimens was so important to prevent development of drug-resistant virus, patie nts were not only the center of the team, they led the team, said Chesney. I t was \"their adherence to care\" that the team needed to encourage. Wanting t o avoid adding new medications to deal with the side effects of their a ntiviral treat- ment, patients began educating her and other clinicians about s ide effect management, including acupuncture, massage, dietary interventio ns, sup- plements, and other nonpharmacological approaches they ht out. The collaborative team also expa nded to include communities, wh en it be- came clear that providing housing and other resources would als o be neces- sary to stop the epidemic. Anderson added that including social scientists and psychologists on the team can be especially helpful in eluc idating the importance of social de terminants of health.

All rights reserved.58 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT The Department of Defense's (DoD 's) Pain Management Task Force, which was mentioned in Chapter 5, also recognized the importanc e of col- laborative practice, said Chester (Trip) Buckenmaier III, Colon el, U.S. Army (retired) and program director and principal investigator for the Uni- formed Services University of th e Health Sciences Defense and V eterans Center for Integrative Pain Management (DVCIPM) under the Depar tment of Military Emergency Medicine. The ultimate goal of collaborat ive practice, said Buckenmaier, is to enable an individualized process and te am approach that bridges the different treat ment silos. Keeping silos and c onnecting them with the patient at the center of the activity is important, he said, adding that, in the operating room, the silo of anesthesiology is essential. Combating prejudice against what are considered alternative tre atment approaches can interfere with development of collaborative team s, noted John Chae, vice president of research at MetroHealth. Using as an example the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R), he su ggested that prejudice could be overcome with science. PM&R evolved to what is now a more mainstream approach i n part because of the emergence of the biopsychosocial model as well as an embrace of science, he said . How- ever, Kligler noted a tension that exists between pushing for r esearch using conventionally established methods of proof and the use of othe r types of research methodologies. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Inst itute (PCORI), for example, has successfully promoted the use of alte rnative methodologies, he said. Collaborative Practice Models Several models of collaborative practice were presented at the work- shop. Some of these use case studies to discuss various aspects of pain management and treatment of opioid use disorder. Eric Schoomake r sug- gested that to explore management of opioid use disorder, a cas e involving traumatic amputation would be appropriate since wounded warrior s are the most grievously wounded and do not want to be further disab led by opioids. Other models immerse patients in a well-functioning so cial group to leverage the importance of social, cohort, and kinship funct ions in man- aging chronic pain. Daniel Carr, past president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine and professor of public health and community m edicine at Tufts University, suggested that these programs might inadve rtently be providing something akin to family therapy.

All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 59 University of Toronto Interfaculty Pain Curriculum Judy Watt-Watson, professor emeritus at the University of Toron to, described an interfaculty pre licensure pain curriculum8 at the University of Toronto that has been mandatory for students in six training programs since 2002: dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, occupationa l therapy, and physical therapy (Hunter et al., 2008; Watt-Watson et al., 2004). Phy- sician assistants were also recently added, she said. The 20-hour program is completed over 3 days through a combinat ion of online modules, large and small multiprofessional sessions, and concur- rent clinically focused sessions that the students choose. Stud ents are as- signed to an interprofessional group of 30 people that is furth er divided into 10-person interprofessional teams to discuss several patie nt cases and develop appropriate patient-focu sed pain management plans. A fa cilitator on each team guides the team to ensure respect for the role of the different professions in patient care as well as the need for collaborati on and future referrals to colleagues outside o f their own profession, said W att-Watson. Meanwhile, students learn about the relationship between pain a nd the so- cial determinants of health. Watt-Watson noted that an outcome of the curriculum is that man y of the health science departments are now including more pain cont ent in their curricula. As a result, students' baseline knowledge is g reater and overall scores for pain knowledge and beliefs between pre-test and post- test assessments increased by only 7 percent in 2018 as compare d to 17 percent in 2002. Recently, they have conducted curriculum mappi ngs to identify overlaps and gaps, which along with the many other eva luations, allow them to adapt the program in an iterative fashion. They a lso have published a pain interprofessional curriculum decision model to share with other institutions what they have learned through the developme nt and evolution of this program, said Watt-Watson (Watt-Watson et al. , 2017). SHOW/Crossroads Model At the Biomedicine Campus in Phoenix, Arizona, the student-led clinic Student Outreach for We llness (SHOW) has partnered with Cross- roads, the largest substance abuse recovery residential center in the South- west, to provide community-based interprofessional direct care and more information, see http://sites.utoronto.ca/pain/researc h/interfaculty- curriculum.html (acce ssed March 11, 2019).

All rights reserved.60 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT promotion services,9 said S. Liz Harrell, chief medical officer of integrated care at Crossroads and Doctor of Nursing Practice Faculty at th e Arizona State University College of Nursing and Health Innovation. SHOW provides a learning laboratory that uses an interprofessio nal team-based approach to deliver care to vulnerable populations, said Harrell. The program is run by students and guided by interprofessional faculty from 12 different professional programs. Crossroads has been op erating since 1960, originally as a halfway house before transitioning to become a residential substance use treatment program. Their recognitio n of the need for additional primary care services led to the partnershi p with SHOW, said Harrell. The SHOW/Cross roads clinic is expected to o pen in 2019 and will use an interdisciplinary team approach that focus es on ho- listic restoration. Other Innovative Programs to Promote Interprofessional Care Kligler described an exchange program between students from the Al- bert Einstein College of Medicine and the Pacific College of Or iental Med- icine, which gives students the opportunity to learn about each o t h e r ' s practices and how they can be used in a complementary fashion t o improve patient care (Anderson et al., 2012). Kligler also mentioned an acupunc- ture fellowship at Beth Israel in New York that trained license d acupunc- turists to work in inpatient hos pital settings. In interviews c onducted with the acupuncturists, physicians, and nurses, Kligler said he and h i s c o l - leagues found that when nurses and physicians saw the benefits to their patients, they recommended acupuncture even if they did not kno w how it worked. The acupuncturists, meanwhile, felt like outsiders in c onventional health care settings, and had to learn more about how hospitals function, said Kligler. The VA also has some excellent programs in complementary and in - tegrative care, added Kligler. For example, the Empower Veteran s Pro- gram10 brings together social work, chaplaincy, physical therapy, and teachers of mindfulness in a 10-week program for veterans with high im- pact chronic pain. Participation in the program has yielded imp roved pain outcomes, decreased opioid use, and decreased suicidal thinking , said Kligler. 9For more information, see https://showazgeneral.wixsite.com/sho wazclinic (accessed March 11, 2019). 10To learn more about the Empower Veterans Program, see https://w ww.atlanta.va.gov/ services/Empower_Veterans_Program .asp (accessed Fe bruary 6, 201 9).

All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 61 Another innovative program calle d Central City Concern in Portl and, Oregon, addresses the social determinants of physical and menta l illnesses as well as addiction among the homeless through a comprehensive a p - proach that provides naturopaths, acupuncturists, chiropractors , working with a variety of mainstream health care providers while also o ffering housing, job training, and job placement, said Goldblatt. Models have also been developed for sustaining both education a nd care delivery programs after initial grant funding runs out, sa id Harrell. Given that there is no business m odel for care programs, she is in the pro- cess of building such a model th at others can use to replicate. On the edu- cation side, Watt-Watson noted that sharing specific curriculum content can be challenging because of copyrights held by the universiti es where the curricula were developed. Michele Maiers, executive director of research and innovation a t Northwestern Health Sciences Univ ersity, summed up the discussi on by citing the need to customize models of interprofessional and tr ansdiscipli- nary education to the specific needs of the communities served, including the learning communities. Moreover, she said, in planning for t he future it will be important to consider t he next generation of health car e providers. Most of them are millennials who are recognized as being highly collabo- rative with extensive communica tion networks, said Maiers, addi ng that they also want to be part of cr eating new models from the groun d up. Leslie Davidson, chair of the department of clinical research a nd lead- ership at the George Washington University School of Medicine a nd Health Science and an occupational therapist who specializes in traumatic brain injury and neurology, added that pain is not a sensation, but a per- ception which can be described as a complex phenomenon attribut ed to the confluence of ever-shifting internal and external variables . Conse- quently, the treatment of pain is equally complex, with patient s at the cen- ter requiring a collaborative a pproach from practitioners with a range of skills. Davidson said, implementing collaborative prac tice requires practitioners to c on- sider multiple aspects of a patient's pain experience. For exam ple, pain may be particularly debilitating for different reasons dep end- ing on the current circumstances and life stressors of the indi vidual. She cited a recent book titled Not for Long: The Life and Career of the NFL Athlete by Robert W. Turner II, an assi stant professor in her depart-The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.62 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT ment, who described how the lives of professional football play ers are af- fected by years of playing the sport. The pain they experience every day and the functional limitations imposed by the pain, frequently lead to de- pression that may increase thei r sense of pain and hopelessness , said Davidson. Other important consid erations include the roles, pri orities, and the sense of purpose or meaningful activity of the person who e xperiences pain. It is critical for those who participate on their care te am to understand how the person expresses their pain, how pain can be treated to increase their quality of life, and wheth er the pain is acute, sub-acute , or chronic, said Davidson. She added that it is essential that the care tea m understands and explores what situations or activities are most painful, an d the pa- tient's level of readiness to par ticipate in a treatment plan. Davidson said, With this more complete unders tanding of the patient's pain experience a treatment plan can be devised, that may include occupational therapy, physical therapy, sleep hygiene, cogni- tive behavioral therapy (CBT), yoga therapy, nutrition, main- taining and activity journal, intimacy counseling, meditation, and other approaches. Simplification of the pain experience is a surefire way to set up a recipe for treatment failure.

Novel systems and tools have been developed to gather evidence regarding multidimensional aspects of patients' pain, treatment effects, and patient preferences and expectations, which can in - form efforts to revise polic ies (Buckenmaier, Darnall). To change the culture of pain man agement, educational programs should target not only providers, but patients and payers as we ll (Bonakdar, Cowan, Darnall). Flexible policies are needed that allow providers to deliver th e right treatments to the right people, and that equip people to self- manage their pain as much as possible without demonizing the need to receive medical treatment , including opioids when appro - priate (Darnall). Reimbursement reform is needed to address the discordance be- tween evidence-based practices and payment structures, ensure providers have adequate time for a complete pain assessment, an d enable clinicians rather than pay ers to determine optimal treat - ment approaches (Carr, Cowan, Herman). Large health systems such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Kaiser Permanente have successfully implemented complementary nonpharmacologi cal care approaches and can serve as models for other health systems (Goldberg, Lisi). Patients should be at the center of policy decisions (DeBar, Heapy, Kerns). The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.64 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT Profound differences in the cost of opioids versus nonpharmaco- logical care, along with cultural expectations, evidence, and e ase of controlling coverage, are key drivers of coverage disparitie s; health systems and payers are exploring alternative care, cover - age, and reimbursement models to increase the use of nonphar- macological approaches (Alexander, Elton, Ling, Livingston). NOTE: These points were made by the individual speakers identif ied above; they are not intended to reflect a consensus among works hop participants. Chapter 6 discussed efforts to a ddress the problem of inadequat e pain education through the development of interprofessional curricul a. How- ever, inadequate education is but one of many barriers to the d elivery of effective pain care (Kligler et al., 2018). To help lower these barriers and accelerate change toward greater use of nonpharmacological ther apies, policy changes will be needed as well as evide nce to support th ose policy changes, according to Robert Saper, director of integrative med icine in the Department of Family Medicine at Boston Medical Center and asso ciate professor at the Boston Univers ity Schools of Medicine and Publ ic Health. Saper noted that much of the heightened focus on pain managemen t at the policy level has been fueled by the opioid epidemic and its sequelae; for example, policies and regulations that promote medication-a ssisted treatment ensure the availability of detox facilities, and decr ease opioid prescribing. However, he suggested that policies also need to l ook up- stream at pain itself. BARRIERS AND POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NONPHARMACOLOGICAL CARE: PATIENT, CLINICIAN, EDUCATOR, AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES Both barriers and opportunities to implement evidence-based non - pharmacological approaches to pain treatment can be captured by what Saper calls the five As: awaren ess, acceptance, availability, a ccessibility, and affordability. Awareness and acceptance are relevant to all stakeholder groups (e.g., patients, providers , educators, health systems, a nd payers), he said, while availability, accessibility, and affordability a re especially The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.POLICIES TO ADDRESS BARRIERS 65 important to patients, providers, health systems, and payers. W hile work- shop participants focused their comments on nonpharmacological ap- proaches, some of the issues raised and opportunities discussed may be relevant to all pain management. Improving the Understanding of Pain As mentioned in Chapters 2 and 3, an incomplete understanding o f pain hinders the delivery of optimal pain care. To overcome thi s barrier, Daniel Carr said the first step is to recognize pain, particula rly chronic pain, as a disease per se. This would call on the field to rais e its evidence base to be comparable with tho se of other diseases such as canc er and car- diovascular disease, he said. To achieve this, especially in the realm of interventional pain medi- cine, Carr suggested broadening the sources or types of evidenc e and the manner in which data are analy zed and synthesized. He also call ed for balancing procedure-centric gui delines with patient-centric gui delines that stratify and prioritize resources for patients at risk. Guideli nes, regulations, laws, and regulatory policies should respect the diversity of p opulations and the variability of individua ls and should be consistent wit h the Na- tional Pain Strategy and the Federal Pain Research Strategy, he said. Fi- nally, Carr suggested revisiting the Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention (CDC) guidelines to exa mine unintended consequences of their implementation and genera lization (Carr, 2018). Better data are needed, said Be th Darnall, including better phe notyp- ing and data on treatment effect s and patient preferences and e xpectations. She said there is an imperative to invest in the implementation of learning health care systems; for example , the Stanford Collaborative He alth Out- comes Information Registry (CHOIR) provides a platform for prag matic research and for the implementation of scalable, digital behavi oral pain medicine treatments that can be deployed at low or no cost. CHO IR allows providers to track multidimensional aspects of a patient's pain over time, discuss with patients which symp toms have the most impact, and then en- gage them in different dimensions of treatment. For example, Da rnall and her colleagues have developed a perioperative digital behaviora l pain med- icine treatment called My Surgical Success to help patients lea rn how to self-manage pain after surgery. The tools commonly used to assess pain intensity also fail to r epresent patients' experience of pain (Ballantyne and Sullivan, 2015), a dded Chester (Trip) Buckenmaier. Recognizing this, DVICPM developed a Depart ment The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.66 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT of Defense (DoD) Pain Scale, which retains the 0-to-10 numberin g system commonly used, but defines each number with functional language and asks four additional questions to capture the impact of pain on activity, sleep, mood, and stress\u2014aspects of the pain experience that are meaning- ful to patients (Buckenmaier et al., 2013). Buckenmaier said he thinks that by measuring the right factors, t reatments such as acupuncture and mas- sage can actually compete with opioids in terms of effectivenes s. He added that the DoD has also established the Pain Assessment Screening Tools and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR),1 leveraging both the DoD Pain Scale and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Ou tcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments to collect data and help identify best pr actices (Cook et al., 2014). Reforming Education and Changing Culture Education gaps regarding pain assessment and pain management were discussed in Chapter 6. Robert Bonakdar, director of pain manage- ment at the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine, said educa tion reform is needed not only for providers, but for patients and payers a s well. He said culture change is also needed. Bonakdar advocated a nation al educa- tion campaign with clear messaging about the benefits of nonpha rmaco- logical interventions. He suggested supporting this with a nati onal clearinghouse of educational materi als that are evidence based and shown to have a real-world impact, possibly with case studies. The need for changes in pain education was reiterated by Carr a s well as Penney Cowan, founder and chief executive officer of the Ame rican Chronic Pain Association. Cowan called for mandatory education in pain management for all health care providers across the board. Carr suggested flipping the pain curriculum from a bottom-up to a top-down app roach to change the emphasis from nociceptive mechanisms to social deter minants and dimensions of pain (Carr a nd Bradshaw, 2014). Bonakdar adde d that education for providers should also be expanded to include cour ses on nu- trition, prevention, and provider empathy. Darnall said scalable methods need to be developed and applied to improve education for clinicians and patients. By leveraging te chnology, she suggested that some of the solutions discussed earlier coul d be applied 1For more information about PAST OR, see https://www.dvcipm.org/c linical- resources/pain-assessment-scree ning-tool-and-outcomes-registry- pastor (accessed Febru- ary 6, 2019).

All rights reserved.POLICIES TO ADDRESS BARRIERS 67 more broadly to achieve both short- and long-term impacts. Darn all also advocated for dedicated funding to scale up matriculation and p rofessional training to meet patient demand. This might involve cross-insti tutional collaborations as well as community-based professional pain edu cation in- centivized with reimbursement models, she said. Improving Access to Pain Care Through Policy To access a balanced approach to pain management, people with p ain need health care that is patien t-centered and helps them move f rom being a passive patient to an active participant, said Cowan. That me ans includ- ing the patient voice in everything, from bedside to bench or b ench to bed- side. Bonakdar also supported the idea raised earlier of using pain navigators or educators to help patients access optimal care. Darnall added that flexible policies are needed that allow prov iders to deliver the right treatments to the right people, and that equi p people to self-manage their pain as much as possible without demonizing t he need to receive medical treatment, in cluding opioids when appropriat e. Carr agreed, adding that stigmatization and marginalization of patie nts being treated for pain is a significant barrier to care (Carr, 2016). Reforming Reimbursement Policies Discordance between evidence-based best practices and payment structures, such as inadequate coverage for multidisciplinary t herapy in- cluding behavioral therapy and medication-assisted therapy, fur ther hinder delivery of optimal pain care, sa id Carr. Another way that reim bursement policies block optimal care is by not allowing providers adequa te time to do a complete assessment, said Cowan. She called for adequate r eimburse- ment of providers' time to allow for a complete assessment of a person's pain. Cowan also called for changes in prior authorization for many pain management treatments to allow fo r more flexible and targeted t reatment options. Patricia Herman added that costs to patients extend far beyond copays and reimbursement. There are costs to individuals in terms of t aking time off work to visit a practitioner or to receive training for sel f-care, which then needs to be integrated int o daily activities, that need to be considered when revising guidelines, she said. She emphasized that chronic pain is chronic. Some of the course of pain management should be entrus ted to The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.68 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT patients and their providers, sai d Herman, and not prescribed b y payer guidelines that might not match patients' needs. Cowan suggested changes in policies regarding opioid prescribin g that take treatment decisions out of payer's hands and give that aut hority back to providers. She added that if a provider is going to stop opi oid treatment, the tapering protocol should b e designed according to the indiv idual pa- tient's needs. However, if the patient is functioning well and has a good quality of life, opioids may be a long-term part of their compl ete pain man- agement, said Cowan. Implementing Integrative Pain Management Harley Goldberg, retired physician executive at the Northern Ca lifor- nia Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, shared experiences he had when implementing complementar y approaches in a closed health c are system that combines both delivery of and payment for services. Evidence of the efficacy of acupuncture did not drive inclusion of the m odality into the system, he said. Rather, the health care system agreed to i ncorporate complementary approaches when pr esented with usage data showing that a brief acupuncture program of four to six treatments resulted in declined us- age in every single clinical department except for chronic pain . Goldberg added that in a single-payer system like Kaiser, adding clinici ans in one area means subtracting them somewhere else, which complicates t he im- plementation of a new program. In addition, integrating ancilla ry providers and adjunctive treatments into the system presents operational challenges, he said. The solution at Kaiser was to build new programs into existing programs, said Goldberg. For example, mind-body medicine progra ms were built into their very mature patient education program as well as some psychology, behavioral medicine, and primary care modules, he a dded. Anthony Lisi, chiropractic program director for the Veterans He alth Administration, described some of the VA policy and practice in itiatives that have enabled implementation of nonpharmacological painmana ge- ment. In 2001, a law2 was passed requiring the VA to begin including chi- ropractic care as a covered service, and in 2004 a directive wa s issued to start providing chiropractic car e in-house at VA facilities as well as in the community. Use of chiropractic services grew slowly at first, b ut has ac- celerated in recent years. Additionally, in 2014, the VA establ ished the 2Public Law 107-35, the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Ca re Programs Enhancement Act. The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.POLICIES TO ADDRESS BARRIERS 69 Integrative Health Coordinating Ce nter. The Comprehensive Addic tion and Recovery Act of 2016 further mandated expansion within the VA of nonpharmacological approaches, particularly those in the comple mentary and integrative realms, said Lisi. According to Lisi, there are now approximately 170 chiropractor s providing care at 99 VA facilities, and the use of chiropractic care has grown an average of about 18 percent per year since 2005 (Lisi and Brandt, 2016). Within the VA, chiropractic clinics can be implemented i n physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain medicine, or primary care, an d all three models have worked well, although with different dynamics, he s aid. Lisi added that chiropractic users in the VA tend to be younger and more likely to be female, which matches the priority population of Iraq and Afghani- stan veterans who, in comparison with veterans of previous wars , are also younger, more likely to be female, and more likely to have chro nic mus- culoskeletal pain and mental illness as their main complaints. In 2016, the VA Health Services Research & Development Service held a state-of-the-art conference on nonpharmacological approa ches for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Lisi said that among the results of that conference was the recommendation to deliver se veral non- pharmacological approaches for pain widely within the VA, and s pecifi- cally to deliver those therapies early in the course of pain ca re rather than only after other approaches had failed (Kligler et al., 2018). He noted that the recommended approaches\u2014cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), ac- ceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduc tion, physical exercise, tai chi, yoga, acupuncture, manipulation, an d mas- sage\u2014were listed by therapy, not by discipline. In other words, it comes back to putting the patient first as opposed to the provider fi rst, said Lisi. Recently, acupuncture has been offered in the VA, and while pre vi- ously only physicians and chiropractors with acupuncture traini ng were authorized to provide acupuncture therapy, licensed acupuncturi sts were recently approved as well. The VA has partnered with DoD to pro vide battlefield acupuncture training, said Lisi. More than 2,000 VA providers, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, have si nce been trained to perform ear acupuncture, which involves inserting sm all needles at specific points in the ears to relieve pain, said Lisi (Levy et al., 2018). He added that the number of veterans receiving acupuncture incr eased greatly in recent years. In 2014, Lisi and colleagues assessed the implementation of chi roprac- tic care (Lisi et al., 2014). They identified several barriers and some facil- itators, which he said may be applicable to other services. The three main The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.70 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT barriers were negative perceptions by individual physicians, la ck of fund- ing (because the original VA mandate was unfunded), and lack of guid- ance on how to implement the service, said Lisi. Conversely, th e strongest facilitator was having a positive perception of individual phys icians and decision makers. New funding initiatives and central office gui dance have also helped to expand chiropractic care, he said. Interestingly , neither pa- tient preferences nor the degree of evidentiary support was ide ntified as a barrier or facilitator, said Lisi. Along with colleagues at Yale a nd the Pain Research, Informatic s, Multimorbidities and Education (PRIME) Center at the VA Connect icut Healthcare System, Lisi has also examined opioid use among vete rans. They found that the percentage of the population likely to fill an opioid prescription was much lower after a chiropractic visit compared with be- fore the visit (Lisi et al., 2018). Placing Patients at the Center of Policy Decisions Lynn DeBar noted that one cannot discuss quality without some k ind of patient-centered outcome. R obert Kerns added that the experi ence of clinicians in health care system s and organizations is also imp ortant. Wen Chen from the NCCIH commented about the difficulty for patients t o know what to do first. She asked if there is evidence to suppor t recom- mending one approach over anothe r and if not, how researchers m ight de- sign studies to gather this evidence. Alicia Heapy said she bel ieves there are many different ways for patients to improve. The most impor tant thing, she said, is that patients have the opportunity to engage in tr eatments and continue receiving that treatment if they believe it is providi ng benefits. For that to happen, she said, a system is needed that makes it easy for patients to obtain care and for providers to make referrals. Pr oviders need to be educated about the value of providing nonpharmacological treat- ments early, Heapy added. THE PAYER PERSPECTIVE: INSURANCE COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT With public attention focused on both the opioid epidemic and t he care of people in pain, policy makers have the unique opportunity to scrutinize the role coverage and reimbursement policies can play in reduci ng the overuse of opioids and improving quality of care for those in p ain, said The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.POLICIES TO ADDRESS BARRIERS 71 Caleb Alexander, founding co-director of the Center for Drug Sa fety and Effectiveness and associate professor of epidemiology and medic ine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. One of the big gest myths about the opioid epidemic is that there is a conflict bet ween these two goals; however, Alexander sai d there is no conflict. Streng thening coverage, reimbursement, qualit y, and access to nonpharmacologi cal treatments is the place to start, he said. Eight years ago, DoD published a report that concluded there wa s good evidence for the use of many nonpharmacological modalities , espe- cially yoga, massage therapy, mindfulness meditation, and tai c hi for back pain, in contrast to the use of chronic opioids and highly inva sive and po- tentially destructive surgical a pproaches, said Eric Schoomaker (Office of the Army Surgeon General, 2010) . He wondered why coverage of no n- pharmacological treatments is still being debated in some circl es. One rea- son, said Roger Chou, is that for primary care providers, order ing an imaging test or prescribing an o pioid may be easier and take le ss time. He added that even if physicians wa nt to refer their patients to p sychologists, acupuncturists, or other providers of nonpharmacological treatm ents, they may have difficulty finding a provider who will provide the rig ht treatment and take the patient's insuran ce. Moreover, Chou said, there is no system to vet these providers and the paperwork required from Medicaid and other payers may be onerous. Revising Coverage Policies to Improve the Treatment of Pain There are wide disparities among insurers in coverage and adopt ion of nonpharmacological treatments for pain, said Alexander. Profoun d differ- ences in cost are one driver of this disparity, he said. Wherea s a typical course of physical therapy may call for 6 to 12 visits and a $3 0 copay per visit (Heyward et al., 2018), the median cost of a 30-day suppl y of generic opioids is only about $10 (Lin et al., 2018). Costs matter not only to pa- tients, but to policy makers too, said Alexander. In many state s, constraints on Medicaid budgets make it extremely difficult for them to add new ben- efits. He added that there have been mixed data regarding the d egree to which various treatments pay for themselves. A few years ago, Oregon's Health Evidence Review Commission identified a problem in the state's Medicaid coverage for back pain, said Catherine Livingston, associate medical director of the Commiss ion. Back pain was not a funded diagnosis, said Livingston, which essenti ally meant that patients could see their primary care providers and get op ioids, but no The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.72 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT other treatments were covered. Given the evidence supporting th e use of nonpharmacological therapies for back pain, Livingston said the y con- vened a public multidisciplinary task force to develop a new ba ck pain coverage paradigm that includes coverage for all the therapies that have been shown to be effective, including CBT, spinal manipulation, acupunc- ture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nonopioid medicat ions, yoga, interdisciplinary rehabilitation, supervised exercise, and mass age. Recog- nizing the likelihood of implementation barriers, she said they added an \"if available\" caveat to the policy. Simultaneously, they creat ed a guide- line to limit the use of treatments that do not have evidence o f efficacy (e.g., TENS and epidural steroid injections) or that have evide nce of harm, such as opioids.3 They also added a risk stratification component using the STarT Back tool mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4. Livingston said that PCORI and th e National Institute on Drug A buse (NIDA) are studying the impact of this new policy and should ha ve results in a few years. She added that while this was a very expensive change in policy, the Commission believed it was the right thing to do an d imple- mented it. Other challenges raised by this policy include workf orce issues such as licensing and credentiali ng; educating providers, patie nts, and plan medical directors; and implementation issues related to meeting require- ments and tapering opioids, said Livingston. In Chapter 2, David Elton said that when the first point of con tact is a chiropractor or physical therapist, opioid use is markedly redu ced and sug- gested that substantial savings could be realized if physical t herapists and chiropractors replaced primary care providers or specialists as first line providers. He and his colleagues at Optum have shown that for t he treat- ment of back pain, the conserva tive care pathway that begins wi th chiro- practic, physical therapy, or acupuncture is the most aligned w ith prevailing pain treatment guidelines and the least fragmented, yet only 30 percent of patients start on this pathway. Meanwhile, he said, only about 2 percent of specialists or medical physicians refer patients t o conservative (i.e., low-risk and low-cost) care (see Figure 7-1). Elton's group wants to increase the percentage of patients star ting with conservative care to more than 50 percent in the next 2 years a nd at the same time increase the percentage of referrals from physicians to con- servative care to around 10 percen t. Actuaries have estimated t hat this 3For more information, see http s://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/DSI-HE RC/Pages/ Evidence-based-Reports-Blog.aspx?View=%7b2905450B-49B8-4A9B-AF1 7-5E1E03AB 8B6B%7d&SelectedID=197 ( accessed March 12, 2019).

The grap h displays the likelihood of receiving an opioid or imaging study at any time during an episode of back pain based on the specialty of the first pro vider. SOURCE: Presented by David Elton on December 5, 2018. would reduce annual medical expenditures by about $230 million and opi- oid prescribing for back pain by about 25 percent, said Elton. The call to action, he said, is to make this happen now. No more research o r data are needed to support this change, Elton said. One way to help achieve this goal, he said, would be to have ou t-of- pocket costs (i.e., copays and deductibles) for conservative ca re reduced or eliminated. Providing consumers with tools and resources to help them understand available options based on the characteristics of th eir pain and their own personal preferences could help guide them toward cho osing conservative care when appropriate, or more aggressive care whe n needed, he said. Reforming Reimbursement Policies Value-based payment reforms through shared savings or bundling may address another barrier to th e delivery of quality pain car e (i.e., the The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.74 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT concern expressed from clinicians that reimbursement rates are too low), said Julie Fritz. Elton agreed that the rates that are paid to providers of nonpharmacological therapies might not be appropriate for the v alue cre- ated. Bundling payments for multiple visits over weeks or month s is chal- lenging, he said, particularly w hen multiple providers are invo lved and/or subcontractors are used for services. Optum has been developing a value- based bundled payment model, said Elton. Shari Ling, deputy chi ef medi- cal officer for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (C MS), added that the CMS Innovation Center has also developed several bundled payment care initiative models and is exploring other alternati ve payment models as well, although no pain-specific model thus far. One p ossible approach would combine comprehensive primary care with an alter native payment model, she said. DeBar mentioned that there are also ma ny small- scale natural experiments going on at coordinated care organiza tions to examine how services are organized and whether alternative paym ent models might result in better patient outcomes. Bonakdar noted that clinicians a lso must grapple with denial of cov- erage for some nonpharmacological pain therapies such as biofee dback. Elton said the opioid epidemic has forced a lot of innovation a nd rethink- ing about legacy coverage policies for treatments such as biofe edback. To introduce coverage for a new therapy, payers and health systems need to evaluate the science supporting the approach, how it will be co vered, and what the cost will be to cover it, he said. It is a long journe y, but a neces- sary one given the urgent need for new approaches to address th is epi- demic, said Elton. The Importance of Evidence in Coverage Decisions To implement coverage changes, payers need evidence of the effe cts on critical outcomes such as long-term function, opioid use, us e of emer- gency care, and ability to return to work, said Livingston. Evi dence on dose response of nonpharmacological interventions is also impor tant, she added. The importance of evidence was reiterated by Ling. When it come s to coverage determinations for Medi care, one of the major limitati ons has been the absence of evidence from patient samples that reflect the Medi- care beneficiary population, she said. This explains, for examp le, why there is a national noncoverage policy for acupuncture. She ack nowledged, however, that the constraint in enrolling Medicare patients in clinical trials The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.POLICIES TO ADDRESS BARRIERS 75 stems from the Medicare statute. Strategies are needed to integ rate these patients into trials, said Ling. Ling added that as CMS shifts from volume to value in consideri ng how and what services to cover, hav ing a core set of outcomes t hat matter to the people served would be inc redibly helpful. Moreover, she said, the metrics and data collected across care settings (e.g., clinicia ns, practices, health systems, programs, states, the entire country) all need to be stand- ardized and aligned. She noted that this is already taking plac e as a result of the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act).4 Coverage is just the starting point, said Ling, adding that barriers to implementation also need to be identified and addre ssed. Among these are administrative barriers, which are being addres sed in part through the Patients over Paperw ork Initiative, launched by CMS Admin- istrator Seema Verma in October 2017.5 4To 2019). 5To learn more about the Patients Over Paperwork Initiative, see https://www.cms.gov/ About-CMS/story-page/patients-ove r-paperwork.html (accessed Feb ruary 6, 2019).

To make it easier for clinicians to provide nonpharmacological care, models to remove cost and access barriers and provide sup - port for clinicians are being studied (Cherkin). Pilot studies are underway to ev aluate the effectiveness of mul ti- modal treatments, and pragmatic s tudies and big data approaches will also likely be nee ded (Elton, Kligler). Potential next steps include identifying actions that would hav e the greatest impact, developing a strategy to implement those a c- tions, designing a national public education campaign on pain a nd pain management, and engaging with companies moving into the health care field (Anderson, Goldblatt, Schoomaker). NOTE: These points were made by the individual speakers identif ied above; they are not intended to reflect a consensus among works hop participants. Daniel Cherkin suggested in his concluding remarks that the fie ld is in the midst of moving \"from a thousand points of blight to a t housand points of light.\" The points of blight are well recognized, he said, including the tremendous toll of the opioid epidemic, the continued suffe ring of peo- ple in pain despite the availability of treatment approaches th at can relieve suffering, inadequate clinician tr aining, poor understanding of evidence The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.78 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT regarding pain treatment effectiveness, continued focus on a bi omedical rather than biopsychosocial appr oach to treating pain, poor acc ess to ef- fective nonpharmacological care, inadequate coverage of nonphar maco- logical treatments, and a shortage of qualified clinicians to d eliver those treatments. The cost of continued inaction is high, Cherkin said as he shif ted his attention to the thousand points of light. First, he said, reco gnition of the essential role of education has resulted in efforts to improve pain curricula with a focus on team and collaborative care, expand the workfor ce in crit- ical areas, and change licensure and accreditation policies. In addition, models are being developed to remove cost and access barriers a nd provide systems support to make it easier for clinicians to provide non pharmaco- logical care. Finally, many agen cies are increasing research fu nding dedi- cated to improving the management of pain. Cherkin also highlig hted the increasing focus on patients at the center of care management a nd the im- portance of empowering patients and supporting self-management. Eric Schoomaker added that alt hough people in the conventional health care world might see efforts to expand the use of comple mentary and integrative health approaches as an attempt to build an alt ernative uni- verse, in reality the aim is to integrate emerging disruptive t echnologies, some of which are 4,000 years old, into conventional practice. POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR MOVING FORWARD Cherkin predicted that the workshop would imbue participants wi th energy and confidence to take their good work in this area to t he next level, knowing that they can call on other participants for advice, su pport, and collaboration. Anthony Delitto agr eed, adding that workshop par ticipants are already implementing many new ideas in the classroom, clini c, and community. Emerging models are ready for prime time, said Delit to, add- ing that he would like to see si mulations give way to real-worl d studies in community environments. David Elton noted that many innovative pilot studies are underw ay that are driven by employers. For example, some studies evaluat ing virtual reality with biofeedback in the office and at home to control p ain (Gupta et al., 2018). Biometric data collected indicated that particip ants experi- enced better pain control and improved function at very low cos t, he said. Benjamin Kligler commented that pragmatic data and a big data a p- proach will be needed to evaluate some combinations of approach es, such The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.FUTURE DIRECTIONS 79 as cognitive behavioral therapy plus acupuncture plus yoga, bec ause it is unlikely that anyone would conduct a clinical trial to assess e ffectiveness of that combination. Elton said Optum Labs is working in this s pace to bring all stakeholders together with academic and industry rese archers and provide data access to begin answering these kinds of questions . Margaret Chesney added that leveraging datasets in existing studies may also pro- vide a head start in efforts to fill research gaps. Another issue related to understanding the effectiveness of com bined therapeutic approaches was raised by Elizabeth Goldblatt. When people experience difficult chronic pain, they frequently see multiple practition- ers who may or may not be working together as a team. It is vit ally im- portant that health professionals communicate with one another to provide optimal care, she added. Roger Chou said there have been studie s of coor- dinated care models at the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs (VA); although implementing these models outside of VA settings has proven dif ficult. Elton said data from his large network suggests there are pocke ts of inno- vation where diverse providers a re working together in natural networks to provide tightly integrated care. These approaches can be pow erful, he said, but may be challenging to scale up in health systems wher e providers operate in silos. Cherkin suggested convening a task force to identify key action s that would have the biggest, broadest, and quickest impact on removi ng major barriers, and then crafting a strategy to address those issues. Schoomaker agreed, adding that a campaign plan is needed to clearly define lines of efforts and principal tasks. A national campaign should include a substan- tial amount of public education, added Goldblatt. She and Belin da Anderson suggested reaching out and engaging big technology companies th at are moving into the health care field in these efforts. In the closing moments of the workshop, David Shurtleff urged w ork- shop participants to take advantag e of the major programs and i nitiatives already in place to help move these ideas forward.1 1Shortly after this workshop, 30 new funding opportunities aimed at evaluating the full spectrum of strategies for pain management were announced as pa rt of the NIH HEAL Initi- ative.

Giv en the com- plexity and biobehavioral nature of pain, the 2011 Institute of Medicine re- port Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research advocated for multifaceted approaches for pain management composed of bot h pharmacological and nonpharmac olog- ical therapies. In 2017, Academies of Sciences, En gineering, and Medicine's report Pain Management and the Opioid Epidemic: Balanc- ing Societal and Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use reviewed the status of availabl e evidence on nonpharmacological therapies for managing chronic pain. For example, cognitive behavioral th erapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy f ocused on restructuring negativ e thoughts and experiences with positive e xpectations, has been shown to b e effective in reducing pain intensity and other psychological effects caus ed by pain (e.g., anxiety and depression) fo r low back pain, headaches, ar thritis, orofa- cial pain, and fibromyalgia. As a result of this national push toward the use of nonpharmaco logical therapies for chronic pain, incr eased health professional educa tion and train-The Role of Nonpharmacological Approaches to Pain Management: Proceedings of a Workshop Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.92 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO PAIN MANAGEMENT ing will be needed to encourage the adoption and appropriate us e of the ev- idence-based approaches. In addi tion, addressing policy barrier s, such as those related to reimbursement f or these treatments, will be im portant to en- able broader use and dissemination. Given the changing landscap e for pain management, the Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disord ers and the Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional Educa tion will bring together key stakeholders t o discuss these treatments and integrative health models for pain management. Workshop Objectives: Review the current state of ev idence on the effectiveness of no n- pharmacological treatments and integrative health models for pain management as well as ava ilable evidence on use patterns and patient interest. Examples may include acupuncture; manual therapies; physical therapy, occ upational therapy, and exercise ; cognitive behavioral therapy; ta i chi; yoga; meditation; and ne u- rostimulation. Explore the state of evidence on the effectiveness of emerging models of pain management. Consider multimodal approaches and potential synergies be- tween and among pharmacological and nonpharmacological ap- proaches to pain management. Consider multimodal approaches and potential synergies be- tween and among devices and n onpharmacological approaches to pain management. Discuss research gaps and key questions for further research. Examine health professions' cu rrent approaches for educating students, trainees, and practicing clinicians on nonpharmacolog i- cal pain management, and discuss potential next steps to improv e training and education within and across health professions. Explore policies, such as those related to reimbursement that would enable broader dissemination and implementation of eviden ce- based nonpharmacological treatments when appropriate.
