If there is a specific situation, our doctors will advise you. Our medicines are prepared following rigorous methods of manufacturing, adhering to high safety standards.

When properly purified, these are highly effective and even curative for some diseases.

When prepared meticulously, the metals become medicinal and hence will not cause any harm. However, if you do not want to be prescribed medicines which contain metals, you can inform the doctor.
