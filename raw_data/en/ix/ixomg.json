Some of their recommendations remained unchanged from the 2007 guidelines, but others were updated based upon more-recent clinical trials and epidemiolog-ical studies, according to Joshua P . Metlay, MD, of Massachusetts General and colleagues on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society. Among the key recommendations differing from the previous guidelines, the 2019 guide-lines include the following: Sp utum and blood culture samples are recom- mended in patients with severe disease, as wellas in all inpatients empirically treated for methi-cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa .CDC, FDA in hot pursuit of vaping lung injuries' source BY THERESE BORDEN MDedge News The national outbreak of vaping-associated lung injuries is ongoing, and the number of cases and deaths continues to rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention is providing frequent updates of the wide-ranging and aggressive investigation of the cases and deaths linked to vaping, and although a definitive cause remains unknown, evidence is accumulating to implicate tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing devices. The investigation is being conducted in concert with the Food and Drug Administration, state and local health departments, and public health and clinical partners. The acronym EV ALI has been developed by CDC to refer to e-cigarette, or vaping products use-associated lung injury. In a report summa-rizing data up to Oct. 31, CDC reported 1,888 EV ALI cases and 37 deaths. These cases have oc-curred in all U.S. states (except Alaska), the Dis-trict of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

In the event that fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors are the only drug of choice, dosage reductions are recommended. Monitor foradverse reactions and consider discontinuation of ESBRIET as needed [see Dosage and Administration section 2.4 in full Prescribing Information] . Moderate CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of ESBRIET and ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) moderately increases exposure to ESBRIET [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information]. If ciprofloxacin at the dosage of 750 mgtwice daily cannot be avoided, dosage reductions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration section 2.4 in full Prescribing Information]. Monitor patients closely when ciprofloxacin is used at a dosage of 250 mg or 500 mg once daily. Concomitant CYP1A2 and other CYP Inhibitors Agents or combinations of agents that are moderate or strong inhibitors of both CYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism ofESBRIET (i.e., CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1) should be to andavoided during ESBRIET treatment. 7.2 CYP1A2 Inducers The concomitant use of ESBRIET and a CYP1A2 inducer may decrease the exposure of ESBRIET and this may lead to loss of efficacy. Therefore, discontinue use of strong CYP1A2 inducers prior to ESBRIET treatment andavoid the concomitant use ESBRIET and a strong CYP1A2 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information] . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The data with ESBRIET use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform on drug associated risks for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproductionstudies, pirfenidone was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to3 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) inadults [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birthdefects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. DataAnimal DataAnimal reproductive studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryofetal development study, female rats received pirfenidoneat oral doses of 0, 50, 150, 450, and 1000 mg/kg/day from 2 weeks prior tomating, during the mating phase, and throughout the periods of early embryonicdevelopment from gestation days (GD) 0 to 5 and organogenesis from GD 6 to17. In an embryofetal development study, pregnant rabbits received pirfenidoneat oral doses of 0, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day throughout the period oforganogenesis from GD 6 to 18. In these studies, pirfenidone at doses up to3 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) inadults (on mg/m 2 basis at maternal oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in rats and 300 mg/kg/day in rabbits, respectively) revealed no evidence of impairedfertility or harm to the fetus due to pirfenidone. In the presence of maternaltoxicity, acyclic/irregular cycles (e.g., prolonged estrous cycle) were seen in ratsat doses approximately equal to and higher than the MRDD in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at maternal doses of 450 mg/kg/day and higher). In a pre- and post-nataldevelopment study, female rats received pirfenidone at oral doses of 0, 100, 300,and 1000 mg/kg/day from GD 7 to lactation day 20. Prolongation of the gestationperiod, decreased numbers of live newborn, and reduced pup viability and bodyweights were seen in rats at an oral dosage approximately 3 times the MRDD inadults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 1000 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No information is available on the presence of pirfenidone in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug onmilk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes cleardetermination of the risk of ESBRIET to an infant during lactation; therefore, thedevelopmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered alongwith the mother's clinical need for ESBRIET and the potential adverse effectson the breastfed child from ESBRIET or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data A study with radio-labeled pirfenidone in rats has shown that pirfenidone or its metabolites are excreted in milk. There are no data on the presence of pirfenidoneor its metabolites in human milk, the effects of pirfenidone on the breastfed child,or its effects on milk production.8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ESBRIET in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the clinical studies receiving ESBRIET, 714 (67%) were 65 years old and over, while 231 (22%) were 75 years old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed betweenolder and younger patients. No dosage adjustment is required based upon age. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment ESBRIET should be used with caution in patients with mild (Child Pugh Class A) to moderate (Child Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Monitor for adverse reactionsand consider dosage modification or discontinuation of ESBRIET as needed [see Dosage and Administration section 2.3 in full Prescribing Information] . The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ESBRIET have not been studiedin patients with severe hepatic impairment. ESBRIET is not recommended foruse in patients with severe (Child Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information] . 8.7 Renal Impairment ESBRIET should be used with caution in patients with mild (CL cr 50-80 mL/min), moderate (CLcr 30-50 mL/min), 30 mL/min) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information] . Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dosage modification or discontinuation of ESBRIET as needed [see Dosage and Administration section 2.3 in full Prescribing Information] . The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ESBRIET have not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Use of ESBRIETin patients with end-stage renal diseases requiring dialysis is not recommended. 8.8 Smokers Smoking causes decreased exposure to ESBRIET [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information], which may alter the efficacy profileof ESBRIET. Instruct patients to stop smoking prior to treatment with ESBRIETand to avoid smoking when using ESBRIET. 10 OVERDOSAGE There is limited clinical experience with overdosage. Multiple dosages of ESBRIET up to a maximum tolerated dose of 4005 mg per day were administered as five 267 mgcapsules three times daily to healthy adult volunteers over a 12-day dose escalation. In the event of a suspected overdosage, appropriate supportive medical care should be provided, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of theclinical status of the patient. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Liver Enzyme Elevations Advise patients that they may be required to undergo liver function testing periodically. Instruct patients to immediately report any symptoms of a liverproblem (e.g., skin or the white of eyes turn yellow, urine turns dark or brown[tea colored], pain on the right side of stomach, bleed or bruise more easily thannormal, lethargy) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash Advise patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) during use of ESBRIET because of concern for photosensitivity reactions or rash.Instruct patients to use a sunblock and to wear clothing that protects against sunexposure. Instruct patients to report symptoms of photosensitivity reaction orrash to their physician. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations maybe required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Gastrointestinal Events Instruct patients to report symptoms of persistent gastrointestinal effects including nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease,and abdominal pain. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may berequired [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Smokers Encourage patients to stop smoking prior to treatment with ESBRIET and to avoid smoking when using ESBRIET [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information]. Take with Food Instruct patients to take ESBRIET with food to help decrease nausea and dizziness.

These small changes revolved mainly around how much wording to include in the current color block tables versus including the informa-tion in the notes section. Key updates to the schedule in- cluded a change in wording for the definition of the red bars on the table to include \"not recommend- 01_4thr7_CHPH19_11.indd 4 11/6/19 9:28 AM MDEDGE.COM/CHESTPHYSICIAN NOVEMBER or contraindicated\" instead of only the word \"contraindicated. \" Committee members were espe-cially interested in changing this wording to guide clinicians in use of the live attenuated influenza vaccine because of its potential value in vaccinating health care personnel. Other updates include language that vaccination of young adults aged 16-23 years who are not at in-creased risk for meningococcal dis-ease should be vaccinated as follows: \"Based on shared clinical decision making, 2-dose series MenB-4C at least 1 month apart or 2-dose series MenB-FHbp at 0, 6 months. \" Similarly, clinical decision-making language was added to the notes for the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). The routine vaccination calls for only one dose of PPSV23 given on or after the individual's 65th birth-day. Then, based on shared clinical decision making, a dose of PCV13 is recommended for immunocom- petent individuals aged 65 years and older. The notes also state that, based on shared clinical decision making, PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be given in the same visit and, if both will be given, PCV13 should be first and should be given 1 year be-fore PPSV23. In addition, \"PPSV23 should be given at least 5 years after any previous PPSV23 dose. \" The schedule also adds shared clinical decision making to the notes on human papillomavirus vaccina-tion for adults aged 27-45 years. The committee members ac- knowledged the increasing complex-ity of the adult vaccination schedule, but several members agreed that it is accessible to many clinicians. \"We can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good\" said Jason Goldman, MD, liaison representing the American College of Physi-cians. \"Those who want to learn the schedule will learn it; the health sys-tem will learn it, \" even if not every specialist does. The table \"is something to draw you in, \" said Sandra Fryhofer, MD, an internist who is liaison for the American Medical Association. More specific information about contraindications for patients with cochlear implants, which also came up in the discussion, may be added to the schedule at a later date.

Please review the full Prescribing Information prior to prescribing ESBRIET. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ESBRIET is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes and Drug-Induced Liver Injury Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with ESBRIET. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI, including severeliver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. Patients treated with Esbriet2403 mg/day in three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALTor AST 3x ULN than placebo patients (3.7% vs 0.8%, respectively). Elevations10x ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the Esbriet 2403 mg/daygroup and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST3x ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation. Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to the initiation of therapy with ESBRIET, monthly for the first 6 months, every 3 months thereafter,and as clinically indicated. Measure liver function tests promptly in patientswho report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia,right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Dosage modificationor interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)] . 5.2 Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions (9%) compared with patientstreated with placebo (1%). The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurredduring the initial 6 months. Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure tosunlight (including sunlamps), to use a sunblock (SPF 50 or higher), and to wearclothing that protects against sun exposure. Additionally, instruct patients to avoidconcomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity. Dosage reductionor discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction orrash [seeDosage and Administration section 2.3 in full Prescribing Information] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders In the clinical studies, gastrointestinal events of nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain were morefrequently reported by patients in the ESBRIET treatment groups than in thosetaking placebo. Dosage reduction or interruption for gastrointestinal events wasrequired in 18.5% of patients in the 2403 mg/day group, as compared to 5.8%of patients in the placebo group; 2.2% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/daygroup discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal event, as compared to1.0% in the placebo group. The most common (>2%) gastrointestinal events thatled to dosage reduction or interruption were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anddyspepsia. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was highest early in thecourse of treatment (with highest incidence occurring during the initial 3 months)and decreased over time. Dosage modifications may be necessary in some casesof gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration section 2.3 in full Prescribing Information] . 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Liver Enzyme Elevations and Drug-Induced Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Gastrointestinal Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates inthe clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of pirfenidone has been evaluated in more than 1400 subjects with over 170 subjects exposed to pirfenidone for more than 5 years in clinical trials. ESBRIET was studied in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in which a total of 623 patients received 2403 mg/dayof ESBRIET and 624 patients received placebo. Subjects ages ranged from 40 to80 years (mean age of 67 years). Most patients were male (74%) and Caucasian(95%). The mean duration of exposure to ESBRIET was 62 weeks (range: 2 to 118 weeks) in these 3 trials. At the recommended dosage of 2403 mg/day, 14.6% of patients on ESBRIET compared to 9.6% on placebo permanently discontinued treatment becauseof an adverse event. The most common (>1%) adverse reactions leadingto discontinuation were rash and nausea. The most common (>3%) adversereactions leading to dosage reduction or interruption were rash, nausea, diarrhea,and photosensitivity reaction. The most common adverse reactions with an incidence of 10% and more frequent in the ESBRIET than placebo treatment group are listed in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring in 10% of ESBRIET-Treated Patients and More Commonly Than Placebo in Studies 1, 2, and 3 Adverse Reaction% of Patients (0 to 118 Weeks) ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (N = 1 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and stomach discomfort. Adverse reactions occurring in 5 to <10% of ESBRIET-treated patients and more commonly than placebo are (5% vs. 4%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions identified from clinical trials the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pirfenidone. Becausethese reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it isnot always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Agranulocytosis Immune System Disorders Angioedema Hepatobiliary Disorders Drug-induced liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 CYP1A2 Inhibitors Pirfenidone is metabolized primarily (70 to 80%) via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from other CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1. The concomitant administration of ESBRIET and fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., enoxacin) is not recommended because it significantlyincreases exposure to ESBRIET [see Clinical Pharmacology section 12.3 in full Prescribing Information] . Use of fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors should be discontinued prior to administration of ESBRIET and avoided duringESBRIET\u00ae (pirfenidone)S:7.0625\"S:9.875\"T:8\"T:10.75\" ESBR19HSNY8061_M2_BS_Update_PP_fof.indd 8-6-2019 4:02 PM / Client Live Overall TrimBleed ColorsESB/100115/0470(3) Genentech 7.0625\" x CMYKColors Black Fonts Univers LT Std (47 Light Condensed, 47 Light Condensed Oblique, 67 Bold Condensed), Minion Pro (Regular)Job info Fonts & Colors Images Saved can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, \" said Jason Goldman, MD, liaison representing the ACP . \"Those who want to learn the schedule will learn it. \" 01_4thr7_CHPH19_11.indd 5 11/6/19 9:28 AM 6 \u007f NOVEMBER 2019 \u007f CHEST PHYSICIAN AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CHEST PHYSICIANS (CHEST) EDITOR IN CHIEF David A.

The updated guidelines include recommendations dealing with the management of patients with co-morbidities, and were published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. \" A difference between this guide- line and previous ones is that we have significantly increased the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for mi-crobiologic studies. This decision is largely based on a desire to cor-rect the overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy that has occurred since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than high-quality evidence, \" the authors concluded. They \"expect our move against endorsing monotherapy with macrolides, which is based on population resistance data rather than high-quality clinical studies, will generate future outcomes studies comparing different treatment strat-egies. \" Authors reported relationships with pharmaceutical companies; full disclosures are detailed at the end of the guidelines publication. mlesney@mdedge.com SOURCE: Metlay JP et al.

VIEW ON THE NEWS From IDWeek 2019: \"Ever since we wrote the first CAP [com- munity-acquired pneumonia] guidelines in 1993, we've heard good and bad things, and I agree with both,\" Michael S. Nieder-man, MD, FCCP, said in a presentation at IDWeek 2019. \"For good or for bad, [guidelines] are a standard against which care can be evaluated.\" He discussed how, as guidelines have become more evidence based, they have often become \"more wishy washy,\" that when the evidence is weak, the recommendation is weak, and the guidelines merely advise doctors: \"You figure it out.\" However, he pointed out that, since CAP guidelines were devel- oped, there have been overall improvements in patient care and antibiotic stewardship. But he saw several weaknesses in the new guidelines, including the fact that they did not update minor crite-ria for determining severe CAP from the 2007 guidelines, despite several studies indicating that there were other criteria to con-sider. The updated guidelines held a negative view of the use of serum procalcitonin to guide site-of-care decisions, which Dr. Nie-derman argued went against an analysis of the Etiology of Pneu-monia in the Community (EPIC) study.

With data available for more than 867 patients with EV ALI, about 86% had a history of using e-cigarette or vaping products that contained THC in the previous 90 days; 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products, and 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products; 52% reported use of both. In a telebriefing on Oct. 25, Anne Schuchat, MD, CDC prin-cipal deputy director, said, \"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products as the source of the vast majority of in-dividuals' lung injury. There are continuing cases that do not report that history. But I' d like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or the way that the devices are producing harm. \" EVALI deaths Among the 29 deaths reported as of Oct. 15, 59% (17) were male. The median age was 45 years (range, 17-75 years), 55 years (range, 17-71 years) among males, and 43years (range, 27-75 years) amongfemales; the age difference betweenmales and females was not statisti-cally significant. Patients who diedtended to be older than patientswho survived. Among 19 EV ALIpatients who died and for whomdata on substance use were avail-able, the use of any THC-containingproducts was reported by patientsor proxies for 84% (16), including63% (12) who exclusively usedTHC-containing Use ofany nicotine-containing productswas reported for 37% (7), (3) used nic-otine-containing products. Use ofboth THC- and nicotine-containingproducts was reported in four ofthose who died. Investigation update Mitch Zeller, JD, director, Center for Tobacco Products at the Food and Drug Administration, participated in the telebriefing and provided an up-date on the ongoing investigation. He said, \"FDA has received or collected over 900 samples from 25 states to date. Those numbers continue to in-crease. The samples [were] collected directly from consumers, hospitals, and from state offices include vaping devices and products that contain liquid as well as packaging and some nearly empty containers. \" He also noted that the self-reports of THC and/or nicotine use could mean that there are misreported data, because reports in many cases are coming from teens and from jurisdictions in which THC is not legal (see related story on 15). Dr. Schuchat noted, \"We are aware of older cases that look similar to what we are seeing now. But we do not believe that this outbreak or surge in cases is due to better recog-nition. \" She suggested that unknown substances may have been intro-duced into the supply chain. A \"handful\" of cases of read- mission have been reported, and the CDC is currently investigating whether these cases included patients who took up vaping again or had some other possible contributing factor. Dr. Schuchat cautioned recov-ering patients not to resume vaping because of the risk of readmission and the probability that their lungs remain in a weakened state. Clinical guidance update The CDC provided detailed interim clinical guidance on evaluating and caring for patients with EV ALI. The recommendations focus on patient history, lab testing, criteria for hos-pitalization, and follow-up for these patients. Obtaining a detailed history of patients presenting with suspected EV ALI is especially important for this patient population, given the many unknowns surrounding this condition, according to the CDC. The updated guidance states, \" All health care providers evaluating patients for EV ALI should ask about the use of e-cigarette or vaping products, and ideally should ask about types of substances used (e.g., THC, cannabis [oil, dabs], nicotine, modified products or the addition of substances not intended by the manufacturer); product source, specific product brand and name; duration and frequency of use, time of last use; product delivery system and method of use (aerosolization, dabbing, or dripping). \" The ap-proach recommended for soliciting accurate information is \"empathetic, nonjudgmental\" and, the guidelines say, patients should be questioned in private regarding sensitive informa-tion to ensure confidentiality. A respiratory virus panel is rec- ommended for all suspected EV ALI patients, although at this time, these tests cannot be used to distinguish EV ALI from infectious etiologies. All patients should be considered for urine toxicology testing, includ-ing testing for THC. Imaging guidance for suspected EV ALI patients includes chest x-ray, with additional CT scan when the x-ray result does not correlate withclinical findings or to evaluate se-vere or worsening disease. Recommended criteria for hospi- talization of patients with suspect-ed EV ALI are those patients with decreased O 2 saturation (less than 95%) on room air, in respiratory distress, or with comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. As of Oct. 8, 96% of patients with sus-pected EV ALI reported to the CDC have been hospitalized. As for medical treatment of these patients, corticosteroids have been found to be helpful. The statement noted, \" Among 140 cases reported na-tionally to CDC that received cortico-steroids, 82% of patients improved. \" The natural progression of this injury is not known, however, and it is possible that patients might recover without corticosteroids. Given the unknown etiology of the disease and \"because the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, aggressive empiric therapy with corticoste-roids, antimicrobial, and antiviral therapy might be warranted for pa-tients with severe illness. A range of corticosteroid doses, durations, and taper plans might be considered on a case-by-case basis. \" The report concluded with a strong recommendation that pa-tients hospitalized with EV ALI are followed closely with a visit 1-2 weeks after discharge and again with additional testing 1-2 months later. Health care providers are also advised to consult medical specialists, in particular pulmo-nologists, who can offer further evaluation, recommend empiric treatment, and review indications for bronchoscopy. Coding guidance CDC has issued coding guidance to help track EV ALI. The document was posted on the CDC website. The following conditions associated with EV ALI are covered in the new cod-ing guidance: Br onchitis and pneumonitis caused chemical pneu-monitis; J68.0. Pn eumonitis pneumonitis; J84.114. The document notes that the coding guidance has been approved by the National Center for Health Statistics, the American Health In-formation Management Association, the American Hospital Association, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The search continues Mr. Zeller cautioned that this inves-tigation will not be concluded in the near future. He noted, \"We are com-mitted to working to [solve the mys-tery] just as quickly as we can, but we also recognize that it will likely take some time. Importantly, the diversity of the patients and the products or substances they have reported using and the samples being tested may mean ultimately that there are multi-ple causes of these injuries. \" tborden@mdedge.com Richard Franki and Gregory Twacht-man contributed to this story.NEWS THC identified as probable culprit in vaping injuries, but investigation continues // continued from page 1 vchal/Getty Images 01_4thr7_CHPH19_11.indd 7 11/6/19 9:28 AMIntroduction With a recent renaissance in cancer diagnostics and treatment, there is renewed promise for many who pre-viously held little hope. Lung cancer represents the second most frequently diagnosed cancer, a close second to breast cancer, at 12.9% of expected new cancer cases in 2019. 1 However, the 23.5% death rate predicted for lung cancer outranks breast, prostate, colorectal, and skin melanomas com-bined. 1 Five-year lung cancer survival rates have increased from 11% in 1975 to more than 20% in 2016. 1 This relatively low rate of survival can probably be explained by the fact that the majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease (Stage III, disease metastatic to mediastinal or supraclavicular nodes) or advanced disease (Stage IV, disease metastatic to other organs). 2-4 Recent advance- ments in treatment are proving effec-tive in improving patient outcomes 5,6; combined with adherence to screening recommendations and immediate re-ferral to appropriate specialists, earlier diagnosis and staging can help lead to improved outcomes. 7-9 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes 80% to 85% lung cancer diagnoses, including histological identi-fication adenocarcinoma, cell, to 30% of patients with NSCLC are diag-nosed with locally advanced or Stage III disease. 12 A proportion of these patients may experience the curative benefits of combined chemotherapy and surgery or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5,13 About 40% of patients with NSCLC are diagnosed with Stage IV disease, and the treatment goal in these patients is to manage symptoms, im-prove quality of life, and extend surviv-al. 13,14 Treatment options include sys- temic chemotherapy, targeted mutation therapies, radiation, immunotherapy, and on occasion surgery. 7 It is vital that we increase early diagnosis, accurate staging, and referral to the appropriate specialists in lung cancer to ensure that treatment is optimized and more lives are potentially saved. 7 Screening and Diagnosis Unlike with breast, prostate, and col-orectal cancers, systematic screening for lung cancer is not a well-established population-based practice, and its role is not fully grasped by primary caregivers. 15 Risk factors such as history of tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke are common knowledge, but other environmental exposures (diesel smoke, pollution, and other cancer-causing agents) are difficult to quantify. 16,17 Populations with lifestyles with higher exposure to these factors are generally more reticent to intervention and skeptical of the benefits of treatment, while others may be concerned that radiation-based screening techniques contribute to the risk. 15 In addition to patient percep- tions that defer intervention, present-ing symptoms of cough and dyspnea are frequently confounded with other respiratory conditions, creating a delay in early detection and staging. 9 Even further delays have been seen when patients present with more generalized symptoms like fatigue or bone or joint pain. 9 Based on the National Lung Screen- ing Trial (NLST),18 the American Col- lege of Chest Physicians (ACCP) has published recommendations that low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) scans be performed annually on patients meeting the following cri-teria: (1) 30 pack-year current smoker or former smoker between the ages of 55 and 74 years, (2) former smokers who have quit within the past 15 years, and (3) no comorbidities that potentially preclude curative treatment benefit. 15 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network \u00ae (NCCN\u00ae) also encourages patients to seek yearly screening if they are 50 years or older, have a 20 or more pack-year smoking history, and have other known risk factors besides sec-ond-hand smoke exposure, such as ra-don exposure. 19 Screening with LDCT, in select patients at high risk for lung cancer, decreased the relative risk of death from lung cancer by 20% when compared with chest radiography. 18 As such, efforts are being made to educate general practitioners and the public about this tremendous benefit. 15,19,20 The goal of screening is to identify a lung cancer in the earliest possible stage, which, as Table 1 demon- strates, directly improves survivabili-ty. 19 However, imaging alone does not provide accurate staging, and once lung cancer is suspected, time is of the essence in ensuring no further progres-sion. Various target time recommenda-tions have been published advocating for improved wait times across the care spectrum, ranging from 30 to 52 days of median wait time from diagnosis to first treatment. 23,24 Yet one Canadian study showed that despite the rec-ommended time of 2 weeks between symptom onset and diagnosis, the ac-tual median time to diagnosis was 4.5 months. 9 It has been estimated that ev- ery 4 weeks between scans represents the potential for a 13% progression. 25 Kasymjanova et al describe 2 studies and a meta-analysis demonstrating that increased wait times impart a negative effect on recurrence and survival. 23 In their own study, it was noted that re-duced wait times particularly benefited Stage III NSCLC survival. 23 Because pulmonologists may be the first specialist a patient sees, they are relied upon to diagnose, stage, and co-ordinate care for many patients with lung cancer. 26 Because Stage III NSCLC is a curative intent setting,13,27 it is of par- ticular importance to coordinate more complicated surgical, radiation, and chemotherapy care for these patients as soon as the diagnosis and stage have been ascertained. 7 While initial chest computed tomography or positron emission tomography (PET) scans often determine tumor size(s) and location(s), and presence of hilar or mediastinal nodes and extrathoracic lesions (ex-cluding the brain), these studies cannot be the sole factors used in staging, and they falsely overstage 19% of the time and understage 13% of the time. 28 The ACCP guidelines recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain for patients with clinical Stage III or IV disease with or without symptoms of intracranial disease, 29 whereas NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines In Oncology (NCCN Guidelines \u00ae) recommend staging brain MRI in patients with clinical Stage IB (optional), IIA/B, IIIA/B/C and IV. 30 Diagnostic procedures to obtain accu- rate histological diagnosis and staging and adequate tissue samples for molec-ular testing must be considered, ideally with input from a multidisciplinary team (MDT) composed of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, and radiology spe-cialists who are board certified and have expertise in thoracic oncology whenever any stage of NSCLC is suspected. 30 PET imaging can be used to identify the optimal biopsy site that produces the highest yield, is minimally invasive, and is most likely to confer the highest stag-ing. 30 Whenever possible, procedures should be combined (bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound with needle aspiration of lymph nodes) to improve time to diagnosis and clinical staging. 30 Invasive mediastinal staging is recom-mended before surgical resection. 30 The organization of lung cancer care requires development of a multidisciplinary pro-gram committed but not limited to the expeditious coordination of the patient's care among various disciplines to avoid unnecessary tests and procedures, delay in care, costly care, and patient frustration and anxiety. 31 Multidisci- plinary care has been shown to decrease time to diagnosis and improve referral for appropriate treatment. 32 In particular, patients with Stage III NSCLC are more /uni25CF /uni25CF /uni25CF This article is sponsored by AstraZeneca.

Optimal treatment duration for immune check-point inhibitors requires further study, and their use in patients with autoim-mune disorders and a past organ trans-plantation should be avoided. 38References 1.

Accurate diagnosis and staging are critical, par-ticularly in the differentiation between Stage III, which is treated with curative intent, and Stage IV, which is meta-static. CRT is the current standard of care for unresectable Stage III disease and has shown improvement in overall survival, while the introduction of immu-notherapy following CRT treatment can be discussed as a treatment option. To reap the benefits of these advances in treatment, patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer should be managed by an MDT that includes a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, and medical and radiation oncologists, and referral for appropriate treatment of Stage III and IV NSCLC is crucial to improving patient outcomes.SPONSORED ARTICLE SPONSORED ARTICLE 09_CHPH.indd 1 9/26/2019 3:02:55 PM10 NOVEMBER 2019 CHEST PHYSICIANPULMONOLOGY Dupilumab in severe chronic rhinosinusitus BY TED BOSWORTH MDedge News MADRID - In adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitus with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), the monoclonal antibody dupilumab is effective for shrinking the polyps, improving symptoms, and reducing the need for systemic corticosteroids and surgery, according to results of two phase 3 studies reported together at the annual congress of the European Respiratory Society. \"Dupilumab improved all of the disease components, and the im-provement was observed in most of them at the first assessment, \" report-ed Jorge F. M\u00e1spero, MD, research director, Fundacion Cidea, Buenos Aires. The data were drawn from multi- center phase 3 trials called LIBER-TY NP SINUS-24 and LIBERTY NP SINUS-52. Both included stratifica-tions for asthma and for NSAID-ex-acerbated respiratory disease (ERD), which are common comorbidities. Findings of the two studies were published together just prior to Dr. M\u00e1spero's presentation at the ERS (Lancet. 2019 Sep 26. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736[19]31881-1). For the coprimary end point of endoscopic nasal polyp score (NSP), the reductions were 2.06 and 1.8 at 24 weeks from baseline (both P less than .0001) in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52, respectively. For the na-sal congestion or obstruction score, another primary end point, the re-ductions were 0.89 and 0.87, respec-tively (both P less than .0001). There were also major improve- ments at week 24 on secondary end points, including the Lund-McKay CT score for staging of CRSwNP (P less than .0001), total symptom score (P less than .0001), the UPSIT test for smell (P less than .0001), and SNOT-22 (P less than .0001), a quality of life instrument specific for nasal and sinus diseases. When these outcomes were graphed, curves for the dupilumab and placebo arms had already separat-ed by 4 weeks, \"and then we see the dupilumab patients keep getting better over the course of follow-up, and the effect was seen regardless of comor-bidities, \" said Dr. M\u00e1spero, referring to concomitant asthma or ERD. The SINUS-24 trial randomly assigned 276 CRSwNP patients to 300 mg dupilumab or placebo, each given subcutaneously every 2 weeks. The SINUS-52 trial, which random-ized 448 patients, included the same two arms plus a third arm in which patients also received 300 mg dup-ilumab every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and then 300 mg every month for an additional 26 weeks. In a pooled analysis of these trials, patients randomized to dupilumab had a 78% reduction in likelihood of receiving systemic corticosteroids and a 79% reduction in being re-ferred for surgery relative to place-bo, Dr. M\u00e1spero reported. Dupilumab, a monoclonal an- tibody that inhibits the activity of interleukin-4, IL-5, and IL-13, was well tolerated. Among the most common adverse events, there were lower rates of headache (9% vs. 7%), in the dupilumab and placebo arms, respectively, but the rate of serious adverse events (6% vs. 3%) and ad-verse events leading to treatment discontinuation (5% vs. 3%) were only slightly higher in the active- treatment group. Both trials, which required a bi- lateral baseline NPS score of 5.0 for entry, recruited a population with relatively severe CRSwNP , according to Dr. M\u00e1spero. Of the 724 patients, 204 had ERD. A restored sense of smell was one of the contributors to an improve-ment in quality of life. \"The sense of smell improves very quickly after starting dupilumab. Patients reported results within 2 weeks, and there was an almost complete lack of improvement in the placebo group, \" Dr. M\u00e1spero reported. Dupilumab is already indicated for the treatment of CRSwNP , but this study confirms a major effect on pol-yp size, sinus congestion, and symp-toms irrespective of the presence of common comorbidities affecting the airways, Dr. M\u00e1spero said. Dr. Maspero reports no potential conflicts of interest. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Bachert C et al. Lancet. 2019 Sep 26. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31881-1. Dr. Jorge F. M\u00e1spero Ted Bosworth/MDedge News In-hospital flu shot curbed readmissions in patients with CAP BY ANDREW D. BOWSER MDedge News FROM CHEST 2019 n NEW ORLEANS - In-hos- pital flu shots were rare, yet linked to a lower readmission rate for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia in a recent ret-rospective study, suggesting a \"missed opportu-nity\" to improve outcomes for these patients, an investigator said. Less than 2% of patients admitted for com- munity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) received in-hospital influenza vaccination, yet receiving it was linked to a 20% reduction in readmis-sions, according to investigator Kam Sing Ho, MD, a resident at Mount Sinai St. Luke's, New Yor k . Those patients who were readmitted had a sig- nificantly higher death rate vs. index admissions, Dr. Ho said in a poster discussion session at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians. \"I know (vaccines) are pretty much pushed out to the outpatient setting, but given what we showed here in this abstract, I think there's a role for influenza vaccines to be a discussion in the hospital, \" Dr. Ho said in his presentation. The retrospective analysis was based on 825,906 adult hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of CAP in data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Of that large cohort, just 14,047 (1.91%) received in-hospital influenza vaccination, according to Dr. Ho. In-hospital influenza vaccination inde- pendently predicted a lower risk of readmission (hazard ratio, 0.821; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.98; P less than .02) in a propensity score - matching analysis that included 9,777 CAPpatients who received the vaccination and 9,777with similar demographic and clinical charac-teristics. Private insurance and high-income status also predicted lower risk of readmission in the anal-ysis, while by contrast, factors associated with higher risk of readmission included advanced age, Medicare insurance, and respiratory failure, among other factors, Dr. Ho reported.The overall 30-day rate of readmission in the study was 11.9%, and of those readmissions, the great majority (about 80%) were due to pneumo-nia, he said. The rate of death in the hospital was 2.96% for CAP patients who were readmitted, versus 1.11% for the index admissions (P less than .001), Dr. Ho reported. Moreover, readmissions were asso-ciated with nearly half a million hospital days, $1 billion in costs, and $3.67 billion in charges. Based on these findings, Dr. Ho and colleagues hope to incorporate routine influenza vaccination for all adults hospitalized with CAP . \"We're always under pressure to do so much for patients that we can't comprehensively do every-thing. But the 20% reduction in the risk of com-ing back, I think that's significant, \" Dr. Ho said in an interview.

BOWSER MDedge News FROM CHEST 2019 n NEW ORLEANS - A history of recent exacerba- tions did not significantly affectthe safety or efficacy of aclidiniumbromide (Tudorza) in patientswith moderate to severe chronicobstructive pulmonary disease andhigh cardiovascular risk, analysis ofa postmarketing surveillance Regardless of exacerbation his- tory, the long-acting muscarinic antagonist reduced the rate of moderate or severe COPD exac-erbations versus placebo in this subgroup analysis of the phase IV ASCENT-COPD trial, presented here at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physi-cians. At the same time, there were no significant increases in the risk of mortality or major adverse cardiac events (MACE) for those patients who had an exacerbation in the past year versus those who did not, according to investigator Robert A. Wise, MD.Those findings may be reassuring, given that COPD patients common-ly have comorbidities and cardio-vascular risk factors, according to Dr. Wise, professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University, Bal-timore. \"There's a concern and some evidence that patients who have a propensity to COPD exacerbations may also have an increased risk for cardiovascular events, \" Dr. Wise said in a podium presentation. Accordingly, he and coinvestiga-tors sought to tease out the impact of COPD exacerbations on safety as well as efficacy in the randomized, placebo-controlled ASCENT-COPD trial, which included 3,630 patients with moderate to severe COPD plus a cardiovascular disease history or multiple atherothrombotic risk fac-tors. Of the patients who were analyzed in the study, 1,433 patients had at least one treated COPD exacerba-tion in the year before screening for the study, while 2,156 had no exac-erbations in the prior year, Dr. Wise said. Top-line results of that study, published several months ago, showed that aclidinium did not increase MACE risk over 3 years, and reduced the rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations over the first year (JAMA. 2019 7 May 7;321[17]:1693-701). In this latest analysis, presented at the meeting, risk of MACE with acli-dinium treatment was not increased versus placebo, irrespective of wheth-er they had exacerbations in the prior year (interaction P = .233); like- wise, the risk of all-cause mortality was similar between groups (P = .154). In terms of reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in the first year, aclidinium was supe-rior to placebo both for the patients who had at least one exacerbation in the prior year (rate ratio, 0.80) and those who had no exacerbations in the prior year (RR, 0.69). \"This translates into a number needed to treat to prevent one ex-acerbation of about 11 patients for those without an exacerbation, com-pared to about 6 patients for those with a prior exacerbation, \" Dr. Wise said in his presentation. The ASCENT-COPD study was funded initially by Forest Labo-ratories and later by AstraZeneca and Circassia. Dr. Wise provided related to Abstract doi: 10.1016/j.chest.2019.08.231. PULMONOLOGY Recent COPD exacerbation did not affect aclidinium's efficacy in high-risk patients Race mismatch may affect survival in lung transplant setting BY ANDREW D. BOWSER MDedge News FROM CHEST 2019 n NEW ORLEANS - Race compatibility is a factor that can affect survival and needs to be considered when matching lung transplant candidates to potential donors, results from a large retrospective analysis suggest. Specifically, whites had significantly worse sur- vival when receiving lungs from African Ameri-can donors in this registry analysis, according to study investigator Alexis Kofi Okoh, MD. By contrast, donor-to-recipient race com- patibility (DRRC) did not affect posttransplant survival among African American or Hispanic patients, said Dr. Okoh, who is with the lung transplant division at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, N.J. While race mismatch has been shown to affect outcomes in kidney, heart, and liver transplant settings, the data for DRRC in lung transplant pri-or to this analysis generally have been limited to small, single-center studies, according to Dr. Okoh. \"If you do have the option, [race compatibility] should highly be considered, because it clearly has an impact on outcomes, \" Dr. Okoh said in an interview here at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians. Considering the race of both donor and recip-ient is especially important now that the lung transplant population is becoming more ethnically diverse, he added. The study was based on an analysis of 19,504 lung transplant recipients in the prospectively maintained United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database during 2006-2018. In that cohort, 16,485 recipients were white, 1,787 were Af-rican American, and 1,232 were Hispanic. Race-matched donor organs were used in two-thirds (66.2%) of white recipients, about one-quarter (26.8%) of African American recip-ients, and one-third (33.0%) of Hispanic recipi-ents. Overall, survival post-lung transplant was sig- nificantly poorer among recipients who did not receive a race-matched organ in Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Dr. Okoh said that this effect was diminished after they adjusted for patient baseline characteristics (P = 0.2809). For African American recipients, the unad- justed and adjusted survival estimates were no different regardless of donor race, and likewise, there were no apparent survival differenc-es between Hispanic recipients who received race matched or mismatched organs. Survival among white re- cipients, however, was sig-nificantly affected by race of the recipient, with decreased survival estimates noted even after adjustment for patient characteristics, according to Dr. Okoh's presentation. Results of regression analysis showed that white recipient/African American donor was the only race mismatch to significantly affect survival, Dr. Okoh said in the interview. The posttransplant survival hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) reported by Dr. Okoh with a no race mismatch serving as reference were 1.15 (1.08-1.23) for whites with African American donors, and 1.09 (1.01-1.18) for Whites with Hispanic donors. Dr. Okoh and coinvestigators reported no rele- vant conflicts in relation to their study. SOURCE: Okoh AK et al. CHEST 2019 Abstract doi: 10.1016/j.chest.2019.08.220. Dr. Robert A. Wise Andrew D.

Approval for Trikafta was based on results from two clinical trials in patients with cystic fibrosis with an 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 403 patients, the mean percent predicted forced expirato-ry volume in 1 second increased by 14% from baseline, compared with placebo. In the second trial, a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of 107 patients, mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec-ond was increased 10% from base-line, compared with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, according to the FDA press release. In the first trial, patients who re- ceived Trikafta also saw improve-ment in sweat chloride, reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations, and reduction of body mass index, compared with placebo. The most common adverse events associated with Trikafta during the trials were headaches, upper respiratory tract infections, abdominal pains, diarrhea, rashes, and rhinorrhea, among others. The label includes a warning relat-ed to elevated liver function tests, use at the same time with products that induce or inhibit a liver en-zyme called cytochrome P450 3A4, and cataract risk. \" At the FDA, we're consistently looking for ways to help speed the development of new therapies for complex diseases, while maintain-ing our high standards of review.

CHEST Congress 2020 Italy will be chaired by William F. Kelly, MD, FCCP Girolamo Pelaia, MD, FCCP Register at congress.chestnet.orgBY TED BOSWORTH MDedge News MADRID - In patients with fibrosing lung diseases other than reduced the rate of de-cline in lung function, according to findings from a phase 3, placebo -controlled trial presented at theannual congress of the EuropeanRespiratory Society. The trial, called INBUILD, en- rolled patients who had a progres-sive lung disease with a fibrosing phenotype, such as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features or noninterstitial pneu-monia, on the premise that these conditions might share a patholo-gy responsive to a common ther-apy, explained Kevin R. Flaherty, MD, of National Jewish Health, Denver. The INBUILD trial was a randomized, double-blind, pla-cebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted at 153 sites in 15 countries. A total of 663 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of nin-tedanib (332) or placebo (331). Patients with fibrosing lung dis- ease affecting more than 10% of lung volume were randomized to 150 mg twice daily of nintedanib, which inhibits intracellular growth factors implicated in fibrosis and is PULMONOLOGY TKI preserved lung function in patients with fibrosing pulmonary disease already indicated for IPF, or match- ing placebo. On the primary endpoint of change in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 52 weeks, those in the nintedanib arm lost lung function at a rate that was less than half that of those randomized to placebo (-80.8 vs. -187.8 mL/year; P less than .001). In a preplanned stratification, the protection from nintedanib against a decline in lung function was found to be at least as good in those with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP-like) pattern of fibrosis on baseline imaging (-82.9 vs. -211.1 mL/year), compared -154.2 mL/year). The UIP-like subgroup represented of those enrolled. \"The relative protection from de- cline in lung function supports the hypothesis that progressive fibros-ing interstitial lung diseases have a similar pathobiologic mechanism, \" said Dr. Flaherty. Results from the INBUILD were published simulta-neously with his ERS presentation (N Engl J Med. 2019 Sep 29. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1908681). The curves documenting change of lung function in favor of nin-tedanib relative to placebo separated within 12 weeks of treatment ini-tiation, according to Dr. Flaherty. The ERS-invited discussant, Martin Kolb, MD, PhD, professor of respi-rology, McMaster University, Ham-ilton, Ont., called the reductions in loss of lung function \"profound\" and \"very impactful. \" However, despite these reduc- tions, there was no significant difference in quality of life as measured with the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD) questionnaire, which was a sec-ondary outcome. The problem was that there was little change in KBILD in either group at 52 weeks, limiting the ability to show differences. The rates of death were numeri- cally lower at 52 weeks in the nin-tedanib arm for the study overall (4.8% vs. 5.1%) and for the UIP-like subgroup (5.3% vs. 7.8%), but the differences did not reach statistical significance. A suggestion of benefit was de- rived from a design feature of IN-BUILD that called for patients to remain on blinded therapy until all enrolled patients completed the trial. When the effect of nintedan-ib was evaluated in this extended analysis, the event curves for the combined endpoint of interstitial lung disease or death separated and approached significance. In this extended analysis, which Continued on following page VIEW ON THE NEWS Eric Gartman, MD, FCCP, comments: One of the most noticeable continuing voids in pulmonary medicine is the lack of effective therapy for some patients with non-IPF interstitial lung disease. The morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions often mirror those of IPF, and anything that potentially could improve patients' lives and outlook would be highly welcomed. This study of nintedanib provides exciting data suggesting its effectiveness in reducing the rate of lung function decline in these conditions - with reductions similar to those demonstrat-ed in IPF patients. Similar to the initial IPF studies, this study failed to show a statistically significant decline in mortality ver-sus placebo - although they report a trend that with extended use this may show significance, and further study is needed in this regard. Finally, it is notable that approximately 20% of patients discontinued the drug due to side effects (mostly GI) - which may limit its use somewhat but also may suggest aneven larger-than-mean effect in patients able to tolerate it longterm.\"The relative protection from decline in lung function supports the hypothesis that progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases have a similar pathobiologic mechanism. \" Dr. Kevin R Flaherty Ted Bosworth/MDedge News 10_12thr15_CHPH19_11.indd 14 11/6/19 9:31 AMMDEDGE.COM/CHESTPHYSICIAN \u007f NOVEMBER 2019 \u007f 15PULMONOLOGY New guideline conditionally recommends long-term home NIV for patients with COPD BY STEVE CIMINO MDedge News Long-term home noninvasive ventilation (LTH-NIV) has conditional value for patients with chronic hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to a new guideline from a European Respiratory Society task force. \"Our recommendations, based on the best available evidence, can guide the management of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD patients aimed at improving patient outcomes, \" wrote Begum Ergan, MD, of Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey, and coauthors. The guideline was published in the European Respiratory Journal. To provide insight into the clinical application of LTH-NIV , the European Respiratory Society convened a task force of 20 clinicians, methodol-ogists, and experts. Their four recommendations were developed based on the GRADE (Grading, Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.The first recommendation was to use LTH- NIV for patients with chronic stable hypercap-nic COPD. Though an analysis of randomized, controlled trials showed little effect on mortality or hospitalizations, pooled analyses showed that NIV may decrease dyspnea scores (standardized mean difference, -0.51; 95% confidence interval, -0.06 to -0.95) and life (SMD, 0.49; 95% -0.01 to 0.98). The second was to use LTH-NIV in patients with COPD following a life-threatening episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring acute NIV , if hypercapnia persists. Though it was not associated with a reduction in mortality (risk ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.67-1.25), it was found to potentially reduce exacerbations (SMD, 0.19; 95% CI, -0.40 to 0.01) and hospitalizations 95% CI, 0.30-1.24). The third was to titrate LTH-NIV to normalize or reduce PaCO 2 levels in patients with COPD. While this recommendation was issued with a very low certainty of evidence, it was driven by the \"minimal potential harms of targeted PaCO 2reduction. \"The fourth was to use fixed pressure support mode as first-choice ventilator mode in pa-tients with COPD using LTH-NIV . The six tri-als on this subject did not provide insight into long-term outcomes, nor were there significant improvements seen in health-related quality of life, sleep quality, or exercise tolerance. As such, it was also issued with a very low certain-ty of evidence. The authors acknowledged all four recommen- dations as weak and conditional, \"due to limita-tions in the certainty of the available evidence. \" As such, they noted that their recommendations \"require consideration of individual preferences, resource considerations, technical expertise, and clinical circumstances prior to implementation in clinical practice. \" The authors reported numerous disclosures, including receiving grants and personal fees from various medical supply companies. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Ergan B et al.

More patients in the nintedanib group discontinued therapy because of adverse events (19.6% vs. 10.3%), but Dr. Flaherty characterized the rate of serious adverse events as \"similar. \" He made this statement even though several adverse events, particularly those involving the gas-trointestinal tract, such as diarrhea (66.9% vs. 23.9%), nausea (28.9% vs. 9.4%), vomiting (18.4% vs. 5.1%), and abdominal pain (10.2% vs. 2.4%), were higher in the nintedanib arm. The INBUILD trial demonstrates that nintedanib preserves lung func-tion in fibrosing lung diseases other than IPF. In his review of this paper, Dr. Kolb pointed out that non-IPF etiologies represent about 75% of interstitial lung diseases. For these patients \"we have no drugs, so there is a big medical need. \" Dr. Flaherty reports no potential conflicts of interest. The study was funded by Boehringer-Ingelheim, which produces nintedanib. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Flaherty KR et al.

Butt, MD, of the University of Texas South-western Medical Center, Dallas, and associates. Dr. Butt and associates per- formed a review of lung biopsies from 17 patients (13 men; median age, 35 years) with a history of vaping and either suspected or confirmed vaping-associated lung injury. All cases showed patterns of acute lung injury, including acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse al-veolar damage, or organizing pneu-monia, the authors noted in a letter to the editor published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While no histologic findings were specific, foamy macrophages and pneumocyte vacuolization were seen in all cases, the authors added. Pigmented macrophages were occasionally present but not dominant, neutrophils were of-ten prominent, eosinophils were rare, and granulomas were not seen. Two patients eventually died, despite treatment with glucocor-ticoids and maximum supportive care. \"None of our cases showed histo- logic evidence of exogenous lipoid pneumonia and no radiologic evi-dence thereof has been found; this calls into question the diagnostic utility of identifying lipid-laden macrophages or performing oil red O staining on bronchioloalveolar lavage fluid as a marker of vaping-as-sociated lung injury, as has been pro-posed, \" Dr. Butt and associates wrote. No conflicts of interest were re- ported. lfranki@mdedge.com SOURCE: Butt YM et al. N Engl Oct 2. doi: 10.1056/NE-JMc1913069.

The safety andefcacy of ANORO ELLIPTA in asthma have not been established.4 CONTRAINDICATIONSThe use of ANORO ELLIPTA is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or who havedemonstrated hypersensitivity to umeclidinium, vilanterol, or any of the excipients Warnings and Precautions(5.6), Description (11) of full Use of a long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) without an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is contraindicated in patients with asthma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS5.1 Serious efcacy of patients with asthma have not been established.ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Contraindications (4)].Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death.Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk ofasthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These ndings are considered a class effectof LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in xed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials donot show a signicant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death)compared with ICS alone.A 28-week, placebo-controlled, US trial comparing the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each addedto usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 placebo; relative [95% CI: 1.25,15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including vilanterol, one ofthe active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA.No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with ANOROELLIPTA has been conducted.Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD.5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute EpisodesANORO ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodesof COPD. ANORO ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD. The initiation of ANOROELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate.ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for thetreatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. ANORO ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acutesymptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with aninhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonist. When beginning treatment with ANORO ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-actingbeta 2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing ANOROELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If ANOROELLIPTA no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a reevaluation of the patient and the COPD treatmentregimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dose of ANORO ELLIPTA beyond the recommendeddose is not appropriate in this situation.5.3 Excessive Use of ANORO ELLIPTA and Use with Other Long-acting Beta 2-agonists ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or inconjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically signicant cardiovasculareffects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.Patients using ANORO ELLIPTA should not use salmeterol, formoterolfumarate, arformoterol tartrate, Cytochrome P450 3A4 InhibitorsCaution should be exercised (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) of fullprescribing information].5.5 Paradoxical BronchospasmAs bronchospasm, which may bronchospasm dosing with ANORO with short-acting bronchodilator; ANORO ELLIPTA should immediately;and alternative instituted.5.6 Hypersensitivity ReactionsHypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, afteradministration of ANORO ELLIPTA. Discontinue ANORO ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have beenreports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powdermedications containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use ANOROELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Cardiovascular EffectsVilanterol, like other beta 2-agonists, can produce a clinically signicant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or symptoms [seeClinical Pharmacology (12.2) of full prescribing information]. If such effects occur, ANORO ELLIPTA mayneed to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographicchanges, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression,although the clinical signicance of these ndings is unknown. Fatalities have been reported in associationwith excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.Therefore, ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronaryinsufciency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.In a 52-week trial of subjects with COPD, the exposure-adjusted rates for any on-treatment major adverse cardiacevent, including non-fatal central nervous system acute adjudicated fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (n = 2,070). Adjudicated on-treatment deaths due to cardiovascularevents occurred in 20 of 4,151 patients (0.54 per 100 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol, 27 4,134 patients (0.78 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and like all medicines should be used with caution in patientswith convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.Doses of the related beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.5.9 Worsening of Narrow-Angle GlaucomaANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patientsshould also be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurredvision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema).Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develop.5.10 Worsening of Urinary RetentionANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should bealert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difculty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patientswith prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediatelyif any of these signs or symptoms develop.5.11 Hypokalemia and HyperglycemiaBeta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce signicant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly throughintracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serumpotassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medicines may produce transienthyperglycemia in some patients.In 4 clinical trials of 6-month duration evaluating ANORO ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD, there was no evidence of atreatment effect on serum glucose or potassium.6 ADVERSE REACTIONSThe following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections:\u007f Serious asthma-related events-hospitalizations, intubations, death. LABA, such as vilanterol of the active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA), as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma increase the risk of asthma-related events. ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\u007f Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\u007f Cardiovascular and Precautions (5.7)]\u007f Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]\u007f Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinicaltrials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect therates observed in practice.The clinical program for ANORO ELLIPTA included 8,138 subjects with COPD in four 6-month lung function trials,one 12-month long-term safety study, and 9 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,124 subjects have receivedat least 1 dose of ANORO ELLIPTA (umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 and dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol (125 mcg/25 mcg). The safety data described below are based on the four6-month and two 12-month trials. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in theconrmatory trials.6-Month TrialsThe incidence of adverse reactions associated with ANORO ELLIPTA in Table 1 is based on four 6-month trials:2 placebo-controlled trials (Trial 1, NCT #01313650 and Trial 2, NCT #01313637); N = 1,532 and N = 1,489,respectively) and 2 active-controlled trials (Trial 3, NCT #01316900 and Trial 4, NCT #01316913); N = 843 andN = 869, respectively). Of the 4,733 subjects, 68% were male and 84% were white. They had a mean age of 63years and an average smoking history of 45 pack-years, with 50% identied as current smokers. At screening, themean postbronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) was 48% (range: to 76%), ratio was 0.47 (range: 0.13 to 0.78), and the mean percent reversibility was 14% (range: -45% to 109%).Subjects received 1 1.

She was a coinvestigator in a prospective study of the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP longitudinal birth cohort in which 1,398 women completed the Ba-sic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire and the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at about gestational week 32 and again around 3 months following delivery. Postnatal depressiveness as defined by a CES-D score of at least 10 points was present in 10.3% of the mothers. After adjusting for prenatal depressiveness and other potential confounders, the investigators found that tiredness during the day, poor general sleep quality, getting less than 6 hours of sleep, taking longer than 20 minutes to fall asleep, and sleep loss of 2 hours or more per night during pregnancy were each associated with clinically significant postnatal depressive symptoms, with odds ratios of 1.87-2.19. The full details of the study have been pub- lished (Arch Womens Ment Health. 2019 Jun;22[3]:327-37).The impetus for this study of sleep problems in pregnancy as a predictor of postnatal depressive symptoms was a body of evidence linking insom-nia to depression in both men and women. But it turns out that insomnia is a significant predictor of later onset of a wide variety of psychiatric dis-orders, not only depression, as highlighted in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis con-ducted by an international team of investigators, Dr. Paunio observed. Baseline insomnia symptoms were associated with a 183% increased risk of later onset of de-pression, a 223% increased risk of anxiety, a 35% greater risk of alcohol abuse, and a 28% increased risk of psychosis. However, the insomnia/psy-chosis link must be viewed as tentative, as it was examined in only a single published study. The investigators rated the overall risk of bias in the studies included in their meta-analysis as moder-ate (Sleep Med Rev. 2019 Feb;43:96-105). For Dr. Paunio, these findings suggest that interventional studies of early and effective treat-ment of insomnia as a potential means of pre-venting psychiatric disorders are in order.

For a study published in the Jour- nal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, Tori R. Van Dyk, PhD, of Loma Linda(Calif.) University, and colleagues,enrolled 376 adolescents aged 11-18years (mean age 14.5, 55% female)diagnosed with primary insom-nia and referred to a sleep clinic.Subjects were evaluated using twovalidated questionnaires used tomeasure sleep disorders in adoles-cents, while caregivers reported andmental health diagnoses and symp-toms using a standard behavioralchecklist for adolescents. Dr. Van Dyk and colleagues found that 75% of subjects had at least one or more parent-report-ed mental health diagnosis, most commonly anxiety, mood disor-ders, and ADHD. Some 64% had a clinical elevation of mental health symptoms on evaluation, most com-monly affective disorders, with 40% of the cohort having two or more elevations. Specific mental health symptoms were seen linked with particular sleep symptoms. A great-er burden of ADHD symptoms, for example, was significantly associated with more difficulties falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and reinitiating sleep after waking at night. A total of 15% of subjects were reported by caregivers to engage in deliberate self-harming behav-iors or talking about or attempting suicide - a higher rate than in the general adolescent population. \"Be-cause youth presenting for insomnia treatment may be even more likely to engage in self-harm behavior or to be suicidal, particular attention should be paid to directly assessing for these high-risk behaviors within the context of behavioral sleep med-icine evaluations, \" Dr. Van Dyk and colleagues wrote in their analysis. Although mental health symptoms have been linked to sleep problems in other studies of children and adults, \"associations identified in younger youths and/or adults should not be assumed to hold true among adoles-cents, \" the researchers wrote, adding that adolescence \"is a distinctive developmental period characterized by increases in both psychopathol-ogy and sleep problems, changing biology, increasing independence, and unique social and societal de-mands. \" The investigators noted that because pediatric sleep specialists are relatively rare, the management of adolescent sleep problems and related mental health symptoms is likely to fall on primary care and oth-er providers who \"would benefit in recognizing the relationship between sleep problems and mental health symptoms in this population. \" Dr. Van Dyk and colleagues not- ed among the weaknesses of their study its cross-sectional design, use of parent-reported mental health symptoms only, lack of information on medication use or mental health treatment, and the potential for selection bias toward more severe cases. The authors disclosed no outside funding or conflicts of interest relat-ed to their study. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Van Dyk TR et al.

Children with EoE also were found to have a high prevalence of atopic diseases, including al-lergic rhinitis and eczema - findings that could be driving the breathing problems, said Dr. Siri-wat, a neurology fellow at the Cleveland Clinic, and coauthors. The retrospective study comprised 81 children with a diagnosis of EoE who were referred to sleep clinics. In this group, 46 of the children had active EoE (having gastrointestinal symptoms, including feeding difficulties, dysphagia, reflux, nausea/vomiting, or epigastric pain at presenta-tion). The other 35 had an EoE diagnosis but no symptoms on presentation and were categorized as having inactive EoE. Most were male (71.6%) and white (92.5%). The mean age in the cohort was 10 years and the mean body mass index for all subjects was 22 kg/m 2. A control group of 192 children without an EoE diagnosis who had overnight polysomnography were included in the analysis. Allergic-type comorbidities were common among those with active EoE, rhinitis (55.5%), food allergy (39.5%), and In addition, a quarter had atten-tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 22% an autism spectrum disorder, 21% a neurological disease, and 29% a psychiatric disorder. Several sleep complaints were common in the entire EoE cohort, including snoring (76.5 %), restless sleep (66.6%), legs jerking or leg discom-fort (43.2%), and daytime sleepiness (58%). All children underwent an overnight polysom- nography. Compared with controls, the children with EoE had significantly higher non-REM2 sleep, significantly lower non-REM3 sleep, lower REM, increased periodic leg movement disorder, and increased arousal index. \"Of note, we found a much higher percentage of [periodic leg movement disorder] in active EoE compared to inactive EoE, \" the authors said. The most common sleep diagnosis for the chil-dren with EoE was sleepd disordered breathing. Of 62 children with EoE and sleep disordered breathing, 37% had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Two patients had central sleep apnea and five had nocturnal hypoventilation. Children with EoE also reported parasomnia Of the 59 children with leg movement, 20 had periodic limb movement disorder and 5 were diagnosed with restless leg syndrome. Two were diagnosed with narcolepsy and three with hyper-somnia. Four children had a circadian rhythm disorder. \"Notably, the majority of children with EoE had symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, and more than one-third of total subjects were diag-nosed with OSA, \" the authors noted. \"However, most of them were mild-moderate OSA. It should be noted that the prevalence of OSA in the pe-diatric population is 1%-5% mostly between the ages of 2-8 years, while the mean age of our subjects was 10 years old. The high prevalence of mild-moderate OSA in the EoE population might be explained by the relationship between EoE and atopic disease. \" Dr. Siriwat had no financial disclosures.

In addition, the risk of hospital- ization because of respiratory events for patients with chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD) was greater when opioid and benzodiazepine medications were combined, compared with patients who did not take either medication, Jacques G. Baillargeon, PhD, of the department of preventive medicine and community health at the Uni-versity of Texas, Galveston, and col-leagues wrote. \"Patients with COPD and their physicians should judiciously assess the risks and benefits of opioids and benzodiazepines, alone and in combination, and preferentially rec-ommend nonopioid and nonbenzo-diazepine approaches for pain, sleep, and anxiety management in patients with COPD, \" the investigators wrote. The researchers performed a case-control study of 3,232 Medicare beneficiary cases of COPD patients who were aged at least 66 years. Patients were included if they expe-rienced a hospitalization related to a COPD-related adverse event with a respiratory diagnosis in 2014 and then matched to one or two control patients (total, 6,247 patients) based on age at hospitalization, gender, COPD medication, COPD com-plexity, obstructive sleep apnea, and socioeconomic status. COPD com-plexity was assigned to three levels (low, moderate, high) and calculated using the patient's comorbid respira-tory conditions and associated med-ical procedures in the 12 months prior to their hospitalization. They found that, in the 30 days before COPD-related hospitaliza-tion, use of opioids was associated with greater likelihood of hospital-ization (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-1.97), When pa-tients used both opioids and benzo-diazepines, they had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization, com-pared with patients who did not use opioids or benzodiazepines (aOR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.94-2.77). In the 60 days prior to hospi- talization, there was also a greater likelihood of hospitalization among COPD patients who CI, 1.93-2.67); at 90 days, this high-er risk of hospitalization persisted among COPD 95% CI, 1.88-2.59). The researchers acknowledged that one potential limitation in the study was how COPD diagnoses were obtained through coding per-formed by clinicians instead of from laboratory testing. Confounding by COPD indication and severity; use of over-the-counter medication or opioids and benzodiazepines re-ceived illegally; and lack of analyses of potential confounders such as diet, alcohol use, smoking status and herbal supplement use were other limitations.

This finding from what is be- lieved to be the largest-ever study of infective endocarditis following TAVR will come as a surprise to many physicians. It's easy to mis-takenly assume the risk of this feared complication is lower - and perhaps even negligible - in TAVR patients since the procedure doesn't involve a significant surgi-cal wound, it's briefer, the hospital length of stay is shorter, and recov-ery time is markedly less than with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Not so, Laurent Fauchier, MD, PhD, said in presenting the study findings at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology. \"Do not think there is a lower risk of infective endocarditis. Be aware, be careful, and provide ap-propriate antibiotic prophylaxis, just as surgeons do in SAVR. Don't think, as I did, that with TAVR with no pacemaker implantation there is no risk of infective endocarditis. The TAVR valve is a device, it's a prosthesis, and the risk is very similar to that of surgery, \" advised Dr. Fauchier, a cardiologist at Fran- cois Rabelais University in Tours, France. He presented a study of all of the nearly 108,000 patients who underwent isolated TAVR or SAVR in France during 2010-2018. The data source was the French national administrative hospital discharge record system. Since the TAVR pa-tients were overall markedly older and sicker than the SAVR patients, especially during the first years of the study, he and his coinvestiga-tors performed propensity score matching using 30 variables, which enabled them to narrow the field of inquiry down to a carefully selected CARDIOLOGY TAVR, SAVR share same infective endocarditis risk G. Hossein the im-plantation. Anemia atrialfibrillation as in the hallmarks of higher comor-bidity index. The study spansover 8 years and it is not clearwhether the incidence rate ofinfection was different betweenthe first half of the study vsthe latter half. The message,however, is clear: meticuloussurgical similar to SAVR patients. Dr. Laurent Fauchier Bruce Jancin/MDedge News Continued on following page News PARIS - Beta-blocking drugs were as effective for improving survival in patients with moderately severe re-nal dysfunction as they were in pa-tients with normal renal function in a meta-analysis of more than 13,000 patients, a finding that seemed to solidify the role for this drug class for essentially all similar heart fail-ure patients, regardless of their renal function. This evidence could reshape usual care because \"renal impairment is often considered a barrier in clinical practice\" for starting a beta-blocker drug in patients with heart fail-ure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), Dipak Kotecha, MBChB, said at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology. \"We have shown with sufficient sample size that beta-blockers are effective in reducing mortality in patients with HFrEF and in sinus rhythm, even in those with an eGFR [estimated glomerular filtration rate] said Dr. a cardiologist at the University of Birmingham (En-gland). \"The results suggest that re-nal impairment should not obstruct the prescription and maintenance of beta-blockers in patients with HFrEF. \" \"This important study was a novel attempt to look at [HFrEF] patients with renal insufficiency to see whether they received the same benefit from beta-blockers as other patients, and they did. So renal in- sufficiency is not a reason to with-hold beta-block-ers\" from these patients, com-mented Mariell Jessup, MD, a heart failure physician and chief science and medical officer for the Amer- ican Heart Association in Dallas. \"The onus is on clinicians to find a reason not to give a beta-blocker to a patient with HFrEF because they are generally well tolerated and they can have enormous benefit, as we saw in this study, \" she said in a video interview. The analysis run by Dr. Kotecha and associates used data collected in 11 of the pivotal randomized, con-trolled trials run for beta-blockers during the 1990s and early 2000s, with each study comparing bucind-olol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metopro-lol XL, or nebivolol against placebo. The studies collectively enrolled 18,637 patients, which the investiga-tors whittled down in their analysis to 17,433 after excluding patients with a left ventricular ejection frac-CARDIOLOGY Beta-blockers safe for HFrEF with renal dysfunction tion below 50% or who were undoc-umented. The subgroup with HFrEF included 13,861 patients in sinus rhythm at entry, 2,879 with atrial fibrillation, and 693 with an un-known atrial status. The main anal-ysis ran in the 13,861 patients with HFrEF and in sinus rhythm; 14% of this cohort had an eGFR of 30-44 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 an eGFR of 45-59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The median age of all patients in the main analysis was 65 years, 23% were women, and their median left ventricular ejection fraction was 27%. During follow-up of about 3 years, the impact of beta-blocker treatment on survival, compared with placebo, was \"substantial\" for all strata of pa-tients by renal function, except for those with eGFRs below 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. (Survival was similar regardless of beta-blocker treatment in the small number of patients with severe renal dysfunction.) The num-ber needed to treat to prevent one death in patients with an eGFR of 30-44 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 was 21, the same as among patients with aneGFR of 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or more, Dr. Kotecha said.Among the subgroup of patients with atrial fibrillation, beta-block-ers appeared to exert no survival benefit, compared with placebo. The investigators did not assess the survival benefits exerted by any individual beta-blocker, compared with the others, and Dr. Kotecha stressed that \"my belief is that this is a class effect\" and is roughly similar across all the beta-blockers used in the studies. The analysis also showed good safety and tolerability of the beta-blockers in patients with renal dysfunction. The incidence of adverse events leading to treat-ment termination was very similar in the beta-blocker and placebo arms, and more than three-quar-ters of patients in each of the two subgroups with renal dysfunction were maintained on more than 50% of their target beta-blocker dosage.

Dr. Jessup had no disclosures. mzoler@mdedge.com study population of 16,291 TAVR patients and an equal number of closely similar SAVR patients. A total of 1,070 cases of infective endocarditis occurred during a mean follow-up of just over 2 years. The rate of hospital admission for this complication was 1.89% per year in the TAVR group and similar at 1.71% per year in the SAVR co-hort. Of note, all-cause mortality in TAVR patients who developed in-fective endocarditis was 1.32-fold greater than it was in SAVR patients with infective endocarditis, a statis-tically significant difference. The ex-planation for the increased mortality risk in the TAVR group probably has to do at least in part with an inability on the part of the investi-gators to fully capture and control for the TAVR group's greater frailty, according to the cardiologist. Risk factors for infective en- docarditis shared in common by TAVR and SAVR patients included male gender, a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and a greater frailty index. The main predictors unique to the TAVR pa-tients were atrial fibrillation, ane-mia, and tricuspid regurgitation. And although pacemaker and de-fibrillator implantation were risk factors for infective endocarditis in the SAVR patients, it wasn't predictive of increased risk in the TAVR population. Dr. Fauchier called this finding \"quite reassur-ing\" given that roughly 20% of the TAVR group received a pacemaker. The causative microorganisms for infective endocarditis were essential-ly the same in the TAVR and SAVR groups, simplifying antimicrobial prophylaxis decision making. Dr. Fauchier reported having no financial conflicts regarding the study, conducted free of commercial support.

Comprehensive Bronchoscopy With Endobronchial Ultrasound 20-22 REGISTER TODAY ZOLER MDedge News PARIS - The 2019 dyslipidemia management guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology set an LDL cholesterol target for very-high-risk people of less than 55 mg/dL (as well as at least a 50% cut from baseline), a class I recommen-dation. This marks the first time a cardiology society has either recom-mended a target goal for this mea-sure below 70 mg/dL or endorsed treating patients to still-lower cho-lesterol once their level was already under 70 mg/dL. The guidelines went further by suggesting consideration of an even lower treatment target for LDL cho-lesterol in very-high-risk, second-ary-prevention patients who have already had at least two atheroscle-rotic cardiovascular disease events during the past 2 years, a setting that could justify an LDL cholesterol goal of less than 40 mg/dL (along with a cut from baseline of at least 50%), a class IIb recommendation that denotes a \"may be considered\" endorsement. \"In all the trials, lower was better. There was no lower level of LDL cholesterol that's been studied that was not better\" for patient out-comes, Colin Baigent, BMBCH, said while presenting the new guideline at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardi-ology. \"It's very clear\" that the full treatment benefit from lowering LDL cholesterol extends to getting very-high-risk patients below these levels, said Dr. Baigent, professor of cardiology at Oxford (England) University and one of three chairs of the ESC's dyslipidemia guide-line-writing panel. While this change was seen as a notably aggressive goal and too fixed on a specific number by at least one author of the 2018 Amer-ican Heart Association/American College of Cardiology cholesterol management guideline (J Am Coll Cardiol. 2019 Jun;73[24]:e285-350), it was embraced by another U.S. expert not involved in writing the most recent U.S. recommendations. \" A goal for LDL cholesterol of less than 55 mg/dL is reasonable; it's well documented\" by trial evidence \"and I support it, \" said Robert H. Eckel, MD, an endocri-nologist and professor of medicine at the University of Colorado in Aurora. Dr. Eckel added that he \"also supports\" an LDL cholesterol of less than 40 mg/dL in very-high-risk patients with a history of multiple events or with multiple residual risk factors, and he said he has applied this lower LDL cholesterol goal in his practice for selected patients. But Dr. Eckel acknowledged in an interview that the evidence for it was less clear-cut than was the evidence behind a goal of less than 55 mg/dL. He also supported the concept of in-cluding a treatment goal in U.S. lipid recommendations, which in recent versions has been missing. \"I fall back on a cholesterol goal for practical purposes\" of making the success of cholesterol-lowering treatment easier to track. The new ESC goal was character- ized as \"arbitrary\" by Neil J. Stone, MD, vice-chair of the panel that wrote the 2018 AHA/ACC guideline, which relied on treating secondary -prevention patients at high risk toan LDL cholesterol at least 50% lessthan before treatment, and recom-mended continued intensification forpatients whose LDL cholesterol levelremained at or above 70 mg/dL. \"If the patient is at 58 mg/dL, I'm not sure anyone can tell me what the difference is, \" compared with reach-ing less than 55 mg/dL, Dr. Stone said in an interview. \"I worry about focusing on a number and not on the concept that people at the very highest risk deserve the most inten-sive treatment; the Europeans agree, but they have a different way of looking at it. Despite this difference in approach, the new ESC guide-lines and the 2018 U.S. guideline \"are more similar than different, \" stressed Dr. Stone, professor of med-icine and preventive medicine at Northwestern University, Chicago. However, other experts see an im- portant difference in the risk faced by patients who reach the ESC's recommended treatment goals and those who fall just short. \"It's hard to lower an LDL cho- lesterol that is already relatively low. People who are close to their cholesterol target need the most intensified treatment\" to reach their goal, said Rory Collins, FMedSci, professor of epidemiology at Oxford University. He was not on the ESC guidelines panel. \"It's a mind shift that clinicians need to be most aggressive in treat-ing patients with the highest risk\" even when their LDL cholesterol is low but not yet at the target level, Dr. Collins said during a discussion session at the congress. The new ESC guidelines is about \"both getting the LDL choles-terol down to a certain level and also about achieving a big [at least 50%] change\" from baseline. \"I think the ESC guidelines make that crystal clear, \" said Marc S. Sabatine, MD, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, and the sole American to participate in the ESC guidelines-writing panel. The ESC also broke new ground by advocating an aggressive path toward achieving these LDL cho-lesterol goals by elevating the newest and most potent class of approved LDL cholesterol-lower-ing drugs, the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type a top-tier, I rec-ommendation (\"is recommended\") for secondary prevention in very-high-risk patients not reaching their goal LDL cholesterol level on a maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe. This recommendation to unequivocally add a PCSK9 in-hibitor for this patient population contrasts with the 2018 AHA/ACC guideline that deemed adding a PCSK9 inhibitor a IIa (\"is reasonable\"). A treatment ag- gressiveness appeared in the ESC's recommendations for managing very-high-risk patients in a pri-mary prevention setting, including those without familial hypercho-lesterolemia. For these people, the ESC panel, which worked in concert with the European Athero-sclerosis Society, pegged adding a PCSK9 inhibitor as a IIb (\"may be considered\") recommendation when these very-high-risk people fail to reach their LDL cholesterol target on a maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe. Once again, this opening to use a PCSK9 inhibitor contrasted with the 2018 U.S. guideline, which never mentioned an option of adding a PCSK9 inhibitor for primary pre-vention except when someone also has familial hypercholesterolemia and starts treatment with an LDL level of at least 190 mg/dL (a IIb recommendation). The new Euro-pean guidelines proposed using a PCSK9 inhibitor as a second-line option to consider when needed for people whose very high risk derives primarily from older age and other factors such as smoking or hypertension that give them at least a 10% 10-year risk for cardio-vascular death as estimated with the European-oriented SCORE risk calculator tables. Updated SCORE risk designa- tions appear in the new ESC dyslip-idemia guidelines, and they show, for example, that in lower-risk Eu-ropean countries (mostly Western European nations) virtually all men who are at least 70 years old would fall into the very-high-risk category that makes them potential candi-dates for treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor regardless of any other risk they may or may not have. In higher-risk (mostly Eastern Euro-pean) countries this designation kicks in for most men once they reach the age of 65. Several Congress attendees who came to a discussion session on the guidelines voiced concerns that the new revision will lead to substantially increased use of the these drugs and hence will significantly boost medical costs, because these drugs today are priced at about $6,000 annually to treat one patient. In response, mem-bers of the guideline-writing panel defended their decision as unavoid-able given what's been reported on the clinical impact of PCSK9 inhibi-tors when lowering LDL cholesterol and cutting atherosclerotic cardiovas-cular disease events.

BOWSER MDedge News FROM CHEST 2019 n NEW ORLEANS - The use of a next-generation g enomic test may enable improved management of patients with pul- monary nodules when results ofbronchoscopy are inconclusive, re-sults validationstudy suggest. The Percepta Genomic Sequenc- ing Classifier (GSC) was able to up- and down-classify probability of malignancy for a considerable pro-portion of nondiagnostic bronchos-copies in the study, Peter J. Mazzone MD, FCCP , reported at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians. The test is seen as complementa- ry to bronchoscopy, improving the sensitivity of bronchoscopy overall and showing a combined sensitivity of greater than 95% in low- and in-termediate-risk groups, according to Dr. Mazzone. While the clinical utility of this genomic test needs to be further tested, the eventual goal is to im-prove clinician decision making when bronchoscopy results don't clearly classify nodules as malignant or benign, Dr. Mazzone said in an interview. \"In that situation, you're often left wondering, 'what should I do next? Can I just watch this, and see if it grows and changes, or do I have to be even more aggressive - do another biopsy, or have a surgery to take it out?' \" he exp lained. \"So the test hopes to help make a more informed decision by further strat-ifying those patients as being quite low risk and maybe safe to follow, or quite high risk and maybe you should be considering more aggres-sive management. \" The GSC improves on the per- formance of an earlier molecular test, the Percepta Bronchial Ge-nomic Classifier, which uses a brushing of bronchial epithelium to enhance nodule management in smokers, according to the re-searcher. The next-generation GSC uses 1,232 gene transcripts from whole-transcriptome RNA se-quencing, along with clinical factors, to help with nodule diag-nosis, he said. To establish the diagnostic accu- racy of the GSC, Dr. Mazzone and colleagues evaluated data on 412 patients from three independent cohorts, all of whom had bronchos-copies for lung nodule evaluation that were nondiagnostic. Of those patients, 5% had nodules that physi-cians had deemed as low probability of malignancy prior to bronchosco-py, 28% deemed intermediate risk, and 74% high risk. They found that the Percepta GSC down-classified the low-pretest risk intermediate-pretest risk patients with a 91.0% NPV , Dr. Mazzone reported, while patients with intermediate pretest risk were up-classified with a 65.4% positive predictive value (PPV) and patients with high pretest risk were upclassi-fied with a 91.5% PPV . The proportion of patients re- classified was about 55% for the low-risk group, 42% for the inter-mediate-risk group, and 27% for the high-risk group, according to the report at the meeting. These results suggest the Percepta GSC could help in the \"sticky situ-ation\" where a bronchoscopy result is inconclusive, Dr. Mazzone told attendees. \"When a bronchoscopy is rec- ommended, despite fantastic advances in navigation systems to get to those nodules, we often come back without a solid answer, and that leaves the clinician in a bit of a predicament, \" he said in a late-breaking clinical trial presen-tation.

LUNG CANCER Next-generation genomic test plus bronchoscopy may improve lung nodule management Survey finds barriers to molecular testing for lung cancer BY SHARON WORCESTER MDedge News BARCELONA - Molecular testing to guide treat- ment in patients with lung cancer remains un- derused, and awareness of related evidence-based guidelines is suboptimal, results of an interna-tional survey suggest. Overall, 61% of the 2,537 respondents from 102 countries and across multiple relevant medical specialties reported that molecular testing rates in their country were less than 50%, with the lowest rates reported in Latin America. And 33% of those requesting molecular testing said they were unaware of the most updated guidelines supporting the use of such testing in lung can-cer, Matthew Smeltzer, PhD, of the University of Memphis reported during a press conference at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. The findings from the International Associa- tion for the Study of Lung Cancer Global Sur-vey on Molecular Testing in Lung Cancer also showed that 41% of respondents who perform or interpret molecular testing assays report being dissatisfied with the conditions of mo-lecular testing in their country, 17% said they feel that patients are not satisfied, and 35% said they aren't sure about the state of testing in their country. Specific concerns reported by respondents in- cluded trouble understanding results, the time it takes to receive the results, and the reliability of samples. The top five barriers to molecular testing in- cluded cost, quality, access, awareness, and time, Dr. Smeltzer said at the meeting which is spon-sored by the IASLC. \"These five were the same five top barriers in each region of the world, \" he said, noting that the ordering of the barriers differed somewhat among regions. The survey included a 7-question introduction, with 32 additional questions for respondents who request tests and treat patients, 45 questions on performing and interpreting assays, and 24 ques-tions on tissue acquisition. Additionally, all re-spondents were asked to list barriers that impede their country's ability to offer molecular testing. \"I' d say we got a pretty good geographic dis- tribution of responses; 56% of these responses were from developing countries, 44% from de-veloped countries, \" he said, noting that medical oncologists constituted the highest percentage of respondents, followed by pulmonologists, tho-racic surgeons, pathologists, and other scientists. When asked specifically what would prompt molecular testing, respondents most often listed adenocarcinoma, never-smoker status, female gender, and young age, Dr. Smeltzer said. \"Overall, we're still finding that many in the lung cancer community are not satisfied with the current state of molecular testing. We've got suboptimal awareness of the evidence-based guidelines. We have barriers that remain to molecular testing, which we've identified, and [we're] recommending continuous education around molecular testing, and that should be intensified on a national and international level to ensure that patients receive optimal therapy, \" he concluded. The IASLC survey was funded by AstraZeneca. Dr. Smeltzer reported receiving research support from the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation. sworcester@mdedge.com Sharon Worcester/MDedge News Dr. Matthew Smeltzer 26_29_36_37_CHPH19_11.indd 29 AM36 NOVEMBER 2019 CHEST PHYSICIANBY SHARON WORCESTER MDedge News BARCELONA - Adding low-dose computed tomog- raphy (LDCT)-based lung cancer screening in heavy smokers bolsters lung cancer prevention efforts, according to findings from the prospec-tive bioMILD trial. Specifically, the addition of the miRNA assay appears to reduce unnecessary repeat LDCT scans based on individual risk profiles without adversely affecting lung cancer detection or mor-tality, Ugo Pastorino, MD, director of thoracic surgery at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Foundation, Milan, reported at the World Con-ference on Lung Cancer. Of 4,119 volunteers with a median age of 60 years and a median of 42 pack-years who were enrolled between January 2013 and March 2016, 2,384 (58%) were assigned a 3-year LDCT re-peat according baseline profile, whereas 1,526 (37%) with single-positive positive miRNA or indeterminate/positive LDCT) and 209 (5%) with double positive (both a positive miRNA and indeterminate/positive LDCT) were assigned to annual or shorter LDCT repeat. After four screening runs, a total of 115 lung cancers were diagnosed. The cumulative lung cancer rates \"were enormously different\" in the 3 groups, despite similar group composition with respect to age, gender, and tobacco consumption (0.6% for double-negative screening, 3.8% for single-positive screening, and 20.1% double screening), and lung cancer mortalitywas 0.1%, 0.6%, and 3.8% in the groups, respec-tively, Dr. Pastorino said at the conference, whichis sponsored by the International Association forthe Study of Lung Cancer. However, no significant differences were seen in the proportion of stage I lung cancers, resec-tion rates, or interval cancer incidence in subjects sent to 3-year LDCT repeat, he noted. The bioMILD trial was designed in the wake of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), which showed that three annual LDCT rounds for lung cancer screening reduced lung cancer mortali-ty, and the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection (MILD) trial, which provided additional evidence that intervention beyond 5 years with annual or biennial rounds enhanced the benefit of screening. Dr. Pastorino, the lead author on the MILD trial, previously reported that miRNA expression profiles in tumors and in normal lung tissue in-dicate aggressive lung cancer development and that specific miRNA signatures can be identified in plasma samples up to 2 years before spiral-CT detection of the disease. The bioMILD trial tested the additional value of an miRNA assay at the time of LDCT. Subjects were current (79%) or former heavy smokers, and 39% were women. The findings suggest that adding the miRNA assay to LDCT for lung cancer screening is a \"valuable and safe tool to assess individual risk profile and reduce unnecessary LDCT repeats in lung cancer screening, \" Dr. Pastorino said. \"But what is more important for us [is that] the knowledge of individual biologic risk can improve the efficacy of screening, but can [also] guide prevention strategies because the problem in a heavy smoker is not to just detect lung cancer, it's to reduce mortality, \" he said at a press conference highlighting the findings. \" And so, personalized prevention is a real option now, and that means diagnosis, but also preventive measures [such as] smoking cessation and chemoprevention. \" Invited discussant Harry J. de Koning, MD, PhD, professor of public health and screening evaluation at Erasmus Medical Center, Rotter-dam, the Netherlands, noted that no other studies have evaluated screening intervals longer than 2 years, but he agreed that \"reducing regular fol-low-up scans based on additional risk informa-tion is a way forward. \" However, the approach would increase costs, he said, adding that large, prospective, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm the safety of such approaches in na-tionwide programs. Dr. Pastorino and Dr. de Koning each reported having no disclosures. sworcester@mdedge.com SOURCE: Pastorino U et al. WCLC 2019, Abstract PL02.04LUNG CANCER LDCT plus miRNA bolsters prevention efforts Cardiotoxicity after checkpoint inhibitor treatment seen early, linked to elevated biomarkers BY ANDREW D. BOWSER MDedge News PHILADELPHIA - While immune checkpoint inhibitors were not sig- nificantly more cardiotoxic than other lung cancer treatments, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) did occur earlier, and occurred more frequently in patients with elevated biomarkers, in a retrospective co-hort study reported at the annual scientific meeting of the Heart Fail-ure Society of America. The findings support monitoring of cardiac biomarkers in the initial phase of checkpoint inhibitor treat-ment to identify patients at high cardiac risk, according to Kalyan R. Chitturi, DO, a resident physician with the DeBakey Heart and Vascu-lar Center, Houston Methodist Hos-pital, who presented the results. \"It's the early period that warrants the closest monitoring, as within the first 30-40 days, there's higher risk, \" Dr. Chitturi said in an interview. \"When there was a biomarker eleva-tion, it markedly increased the risk of MACE, warranting a closer vigi-lance during that time period. \" The retrospective study conduct- ed by Dr. Chitturi and colleagues included a total of 252 patients with lung cancer who had been treated at one of seven different sites in Houston Methodist Cancer Center between Aug. 1, 2015, and Aug. 1, 2018. Immune checkpoint inhibitors did not significantly increase the risk of MACE, compared with other lung cancer therapies, with incidences of 13.3% and 10.3%, respectively (P = .632), the investigators found. However, MACE did occur earlier in the checkpoint inhibitor group, at a median time to event of 40 days, compared with 118 days in the pa-tients not treated with checkpoint inhibitors, they found. Risk of MACE with checkpoint inhibitor treatment was increased in patients with elevated troponin (hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-5.21; peptide (HR, 5.77; 95% P less than .001), according to multivariate lo-gistic regression analysis results. These results suggest biomarkers such as cardiac troponin and brain natriuretic peptide are warranted to monitor patients in the early phase of checkpoint inhibitor treatment, according to Dr. Chitturi. \"In the cost-benefit ratio of often-lethal MACE, it's well worth it to collect these, \" he said in the interview. The results corroborate findings from some other recent studies, he noted. These include a recent study that linked elevated serum troponin to myocarditis in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibi-tors (J Am Coll Cardiol. 2018 Apr 24;71[16]:1755-64).

BOWSER MDedge News EXPERT ANALYSIS FROM CHEST 2019 n While further data are awaited on the role of vitamin C, thiamine, and steroids in sepsis, there is at least biologic plausibili-ty for using the combination, and clinical equipoise that supports continued enrollment of patients in the ongoing randomized, controlled VICTAS trial, according to that study's principal investigator. \"There is tremendous biologic plausibility for giving vitamin C in sepsis, \" said Jon Sevransky, MD, pro- fessor of medicine at Emory Univer-sity in Atlanta. But until more data are available on vitamin C-based regimens, those who choose to use vitamin C with thiamine and ste-roids in this setting need to ensure that glucose is being measured ap-propriately, he warned. \"If you decide that vitamin C is right for your patient, prior to having enough data - so if you're doing a Hail Mary, or a 'this pa-tient is sick, and it's probably not going to hurt them' - please make sure that you measure your glucose with something that uses whole blood, which is either a blood gas or sending it down to the core lab, because otherwise, you might get an inaccurate re-sult, \" Dr. Sevransky said at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians. Results from the randomized, placebo-controlled Vitamin C, Thi-amine, and Steroids in Sepsis (VIC-TAS) trial may be available within the next few months, according to Dr. Sevransky, who noted that the trial was funded for 500 patients, which provides an 80% probability of showing an absolute risk reduc-tion of 10% in mortality. The primary endpoint of the phase 3 trial is vasopressor- and ventilator-free days at 30 days after randomization, while 30-day mor-tality has been described as \"the key secondary outcome\" by Dr. Sevran-sky and colleagues in a recent report on the trial design. Clinicians have been \"captivated\" by the potential benefit of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone in patients with severe sepsis and sep-tic shock, as published in CHEST in June 2017, Dr. Sevransky said. In that study, reported by Paul E. Marik, MD, and colleagues, hospital mortality was 8.5% for the treatment group, versus 40.4% in the control group, a significant difference. That retrospective, single-center study had a number of limita-tions, however, including its be-fore-and-after design and the use of steroids in the comparator arm. In addition, little information was available on antibiotics or fluids given at the time of the intervention, according to Dr. Sevransky. In results of the CITRIS-ALI ran- domized clinical trial, just published in JAMA, intravenous adminis-tration of high-dose vitamin C in patients with sepsis and acute respi-ratory distress syndrome (ARDS) failed to significantly reduce organ failure scores or biomarkers of in-flammation and vascular injury. In an exploratory analysis of CI- TRIS-ALI, mortality at day 28 was 29.8% for the treatment group and 46.3% for placebo, with a statisti-cally significant difference between Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the two arms, according to the in-vestigators. Dr. Sevransky disclosed current grant support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-ment Authority (BARDA) and the Marcus Foundation, as well as a stipend from Critical Care Medicine related to work as an associate edi-tor. He is also a medical adviser to Project Hope and ARDS Foundation and a member of the Surviving Sep-sis guideline committees. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Sevransky J et al. Chest 2019.

The study's control group received usual care, which means that nurses adjusted mechanical ventilation manually in response to respiratory rate, tidal volume, positive end-respiratory pressure (PEEP), and other factors to maintain ventilation within parameters associated with safe respiration. The exper-imental group was man-aged with a fully automated closed-loop system to make these adjustments without any nurse intervention. For those in the experi- mental group \"the propor-tion of time in the optimal zone was increased and the proportion of time in the unsafe zone was decreased\" relative to those randomized to con-ventional nursing care, Marcus J. Schultz, MD, reported at the annual congress of the European Respiratory Society. Conducted at a hospital with an experienced ICU staff, the study had a control arm that was managed by \"dedicated nurses who, I can tell you, are very eager to provide the best level of care possible, \" said Dr. Schultz, professor of experi-mental intensive care, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The investigator-initiated POSITiVE trial ran-domized 220 cardiac surgery patients scheduled to receive postoperative mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Exclusions included those with class III COPD, a requirement for extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation (ECMO), or a history of lung surgery. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time spent in an optimal zone, an acceptable zone, or a dangerous zone of ventilation based on predefined values for tidal volume, maximum airway pressure, end-tidal CO 2, and oxygen satu- ration (SpO2). The greatest between-group difference was seen in the pro-portion of time spent in the optimal zone. This climbed from approximately 35% in the control arm to slightly more than 70% in the experimental arm, a significant difference. The proportion of time in the dangerous zone was reduced from approximately 6% in the control arm to 3% in the automated arm. On average nurse-managed patients spent nearly 60% of the time in the acceptable zone versus less than 30% for those in the automated experimental arm. A heat map using green, yellow, and red to rep- resent optimal, acceptable, and dangerous zones, respectively, for individual participants in the trial provided a more stark global impression. For the control group, the heat map was primarily yellow with scattered dashes of green and red. For the experimental group, the map was primarily green with dashes of yellow and a much smaller number of red dashes relative to the control group. In addition, the time to spontaneous breathing was 38% shorter for those randomized to auto-mated ventilation than to conventional care, a significant difference. There are now many devices marketed for automated ventilation, according to Dr. Schultz. The device used in this study was the proprietary INTELLiVENT-ASV system, marketed by Ham-ilton Medical, which was selected based on prior satisfactory experience. Although not unique, this system has sophisticated software to adjust ventilation to reach targets set by the clinician on the basis of information it is receiving from phys-iologic sensors for such variables as respiratory rate, tidal volume, and inspiratory pressure. \"It is frequently adjusting the PEEP levels to reach the lowest driving pressure, \" said Dr. Schultz. Among its many other features, it also \"gives spontaneous breathing trials automatically. \" Uncomplicated patients were selected purpose- fully to test this system, but Dr. Schultz said that a second trial, called POSITiVE 2, is now being planned that will enroll more complex patients. Keeping complex patients within the optimal zone as defined by tidal volume and other critical vari-ables has the potential to reduce lung damage that is known to occur when these are not optimized. \" Applying safe ventilatory support in clinical practice remains a serious challenge and is ex-tremely time consuming, \" Dr. Schultz said. He reported that fully automated ventilation appears to be reliable, and \"it takes out the human factor\" in regard to diligence in monitoring and potential for error. Overall, these results support the potential for a fully automated system to improve optimal ven-tilatory support, reduce risk of lung injury, and reduce staffing required for monitoring of me-chanical ventilation, according to Dr. Schultz. Dr. Schultz reports no potential conflicts of interest. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.orgCRITICAL CARE ICU automated ventilation outperformed usual care Lefamulin found noninferior to moxifloxacin for pneumonia BY HEIDI SPLETE MDedge News Oral lefamulin, the first pleu-romutilin antibiotic approved for intravenous and oral admin-istration, was noninferior to oral moxifloxacin for inducing an early clinical response in patients with bacterial pneumonia, acording to data from a global multicenter study of 738 individuals. Persistent high rates of bacterial resistance to current treatments have created the need for more op-tions, especially for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), which remains a leading cause of hospitalization and death in the United States, wrote Elizabeth Alexander, MD, of Nabriva Therapeutics in King of Prussia, Penn., and colleagues. Lefamulin, \"the first pleuromutilin antibiotic approved for intrave-nous and oral use in humans, \" has demonstrated activity against many CABP-causing pathogens, including some not susceptible to other classes of antimicrobials, they noted. Findings of Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia 2 (LEAP2) were published in JAMA. In this study, the researchers randomized 370 patients to 600 mg of oral lefamulin every 12 hours for 5 days and 368 patients to 400 mg of oral moxiflox-acin every 24 hours for 7 days. Early clinical response rates at 96 hours were 90.8% for both medica-tions (difference of 0.1%). In addi-tion, the rates of clinical response success were similar between the groups in both the modified intent-to-treat population (87.5% with lefamulin and 89.1% with moxiflox-acin) with lefamulin and 93.6% with moxifloxacin). Gastrointestinal issues of diarrhea and nausea were the two most fre-quently reported treatment-emer-gent adverse events in both groups. Both conditions occurred more often in the lefamulin group, com-pared with the moxifloxacin group, but the differences were not signif-icant (12.2% vs. 1.1% and 5.2% vs. 1.9%, respectively). The study findings were limited by several factors including strict exclusion criteria that may limit the generalizability of the results, as well as a lack of testing for viral co-pathogens, low recovery of resistant pathogens, and possible misclas-sification of patient ethnicity, the researchers noted. However, the results were strengthened by the randomized design, inclusion of patients with more severe CABP , and low rate of discontinuation, they said. The data support previous studies of lefam-ulin. Its lack of cross-resistance to other drug classes, coverage of typ-ical and atypical CABP pathogens, and options for both oral and intra-venous use suggest that it \"may pro-vide an alternative approach for the treatment of vulnerable patients, \" the researchers said. The study was supported by Nabriva Therapeutics.

BOWSER MDedge News FROM CHEST 2019 nNEW ORLEANS - A standardized checklist may help reduce er- rors and improve common quality measures in critically ill patients, results of a recent ret-rospective analysis of 200 con-secutive patients suggest. Use of the checklist was linked to significantly shorter hospital length of stay and ICU length of stay as well as fewer days on a ventilator in the analysis, which was presented at the an-nual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians. The 10-item standardized checklistcovered a variety topics rangingfrom comfort, prophylaxis, andsedation to infection controland prevention, nutrition, andmedication management review. Although health economics weren't evaluated in this anal-ysis, changes in those quality measures might also impact the bottom line, according to study coauthor Priscilla Chow, DO, a resident at Suburban Communi-ty Hospital in East Norriton, Pa. \"Obviously, if the patient is spending less time in the hos-pital and fewer days on the ventilator and in the ICU, then we can potentially also be more cost effective in our care, \" Dr. Chow said in a podium presen-tation at the meeting. The use of checklists to stan- dardize processes and reduce errors is a \"relatively simple ap-proach\" that was adopted from the airline industry and now has been evaluated in a variety of medical care settings, according to Dr. Chow. Previous studies have demon- strated that checklist-driven care may reduce the incidence of postoperative complica-tions, central line-associated bloodstream infection, ventila-tor-associated pneumonia, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection. The present retrospective data analysis by Dr. Chow and col-leagues included 200 consecutive patients admitted to the surgical ICU at an urban level 1 trauma center, including 100 patients managed according to the check-list and 100 managed according to standard processes. Though survival to discharge was comparable between the groups, use of the checklist was associated with a significantly shorter hospital length of stay versus standard care (23.9 vs. 9.5 days). Likewise, the ICU length of stay was shorter in the check-list group (13.0 vs. 6.5 days), and the checklist group had fewer ventilator days (7.7 to 2.8). Injury Severity Score did not differ between groups; though overall, use of the checklist re-sulted in more of the underlying topics being addressed in clinical documentation (5.0 vs. 8.7 items). Dr. Chow and colleagues dis- closed that they had no relation-ships relevant to their study. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Akella K et al. CHEST 2019. Abstract, doi: 10.1016/j.chest.2019.08.201. CRITICAL CARE Checklist may improve quality measures in the surgical ICUEarly palliative care consult decreases in-hospital mortality BY ANDREW D. BOWSER MDedge News FROM CHEST 2019 nNEW ORLEANS - When initiated early, a palliative care consultation may increase the numberof discharges to hospice critical carepatients meeting certain end-of-lifecriteria, results of a recent randomizedclinical trial suggest. The rate of in-hos- pital mortality was lower for critical care patients receiving an early consultation, compared with those who received palliative care initiated accord-ing to usual standards in the randomized, controlled trial, de-scribed at the annual meeting of the Amer-ican College of Chest Physicians. More health care surrogates were chosen in the hospital when palliative care medicine was involved earlier, ac-cording to investigator Scott Helgeson, MD, fellow in pulmonary critical care at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. Taken together, Dr. Helgeson said, those findings suggest the importance of getting palliative care involved \"very early, while the patient can still make decisions. ... There are a lot of things that can get in the way of adequate conversations, and that's when the palliative care team can come in, \" Dr. Helgeson said in an interview. This study is the first reported to date to look at the impact on patient care outcomes specifically within 24 hours of medical ICU admission, according to Dr. Helgeson and coinvestigators In their randomized study, patients were eligible if they met at least one of several criteria, including advanced age (80 years or older), late-stage dementia, post-cardiac arrest, metastatic cancer, end-stage organ failure, recurrent ICU admissions, an APACHE II score of 14 or higher, a SOFA score of 9 or higher, preexisting functional dependency, or consideration for a tracheostomy or per-manent feeding tube. Of 29 patients ran- domized, 14 received early palliative care, and 15 received stan-dard palliative care, which was defined as starting \"whenever the treating team deems (it) is appropriate, \" according to the pub-lished abstract. Hospital mortality occurred in none of the patients in the ear- ly palliative care group, versus six in the usual care group (P = .01), Dr. Helgeson and colleagues found. Moreover, sev-en health care surrogates were chosen in hospital in the early palliative care group, versus none in the usual care group ( P less than .01). About one-fifth of deaths in the United States take place in or around ICU admissions, according to the in-vestigators, who noted that those ad-missions can result in changing goals from cure to comfort - though some-times too late.

Approval was based on results of two clinical trials assessing a total of 1,289 people with community-ac-quired bacterial pneumonia. In these trials, lefamulin was compared with moxifloxacin with and without linezolid. Patients who received lefamulin had similar rates of treatment success as those taking moxifloxa-cin alone or moxifloxacin plus linezolid. The most common adverse reactions associated with lefamulin include diarrhea, nausea, reactions at the injection site, elevated liver enzymes, and vomiting. Patients with prolonged QT interval, patients with arrhythmias, patients receiving treatment with antiarrhythmic agents, and pa-tients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval are contraindicated. In addition, because of evidence of fetal harm in animal studies, preg-nant women should be advised of potential risks before receiving lefamulin. \"This new drug provides another option for the treatment of patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, a serious disease. For man-aging this serious disease, it is important for phy-sicians and patients to have treatment options, \" Ed Cox, MD, director of the FDA 's Office of Anti-microbial Products, said in the press release. lfranki@mdedge.com 38_40_44_CHPH19_11.indd 40 11/6/19 9:52 AMmedical intervention, consider discontinuation decreased appetite, anxiety, and insomnia. C M Y KCosmos Communications 1 9js 40548a 07.18.19 133Q1 2019 CHEST PHYSICIANBY MICHELE G. SULLIVAN MDedge News An uncommon but potentially deadly inflammatory lung disease is emerging among children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and its history appears to coincide with the rise of powerful biologics as first-line ther-apy for children with the disease. Most confirmed cases of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis with lung disease (sJIA-LD) are in the United States. But it's popping up in other places that have adopted early biologic treatment for sJIA - includ-ing Canada, South America, Europe, and the Middle East. The respiratory symptoms are rel- atively subtle, so by the time of lung disease detection, the amount of affected lung can be extensive, said Elizabeth Mellins, MD, a Stanford (Calif.) University researcher who, along with first author Vivian Saper, MD, recently published the larg-est case series comprising reports from 37 institutions (Ann Rheum Dis. 2019 Sep 27. doi: 10.1136/ann-rheumdis-2019-216040). By the end of follow-up, 22 of the 61 children in her cohort had died, including all 12 patients who demonstrated excessively high neutrophil levels in bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Another recent report, authored by Grant Schulert, MD, PhD, and colleagues of the Cincinnati Chil-dren's Hospital Medical Center, de-scribed 18 patients, 9 of whom were also included in the Stanford cohort (Arthritis Rheumatol. 2019 Aug 5. doi: 10.1002/art.41073). Both investigators have now iden- tified new patients. \"We are aware of 60 additional cases beyond what were included in our series, \" Dr. Mellins said in an interview, bringing her entire cohort to 121. Dr. Schulert also continues to expand his group, detailing nine new cases at a recent private meeting. \"We are up to 27 now, \" he said. \"The features of these new patients are all very similar: The children are very young, all have had macrophage activation syndrome in the past and very-difficult-to-control JIA. Reac-tions to tocilizumab [Actemra] were also not uncommon in this group. \" Dr. Mellins also saw this associa- tion with allergic-type tocilizumab anakinra (Kineret) or canakinumab (Ilaris). Although serious lung disease in sJIA patients is not unheard of, this phenotype was virtually unknown until about a decade ago. Both investigators said that it's been rising steadily since 2010 - just about the time that pow-erful cytokine-inhibiting biologics were changing these patients' world for the better. After decades of re-lying almost solely on steroids and methotrexate, with rather poor re-sults and significant long-term side effects, children were not only im-proving, but thriving. Gone was the life-changing glucocorticoid-related growth inhibition. Biologics could halt fevers, rash, and joint destruc-tion in their tracks. But the emergence of this par- ticular type of lung disease could throw a pall over that success story, he said. If sJIA-LD is temporally associated with increasing reliance on long-term interleukin-1/IL-6 in-hibition in children with early-onset disease, could these drugs actually be the causative agent? Some of the 18 in his initial series have improved, while 36% of those in the Stanford series died. Most who do recover stay on their IL-1 or IL-6-blocking therapy with good disease control without further lung problems. Both investigators found compelling genetic hints, but nothing conclusive. Children with trisomy 21 appear especially vulnerable. Most patients are very young - around 2 years old - but others are school aged. Some had a history of macro-phage activation syndrome. Some had hard-to-control disease and some were clinically well controlled when the lung disease presented. With so many potential links, all unproven, clinicians may ques-tion the wisdom of embarking on long-term biologic therapy for their children with sJIA. Peter Nigrovic, MD, of Boston Children's Hospital, addressed this in an accompanying editorial (Arthritis Rheumatol. 2019 Aug 7. doi: 10.1002/art.41071). \"My take on this is that it's a very worrisome trend, \" he said in an in-terview. \"We've been going full bore toward early biologic therapy in sJIA and at the same time we are seeing more of this lung disease. Is it guilt by association? Or is there something more? The challenge for us is not to jump too soon to that conclusion. \" Although the association is there, he said, association does not equal causation. And there's no doubt that biologics have vastly improved the lives of sJIA patients. \"The drugs might be causal, and I worry about that and think we need to study it. But we absolutely need stronger evi-dence before we change practice. \" \"This is a new manifestation of the disease, and it's coming at the same time we are changing the treatment paradigm, \" Dr. Nigrovic continued. \"It could be because of interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 block-ade. There is biological plausibility for such a link. It could also be relat-ed to the fact that we are using less steroids and methotrexate, which might have been preventing this. The appearance of sJIA lung disease could also be that a distinct secular trend unrelated to treatment, just as we saw amyloid come and go in this population in Europe. These other therapies were actually preventing this. We just don't know. \" Clinical characteristics Children presented with similar symptoms. Respiratory symptoms are usually subtle and mild. These can include tachypnea, hypoxia (43% in the Stanford series), and pulmonary hypertension (30% in the Stanford series). Digital clubbing, often with er- ythema, was a common finding. Some children showed pruritic, nonevanescent rashes. Eosinophilia occurred in 37% of the Stanford series and severe abdominal pain in 16%, although Dr. Mellins noted that belly pain may be underesti-mated, as it was only volunteered, not queried, information. \"There are some red flags that should raise suspicion even without obvious respiratory symptoms, \" Dr. Mellins said. These include lympho-penia, unexplained abdominal pain, eosinophilia, an unusual rash, and finger clubbing with or without er-ythema. Findings on imaging were consis- tent in both series. Several key clinic features emerged: pleural thickening, septal were sup- ported by grants from the sJIA Foundation, the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health, Stanford graduate fellowships, the Life Sciences Research Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Founda-tion, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, the Childhood Arthri-tis and Rheumatology Research Al-liance, the Arthritis Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. Many authors on both papers re-ported financial ties to Genentech, which markets tocilizumab, and other pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Nigrovic reported receiving consulting fees and research support from Novartis and other companies. msullivan@mdedge.com SOURCES: Saper V et al.

On Oct. 23, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) released a re-port, \"Taking Action Against Clini-cian Burnout: A Systems Approach to Professional Well-Being. \" The report calls for a broad and unified approach to tackling the root causes of burnout. There must be a concerted ef- fort by leaders of many fields of health care to create less stressful workplaces for clinicians, Pascale Carayon, PhD, cochair of the NAM committee that produced the report, said during the NAM press event. \"This is not an easy process, \" said Dr. Carayon, a researcher into pa-tient safety issues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"There is no single solution. \" The NAM report assigns specific tasks to many different participants in health care through a six-goal ap-proach, as described below. Create positive workplaces. Lead- ers of health care systems should consider how their business andmanagement decisions will affectclinicians' jobs, taking into accountthe potential to add to their levels ofburnout. Executives need to continu-ously monitor and evaluate the extentof burnout in their organizations,and report on this at least annually. Address burnout in training and in clinicians' early years. Medical, nursing, and pharmacy schoolsshould consider steps such as mon-itoring workload, implementingpass-fail grading, improving accessto scholarships and affordable loans,and creating new loan repaymentsystems. Reduce administrative burden. Federal and state bodies and organi- zations such as the National QualityForum should reconsider how theirregulations and recommendationscontribute to burnout. Organizationsshould seek to eliminate tasks that donot improve the care of patients. Improve usability and relevance of health information technology(IT). Medical organizations should develop and buy systems that are as user-friendly and easy to operate as possible. They also should look to use IT to reduce documentation demands and automate nonessential tasks. Reduce stigma and improve burnout recovery services. State of- ficials and legislative bodies shouldmake it easier for clinicians to useemployee assistance programs,peer support programs, and mentalhealth providers without the infor-mation being admissible in malprac-tice litigation. The report notes therecommendations from the Federa-tion of State Medical Boards, Amer-ican Medical Association, and theAmerican Psychiatric Associationon limiting inquiries in licensingapplications about a clinician's men-tal health. Questions should focuson current impairment rather thanreach well into a clinician's past. Create a national research agenda on clinician well-being. By the end of 2020, federal agencies - includingthe Agency for Healthcare Researchand Quality, the National Insti-tute for Occupational Safety andHealth, the Health Resources andServices Administration, and theU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs- should develop a coordinated re-search agenda on clinician burnout,the report said. In casting a wide net and assign- ing specific tasks, the NAM report seeks to establish efforts to address clinician burnout as a broad and shared responsibility. It would be too easy for different medical or-ganizations to depict addressing burnout as being outside of their responsibilities, Christine K. Cassel, MD, the cochair of the NAM com-mittee that produced the report, said during the press event. \"Nothing could be farther from the truth. Everyone is necessary to solve this problem, \" said Dr. Cassel, who is a former chief executive offi-cer of the National Quality Forum. Darrell G. Kirch, MD, chief execu- tive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, described the re-port as a \"call to action\" at the press event. Previously published research has found between 35% and 54% of nurses and physicians in the United States have substantial symptoms of burnout, with the prevalence of burnout ranging between 45% and 60% for medical students and resi-dents, the NAM report said. Leaders of health organizations must consider how the policies they set will add stress for clini-cians and make them less effective in caring for patients, said Vindell Washington, MD, chief medical officer of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana and a member of the NAM committee that wrote the report. \"Those linkages should be incen- tives and motivations for boards and leaders more broadly to act on the problem, \" Dr. Washington said at the NAM event. Dr. Kirch said he experienced burnout as a first-year medical stu-dent. He said a \"brilliant aspect\" of the NAM report is its emphasis on burnout as a response to the con-ditions under which medicine is practiced. In the past, burnout has been viewed as being the fault of the physician or nurse experiencing it, with the response then being to try to \"fix\" this individual, Dr. Kirch said at the event. The NAM report instead defines burnout as a \"work-related phe-nomenon studied since at least the 1970s, \" in which an individual may experience exhaustion and detach-ment. Depression and other mental health issues such as anxiety disor-ders and addiction can follow burn-out, he said. \"That involves a real human toll. \" Joe Rotella, MD, MBA, chief med- ical officer at American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, said in an interview that this NAM paper has the potential to spark the kind of transformation that its earlier research did for the quality of care. Then called the Institute of Medicine, NAM in 1999 issued a report, \"To Err Is Human, \" which is broadly seen as a key catalyst in efforts in the ensuing decades to improve the quality of care. IOM then followed up with a 2001 report, \"Crossing the Quality Chasm. \" \"Those papers over a period of time really did change the way we do health care, \" said Dr. Rotella, who was not involved with the NAM report. In Dr. Rotella's view, the NAM re- port provides a solid framework for what remains a daunting task, ad-dressing the many factors involved in burnout. \"The most exciting thing about this is that they don't have 500 rec-ommendations. They had six and that's something people can orga-nize around, \" he said. \"They are not small goals. I'm not saying they are simple. \" The NAM report delves into the factors that contribute to burnout. These include a maze of govern-ment and commercial insurance plans that create \"a confusing and onerous environment for clini-cians, \" with many of them juggling \"multiple payment systems with complex rules, processes, metrics, and incentives that may frequently change. \" Clinicians face a growing field of measurements intended to judge the quality of their performance. While some of these are useful, others are duplicative and some are not relevant to patient care, the NAM report said. The report also noted that many clinicians describe electronic health records as taking a toll on their work and private lives. Previously published research has found that, for every hour spent with a patient, physicians spend an additional 1-2 hours on the EHR at work, with additional time needed to complete this data entry at home after work hours, the report said. In an interview, Cynda Rushton, RN, PhD, a Johns Hopkins Univer- sity researcher and a member of the NAM committee that produced the report, said this new publication will support efforts to overhaul many aspects of current medical prac-tice. She said she hopes it will be a \"catalyst for bold and fundamental reform. \"It's taking a deep dive into the evidence to see how we can begin to dismantle the system's contributions to burnout, \" she said. \"No longer can we put Band-Aids on a gaping w o u n d .\" chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org PRACTICE MANAGEMENT NAM offers recommendations to fight clinician burnout Dr. Vindell Washington 46_47_48_57_58_59_CHPH19_11.indd 46 11/6/19 10:00 AMMDEDGE.COM/CHESTPHYSICIAN NOVEMBER 2019 47BY ALICIA GALLEGOS MDedge News A judge has sided with a med- ical malpractice insurer in a legal challenge that accused the company of misallocating blame among physicians after a liability settlement. In a Sept. 27 decision, Judge Debra Squires-Lee of the Common-wealth of Massachusetts Superior Court ruled that Medical Profes-sional Mutual Insurance Company (ProMutual) acted reasonably when it settled a medical liability claim for $500,000 against several health providers and allocated respon-sibility for 30% of the settlement ($150,000) to internist Nataly Minkina, MD. ProMutual was well within its rights and obligations when it settled the underlying claim and did not act in bad faith when assigning responsibility in the case, Judge Squires-Lee wrote in her 49-page ruling. \" At its heart, this case is about a multiple defendant malpractice lawsuit with finger pointing by Dr. Minkina against her codefendants and others, and a disagreement about ProMutual's ultimate de-termination about how to allo-cate a global settlement with the plaintiffs amongst ProMutual's insureds, \" Judge Squires-Lee wrote in the decision. \"Dr. Minkina strongly believes that she did not fail [the patient], that she acted reasonably, and that her treatment of [the patient] satisfied the stan-dard of care. She also questions why ProMutual failed to allocate liability in the [patient's] suit to other physicians. However ... the question for this court is whether ProMutual committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in its settlement and allocation of its settlement. I conclude that Pro- Mutual did not. \" The case stems from a patient's lawsuit against Dr. Minkina and several others at Blue Hills Medical Associates in Braintree, Mass. The patient alleged that the health care professionals were responsible for a missed breast cancer diagnosis. Dr. Minkina saw the patient just once in 2002 while covering for another doctor. During the visit, she confirmed some nodularity in the 55-year-old women's breast and referred her for a mammogram and an ultrasound. A radiologist twice reported no abnormalities, which Dr. Minkina said she relayed to the patient. Dr. Minkina left the practice shortly after. The patient visited the practice several more times and was referred for another mammogram in 2006, the results of which revealed some signs of malignancy, according to court documents. However, a nurse at the practice misread, misunder-stood, or overlooked the signs and recorded that \"the benign breast condition had no changes, \" accord-ing to court transcripts. Later that year, the patient visited the practice complaining of headaches and a droopy eye at which time her prima-ry care physician diagnosed sinusitis and prescribed antibiotics. In 2007, the patient underwent MRIs of the brain and the breast, which revealed widespread metastatic carcinoma. She and her family sued Dr. Minki-na and several others in June 2007. The patient died in 2008. ProMutual settled the case against the defendants for $500,000 in 2008, allocating 30% of the liability to Dr. Minkina, 10% of the nurse practi-tioner, 60% to the medical practice, and no liability to the other doctors named. ProMutual contended Dr. Minkina bore more responsibility than the other health care profes-sionals named for the delayed diag-nosis because of causation factors and standard of care violations, namely that Dr. Minkina should have pursued a biopsy for the pa-tient. Dr. Minkina sued the insurer in 2012, claiming chiefly that the insurer allocated an unjustifiably high percentage of liability to her because she was no longer insured and because the company had an economic incentive to allocate a disproportionate percentage of re-sponsibility and damages. A lower court initially dismissed Dr. Minkina's suit, but the Com-monwealth of Massachusetts Ap-peals Court in 2015 overturned that decision, ruling the case could move forward. In 2018, the su-perior court agreed Dr. Minkina had a valid bad faith claim, stating that she had provided information about ProMutual's conduct from which \"a reasonable juror could infer the defendant's bad faith in connection with its settling the underlying malpractice suit, in-cluding the allocation of liability. But Judge Squires-Lee ruled that trial evidence showed that Pro- Mutual did not act for its own benefit or favor other insureds over Dr. Minkina. The judge wrote that the insurer satisfied its con-tractual and legal obligations when defending the underlying legal claim. Dr. Minkina said she was disap- pointed with the ruling, but that she is considering her legal ave-nues. ProMutual declined to comment about the decision. agallegos@mdedge.comPRACTICE MANAGEMENT Judge rules for insurer in doctor's allocation lawsuit President to nominate oncologist to lead FDA BY ALICIA GALLEGOS MDedge News Stephen M. Hahn, MD, a radiation oncologistand researcher, may soon take the reins of the Food and Drug Administration. President Trump indicated his intent to nominate Dr. Hahn as FDA Commissioner in a brief Nov.1 statement that outlined Dr. Hahn's background. Dr. Hahn currently serves as chief medical executive at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, where he heads the radiology oncology division. Dr. Hahn specializes in treating lung cancer and sarcoma and has authored 220 peer-reviewed origi-nal research articles. He was previously chair of the department of radiology oncology at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and also served as a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Hahn completed his residency in radiation oncology at NCI and his residency in internal medi-cine at the University of California, San Francisco. Margaret Foti, PhD, chief executive officer for the American Association for Cancer Research called Dr. Hahn a renowned expert in radiation oncology and research, an experienced and highly effective administrator, and an innovative leader.\"I have seen firsthand Dr. Hahn's extraordinary dedication and commitment to cancer patients, and the AACR is extremely confident that he will be an outstanding leader for the FDA, \" Dr. Foti said in a statement. \"Dr. Hahn, who is board certified in both radia-tion and medical oncology, is esteemed for the breadth and depth of his scientific knowl-edge and expertise, and he has consistently advocated for a drug review process at the FDA that is both science directed and patient focused. \" The American Society of Clinical Oncology also congratulated Dr. Hahn on the upcoming nomination, noting that he has a strong grasp of the drug development process and understands the realities of working in a complex clinical care environment. \"The role of FDA commissioner requires a strong commitment to advancing the agency's mission to protect public health across the United States, and an understanding of how to help speed innovations to get new treatments to patients, while also ensuring the safety and efficacy of the medical products that millions of Americans rely on to manage, treat, and cure their cancer, \" the society stated. \" ASCO has a long and productive history of collaborating with FDA, including with current Acting Commissioner, Ned Sharpless, MD, in support of the agency's important role in reduc-ing cancer incidence, advancing treatment options, and improving the lives of individuals with cancer. We look forward to continuing our close collabo-ration to make it possible for every American with cancer to have access to medical products that are safe and effective. \" Dr. Sharpless will return to his position as NCI director; he served as interim FDA commissioner from the April departure of then-FDA commis-sioner, Scott Gottlieb, MD. \" As one of the nation's leading oncologists who has devoted his entire professional career to helping patients in the fight against cancer, Ned is returning home to NCI to continue this work and we look forward to working closely with him once again, \" Francis S. Collins, MD, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a state-ment. \" agallegos@mdedge.com Dr. Hahn 46_47_48_57_58_59_CHPH19_11.indd 47 11/6/19 10:00 NOVEMBER 2019 \u007f CHEST PHYSICIANNEWS FROM CHEST Editor's Picks BY PETER J.

PRACTICE MANAGEMENT Demeaning patient behavior takes emotional toll on physicians BY STEVE CIMINO MDedge News Despite an increasingly diverse workforce, a new study has found that many patients remain biased toward certain phy-sicians, which can produce sub-stantial negative - and occasionally positive - effects. \" Addressing demeaning behavior from patients will require a con-certed effort from medical schools and hospital leadership to create an environment that respects the diversity of patients and physicians alike, \" wrote Margaret Wheeler, MD, of the University of California, San Francisco and her coauthors. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. To determine the perspectives of physicians and trainees in regard to patient bias, along with potential barriers to responding effectively, the researchers led 13 focus groups attended by 11 internal medicine hospitalist physicians, 26 internal medicine residents, and 13 medical students affiliated with the UCSF School of Medicine. In describing biased and de- meaning patient behavior, the participants recalled remarks that ranged from refusal of care and questioning the clinician's role to ethnic jokes, questions as to their ethnic backgrounds, and inappro-priate flirtations or compliments. The effects of these behaviors on the participants included negative responses like carrying an emotion-al burden and withdrawing from work, along with positive responses like an increased desire for self-growth and to pursue leadership opportunities. Barriers to addressing these be- haviors included a lack of support, uncertainty as to the appropriate response, and a fear of being per-ceived as unprofessional. Deciding how to respond - or to respond at all - was often dictated by the level of support from colleagues, a pro-fessional responsibility to peers, and the presence of a positive role mod-el who would've done the same. The study was supported by the Greenwall Foundation. The authors reported no conflicts of interest. chestphysiciannews@chestnet.org SOURCE: Wheeler M et al. JAMA In- tern Med. 2019 Oct 28. doi: 10.1001/ jamainternmed.2019.4122. This month in the journal CHEST \u00aeVIEW ON THE NEWS The results of the patient bias study from Wheeler et al. are troubling, but not surprising. As the physician workforce be- comes more diverse in regard to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, considering and addressing the negative impacts of demeaning patient interactions becomes increasingly important. And though a recent analysis stated a decline in biases between 2007 and 2016, discriminatory and disrespectful treatment remains the norm for members of many minority groups. Strategies to address these behaviors include codes of pro- fessional ethics offering guidance on responding to disrespectful behavior, antidiscrimination training for all health professionals, and health care leaders themselves practicing and preaching re-spectfulness and civility within their institutions. Patients can be expected to behave respectfully towards physicians only if the culture of health care is also respectful. When anyone, including a patient, exhibits biased and disrespectful behavior, silence is not golden. It is tacit approval. We all have the responsibility to speak and act. Lisa A. Cooper, MD, and Mary Catherine Beach, MD, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; and David R. Williams, PhD, of Harvard University, Boston, made these comments in an accom-panying editorial (JAMA Intern Med. 2019 Oct 28. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.4100).

Kelly Sr. said the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate sufficient evidence for their antitrust and unjust en-richment claims against ABIM. The doctors also did not establish any showing of anticompetitive conduct by ABIM to support a monopolization claim, the judge ruled. \"We disagree with plaintiffs and find that ABIM's initial certifica-tion and MOC products are part of a single product and do not oc-cupy distinct markets, \" Judge Kelly wrote in his decision. \"Not only are we unconvinced by plaintiffs' arguments, we find that plaintiffs' entire framing of the ABIM certi-fication to be flawed. In essence, plaintiffs are arguing that, in order to purchase ABIM's initial certi-fication, internists are forced to purchase MOC products as well. However, this is not the case. ... Nowhere in the amended com-plaint do plaintiffs allege that they were forced to buy MOC products in order to purchase the initial cer-tification. \" The judge dismissed the suit, but allowed the plaintiffs 14 days to submit an amended complaint reoutlining their claims of illegal monopolization and racketeering against the board. If the amended complaint passes legal muster, the judge could revive those claims. ABIM President Richard J. Baron, MD, expressed satisfaction that the court granted the board's motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a valid claim. \" ABIM is pleased that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania dismissed in its entirety a lawsuit that alleged physicians were harmed by the re-quirements for maintaining ABIM board certification, \" Dr. Baron said in a statement. C. Philip Curley, a Chicago-based attorney for the physician plaintiffs, said the case is far from over. \"The four internists who brought the lawsuit were invited to file amended claims, which is certainly being considered, \" Mr. Curley said in an interview. agallegos@mdedge.com 46_47_48_57_58_59_CHPH19_11.indd 48 11/6/19 10:00 AMMDEDGE.COM/CHESTPHYSICIAN NOVEMBER 2019 57NEWS FROM CHEST Environmental scan: Drivers of social, political, and environmental change BY THERESE BORDEN MDedge News We are living through an era of rapidly accelerated social, political, and envi-ronmental change. Spiraling costs of medical care, consumer activism around health care delivery, an aging population, and growing evidence of climate change are just some of the big currents of change. These trends are national and global in scope, and as such, far beyond any one profession or sector to shape or control. It remains for the medical profession to understand the currents of the time and adapt in order to thrive in the future. David A. Schulman, MD, FCCP , Professor of Medicine at Emory University School of Medi-cine, Atlanta, has reflected on these trends of the times and their impact on chest physicians. He commented, \"In 1957, the American Medical As-sociation adopted the Principles of Medical Ethics, which noted that 'the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to the individu-al, but also to societywhere these respon-sibilities deserve his [her] interest and participation in activities which have the purpose of improving both the health and the well-being of the individual and the commu-n i t y.' 1 While this terminology has evolved in more recent iterations of the Code of Medical Ethics, it is more important than ever for physicians to be cognizant of the effects of social, political, and en-vironmental factors on personal and public health. These external pressures seem to be growing in a climate where the country is more polarized than ever, and conversations on some of these topics can introduce unnecessary tension on interperson-al relationships, but there are still many things in this domain on which we can all agree. \" Two trends of particular interest to chest phy- sicians are the potential impact of climate change on patients, and the \"greying\" of the patient pop-ulation. Both are likely to have a significant im-pact on medical practice in the decades to come. Patients will feel climate change Environmental factors affecting the air we breathe are of primary concern for patients with a broad range of cardiorespiratory conditions. 2 Healthy but vulnerable infants, children, preg-nant women, and the elderly may also feel the effects. 3 Air pollution, increased levels of pollen and ground-level ozone, and wildfire smoke are all tied to climate change and all can have a direct impact on the patients seen by chest physicians. Individuals exposed to these environmental con-ditions may experience diminished lung function, resulting in increased hospital admissions. Keep-ing up with the latest research on probable health impacts of these environmental trends will be on the agenda of most chest physicians. 4 Professional societies will need to provide for the educational needs of members, as the field will respond with new diagnostic tools and treatments. Dr. Schulman said, \"Stresses on our physical environment are affecting our patients. Environ-mental warming may increase the spread of mos-quito-borne illnesses. 5 The lack of available clean water in many areas of the world will increase the risk of water-borne infections. Higher levels of pollution will lead to poorer air quality and an increased risk of respiratory infections, exacerbations of respiratory disease, loss of lung function, and the eventual development of lung cancer. While any one of us may not be able to make a change on a global level, we do bear a responsibility to ensure that our patients are cognizant of the effects of en- vironmental exposures on their health, and how these effects can be mitigated (which may include minimizing time outside on days with poor air quality and implementing methods to improve indoor air quality). \" Mind the generation gap The population in the United States is primarily under age 65 (84%), but the number of older citizens is on the rise. In 2016, there were 49.2 million people age 65 or older, and this number is projected to almost double to 98 million in 2060. The 85 and over population is projected to more than double from 6.4 million in 2016 to 14.6 mil-lion in 2040 (a 129% increase). 6 The medical needs of the aging population are already part of most medical institutions' planning, but the current uncertainty in the health insurance market and the potential changes in Medicare coverage, not to mention the well-documented upcoming physician shortage, 7 are complicating the planning process. Almost all acknowledge the \"greying\" of the population, but current approach-es may not be sufficient given the projected scale of the problems. This includes major increases in patients with chronic illnesses and the need for upscaling long-term geriatric care. Dr. Schulman notes that there will likely be \"a workforce shortage, unless we make deliberate efforts to increase the workforce. More aggressive recruitment of individuals into the health-care industry, including those traditionally under-rep-resented in medicine, will be an important com-ponent of this endeavor. Mitigating burnout, which impacts both provider efficiency and leads to early exit from the practice of medicine, will be another critical step in this process. \" In addition to the problem of planning for treat- ing a growing elderly population, several concern-ing trends are appearing among younger groups. E-cigarette use among middle- and high-schoolstudents may create millions of future patientswith lung damage and nicotine addictions. 8 Gov- ernment intervention in this smoking epidemic is lagging behind the rapid spread of this unhealthy habit among young people. 9 Dr. Schulman is con- cerned about new sources of tobacco delivery to young people. \"Independent of the recent spate of vaping-associated pulmonary injury, the increasing use of nicotine-delivery systems by our youth is highly troubling. In much the same way that we have long advised our tobacco-abusing patients to minimize or discontinue smoking, health-care providers need to aggressively screen for (and ad-vocate against) the use of alternative methods of nicotine delivery, at least until such time that one of them is proven to be safe in long-term studies. \" Continued on page 61 MDedge News Dr. SchulmanINSPIRATION: Pacing the Future INSPIRATION: Pacing the \u007f 61NEWS FROM CHEST How to carve out a career as an educator during fellowship BY JUSTIN K. LUI, MD Editor's Note - As CHEST has just awarded the designation of Distin-guished CHEST Educator (DCE) to 173 honorees at CHEST 2019 in New Orleans , this blog reminds fellows to start early to pursue a clinician educator role throughout their career. While fellowship training is a time to continue building the foundation of expert clinical knowledge, it also offers an opportunity to start assembling a portfolio as a clinician educator. It takes time to compile education-al scholarship and to establish a reputation within the communities of both teachers and learners, so it pays to get a head start. More-over, it also takes time to master techniques for effective teaching to become that outstanding edu-cator that you once looked up to as a medical student or resident. Below are some things that I found helpful in jump-starting that path during fellowship training. Find a capable mentor As with any sort of career planning, mentorship is key. Mentorship can open doors to expand your network and introduce opportunities for scholarship activities. Find a men-tor who shares similar views and values with something that you feel passionate about. If you are plan-ning on starting a scholarly project, make sure that your mentor has the background suited to help you maximize the experience and offer you the tools needed to achieve that end. Determine what you are passionate aboutMedical education is a vast field. Try to find something in medical education that is meaningful to you, whether it be in undergradu- ate medical education or graduate medical education or something else altogether. Y ou want to be able to set yourself up for success, so the work has to be worthwhile.Seek out opportunities to teachThere are always opportunities to teach whether it entails precepting medical students on patient inter-views or going over pulmonary/critical care topics at resident noon conferences. What I have found is that active participation in teach-ing opportunities tends to open a cascade of doors to more teaching opportunities. Look for opportunities to be involved in educational committeesMedical education, much like medicine, is a highly changing field. Leadership in medical ed-ucation is always looking for resident/fellow representatives to bring new life and perspective to educational initiatives. Most of these opportunities do not require too much of a time commitment, and most committees often meet on a once-monthly basis. However, it connects you with faculty who are part of the leadership who can guide and help set you up for fu-ture success in medical education. During residency, I was able to take part in the intern curriculum committee to advise the direction of intern report. Now as a fellow, I've been able to meet many facul-ty and fellows with similar inter-ests as mine in the/uni00A0 CHEST/uni00A0Trainee Work Group. Engage in scholarly activities It is one thing to have a portfolio detailing teaching experiences, but it is another thing to have demon-strated published works in the space of medical education. It shows long-term promise as a clinician educator, and it shows leadership potential in advancing the field. It doesn't take much to produce publications in medical education\u2014there are always journals who look for trainees to contribute to the field whether it be an editorial or systematic review or innovative ideas.

In 2019, health coverage for adults has start- ed to decline again after a decade of gains,10 so the possibility of this becoming a long-term trend has to be considered in planning for the treatment of the young population as they enter adulthood. 11 Final thoughtsSome issues, including the increase in tobacco usage and aging patients with more complex problems, are likely to be addressed through both continuing education and guidelines/standards. On the other hand, with a growing population of individuals under 30, we can expect increasing unrest with the status quo, a demand for change in public policy, and a higher adoption of new models for the diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care of health-related issues. In order to have a real impact, organizations will need to explore new partnerships for ad-dressing issues related to climate change and the increase in tobacco use by minors. Members need to stay up-to-date using information cu-rated and shared by trusted organizations and sources. References 1. American Medical Association. Principles of medical ethics.

DEWAN MD, FCCP The conventional approach to treat hypoventilation has been to use noninvasive ventilation (NIV), while continuous positive airway pres-sure (CPAP) that does not augment alve-olar ventilation improves gas exchange by maintaining upper airway patency and increasing func-tional residual capacity. Why, then, are we debat-ing the use of CPAP vs NIV in the treatment of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)? To understand this rationale, it is important to first review the pathophysiology of OHS. The hallmark of OHS is resting daytime awake arterial PaCO 2 of 45 mm Hg or greater in an obese pa-tient (BMI > 30 kg/m 2) in absence of any other identifiable cause. To recognize why only some but not all obese subjects develop OHS, it is important to understand the differ-ent components of pathophysiology that contribute to hypoventilation: (1) obesity-related reduction infunctional residual capacity andlung compliance in of breathing; (2)central hypoventilation related toleptin resistance and reductionin respiratory drive with REM hy-poventilation; and (3) upper airwayobstruction caused by upper airwayfat deposition along with low FRCcontributing to pharyngeal airwaynarrowing and 2019; 28:180097). CPAP vs NIV for OHSLet us examine some of the studies that have compared the short-term efficacy of CPAP vs NIV in patients with OHS. In a small ran-domized controlled trial (RCT), the effectiveness of CPAP and NIV was compared in 36 patients with OHS (Piper AJ, et al. Thorax. 2008;63:395). Reduction in PaCO 2 at 3 months was similar between the two groups. However, patients with persistent nocturnal desatu-ration despite optimal CPAP were excluded from the study. In anoth-er RCT of 60 patients with OHS who were either in stable condi-tion or after an episode of acute on chronic hypercapnic respira-tory failure, the use of CPAP or NIV showed similar improvements at 3 months in daytime PaCO 2, quality of life, and sleep parame-ters (Howard ME, et al. Thorax. 2017;72:437). In one of the largest randomized control trials, the Spanish Pickwick study randomized 221 patients with OHS and AHI >30/h to NIV , CPAP , and lifestyle modification (Masa et al. J Respir Crit Care Med. 2015:192:86). PAP therapy includ-ed NIV that consisted of in-lab titration with bilevel PAP therapy targeted to tidal volume 5-6 mL/kg of actual body weight or CPAP . Lifestyle modification served as the control group. Primary out-come was the change in PaCO 2 at 2 months. Secondary outcomes were symptoms, HRQOL, polysomno-graphic parameters, spirometry, and 6-min walk distance (6 MWD). Mean AHI was 69/h, and mean PAP settings for NIV and CPAP were 20/7.7 cm and 11 cm H 2O, respectively. NIV provided the greatest improvement in PaCO 2 and serum HCO3 as compared with control group but not relative to CPAP group. CPAP improved PaCO 2 as compared with control group only after adjustment of PAP use. Spirometry and 6 MWD and some HRQOL measures improved slightly more with NIV as com-pared with CPAP . Improvement in symptoms and polysomnographic parameters was similar between the two groups. In another related study by the same group (Masa JF, et al. Tho-rax. 2016;71:899), 86 patients with OHS and mild OSA (AHI <30/h), were randomized to NIV and life-style modification. Mean AHI was 14/h and mean baseline PaCO 2 was 49 +/-4 mm Hg. The NIV group with mean PAP adherence at 6 hours showed greater im-provement in PaCO 2 as compared with lifestyle modification (6 mm vs 2.8 mm Hg). They concluded that NIV was better than lifestyle modification in patients with OHS and mild OSA. To determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of CPAP vs NIV , patients in the Pickwick study, who were initially assigned to either CPAP or NIV treatment group, were continued on their respective treatments, while sub-jects in the control group were again randomized at 2 months to either CPAP or NIV (Masa JF, et al. Lancet. 2019;393:1721). All subjects (CPAP n=107; NIV n=97) were followed for a minimum of 3 years. CPAP and NIV settings (pressure-targeted to desired tidal volume) were determined by in-lab titration without transcutaneous CO 2 monitor, and daytime adjust- ment of PAP to improve oxygen saturation. Primary outcome was the number of hospitalization days per year. Mean CPAP was 10.7 cm H 2O pressure and NIV 19.7/8.18 cm H2O pressure with an average respiratory rate of 14/min. Medi-an PAP use and adherence > 4 h, respectively, were similar between the two groups (CPAP 6.0 h, ad-herence > 4 h 67% vs NIV 6.0/h, adherence >4 h 61%). Median du-ration of follow-up was 5.44 years (IOR 4.45-6.37 years) for both groups. Mean hospitalization days per patient-year were similar be- Dr. Dewan Continued on following pageThe hallmark of OHS is resting daytime awake arterial PaCO2 of 45 mm Hg or greater in an obese patient (BMI > 30 kg/m2) in absence of any other identifiable cause. 46_47_48_57_58_59_CHPH19_11.indd 62 11/6/19 10:00 AMMDEDGE.COM/CHESTPHYSICIAN \u007f NOVEMBER 2019 xl2 39 RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.34-1.77; P =0.561). Overall mortality, adverse cardiovascular events, and arterial blood gas pa-rameters were similar between the two groups, suggesting equal effica-cy of CPAP and NIV in this group of stable patients with OHS with an AHI >30/h. Given the low com-plexity and cost of CPAP vs NIV , the authors concluded that CPAP may be the preferred PAP treat-ment modality until more studies are available. An accompanying editorial (Murphy PB, et al. Lancet. 2019; 393:1674), discussed that since this study was powered for superiority as opposed to noninferiority of NIV (20% reduction in hospital-ization with NIV when compared with CPAP), superiority could not be shown, due to the low event rate for hospitalization (NIV 1.44 days vs CPAP 1.63 days). It is also possible optimum NIV titration may not have been determined since TCO 2 was not used. Further- more, since this study was done only in patients with OHS and AHI >30/h, these results may not be applicable to patients with OHS and low AHI < 30/h who are more likely to have central hypoventi-lation and comorbidities, and this group may benefit from NIV as compared with CPAP . Novel modes of bi-level PAP therapyThere are limited data on the use of the new bi-level PAP modalities, such as volume-targeted pressure support ventilation (PS) with fixed or auto-EPAP . The use of intel-ligent volume-assured pressure support ventilation (iV APS) vs standard fixed pressure support ventilation in select OHS patients (n=18) showed equivalent control of chronic respiratory failure with no worsening of sleep quality and better PAP adherence (Kelly JL, et al. Respirology. 2014;19:596). In another small randomized, dou-ble-blind, crossover study, done on two consecutive nights in 11 patients with OHS, the use of au-to-adjusting EPAP was noninferior to fixed EPAP (10.8 cm vs 11.8 cm H 2O pressure), with no differences in sleep quality and patient prefer-ence (McArdle N. Sleep . 2017;40:1). Although the data are limited, these small studies suggest the use of new PAP modalities, such as variable PS to deliver target volumes and auto EPAP could offer the poten-tial to initiate bi-level PAP therapy in outpatients without the in-lab Continued from previous pageMeet the new CHEST\u00ae journal Deputy Editors Christopher L.

More studies are needed before bi-level PAP therapy can be safely initiated in outpatients with OHS. Summary How can we utilize the most ef-fective PAP therapy for patients with OHS? Can we use a pheno-type-dependent approach to PAP treatment options? The answer is probably yes. Recently published ATS Clinical Practice Guide-line (Am J Respir Crit Care Med.2019;200:e6-e24) suggests the use of PAP therapy for stable ambu-latory patients with OHS as com-pared with no PAP therapy, and patients with OHS with AHI >30/h (approximately 70% of the OHS patients) can be initially started on CPAP instead of NIV . Patients who have persistent nocturnal de-saturation despite optimum CPAP can be switched to NIV . On the other hand, data are limited on the use of CPAP in patients with OHS with AHI <30/h, and these pa-tients can be started on NIV . PAP adherence >5-6 h, and weight loss using a multidisciplinary approach should be encouraged for all pa-tients with OHS.
