If you have been told that you could benefit from meeting with an experienced Columbia, MD natural medicine doctor but you're unsure of whether you're comfortable doing so, that's okay. All too often, natural medicine is referenced in such vague terms that many people - very understandably - are uncertain of what to expect when connecting with a naturopathic physician. While we will provide you with some basic information about natural medicine below in an effort to begin setting your mind at ease, please know that the team at Patapsco Integrative Medicine & Rehab is always happy to answer specific questions and to address specific concerns. You shouldn't be dissuaded from seeking potentially beneficial care simply because you don't yet have all the information you need to make informed choices about your options. This initial question of \"What is natural medicine?\" is most efficiently answered as an alternative approach to medicine that promotes overall patient wellness through non-invasive means. There are a host of treatment types utilized by practitioners of natural medicine - from homeopathy to herbal supplementation and acupuncture to address both underlying health challenges and overall promotion of physical, mental, and emotional health. Who Can Benefit from Natural Medicine? Individuals of all ages can benefit from connecting with an experienced Columbia natural medicine doctor. Because the model of natural medicine involves both prevention of health-related issues and treatment of existing conditions, healthy people and those who are struggling can both benefit from this approach. When patients are healthy, practitioners focus on bolstering their natural healing responses in order to keep them healthy. When patients are struggling with various challenges, practitioners work to identify the underlying causes of their strife so that they can treat both underlying causes and symptoms as efficiently and effectively as possible. The Costs of Natural Medical Care Sometimes, people hesitate to connect with the team at Patapsco Integrative Medicine & Rehab because they have been led to believe that the costs of natural medicine are steeper than those of Western approaches. In reality, natural medicine is often far less expensive in the long run because of its focus on preventing medical challenges from developing and because of its focus on treating underlying conditions, not symptoms alone. By not masking underlying causes by simply managing symptoms - as is too often the case with exclusively Western approaches - natural medicine practitioners are often in a position to better determine whether a condition is truly healing. When too much unnecessary prescription medication - patients should unquestionably stay on those medications that are necessary - leads a patient to believe that their asymptomatic state means that they're cured, underlying conditions can fester and flare until they become truly costly conditions. By working with an experienced Columbia natural medicine doctor, you can mitigate this risk of such escalation. With that said, if you are concerned about costs, don't hesitate to let us know what your concerns are. We have been practicing for a long time and can give you some solid feedback and clarity to better inform your decision-making process.
