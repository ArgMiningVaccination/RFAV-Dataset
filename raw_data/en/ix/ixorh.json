Use caution when administering ProQuad and M-M-R\u00aeII to individuals with anaphylaxis or immediate hypersensitivity to eggs. - ProQuad, M-M-R\u00aeII, and VARIVAX are contraindicated in certain individuals, including those with: immunodeficiency or who are immunosuppressed; an active - Pregnancy: ProQuad, M-M-R\u00aeII, and VARIVAX are contraindicated for use in pregnant women. Do not administer ProQuad or VARIVAX to individuals who are planning to become pregnant in the next 3 months. Do not administer M-M-R\u00aeII to individuals who are planning to become pregnant in the next month. - Febrile Seizures: Administration of ProQuad (dose 1) to children 12 to 23 months old who have not been previously vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella, nor had a history of the wild-type infections, is associated with higher rates of fever and febrile seizures at 5 to 12 days after vaccination when compared to children vaccinated with a first dose of both M-M-R\u00aeII and VARIVAX administered concomitantly. - Febrile Seizures: Use caution when administering ProQuad and M-M-R\u00aeII to individuals with a history of febrile seizures. - Family History of Immunodeficiency: Vaccination with ProQuad, M-M-R\u00aeII, and VARIVAX should be deferred in individuals with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the individual's immune status has been evaluated and the individual has been found to be immunocompetent. - Thrombocytopenia: Transient thrombocytopenia has been reported within 4-6 weeks following vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Carefully evaluate the potential risk and benefit of vaccination in children with thrombocytopenia or in those who experienced thrombocytopenia after vaccination with a previous dose of a measles, mumps, and rubella-containing vaccine. - Varicella Transmission vaccinees administered ProQuad or VARIVAX to avoid: close contact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination since transmission of varicella vaccine virus to susceptible contacts has been reported. Varicella vaccine virus transmission may occur between vaccine recipients and contacts susceptible to varicella including healthy individuals. - Immune Globulins and Transfusions: Immune Globulins and other blood products should not be given concomitantly with ProQuad, M-M-R\u00aeII, or VARIVAX. - Use of Salicylates: Avoid use of salicylates in children and adolescents administered ProQuad or VARIVAX for 6 weeks following vaccination due to the association of Reye Syndrome with salicylate therapy and wild-type varicella infection. - Adverse Events: The following adverse events have been reported for both subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of ProQuad, reactions (pain/tenderness/soreness, erythema, and swelling); and rash on the body or at the injection site. Additionally, irritability has been reported for the subcutaneous injections of ProQuad, M-M-R\u00aeII, and VARIVAX. - ProQuad Systemic Vaccine-Related Adverse Events: Systemic vaccine-related adverse events that were reported at a significantly greater rate in recipients of subcutaneous ProQuad than in recipients of the component vaccines administered concomitantly were fever and measles-like rash. - VARIVAX Dose-related Adverse Events: In a clinical trial involving children who received 2 doses of VARIVAX 3 months apart, the incidence of injection-site clinical complaints observed in the first 4 days following vaccination was slightly higher post-dose 2 (overall incidence 25.4%) than post-dose 1 (overall incidence 21.7%), whereas the incidence of systemic clinical complaints in the 42-day follow-up period was lower post-dose 2 (66.3%) than post-dose 1 (85.8%). - Concomitant Vaccines With ProQuad: ProQuad may be administered concomitantly with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine.

What is the CPT (Measles, and for ProQuad is 90710. are storage for ProQuad\u00ae (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus ProQuad\u00ae (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Live)? Storage Temperature Range To maintain potency, ProQuad must be stored frozen between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C). Use of dry ice may subject ProQuad to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Before reconstitution, store the lyophilized vaccine in a freezer at a temperature between 58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (50\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C) for up to 18 months. Any freezer (eg, chest, frost-free) that reliably maintains an average temperature between 58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (50\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C) and has a separate sealed freezer door is acceptable for storing ProQuad. Routine defrost cycling of a frost-free freezer is acceptable. Temperature Range Prior to Reconstitution ProQuad may be stored at refrigerator temperature (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F, 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) for up to 72 hours prior to reconstitution. Discard any ProQuad vaccine stored at 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F which is not used within 72 hours of removal from 5\u00b0F (-15\u00b0C) storage. Light Exposure Protect the vaccine from light at all times since such exposure may inactivate the vaccine viruses. Guidelines for Reconstituted Vaccine - IF NOT USED IMMEDIATELY, THE RECONSTITUTED VACCINE MAY BE STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, PROTECTED FROM LIGHT, FOR UP TO 30 MINUTES. - DISCARD RECONSTITUTED VACCINE IF IT IS NOT USED WITHIN 30 MINUTES. - DO NOT FREEZE RECONSTITUTED VACCINE. Diluent Storage Temperature Diluent should be stored separately at room temperature (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F, 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C), or in a refrigerator (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F, 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C).

What are the CDC recommendations for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines? What are the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines?
