NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Shingrix p owder and suspension for suspension for injection Herpes zoster vaccine (recombinant , adjuvanted) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION After reconstitution, one dose (0.5 m L) contains: plant extract -21) 50 micrograms 3-O-desacyl -4'-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) from Salmonella minnesota 50 micrograms 3 glycoprotein E (gE) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovar y (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder and suspension for suspension for injection. The powder is white. The suspension is an opalescent, colourless to pale brownish liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Shingrix is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post -herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in : adults 50 years of age or older ; adults 18 years of age or older at increased risk of HZ . The use of Shingrix should be in accordance with official recommendations . 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The primary vaccination schedule consists of two doses of 0.5 mL each: an initial dose followed by a second dose 2 months later. If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary , the second dose can be administered between 2 and 6 months after the first dose (see section 5.1) . For subjects who are or might become immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy, and whom would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule, the second dose can be given 1 to 2 months after the initial dose (see section 5.1 ). The need for booster doses following the primary v accination schedule has not been established (see section 5.1) . Shingrix can be given with the same schedule in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated HZ vaccine (see section 5.1). 3 Shingrix is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of S hingrix in children and adolescents ha ve not been established. No data are available. Method of administration For intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered prod uct should be clearly recorded. Prior to immunis ation As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. As with other vaccines, vaccination with Shingrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. However, t he presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination. As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. The vaccine is for prophylactic use only and is not intended for treatment o f established clinical disease. Shingrix should not be administer ed intravascularly or intradermally. Subcutaneous administration is not recommended. Maladministration via the subcutaneous route may lead to an increase in transient local reactions. Shingrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder since bleeding may occur following intramuscular adm inistration to these subjects. Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthe sia and tonic -clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. In a post -marketing observational study in individuals aged 65 years or older, an increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (estimated 3 excess cases per million doses administered) was observed during the 42 days following vaccination with Shingrix. Available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with Shingrix. 4 There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support replacing a dose of Shingrix with a dose of an other HZ vaccine. There are limited data to support the use of Shingrix in individuals with a history of HZ (see section 5.1). H ealth care profess ionals therefore need to weigh the benefits and risks of HZ vaccination on an individual basis. Excipients This medicin al product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. This medicin al product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium -free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Shingrix can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted inactivated pertussis vaccine (dTpa) . The vaccines should be administere d at different injection sites. In four phase III, controlled, open- label clinical studies, adults 50 years of age were randomised to receive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart administered either concomitantly at the first dose or non-concomitantly with an unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal Al 3+ (N=830; Zoster -042). The immune responses of the co-administered vaccines were unaffected, with the exception of lower geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for one of the pertussis antigens (pertactin) when Shingrix is co- administered with the dTpa vaccine. The clinical relevance of this data is not known. The adverse reactions of fever and shivering were more frequent when PPV23 vaccine was co-administered with Shingrix (16% and 21%, res pectively) compared to when Shingrix was given alone (7% for both adverse reactions) . Concomitant use with other vaccines is not recommended due to lack of data . 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no data from the use of Shingrix in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Shingrix during pregnancy. Breast -feeding The effect on breast -fed infants of administration of Shingrix to their mothers has not been studied. It is unknown whether Shingrix is excreted in human milk. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects with respect to fertility in male s or female s (see section 5.3). 5 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Shingrix may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines in the 2 - 3 days following vaccination. Fatigue and malaise may occur following administration (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile In adults aged 50 years and above, t he most frequently reported adverse reaction s were pain at the injection site Most of these reactions were not long- lasting (median duration of 2 to 3 days) . Reactions reported as severe lasted 1 to 2 days . In adults 18 years of age who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy (referred to as immunocompromised (IC)), the safety profile was consistent with that observed in adults 50 years and above. There are limited data in adults aged 18- 49 years at increased risk of HZ who are not IC. Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: - studies in IC adults 18 years of age (pooled analysis) : the inciden ce of pain at the injection site, fatigue, myalgia, headache, shivering and feve r was higher in adults aged 18- 49 years compared to those aged 50 years and above. - studies in adults 50 years of age (pooled analysis) : the incidence of myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in adults aged 50- 69 years compared to those aged 70 years and above. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The safety profile presented below is based on a pooled analysis of data generated in placebo - controlled clinical studies on 5 887 adults 50- 69 years of age and 8 758 adults 70 years of age. In clinical studies in IC adults 18 years of age (1 587 subjects) the safety profile is consistent with the data presented in Table 1 below. Adverse reactions reported during post -marketing surveillance are also tabulated below. Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: Very common ( 1/10) Common ( 1/100 ) Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000) Very rare (< 1/10 000) Within each frequency grouping the adverse reactions are reported in the order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1 : Adverse Reactions 6 System Organ Class1 Frequency Adverse reactions Blood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon lymphadenopathy Immune system disorders Rare hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, an gioedema 2 Nervous system disorders Very common headache Gastrointestinal disorders Very common gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Very common myalgia Uncommon arthralgia General disorders and administration site conditions Very common injection site reactions (such as pain, redness, swelling), fatigue, chills, fever Common injection site pruritus, malaise 1According to MedDRA (medical dictionary for regulatory activities) terminology 2Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties group: Vaccines, v aricella zoster vaccines, ATC code: J07BK03. Mechanism of action By combining the VZV specific antigen (gE) with an adjuvant system (AS01 B), Shingrix is designed to induce antigen -specific cellular and humoral immune responses in individuals with pre -existing immunity against VZV. Non-clinical data show that AS01 B induces a local and transient activation of the innate immune system through specific molecular pathways. This facilitates the recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells carrying gE -derived antigens in the draining lymph node, which in turn l eads to the generation of gE -specific CD4+ T cells and antibodies. The adjuvant effect of AS01 B is the result of interactions between MPL and QS -21 formulated in liposomes. 7 Clinical e fficacy of Two placebo- controlled, observer -blind efficacy studies of Shingrix were conducted in adults 50 years with 2 doses administered 2 months apart : - ZOE -50 (Zoster -006): Total Vaccinated C ohort (TVC) of 15 405 adults 50 years who received at least one dose of either Shingrix (N=7 695) (Zoster -022): TVC of 13 900 adults 70 years who received at least one dose of either Shingrix (N=6 950) or placebo (N=6 950). The studies were not designed to demonstrate efficacy in subgroups of frail individuals, including those with multiple comorbidities, although these subjects were not excluded from the studies. Two phase III, placebo- controlled , observer -blind studies evaluating Shingrix efficacy were conducted in IC adults 18 years with 2 doses administered 1- 2 months apart: - Zoster -002: TVC of 1 846 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants (aHSCT) recipients who received at least one dose of either Shingrix (N=922) or placebo (N=924) 50 -70 days post- transplant , 21.3 % (Shingrix) and 2 0.5% (placebo) of the subjects received at least one immunosuppressive (IS) treatment (for a duration of at least one day) from HSCT up to 30 days after Dose 2 (TVC). The proportion of subjects by underlying disease was: 53.1 % (Shingrix) and 53.4 % (placebo) for multiple myeloma (MM) and 46.9% (Shingrix) and 46.6% (placebo) for other diagnosis . - Zoster -039: TVC of 562 subjects with hematologic malignancies who received at least one dose of either Shingrix (N=283) or placebo (N=279) during a cancer therapy course ( 37%) or after the full cancer therapy course ( 63%). The proportion of subjects by underlying disease was: 70.7% (Shingrix) and 71.3 % (placebo) for MM and other diseases, 14.5% (Shingrix) and 14.0% (placebo) leukaemia (CLL) . These studies were not designed to assess the impact of concomitant use of IS therapy on vaccine efficacy or to assess the impact of specific IS treatments on vaccine efficacy. Most vaccine recipients were not under IS therapy at the time of vaccination (s ee above). Not all types of IS therapies were used in the populations studied. Incide nce of HZ and PHN cases as well as vaccine efficacy were evaluated in the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC), i.e. excluding adults who did not receive the second dose of vaccine or who had a confirmed diagnosis of HZ within one month after the second dose. Shingrix significantly decreased the incidence of HZ compared with placebo in : - adults 50 years (ZOE -50): 6 vs. 210 cases ; - adults 70 years ( pooled analysis of ZOE -50 and ZOE -70): 25 vs. 284 cases ; - adults 18 years with aHSCT (Zoster -002): 49 vs. 135 cases; - adults 18 years with hematologic malignancies (Zoster -039): 2 vs. 14 cases . Vaccine efficacy was calculated post -hoc.

Post -hoc analysis of efficacy against confirmed HZ undertaken in patients with common conditions (chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, depression or diabetes mellitus), in dicates that the vaccine efficacy is aligned with the overall HZ efficacy. Shingrix significantly decreased the incidence of PHN compared with placebo in : - adults 50 years (ZOE -50): 0 vs. 18 cases ; - adults 70 years ( pooled analysis of ZOE -50 and ZOE -70): 4 vs. 36 cases ; - adults 18 years with aHSCT ( Zoster -002): 1 vs. 9 cases. 9 Vaccine efficacy results against PHN are presented in Table 3.

A further reduction of PHN incidence in subjects with confirmed HZ could not be demonstrated due to the limited number of HZ cases in the vaccine group. In the fourth year after vaccination, the efficacy against HZ was adults 50 years (ZOE -50) and adults 70 years (pooled ZOE -50 and ZOE -70), respectively. The duration of protection beyond 4 years is currently under investigation. 10 In Zoster -002, during a follow -up period starting 1 month post -dose 2 (i.e. corresponding to approximately 6 months after a HSCT) until 1 year after aHSCT, when the risk for HZ is the highest, the efficacy against HZ was (95% CI: disease, neurologic disease including stroke , and visceral disease. In the pooled analysis of ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, Shingrix significantly reduced the se HZ CI: 43.3; 99.8) in adults 50 years (1 vs. 16 cases) and adults 70 years (1 vs. 12 cases), respectively. No cases of visceral disease or stroke were reported during these studies. In Zoster -002, Shingrix 96.0) in aHSCT recipients 18 years vs 13 cases). In addition, in Zoster -002, of Shingrix on HZ -related pain Overall in ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, there was a general trend towards less severe HZ -related pain in subjects vaccinated with Shingrix compared to placebo. As a consequence of the high vaccine efficacy against HZ, a low number of breakthrough cases were accrued, and it was therefore not po ssible to draw firm conclusions on these study objectives. In subjects 70 years with at least one confirmed HZ episode ( ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 pooled) , Shingrix significantly reduced the use and the duration of -related pain duration of pain medication use was 32.0 and 44.0 days in the Shingrix and placebo group, respectively. In subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode, Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum average pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 3.9 vs. 5.5, P -value = 0.049 and mean = 4.5 vs. 5.6, P -value = 0.043, in subjects 50 years (ZOE -50) and 70 years (ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 pooled), respectively). In addition, in subjects 70 years (ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 pooled), Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum worst pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 5.7 vs. 7.0, P -value = 0.032). The burden- of-illness ( BOI) sc ore incorporates the incidence of HZ with the severity and duration of acute and chronic HZ -related pain over a 6 month period following rash onset. The efficacy in reducing BOI was 98.4% (95% CI: 92.2; 100) in and 92.1% (95% CI: 90.4; 93.8) in subjects 70 years and ZOE -70 pooled). In Zoster -002, Shingrix significantly reduced the by 38.5% (95% CI: 11.0; 57.6) in aHSCT recipients 18 years with at least one confirmed HZ episode. Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum average pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 4.7 vs. 5.7, P -value = 0.018) and the maximum worst pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 5.8 vs. 7.1, P -value = 0.011). The percentage of subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode in Zoster -002 using at least one pain medication was 65.3% and 69.6 % in the Shingrix and placebo group, respectively. The median duration of pain medication use was 21.5 and 47.5 days in the Shingrix and placebo group, respectively. Additionally, in Zoster -002, the efficacy in of protection has not been established; therefore the level of immune response that provides protection against HZ is unknown. In adults 50 years, t he immune responses to Shingrix , given as 2 doses 2 months apart, were evaluated in a subset of subjects from the phase III efficacy studies ZOE -50 [humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (CMI)] and ZOE -70 (humoral immunity). The gE -specific immune responses (humoral and CMI) elicited by Shingrix are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively . 12 Table 4 : Humoral immunogenicity of Shingrix in adults 50 years (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) Anti -gE immune response^ Age group (years) Month 3* Month 38** N GMC (mIU/mL ) (95% CI) Median fold increase (Q1; Q3) N GMC (mIU/mL ) (95% of concentrations vs. pre-vaccination (Q1; Q3) ZOE- 50 50 1 577.9) 41.9 (20.8; (11 345.6; 12 522.7) 9.3 (4.9; 19.5) Pooled ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 70 742 49 691.5 (47 250.8; 14.5) According- To-Protocol ^ Anti- gE immune response = anti- gE levels, measured by anti -gE enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (gE ELISA) * Month 3 = 1 month post -dose 2 ** Month 38 = 3 years post -dose 2 N Number of evaluable subjects at the specified time point (for the GMC) CI Confidence interval GMC Geometric Mean Concentration Q1; Q3 First and third quartiles Table 5 : Cell -mediated immunogenicity of Shingrix in adults 50 years (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) gE-specific CD4[2+] T cell response^ Age group (years) Month 3* Month 38** N Median frequency (Q1; Q3) Median fold increase of frequency vs. pre-vaccination (Q1; Q3) N Median frequency (Q1; Q3) Median fold increase of frequency vs. pre-vaccination (Q1; Q3) ZOE -50 50 164 1 T cell response = gE CD4+ T activity, measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay (CD4[2+] T cells = CD4+ T cells expressing at least 2 of 4 selected immune markers) * Month 3 = 1 month post -dose 2 ** Month 38 = 3 years post -dose 2 N Number of evaluable subjects at the specified time point for the median frequency Q1; Q3 First and third quartiles *** The gE -specific CD4[2+] data in the 70 years of age group were only generated in ZOE -50 because CD4+ T cell activity was not assessed in ZOE -70 13 Data from a phase II, open -label, single group, follow -up clinical study in adults 60 years (Zoster - 024) indicate that the vaccine -induced immune response (humoral and CMI) persists up to approximately 6 years following a 0, 2- month schedule (N= 119). The median anti -gE antibody concentration was greater than 7- fold above the baseline pre -vaccination median concentration. The median frequency of gE -specific CD4[2+] T cells was greater than 3.7 -fold above baseline pre-vaccination median frequency. In IC adults 18 years, the humoral and CMI responses to Shingrix, given as 2 doses 1 -2 months apart, were evaluated in: - one phase I/II study: Zoster -015 (HIV infected subjects, the majority ( 76.42 %) being stable on antiretroviral therapy (for at least one year) with a CD4 T -cell count 200 /mm3); - one phase II/III study: Zoster -028 (patients with solid tumou rs undergoing ; - three phase III studies: -002 (aHSCT with hematologic malignancies vaccinated during a cancer therapy course or after the full cancer therapy course) and Zoster -041 (renal transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppressive treatment at the time of vaccination ).

The clinical relevance in terms of impact on efficacy, on the short and long term, is unknown. 15 Table 7 : Cell -mediated immunogenicity of Shingrix in IC adults 18 years ( ATP cohort for immunogenicity) gE-specific CD4[2+] T cell response^ Month 3 Month 13/18/25 N Median frequency (Q1; Q3) Median fold increase of frequency vs. pre-vaccination (Q1; Q3) N Median frequency (Q1; Q3) vs. (16.4; 23.4 response = gE CD4+ T activity, measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay (CD4[2+] T cells = CD4+ T cells expressing at least 2 of 4 selected immune markers) N Number of evaluable subjects at the specifi ed time point for the median frequency Q1; Q3 First and third quartiles * Blood for CMI was only collected from the group of subjects that received the first dose of Shingrix 8- 30 days before the start of a chemotherapy cycle (i.e. largest group of the st udy) Immunogenicity in subjects receiving 2 doses of Shingrix 6 months apart Efficacy has not been assessed for the 0, 6-month schedule . In a phase III, open- label clinical study (Zoster -026) where 238 adults 50 years of age were equally randomi sed to receive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 or 6 months apart, the humoral immune response following the 0, 6- month schedule was demonstrated to be non- inferior to the response with the 0, 2-month schedule. T he anti -gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 38 153.7 mIU/mL (95% CI: CI: 39 697.0; 49 607.2) following th e 0, 6- month schedule and the 0, 2- month schedule , respectively. 16 Subjects with a history of HZ prior to vaccination Subjects with a history of HZ were excluded from ZOE -50 and ZOE -70. In a phase III, uncontrolled, open- label clinical study (Zoster -033), 96 adults 50 years of age with a physician -documented history of HZ received 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart. Laboratory confirmation of HZ cases was not part of the study procedures. The anti -gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 47 758.7 mIU/mL (95% CI: 42 258.8; 53 974.4) . There were 9 reports of suspected HZ in 6 subjects over a one- year follow up period. This is a higher recurrence rate than generally reported in observational studies in unvaccinated individuals with a history of HZ. (See section 4.4) Immunogenici ty in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine In a phase III, open- label, multicentre clinical study (Zoster -048), a 2 dose schedule of Shingrix 2 months apart was assessed in 215 adults 65 years of age with a previous history of vaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine 5 years earlier compared to 215 matched subjects who had never received live attenuated HZ vaccine. The immune response to Shingrix was unaffected by prior vaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine.

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Shingrix is and what it is used for What Shingrix is used for Shingrix is a vaccine that helps to protect adults against shingles ( herpes zoster ) and post -herpetic neuralgia (PHN) lasting nerve pain that follows shingles . Shingrix is given to : adults 50 years and above ; adults 18 years and above who are at increased risk of shingles . Shingrix cannot be used to prevent chickenpox (va ricella). What shingles is Shingles is a rash with blisters that is often painful. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several weeks. Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, if your immune system (the body's natural defences) becomes weaker (due to age , an illness or a medicine you are taking) , the virus can cause shingles. Complications related to shingles Shingles may lead to complications . The most common complication of shingles is : long- lasting nerve pain - called post -herpetic neuralgia or PHN. After the shingles blisters heal, you may get pain which can last for months or years and may be severe. Other complications of shingles are: scars where the blisters have been. skin infections, we akness, muscle paralysis and loss of hearing or vision - these are less common. How Shingrix works Shingrix reminds your body about the virus that causes shingles. This helps your immune system (the body's natural defences) stay prepared to fight the virus and protect you against shingles and its complications. 32 2. What you need to know before you receive Shingrix You must not be given Shingrix if you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. You must not be given Shingrix if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you receive Shingrix if: you have a severe infection with a high temperature (fever). In these cases, the vaccination may have to be postponed until you have recovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first; you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you receive Shingrix. Fainting can occur before or after any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. Shingrix cannot be used as a treatment if you already have shingles or shingles -related complications. As with all vaccines, Shingrix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. Talk to your doctor if you experience temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakn ess, and paralysis (called Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome) after receiving Shingrix . A slightly increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (estimated 3 additional cases per million doses administered) has been reported in people aged 65 years and above after rec eiving Shingrix. Other medicines and Shingrix Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or have recently received any other vaccine. Shingrix can be given at the same time as other vaccines. A different injection site will be used for each vaccine. You may be more likely to experience feve r and/or shivering when 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is given at the same time as Shingrix . Pregnancy and breast -feeding If you are pregnant or breast -feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine.

This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium -free'. 33 3. How Shingrix is given Shingrix is given as an injection into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). You will receive 2 injections 2 months apart . If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 and 6 months after the first dose . Based on your medical condition, your doctor may also recommend that you receive the second injection 1 month after the first injection. You will be informed when you should come back for the second dose of Shingrix. Make sure you finish the complete vaccination course. This will maximise the protection o ffered by Shingrix.
