A genome sequence of a virus can reveal mutations in a virus that make it unique. Mutations are changes in a genome sequence (usually one-letter changes) and occur naturally over time. Collecting the genome sequence of virus specimens can also reveal information about the relatedness of viruses and the similarities shared among groups of viruses. Groups of same-species viruses that share a set of genome mutations are referred to as a lineage. Scientists compare viral genomes to better understand virus transmission, how viruses can spread from person to person. Sequencing allows Public Health Ocials to monitor viruses involved in outbreaks, characterize outbreaks, detect clusters of cases and monitor new lineages. Novel mutations can emerge with new lineages and scientists refer to these new lineages as emerging variants. Some of these variants are classied by CDC as variants of concern and others as variants being monitored, because of their attributes, which can be for example: increased transmissibility, decreased neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, or increased severity of disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has extensive information about the variant classication (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html), which is updated as new evidence becomes available. Sequencing can only be performed on samples that contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which means only samples used for molecular tests (such as PCR) can be included. For this reason, this report is limited to conrmed cases only. The genomes that are sequenced and compared are those of the virus, not humans. Sequencing can be performed on stored specimens at any time. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and batches of stored specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. The State of Hawaii has conducted sequencing on approximately 6% of positive specimens that were detected sincethebeginningofthetesting, whichranksamongthebestinthenationaccordingtotheCentersforDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#published-covid-sequences) In February 2021, the State Laboratories Division of the Hawaii Department of Health has ramped up the sequencing done on positive samples to increase the ability to detect the new variants of concern and variants being monitored early. Since then, between 15-20% of the samples that were detected positive on PCR Covid-19 tests were sequenced (see below for details). 3Acknowledgements This report integrates genomes sequenced since Jan 1, 2021 by: Institution Program/partner Count Percent Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratories Division3213 79.985% Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3)228 5.676% Quest Diagnostics Incorporated 238 5.925% Laboratory Corporation of America 163 4.058% Aegis Sciences Corporation 1.942% Helix/Illumina 54 1.344% Total 4017100.000% Notes: the samples sequenced by CDC in the NS3 program are collected, quality controlled and shipped to CDC by Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratory Division, Hawaii Department of Health County distribution of genomes sequenced since Jan 1st, 2021 Honolulu County Maui County Hawaii County Kauai County unknown Total 1879 494 473 122 245 3213 Notes: County information is currently unavailable except for the samples sequenced by LPRB. 4Short summary On September 21, 2021, the US government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG), which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of Defense (DoD) added a new class of SARS-CoV-2 variants designated as Variants Being Monitored (VBMs). This class includes variants with substitutions of concern, including previously designated Variants of Interest(VOIs) or Variants of Concern (VOCs), that are no longer detected or are circulating at very low levels in the United States, and as such, do not pose a signicant or imminent risk to public health in the United States. Alpha (B.1.1.7, Q.1-Q.8), Beta (B.1.351, B.1.351.2, B.1.351.3), been downgraded from Variants of Concern toVariants Being Monitored based on signicant and sustained reduction in national and regional proportions. Eta (B.1.525), Iota (B.1.526), Kappa (B.1.617.1), and B.1.617.3 have been downgraded from Variants of Interest toVariants Being Monitored based on signicant and sustained reduction in national and regional proportions. Additional Variants Being Monitored include Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429) and Zeta (P.2) based on their previous classication as Variants of Concern orVariants of Interest and Mu (B.1.621 and B.1.621.1). The vast majority (>99%) of the genomes from Hawaii sequenced in the last 2 weeks belong the Delta variant, most of them from the main lineage (B.1.617.2), but also from 15 additional sub-lineages (AY.*). LPRB (Laboratory Preparedness and Response Division, State Laboratories Division) has sequenced an additional 427 viral genomes in the last 2 weeks (since the last variant report was generated), using a new protocol allowing higher throughput. CDC and its commercial partners have sequenced 81 viral genomes from Hawaii in the last 2 weeks. These additional sequences have increased the percentage of the positive cases from the surge that have been sequenced, but even though the number of sequenced genomes for a certain 2-week interval has doubled, the percentages are much lower than pre-surge, because of the amplitude of the surge (about 10 times more cases in average than in previous months). 5Signicance of variants of concern and variants being monitored It is important to note that evidence to date shows that vaccination leads to milder cases, not requiring hospitalization, for all the variants of concern and variants being monitored that are described here, even if the ecacy of antibodies is diminished against some of these variants compared to the original version of the virus. Also,noneof these variants are classied as a \"variant of high consequence\" , according to CDC variant categories (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Consequence), which is a category that would imply a variant has the ability to evade diagnosis, signicantly reduce the vaccines eectiveness and protection against severe disease, signicantly reduce susceptibility to treatments or lead to more severe disease and increased hospitalizations. Variants of concern (VOC) Delta variant (B.1.617.2 and AY.* sub-lineages) B.1.617.2 was rst identied in India and it is also known as variant 21A. WHO labeled it Delta on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the L452R mutation in the spike protein that is present in Epsilon variants, plus a few additional spike mutations predicted to have functional consequences (e.g. T478K). The Delta variant is highly contagious, more than 2x as contagious as previous variants. For more information about Delta, go to (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html). Variants being monitored (VBM) Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 and Q.* sub-lineages) B.1.1.7 was rst identied in the United Kingdom and it is also known as VOC202012/01 and 20I/501Y.V1. WHO labeled it \"Alpha\" on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the N501Y mutation and a short deletion in the Spike (S) protein. This variant is concerning because it has been shown to be signicantly more transmissible (~50%) than the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages and recent analyses from the United Kingdom suggest that B.1.1.7 cases are more likely to require hospitalization. B.1.1.7 does not appear to evade vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses. Gamma variant (P.1 and P.1.* sub-lineages) P.1 was rst identied in Brazil and it also known as variant 20J/501Y.V3. WHO labeled it \"Gamma\" on May 31, 2021. This variant also contains the N501Y mutation, like B.1.1.7 but not the deletion in the spike protein. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. Beta variant (B.1.351 and B.1.351.* sub-lineages) B.1.351 was rst identied in South Africa and it is also known as 20H/501Y.V2. WHO labeled it \"Beta\" on May 31, 2021. This variant is highly infectious and can quickly spread from person to person. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. 6Mu variant (B.1.621) Lineage B.1.621 was rst identied in Columbia in January 2021 and it has a couple of mutations that are common with the Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma( P.1) variants, which have been associated with high transmissibility (N501Y) and a level of vaccine eciency decrease (E484K). Iota variant (B.1.526) B.1.526 was rst identied in New York and is classied by CDC as a variant being monitored, because there are signs that it has increased transmissibility. WHO has labeled it \"Iota\" on May 31, 2021. Some of the samples (but not all) of this variant contain a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. Epsilon variant (B.1.429 and B.1.427) These closely related variants, B.1.429 and B.1.427, were rst identied in California and designated initially as CA VUI1. WHO labeled them \"Epsilon\" on May 31, 2021. They can quickly spread from person-to-person, with an estimated ~20% higher eciency than the original virus. CDC has deescalated \"Epsilon\" from a \"variant of concern\" to \"variant of interest\" on June 29, 2021, due to the signicant decrease in the proportion of B.1.429/B.1.427 lineage viruses circulating nationally and available data indicating that vaccines and treatments are eective against this variant. CDC has removed B.1.429 and B.1.427 from the \"variants if interest\" list in July 2021 due to declining prevalence and very few detections in recent months. Zeta variant (P.2) P.2 was rst identied in Brazil and is classied by CDC as a variant being monitored. It contains a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. This variant has been removed from the \"variant of interest\" list in July 2021 due to few detections in recent months. shows the total number of variants by lineage detected in the State of Hawaii in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as follows orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , Variants being monitored are shown as follows: dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351), green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*), pink = Epsilon (lineages B.1.429 and B.1.427) and Iota (lineage B.1.526) The gray bar graph above it shows the percentage of the PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing may not be a random sample of all cases. This gure does not estimate the prevalence of the population. Sequencing can be performed on stored patient specimens at any time, so these numbers may change as additional specimens are sequenced, especially for the last 2-week period, for which a number of samples are currently being processed. 8Estimate of proportion of variants circulating in the viruses sequencedVariant Other Alpha Delta Gamma Beta Iota Epsilon Mu Notes: The chart above shows the estimate of biweekly percentages of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the State of Hawaii, grouped in two-week intervals (based on the date of collection of samples). Not all positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens are sequenced and sequenced specimens are not a random selection of all COVID-19 cases in Hawaii. This chart has been generated only counting samples that were selected randomly for the purpose of surveillance, to avoid over-representing the samples that were selected for investigations of clusters. The last 2-week interval numbers will most likely change, as a number of samples that are currently being processed will be added. Sequencing of certain specimens can be delayed for technical reasons. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. 9Variants of concern in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Delta 1713 B.1.617.2 India 1105 18 May 2021 14 Sep States 21321 Jun 2021 15 Sep 2021 AY.3 United States 136 28 Jun 2021 31 Aug AY.1 Europe 7530 Jun Aug States 3001 Jun 2021 19 Aug 2021 AY.14 United States 29 24 Jun 2021 27 Aug 2021 AY.13 United States 2609 Jun Aug 1323 Jul 2021 31 2021 Aug AY.12 Israel 1Jul 2021 Kingdom 1Aug 2021 Aug 2021 Variants being monitored in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Alpha 753 B.1.1.7 United Kingdom 705 21 Jan 2021 14 Aug 2021 Q.3 United States 4821 Mar 2021 02 Sep 2021 Beta B.1.351 South Africa 16 16 Feb 2021 01 Sep 2021 Gamma 185 P.1 Brazil 104 21 Mar 2021 21 Jul 2021 P.1.10 59 07 Dec 2020 05 Jun 2021 Iota B.1.526 New York 12806 Feb 2021 Jul 2021 Mu B.1.621 Columbia 3703 Jun 2021 30 Jul 2021 B.1.621.1 United States 10 27 May 2021 11 Aug 2021 10Honolulu County shows the total number of variants detected in Honolulu County in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown - (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as follows orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , Variants being monitored are shown as follows: dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351), green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*), pink = Epsilon (lineages Iota (lineage B.1.526) SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing may not be a random sample of all cases.
