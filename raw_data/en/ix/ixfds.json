This is your one-stop post for answering your dosing questions! How do I make a liquid homeopathic remedy for my dog or cat? - Fill a clean dropper bottle with distilled, reverse osmosis, or spring water only to the shoulder of the bottle, leaving a little air space. **Do not make your liquid homeopathic remedies in bottles that had herbal tinctures in them.** - Place one or two pellets into the dropper bottle. It doesn't matter how many pellet, but more than 2 is not necessary. - Let the pellets partially dissolve. Remember, the medicine in on the pills, not in the pills. You can give the remedy before the pellets have completely dissolved. - Hit the bottom of the bottle against your palm 10 times, activating the remedy. This is called \"succussion\" in homeopathic terminology; a process that activates the water. Since our bodies are composed of over 70% water, making a water potency allows for easy absorption for you or your animal.

Make a liquid potency (as described above) in a clean glass or dropper bottle. Give 4 doses of a few drops every 5-15 minutes, depending on the severity of the symptoms. Then dose once per hour for 2 more hours. As the symptoms improve, decrease the number of doses. How do I give a liquid remedy dose to my animal? For DOGS: Gently pull out the lower lip and squirt a few drops onto the gums or tongue - anywhere in the mouth is fine. The drops do not need to be swallowed, then only need to touch any mucous membrane. Alternatively, you can put the remedy in a bit of milk as a \"treat.\" For CATS: If they are agreeable, hold their head angled slightly to the ceiling which opens the mouth naturally. Squirt 1-2 drops into their mouth. Be careful not to use too many drops or this could make your cat choke. Alternatively, and more easily, give the remedy in water (if you are sure they will drink it) or in goat's or cow's milk or cream (any percentage is fine). Stir the remedy into about 1 tablespoon of milk to potentize the milk (or water) and the \"treat\" to your cat. This is my preferred method if your cat like milk. How do I give dry pellet doses to my animal by mouth? Be patient, experiment, and find the way that works best for each animal. Keep in mind: - The pellets do not need to be swallowed or completely dissolved, but should be in the mouth for at least 30 seconds. - Do not touch the pellets with your hands. - The smaller the pellets, the more likely your animal will not spit them out. Think about it this way - your cat cleans himself so there is hair and dirt in his mouth frequently. Your dog chews on all sorts of things and doesn't worry about spitting out debris. So, the #10 sized pellets, the size of poppy seeds, are the easiest to give in the dry form; however, they are not the most available at health food stores. There are 3 ways to give dry pellets to your dog or cat by mouth: - Place a few pellets into the cap and tip it directly into your pet's mouth. Make sure the cap does not touch any part of your dog, especially the tongue. If it happens, rinse the lid with hot water for a few seconds, dry carefully, and replace the lid on the bottle. Caring for your remedies will insure they will care for you for generations! - The large pellets available at health food stores are best dissolved in water or milk (as described above), but if that is not the chosen method, place 1-2 large pellets between a folded index card and mash into a powder. The, holding the mouth carefully, use the card to gently tip the powder into the animal's mouth. The powder will be quickly absorbed. This method requires some skill and patience! - Place a few pellets (by putting them in the cap) in the animal's bowl and let them lick the pellets. Many animals, especially dogs, will agree to this method. What should I know before giving homeopathic remedies? How often you give the dose depends on the severity of symptoms and the potency of the remedy. If I or your homeopathic vet do not offer specific directions to you about dosing, then these general guidelines apply: - Administer homeopathic medicine into a neutral mouth - this means No food or drinks (other than water) 15 minutes before or after dose. - Keep in mind that the higher the potency, the stronger the remedy (Ordered here from lowest to highest: 6C, 30C, 200C, 1M). - Do not touch the remedy you are dispensing to your animal. You may touch the remedy pellets if you are the one taking it. Giving Homeopathic Remedies To Animals A DIY Ebook with printable PDF Price: $10 How do I dose the remedies for acute and chronic illness? Dosing remedies depends on the nature of the illness, the strength (potency) of the remedy, the availability of the person dosing the animal, and the compliance of the animal to take the remedy. For Acute illness, accidents, sudden onset of symptoms: - Give the remedy as often as every 5 minutes until you see an improvement in symptoms. Improvement in symptoms could mean your animal is more relaxed, stops panting, closes their eyes, wants to be close to you, wants to eat or drink - anything that tells you they feel better. - Continue to give the remedy (this varies with remedy potency and situation) 2 more times, once per hour. You may need to repeat this once per rhythm for a few more doses if the situation seems appropriate. For example, if your dog has a nose bleed, you give Phosphorus 30C every 5 minutes for 4 doses, with a great decrease in bleeding. Repeat the remedy about every 15-30 minutes for one to two doses. Then wait about 1 hour or so until you're sure the bleeding has stopped. If the bleeding returns, repeat remedy once (or twice) as needed to complete the healing process. - The treatment of acute illness with homeopathic remedies requires you, the pet parent, to be observant, and to trust what you're seeing and feeling. The treatment is not rote - give the remedy frequently then back off and evaluate the response. If the response is good, then repeat only if the symptoms return. If there is no response, change the remedy and repeat the process. For Chronic illness: It's best to consult with a practitioner to give guidance on dosing remedies. Frequent dosing is not indicated if using high potencies (above 30C) but might be given early in treatment for very short periods. What are the things that don't matter about homeopathic remedies but are important to know? - The number of pellets in each dose does not matter at the potencies we most frequently use (X, C, M) but you will use up your supply if you give more than is needed. Giving more than one or two pellets (no matter the size of the remedy) is not needed. Directions on the bottles are just guidelines and required by the FDA, but are not needed to initiate the full effect of the remedies. One pellet is really all you need! - The time of day/night for each dosing is not important unless your practitioner clearly defines when to dose. Some remedies are best given during certain times of the day or night, but this suggestion should be left to the practitioner. For acute situations, give the remedy immediately. - The amount of milk or water used to dissolve the pellets is not critical except when using the LM potencies, which are the more typically prescribed for chronic ailments. For the more common remedy potencies (X, C, M), diluting the pellets in any amount of water is fine. The animal does not have to drink that entire amount, only a few drops. Even one drop is enough for the body to recognize the potentized water or milk. It is the Vital Force, or the energy the body, that recognizes the remedy and is stimulated to start the healing process. - Dissolving the pellets completely is not important because the medicine is on the pellets, not in the pellets. Just dissolve the pellets a bit by stirring vigorously (I prefer a wooden spoon) or succussing a dropper bottle against the palm of your hand about 10 times. What are the important things to remember when using remedies? It is possible to contaminate the remedy by touching the dropper on your pet's mouth or on yourself. Rinse it under hot water for a few seconds before returning the dropper to the bottle. The use of perfumes, essential oils, scented candles, or pet shampoos may antidote your pet's remedy. Cell phones, microwave ovens and computers are the most common ways to antidote your remedies. Keep them at least 8 feet away. How should I store my homeopathic remedies? Store all homeopathic remedies in a neutral cabinet or drawer! - NOT anywhere hot or cold; no refrigeration, no hot or cold cars or outdoor storage stalls. - NOT near computers, cell phones, electrical outlets, etc. - NOT near herbs, spices, or other strong-smelling substances, essential oils, incense, etc. Homeopathy Kit For Acute & Chronic Ailments For Pets & People, this homeopathic kit contains 100 of the most commonly used remedies in a 30C or 200C potency, "}
