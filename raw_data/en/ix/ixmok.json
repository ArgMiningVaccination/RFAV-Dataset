They are in the air we breathe, in the water we drink, in our food, in the ground, and in our water. The global use of toxic chemicals increases drastically each year, and they have devastating effects on our health. Internal cleansing and detoxification is needed to remove these substances from our bodies in order to maintain health. With Bentonite Clay we can do just that. Calcium Bentonite clay is used both internally and externally to detoxify the body. This unique clay has very powerful adsorptive and absorptive properties. It carries a uniquely strong negative ionic charge which causes it to 'magnetically' attract any substance with a positive ionic charge (i.e. bacteria, toxins, heavy metals). These substances are both adsorbed (sticking to the outside like Velcro) and absorbed (drawn inside) by the clay molecules. The body doesn't digest clay, so the clay passes through the digestive tract, collecting the toxins, and removing them as the clay is eliminated. It`s like a little internal vacuum cleaner. Bentonite Clay provides multiple health benefits such as: Liver Detoxification- bentonite clay allows its essential functions to be restored through cleansing of the livers impurities. Improved Circulation- the clays rich enzyme content has the ability to purify from free radicals, thereby increasing circulation. Digestive Support- bentonite clay may improve bad breath, IBS, diarrhea, and ulcers through neutralizing acids, absorbing toxins and bacteria, and balancing gut flora, Mineralization- Provides over 15 important minerals and dozens more trace minerals. AUTISM AND BENTONITE CLAY The number of children diagnosed annually with autism is escalating at a truly frightening rate. In the 1980's, a study showed that 4 in every 10,000 children showed signs of autism. A recent study by Cambridge University`s Autism Research Center showed that approximately 1 in 60 children has some form of the condition. The controversy over what causes autism spectrum disorder has grown almost as rapidly as the number of cases. Since autism is a very new disease with the first case diagnosed in 1949, blaming genes just doesn't make Current research has shown that environmental factors may be the trigger that actually sets off the disorder. Many holistic doctors have pointed to childhood vaccinations as the source of heavy metal toxicity, and the debate continues on that point. Although mercury (thimerosol) has been removed from many vaccines, it is still present in the flu vaccine. High levels of aluminum are present in many other vaccines. Since children under the age of 2 do not have a fully functioning blood brain barrier, anything injected will enter the brain unhindered. In the last 30 years the total number of vaccines given to kids from birth till age 6 jumped from 10 to 36. It may be possible that multiple vaccines given at once would top the liver's ability to chelate the heavy metals fast enough. With environmental toxins and heavy metals present in foods (including baby food) and fungicides it becomes imperative to protect ourselves from them. Many autism treatment centers are incorporating the use of Bentonite clay in their successful treatment regimens. Studies are showing the clays unique ability to safely remove metals from the body. This has cleared the way for greater use with behavioral and integrative therapies. The detoxing and chelating effects of calcium Bentonite clay baths is proving to be a key factor in the success of these clinics. Chelators are substances that bind to heavy metals. The most common chelators used by medical professionals are DMPS and oral DMSA. However, they are expensive, and have side effects including: fever, headache, diarrhea, fatigue and cramps. Calcium bentonite clay is a better, more natural way to detoxify the body, has less risk of reactions, and works just as well, if not better. Experts agree that when you remove these toxins, all other behavioral and integrative therapies such as music therapy and applied behavioral analysis, work much more easily and effectively. Dr. Miriam Jang, M.D., author of Breakthroughs in Autism stated: \"I have put a huge number of patients on these clay baths and the levels of heavy metals -- mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminum, and cadmium -- have come down dramatically. I have been monitoring the levels of metals using all three methods TD, DMPS, oral DMSA and clay baths. The clay baths were the most effective, and worked faster in removing the metals.'' One particular patient had very high levels of mercury and levels of lead that were off the charts. In 3 months of twice weekly clay baths, the lead came down dramatically and the mercury disappeared. The muscle weakness associated with high lead levels improved dramatically.\" The Diabetes and Bentonite Clay Connection Diabetes is a rapidly growing disease affecting over 29 million people within the United States. It is a complex condition in which the body is either unable to produce enough insulin or is unable to process the insulin that is being produced. Insulin is a hormone that transports nutrients including glucose into the cells. When there is insulin lack or inefficiency, sugar (glucose) becomes trapped in the bloodstream, it can't reach the cells. Since the cells of the body need glucose to function, they become starved and cease to function properly. This is how organs such as the eyes, brain, and even the entire cardiovascular system become damaged due to diabetes. Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy) and poor blood circulation are also common conditions resulting from diabetes. If these conditions are left untreated, they can lead to lower limb amputations. Diabetes is the leading cause of lower limb amputations. For reasons not clear, high blood sugar has the potential to damage the tiny blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the nerves. When nerve cells can't obtain nutrients, nerve damage results. This causes loss of sensation in the lower limbs or hands. This makes the feet vulnerable to skin sores (ulcers), wounds, and infections that can worsen quickly and are difficult to treat. Other symptoms of nerve damage include numbness, tingling, burning, and sharp pain in the extremities. Bentonite Clay is known for its ability to absorb and remove toxins, bacteria, heavy metals, impurities, and chemicals from the body. It provides more than 70 trace minerals for the body. Three dominant macrominerals in calcium bentonite clay are Silica dioxide (silicon), Magnesium oxide, and Calcium oxide. The Calcium Oxide in clay helps to regulate cardiovascular function and blood pressure levels. This results in improved blood circulation, which is highly beneficial for diabetics. Magnesium Oxide helps regulate blood sugar levels, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. It has similar properties to insulin. In addition to regulating blood sugar levels, Calcium Bentonite Clay is a safe, inexpensive way to avoid limb amputations. By increasing blood flow and circulation, the clay revitalizes and re-mineralizes cells, which is the first step of the healing process. It also draws, binds, and pulls infections, gangrene and diseased tissue from the body and stimulates delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the infected area for the rebuilding of new tissue. M.P.
