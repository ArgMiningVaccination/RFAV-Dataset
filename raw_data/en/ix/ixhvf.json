Submitted by mandi b on Thu, 2008-05-08 - 09:27 I am using 50 mg morning 75 mg evening for the past year - I have noticed hair loss - but I am also in my first 2 yrs of menopause, so I don't know if hair loss is due to Topamax or hormone loss. I have told my neurologist and I am paying close attention. This disturbs me but I don't know where to place the blame. I feel you all same thing Submitted by Ciara_5910eca02e749 on Mon, 2017-05-08 - 18:09 I feel you all same thing happened to me.

I am taking Topomax too and loosing so much hair and freaking out. Re: Topamax and losing hair?

I'm scared about losing the locs I've had since 2009. I've gotten a bald spot because of an illness in2001. The remedies I've read require that you wash your hair daily or weekly. I can't do that as my hair is heavy. Is there anything that can help me? I'm thinking of trying to sue Submitted by Caranasser on Tue, 2019-03-05 - 18:56 I'm thinking of trying to sue. She had gorgeous hair and is heartbroken. Only 21 years old. They do not list it as a side effect and Drs are prescribing it everyday. I'm angry.

Have you noticed your hair Submitted by Caranasser on Tue, 2019-03-05 - 18:57 Have you noticed your hair growing back in yet? To those using Topiramate and Submitted by Woman on Mon, 2019-11-18 - 11:40 To those using Topiramate and experiencing hair loss. Try 'FOOD GRADE Diatomaceous Earth'. 1 tablespoon per day in the morning. My hair started falling out at only 25mg taken at night. I quit the drug and started taking FOOD Grade DE (make sure not to get pool grade DE It'll kill you). Anyway, within the week my hair stopped falling out. I'm lucky if I lose a few hairs a day now and it feels super thick! Fellow victims of these devil Submitted by iNaydeen on Fri, 2018-02-09 - 23:10 Fellow victims of these devil pills, I was on topamax for 3 years. I've noticed that not many of you shared anecdotes about your recovery after quitting so here's mine: My dosage was increased from 25 mg, 50 mg, then 75mg over these years. However I quit almost cold turkey because my hair was thinning out in the front. I freaked out, my hair loss was never noticeable until I went up to 75 mg. I've been off of topamax since 12/26/17 and since then I've been taking vitamins daily, eating more fruit, and drinking more water. My hair has become soft and shiny again, I didn't notice how dry my hair was until it became healthy again. And before I quit I weighed about 105 and gained 15 pounds after quitting which I'm not upset about, I just didn't notice how much my appetite was suppressed until now, I'm always hungry. In addition to this, my concentration and memory was a wreck, I was always tired and irritated. But I've got my energy back. I am much happier now because since I quit, I hardly get migraines now. I feel like topamax actually made my migraines worse from withdrawal, the withdrawals was so bad I would get so exhausted. I highly recommend NEVER starting topamax and quit it if you're on it. I'm actually angry that my doctor never told me that topamax messes with your brain, it blocks more than just nerves for pain, it messes with your entire body and wellbeing. I hope my experience helps. Fellow victims of these devil Submitted by iNaydeen on Fri, 2018-02-09 - 23:13 Fellow victims of these devil pills, I was on topamax for 3 years.

I hope my experience helps. I started taking topamax when Submitted by Anthony19pierce85@gmail.com on Tue, 2019-03-12 - 18:07 I started taking topamax when I was 17. I started losing my hair around 17. Which as you can imagine is very embarrassing for someone taking their senior pictures and trying to have an active social life. I'm 34 now and ive had to live with out my hair and despite how people tell you it doesnt matter what others think, they have never been bald by the age of 18. Also if you have oily skin Submitted by iNaydeen on Fri, 2018-02-09 - 23:13 Also if you have oily skin you should know that I do too but it became significantly less oily after I quit. I took Topamax for 6ms, I Submitted by AmandaStar on Tue, 2017-02-28 - 23:27 I took Topamax for 6ms, I stopped it because I lost about 25 percent of my hair, it was falling out so fast, my doctor told me that she's never heard of ppl losing hair from taking Topamax, she told me to stay on it and see if the hair loss stops, the more I read online, the more I know I came to the right decision to get off topamax, I stopped taking it and did not tell my doctor. Re: Topamax and losing hair? Submitted by angel_lts on Sat, 2006-04-22 - 06:59 Dalia, I am having that problem right now and I am loosing alot of hair. It sounds like it may not be from the meds. FOr you had changed meds. Unless both meds are causing the same problem. There could be two other problems. It could be hormone related. For mine could be from my meds(I doubt it) or from the hormones. I told my doctor. She told be I could be low on selinium and zinc. Plus these too things can cause seizures if you are very low. SO I just started taking them last night. Make sure you talk with your doctor before making any changes. take care Lisa http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/epilepsyapproach/ Re: Re: Topamax and losing hair? Submitted by Dalia on Sat, 2006-04-22 - 13:39 Thank u for ur replay Lisa, im on Topamax 8 months yet and i really dont know if this is cuz of changing pills. But cuiz of losing hair my doc will not do anything. For her this is not big problem so... im wonder how can stop this :-(. What medicin u take? Re: Re: Re: 2006-04-22 - 14:06 I am on topamax 800mg in the a.m and 800mg in the p.m. My hair is also falling out like crazy. I am to the point where I am just about ready for a wig again. I went through this when I was on depakote and when I was on dilantin. I just think it is one of the side affects we have to deal with as seizure patients. ((((((((HUGS)))))))))))))))))) ~~Amanda Re: Re: Re: Re: Topamax and Dalia on Mon, 2006-04-24 - 04:33 oh Amanda so im not alone in this :-(( i really dont want to lost a little hair that i have and im wonder how to stop this falling :-( I suppose we must accept it but for sure must fight with this problem only i dont know how :-( Dalia Re: Re: Re: Topamax and hair? Submitted by 2006-04-23 - 11:09 I am on trileptal and Lyrica, not sure if it is from Lyrica for I just started it not too long ago. But it also can be hormone related take care Lisa http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/epilepsyapproach Re: Topamax and losing hair? Submitted by catamenialgirl on Sun, 2006-09-03 - 16:47 Hi Dalia, this is many months after your question, but I wanted to weigh in. Topamax does cause hair loss, I have recently started to taper off of it due to this and found the side effect well documented. Dr's may suggest zinc and selenium, but Topamax does cause hair loss regardless. I went on Zinc and Selenium while tapering the Topamax, but they didn't help much. What has helped is stopping the Topamax. Leese Re: Topamax and losing hair? Submitted by gsledge21 on Tue, 2007-02-13 - 04:55 I hope you are doing better but, yes I had the same problem with hair loss. My neurologist recommended taking Zinc over the conter that you can buy at any pharmacy...hope this helps!!! Good luck!! Gina Re: revawave on Wed, 2007-02-28 - 09:41 I also lost my hair badly with Depakote. When I was a teen it came out so bad that I had a bald spot. I used a shampoo called JASON that began to fill it back in. I am on Tegretol now and still lose some, but not near as much as back then. "}
