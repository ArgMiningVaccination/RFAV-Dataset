It said that the years that public health, regulatory agencies, and vaccine producers invested in pandemic preparedness were a strong point. Other achievements were global cooperation and vaccine monitoring. Areas it said need improvement were upgrading vaccine-production technology, establishing advance supply agreements, and enhancing regulatory processes.

This means 10% had an incomplete immune response to the disease, making them susceptible to re-infection. Having pneumonia and sputum production increased the chance of a robust immune response, while having no fever lowered it. The authors say the 10% may benefit from vaccination.
