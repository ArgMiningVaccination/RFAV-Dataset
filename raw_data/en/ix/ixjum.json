After years working as a make-up artist for television, Danielle Noe was starting to feel unwell, but she wanted to stay away from pharmaceuticals. \"I didn't think much about my diet or the foods I was eating and I started having health issues like digestive issues, fatigue and burn out from stress,\" said [Wild Terra](https://www.wildterra.la/) owner Danielle Noe. \"I slowly started eating more clean, studying nutrition and then herbs kind of naturally fell into place.\" Noe found the medicinal properties of herbal medicine helpful and started visiting the farms to learn how they were grown. After getting familiar with all the fundamentals, Noe realized she wasn't alone. So she decided to leave her job and open a shop of her own where she can share her knowledge with her community. \"Raspberry leaf is one of my favorite nourishing herbs because it's high in minerals and vitamins like calcium and iron and it's excellent for reproductive health for both men and women,\" said Noe. Today, she is teaching a class for folks looking for remedies from anxiety to digestion to eczema. Like Noe, they are looking for natural solutions to their medical issues. Lanie Overton is a stained glass artist. Originally from Missouri, she moved to Highland Park four years ago and found Wild Terra through social media. \"I got into herbal medicine because I want an alternative to pharmaceuticals. I try to avoid as much as possible,\" said Overton. \"I also have early onset arthritis so I wanted to treat that in some way and I found a lot of medicinal herbs help that.\" The shop is where the East meets East Los Angeles with millennials wanting to understand what they are putting into their bodies. Since herbs are mostly weeds, they are interested in growing them as well. \"They are easily accessible to people all over the world and that's what makes their benefit so great is because they're not something special that can only be picked or grown in the special region of the Earth,\" said Noe. \"They grow everywhere and they're truly the people's medicine.\" After leaving Noe's shop, it's time to get your tea on.
