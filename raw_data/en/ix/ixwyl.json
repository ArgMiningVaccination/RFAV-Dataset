However, today, detoxification or \"detoxing\" has become a popular term in today's culture for other health applications. In fact, not a day goes by that you might hear of or read about a revolutionary new detoxing diet or product. It is important to differentiate a \"fad\" detoxification from a medical or health professional supervised metabolic detoxification. Detoxification (\"detox\") is normally referred to medical practices and protocols that embrace both complementary (fasting, colonic cleaning) and conventional (chelation or antitoxin therapy) schools of medical thought - as well as some that push the boundaries of scientific plausibility (such as ionic foot detoxification). In the context of human biochemistry and detoxification refers to a specific metabolic pathway, active throughout the human body, that processes unwanted chemicals for elimination. This pathway involves a series of enzymatic reactions that neutralize and solubilize toxins, homeopathic remedies that assist in transporting the toxins to the secretory organs (like the liver or kidneys), so that they can be excreted from the body. Excess hormones, vitamins, inflammatory molecules, and signaling compounds, amongst others, are typically eliminated from the body by the same enzymatic detoxification systems that protect the body from environmental toxins, or clear prescription drugs from circulation. Metabolic detoxification reactions, therefore, are not only important for protection from the environment, but central to homeostatic balance in the body. At Serenity Health Care Center, our professional approach to metabolic detoxification helps our patients to improve their health and reduce the incidence of chronic illness.
