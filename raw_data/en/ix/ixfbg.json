Over 100 countries have produced translationsor adaptations and a total of some eight million copies in over 170languages are currently in use.The appeal of Ricts for Life is simple. There is a broadagreement among medical experts on the essential child healthinformation that all families have a right to know. Facts for Lifebrings that information together. It is the most authoritativeexpression, in plain language, of what medical science now knowsabout practical, low-cost ways of protecting children's lives andhealth.It is information which can help to save the lives of manymillions of children in the developing world.It is information which can significantly reduce malnutritionand help to protect the healthy growth of the next generation.It is information which almost all parents can put into practice,in some degree, at very low cost.Rids for Life is published by UNICEF, WHO, UNESCO, andUNFPA, in partnership with over 160 of the world's best-knownchildren's agencies.The revised edition of Facts for Life takes into account themany comments received from users over the last four years andhas been thoroughly reviewed in the light of the most recentresearch in the various fields covered (including AIDS).In response to requests from many countries, a new chapterhas been added on the mental and emotional development ofchildren.CommunicatorsEvery week, a quarter of a million children die in the developingworld. Many millions more live on with ill health and poor growth.A fundamental cause of this tragedy is poverty. Anotherfundamental cause is that today's knowledge about protecting thehealth and growth of children has not yet been put at the disposalof the majority.Facts for Life helps to make this knowledge more widelyavailable.But experience has shown that only frequent repetition of newinformation, from many trusted sources and over many years, cantruly succeed in putting new health information at the disposal ofall families and communities. 5 Ricts for Life is issued as a long-term communicationchallenge to:Heads of state and politicalleaders0 Educational systems and theteaching medical profession andthe health professionals intelevision and magazinesReligious and spiritual leadersEmployers and the businesscommunity .Trade union and co-operativeleadersIn sum, Facts for Life is for all those who can help toundertake the greatests communications challenge of all thechallenge of today's knowledge toprotect today's tomorrow's world.Children for Health, which includes all the messagescontained in the latest edition of Facts for Life, is designed for thosewho work with children and who believe that children, in schoolsand as family members, need to be considered as partners inspreading health messages as well as benefiting from them.

Shelooks after two children. One is four and one is two. She keepsthem safe. She carries the little one and picks him up when hecries. She protects the bigger one from accidents. Yesterdaywhen the little girl went too near the stove she scolded her.Today she helped her to cross the road and taught her how towatch for the cars.She helps them when they are sick. She makes themcomfortable, brings them food and keeps the flies away. Lastmonth she saved the life of the little boy. He had diarrhoea andwas very weak but she sat near him and gave him waterthrough the day and long into the night. The little boy lived.Early in the year before the rains she noticed that the biggergirl had a sore on her leg. She took the girl to the medical postand the sore was cured.She helps them to grow healthy. She feeds the little boywhen he is hungry; she helps the little girl find sticks to cleanher teeth. She teaches her songs to help her remember goodhealth habits. She plays with the boy and she plays with thegirl. As they play they learn to use their hands and bodies totry out things, to think of things, to imagine things. Thisteacher makes toys for them, invents games for them and tellsstories to them. She teaches them words and how to sew wordstogetherWho is this teacher who does so much for her pupils anddoes it so well? She is their elder sister and she is elevenyears old.We know a group of community workers who know everyinch of the village in which they work, who are accepted byeveryone, who want to help their community, who will workhard (for short periods of time) and cheerfully (all the time).Last month the health worker used them to collect informationabout which children had been vaccinated in the village. NextTuesday some of them will help to remind the villagers thatthe baby clinic is coming and they will be at hand to play withthe older children when mothers take their babies to see thenurse. Next month they plan to help the schoolteacher in avillage clean-up campaign. These health workers are the boysand girls of the village.' * 8Annals, A. I and Gaylon..1119791. (Iiii,D./0.e/nid. London: Macmillan12 CHILDREN FOR HEALTHThis is a book for those who work with and for children. It is basedon the belief that children not only need to have better health butare also able to give better health to others. We who work withchildren must help them to do so. Who are 'we'?We are all those who plan programmes, write materials, trainteachers and health workers and who work with children and theirfamilies in schools and communities. This is a book for all of us. Itis not a text for children; not a lesson by lesson guide for teachers.It is a resource book of ideas. We can use them in many differentways.Policy makers can use them in planning. We hope that they willdecide that the messages should be learnt by all children, whoshould be enabled and encouraged to act on them and pass themon.Curriculum planners can use them. We hope they will introducethem into national programmes for schools; integrate them intosubject syllabuses and into textbooks; and recommendmethodologies which promote children's active involvement.Health education planners can adopt them and introduce them intotheir programmes both in schools and with non-school-goingchildren.7eacher trainers can use them. We hope they will Thtroduce theminto the programmes of teachers' colleges so that all teachers-to-beknow the facts and how to help children act on them, and into in-service programmes so that serving teachers can become aware ofthem.Schools can use them as a resource: the ideas in this book will helpheads to plan school-based health programmes and activities,teachers to introduce activities into their lessons, and children totake ideas back to their families.Clubs and youth groups based on the school will find these ideasparticularly valuable.Organizers of out-of-school groups can also use this book since noneof the activities it contains are necessarily classroom-based. 1 39 1. Facts for LifeHealth action is based upon sound health knowledge. Before we actwe need to know essential facts. The book Fhcts for Life was firstpublished in 1989, jointly by UNICEF, UNESCO and the WorldHealth Organization. It contains 10 sections, each setting outessential survival and development messages. In their preliminarystatement to Flirts for Life the directors of the three agenciesdescribe the messages in these terms:'Today, there is a world-wide scientific consensus on essentialchild health information.It is information which can help to save the lives of manymillions of children in the world.his information which can drastically reduce malnutritionand help to protect the healthy growth of the next generation.It is information which almost all parents can put intopractice, in some degree, at very low cost.It is therefore information to which all families now have aright.'Facts for Life was revised in 1993. The 'facts' are divided into11 sections:Timing Births MalariaChild Child DevelopmentDiarrhoeaEach section begins with the words 'What every family andcommunity has a right to know about ...' and includes a smallnumber of prime messages and supporting information.In Children for Health we include the complete text of theprime messages and all the supporting information in seven of the11 sections, though we have changed their order. We have slightlyshortened Breastfeeding, Timing Births and Safe Motherhood, andcombined Safe Motherhood and Timing Births in one section. Wehave added prime messages and supporting information onNursing Children with Ryer to the section on Malaria. 1014 We have included two additional sections because they arevital for children to know about and very rich in activities whichchildren can do. These sections are Accidents and Fbod for theFamily.Our 12 sections in their new order are, GrowthChild DevelopmentHygieneDiarrhoeaImmunizationCoughs and ColdsMalariaAIDSSafe MotherhoodAccidentsFood for the FamilyBy mid-1993 eight million copies of Facts for Life had been soldin 178 languages. Leading medical personnel from all round theworld gave their expertise free in the drafting, checking andrevision of the work. 165 organizations have been enrolled aspartners in communicating the messages.A companion book Using Filets for Life - A Handbook draws onworldwide experience to suggest how the information in Fhets forLife can be put into practice effectively at local level. Health workers Teachers andeducators Mass media ReligiousleadersITrades unionsFACTSFOR educationAt the beginning of Hicts for Life the following important wordsoccur:'Putting today's essential health knowledge into practice willbe seen by many as \"women's work \"....the greatest communication challenge of all is the challengeof communicating the idea that the time has come, in allcountries, for men to share more fully in that most difficultand important of all responsibilities - protecting the lives and the health and the growth of their children.Rzcts for Life is therefore addressed not only to women but tomen.'There is more to say:In many countries, boys still have more schooling, better nutritionand health care, and more opportunities in life than girls. Yet bothhave the same rights as individuals to all of these, and equalresponsibilities as parents. Research has proved that, women who are better educated are healthier and bring up healthier childrenwho achieve better in education and life. Hence women's educationis not only their birthright but is directly linked to the health andsuccess of future communities.Facts for Life and the World Summitfor ChildrenIn the declaration signed by heads of state at the World Summitfor Children in 1990, the world's leaders committed themselves to a10 point programme to protect the rights of the child and improvechildren's lives. The 10 points include enhancing children's health;promoting optimal growth and development in childhood;strengthening the role of women and respecting the role of thefamilyall issues which are addressed in Picts for Life.The declaration ends with a plea for partnership to meet thechallenge, and contains the following statement:'Among the partnerships we seek, we turn especially tochildren themselves. We appeal to them to participate in thiseffort.' *This book is a response to this appeal. 'World Summit for Children (1990). World Declaration o\u00bb the Survival, Protection andDevelopment of Children.New York: United Nations. 1216 Facts for Life and Education for AllIn 1990 the World Declaration on Education for All was issued inJomtien, Thailand. The declaration emphasizes the right of allcitizens to basic education and discusses how this may be provided.Basic education is not to be defined as so many years spent inschool or ground covered by an official syllabus. Rather it focuseson learning and skills attained, whether in school or outside it,whether by children, youth or even adults. Such basic learningskills are necessary for further learning and help learners toacquire what has been described as a 'driving permit for life'.Article 1 of the Declaration reads:'Every personchild, youth and adultshall be able to benefitfrom educational opportunities,designed to meet their basiclearning needs. These needs comprise both essential learningtools (such as literacy, oral expression, numeracy, and problemsolving) and the basic learning content (such as knowledge,skills, values, and attitudes) required by human beings to beable to survive, to develop thdir full capacities, to live andwork in dignity, to participate fully in development, to improvethe quality of their lives, to make informed decisions, and tocontinue learning.' *All governments would agree that health content and healthskills are vital to enable human beings to survive, to participatefully and to improve the quality of their lives and that healtheducation should enable them to make informed decisions. What isless certain is how to define and select this content and theseskills. This book helps us to do so.2. Helping Children to HelpOthersWhat do we mean by 'health'?We all hope and pray for our children to grow up healthy andhappy. We wish them to live a productive and stimulating life. Weexpect them to have rights as citizens, to live in peace, to live in anenvironment which has been preserved from contamination andexploitation.We are also aware that for many world citizens these hopesare not fulfilledthat millions of children die as infants, thatmany who survive are weakened by hunger and disease, and thatInter-Agency Commission for the World Ciinference on Education For All (19901. nth/lkelaranon on Ednealinn 14w All. Now York: 1,TNICEF 13 many grow up in societies and environments which are not as wewould want them to be.Individuals may feel powerless to change the future for theirchildren or to shape the society in which these children will growup, but all individuals have some degree of control over theirfamily's health and well-being and when individuals are 'all forhealth' they can all make a big difference.Being healthy starts with being alive, thus the world'semphasis on child survival; but we quickly pass beyond survival todevelopment, beyond simple ideas of health as 'not being ill' towider ideas of health as physical, mental, emotionaland social health. Thus, the World Health Organization hasdefined health as:'A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being andnot merely the absence of disease.'Moreover, we need to recognize that human beings live on aplanet and have the responsibility to preserve its resources forfuture generations. Currently many of us, starting withindustrialized nations, are plundering and destroying theseresources. Our own health depends on the health of theenvironment:If we destroy the soil, we starve.If we pollute the water, we sicken.If we infect the air we breathe, we die.Therefore: 14tE1.11 PT AND(IS1piNI.Loamesours1804/11,11V Nonfiwooligr Health is everyone's concernEvery individual has a right to basic health knowledge and healthcare but also a duty to help others maintain and improve theirhealth. The health of a community depends to a very great degreeupon whether its citizens are passive or active towards health.Passive citizens wait for others to provide better health for them. DOCTOR'SSURGERY Alt MRTwinINircuuti 5 Active citizens promote better health for others through:Keeping themselves healthy.Taking action to prevent disease and glistress in their familiesand communities.Treating conditions which they can treat themselves andrecognizing those which they cannot.Taking action to improve their neighbourhood environment.Passing on their knowledge to those who do not have it.Giving help to others who need it. 15 EvERy carzeNStiotuv 13ECO4 IA HEALTH WORKER ' Children as partners in promotinghealthy livingStrength, effectiveness and happiness in communities often comefrom the strength, love and co-operation of the families who live inthem.The definition of a family as mother, father and children mayoften prove too restrictive. Grandparents, other relatives, friendsand neighbours can all take family responsibility for children andprovide the love, security and sense of solidarity they need. Butsome children are denied adult support; these children, brought upin institutions, living on the streets, exploited in the work place,have only their own comradeship to fall back on for support.All children are citizens, those with the benefit of familysupport and those without it. In many countries nearly half thecitizens are below 15 years old. Just as adult citizens have rightsand duties towards health, so do children.Child citizens can promote better health by:Keeping healthy and setting a good example Amina cleans herteeth.Preventing disease and distress Musa covers the water pot;comforts his little sister.Treating conditions which they can, and recognizing those theycannotSunil cleans her little brother's nose when he has a cold;calls in her parents when he has a fever and is breathing too fast. 1620 Taking action to improve their neighbourhood Pedro and Annabuild a fence round the well.Passing on their knowledge to others Class 5 in school show aplay about the dangers of bottle-feeding.Giving help to others who heed it Patrick holds Mary's handcrossing the road. polo- FoR4ET-WEitrCITIZENSTOO All children are health workers, boys as well as girls.Boys can Girls canLook after babiesCook good foodNurse children while they are sickjust as well as girls canKeep our neighbourhood cleanPractise first aidCarry out immunization surveysjust as well as boys can 17 When children become partners in promoting health theycontribute something special to the partnership.

They can act as the conscienceof a community.- We learnt that medicinesshould be kept out of reachof children3. Three Levels of ActionChildren cannot start and maintain programmes on their own.They need support from adults; from teachers, health workers,youth leaders and community members.Teachers and youth leaders also need support from those whoplan programmes and provide materials.Thus there are three levels of action:Programme organizers to teachers and community workers.Teachers and community workers to children.Children to other children, families and communities.Action from programme organizersProgramme organizers need to:Choose messages and action that are most suitable for children totake up.Activittes need to he:n Important for community health.o Appropriate and do-able by children.o Interesting and fun to do. 194 0 Define and explain general objectives for the programme and itsactivities.Objectives should be:o Clear and medically accurate.o In line witE other programmes and priorities (so thatchildren's action can reinforce other health action).o Achievable.Train field workers.Field workers need to:oHa lie correct medical and scientific knowledge and keep itup-to-date.o Acquire confidence to adapt national programmes to localneeds.o Encourage active methods for children to understand andact on.o Develop skills to listen to people's concerns, understandtheir needs, and adapt national programmes to meet theseneeds.oLearn how to monitor activities.Help in production and adaptation of materials.Materials need to be:o Appropriate to local needs and cultures.o Medically accurate.o Easily readable.oInteresting and fun to work with.Remember: All these tasks require time and expertise. Programmeorganizers need support and assistance from policy makers,professional bodies, NGOs, the local business communities andinternational agencies.Action from teachers, health workersand youth leadersThese work directly with children who need their knowledge,guidance and encouragement to be effective.Four steps for planning and actionMany field programmes find a four step methodology a usefulapproach to planning and organizing children's action.Recognize and Understand ... Study ... Act ... EvaluateProject workers in Mexico draw a bus with four wheels to helpexplain this methodology. 20^4 Thus children need to:Step 1Recognize health needs and priorities e.g. Diarrhoea kills babies.Understand the main message e.g. What causes diarrhoea; whatdehydration is; why it kills; how we can prevent it.Step 2Study:o Find out more e.g. A survey: diarrhoea in our families (howmany children have had it? were they breastfed or bottle-fed? how is it treated?).o Discuss findings e.g. Which local treatments are helpful ormay be harmful?o Learn skills e.g. Recognizing dehydration; making arehydration drink.Step 3Act:o Plan action e.g. What can I do? What can we do (childrentogether)? Who can help us?o Take action myself e.g. Help baby to drink.Take action with others e.g. Make a puppet show.Step 4Evaluate:.o Discuss action taken e.g. What did we do? Who listened tous? What improved? What didn't?o Plan new action e.g. Let's discuss with our teachers and thehealth worker what most needs doing next.5 21 Active approaches to learning and teaching healthSound knowledge and understanding are the basis of effective action for health.School work leading towards examinations does not always promoteunderstanding and rarely encourages action.Sometimes schools talk of 'active learning' and 'active methods'. Activity onits own does not achieve learning. What is needed are methods which promoteactive and critical thinking, leading to well-planned and effective action.

Sometimes they are unsure ofthemselves, sometimes they are nervous, sometimes they can loseheart or lose interest. They need support, advice, praise andencouragement from us all. Within their own cultures they mayencounter resistance to their role, and may have to find their ownspecial means of communicating ideas in a way which isacceptable to adults.Is it easy?At all levels those who introduce Rids for Life and encouragechildren to act upon them will meet difficulties. Questions will beasked and doubts expressed. The policy maker asks:'What's this new approach? Is it worthwhile?''Where are the resources to launch it? Which ministry will bein charge?'Some responses:'In many ways the approach is not new. We have alwaysvalued children and put other children in their trust. Thisapproach confirms our trust and provides new knowledge andnew opportunities for children to learn to be better parentsand community members.''Apart from training, involving children does not imply extraresources. Indeed, children represent one of the resourceswhich every nation has.''Good health depends on co-operation between sectors.Whenever education and health have co-operated effectivelyboth have benefited.' 27 The school head and youth group organizer ask: 'What's new about this? We alwaysdo it. It's called hygiene teaching.''Our programme is overcrowded. Wehave examinations. Is there a placeto fit this in?''Teachers' morale is so low. Will they take it on?''How can we attempt it when we have so few materials?'Some responses:'The approach is not just conventional hygiene teaching, andmust not be allowed to become so. By activating andconsulting children they become interested and involved in away they never did before.''The approach does not imply new subjects and new teaching.It fits easily into existing subjects such as science, languageand mathematics (think of weighing and measuring, andmaking graphs). Much activity can take place in clubs andgroups after school time. Examination questions in othersubjects can include health content but knowledge aboutkeeping alive and healthy is well worth acquiring for its ownsake.''Teachers, even unpaid and undervalued, are naturallyinterested in health topics. They must survive too. Theybecome more interested when they see children's enthusiasm.''Field programmes do face grievous constraints. Fbrtunatelymany health approaches such as discussions, songs, dramaand child stimulation can be achieved with no resources exceptenthusiasm.' 2832 The parent asks: 'Are these new ideas underminingour customs and beliefs?''Should children be teaching othersinstead of learning from theirelders?'Some responses:'Many customs and beliefs, far frombeing questioned need to bereinforced and strengthenedthrough these approaches. And asfor the others...peoPle are changing. Younger, better educatedmothers and fathers are now prepared to question practiceswhich cause deaths of infants, which give girls less lifechances than boys, or which discriminate against the weakand the sick. When schools teach children that these customsare dangerous many mothers and fathers will welcome suchteaching.''Any practice or approach which lessens the respect of childrenfor their families should be discouraged. But as we haveindicated there are many ways in which children can workwith families for change. This book suggests many ideas all ofwhich have been proved effective in societies round the world.' 2933 4. Who Benefits?At first sight it may seem that we are looking at children as agentsfor providing health to target groups (6ther children, families andcommunities). The most important thing therefore is to find outwhether the message 'shot' by the child 'hit' that target.However once we begin to think of children as partners in amuch more complicated process changing lives rather thanhitting targetswe can see that many more benefits result.Children benefitThe children who pass on themessages learn andunderstand more, developconfidence and a sense of self-worth, develop awareness ofthe needs of others and goodsocial attitudes to them. Theyalso develop communicationskills because they must passon their ideas to others.The children who are helpedby others may understandbetter because another child isexplaining to them. In someprogrammes a special attemptis made to identify childrenwho may lack helpers andfriends (especially children who are disabled or in distress). Fbrthese the assistance and companionship of another child can besunlight in their lives.All children gain from participation in a health programme whichlinks learning with action. They will remember what they havedone when the words in the textbooks and upon the blackboard arelong forgotten.Moreover, children have health needs which can be met hereand now. Through their knowledge and actions they can increasetheir chances of remaining healthy and happy tomorrow, nextweek, next month, as well as over the longer term when theybecome parents themselves./ FEEL MN popritgrVEY LIsremEoro ME from moreinteresting and more effectiveteaching and learning methods.They can use these to developknowledge and learning skillswhich children can relate to theirneeds and their 'world'.Evidence is now growing thatwhen a school is involved in asuccessful Child-to-Child andChild-to-Community programme,children in the programme aremore likely to attend regularly anddo better in class.Schools also benefit fromcloser links with the communityand its needs, and with healthworkers and health services withinthat community.REVALTS.:R..... PI.17.Tr. Families and communities benefitVery real, sometimes dramatic,health gains are possible whenchildren are mobilized to spreadmessages. In programmes such ascontrol of scabies, child campaignshave been known almost toeliminate the condition. Whenthere is a local campaign, e.g. onimmunization, children'sparticipation can greatlystrengthen it.When schools, children, youthare jointly involved alongsidehealth workers, communities canbe fully united in a movementtowards Health for All.When children are seen asknowledgeable and concerned inthe health of a family it strengthens that family andmutual respect which is so vital in promoting the rights of thechild.increases the 3135 5. Ideas into ActionThis section suggests ways of starting, building and maintainingprogrammes which help children to communicate Rids for Lifemessages and take action based on them. These suggestions arebased on worldwide experience gained from Child-to-Child andrelated programmes. Such experience suggests that although co-operation is vital between all sectors, especially health andeducation at national, regional and local levels, it is educationwhich may be best suited to take the lead in planning and co-ordinating activities.Getting started1. A national consensusImprovements in health are measured in actions rather thanwords. Nevertheless statements of intent are important. Oncethere is a national agreement that as a component of their basiceducation every child (as part of a family) has a right to know Factsfor Life and should be encouraged to pass on and act upon thatknowledge, then all those who are already undertaking activities orwho wish to start them will be enabled and encouraged.2. Success stories and sharing themMost Child-to-Child and Child-to-Community activities are stillsmall scale, but there are many of them and many success storieswhich need to be shared. In any country there may be a number ofquite separate initiatives. Fbr example, the Child-to-Child Trustlists eight in Kenya, seven in Indonesia, nine in Nigeria, six inBrazil and over 30 in India. Even countries with much smallerpopulations such as Nepal, Sudan, Zambia or Nicaragua haveseveral separate programmes. Many countries have held nationalseminars so that each can benefit from others' experience.3. One step at a timeExperience suggests that although all health priorities areimportant, programmes are more effective if the power andinitiative of children are directed towards a limited number ofhealth topics at one time.Children can be mobilized to help on particular nationalcampaigns:0 Immunization (Togo).0 AIDS awareness (Uganda).0 Safety (Denmark). 3236 Children in projects can be directed by health workers towardsaction on a small number of key priorities:o In a successful programme in a low-income area of Bombay,priorities chosen were anaemia, scabies and diarrhoea.At school level, children and their teachers together choose apriority:oIn one Zambian school they chose personal hygiene andmalaria.o In one Kenyan school: road safety and nutrition.oIn one English school: unsafe and contaminatedenvironment.In every case other priorities are taken up once oneprogramme has been completed.4. Co-operation and informationCommunication and co-operation are keys to the success of aprogramme:Between nationally and locally initiated programmes.Between sectors especially education and health.Between national and international agencies, and voluntarybodies such as NGOs, churches and community initiated Projects.5. Where can action be taken?In national programmes for health educationAdd in a Child-to-Child and Child-to-Community component tostrengthen the programme as in Guinea.*Within national curriculum policiesAgree Rzcts for Lifr and accept the principle of involving childrenas partners in spreading these.Identify which facts children need to know at which age.The curriculum centre then plans the integration of the factsacross its curriculum within 'carrier subjects' such as science and'support subjects' such as language and mathematics.Suggestions for children's action are included in subjectprogrammes ... as in Zambia. For further information about the activities in different countries mentioned on pages 33, 34and 313, please contact tlw rhild.to-Child Trust.37 33 When materials producedIncorporate suggestions activities withinrecommended teachers' and children's material for healtheducation. Possibly highlight these activities by using the Chi ld-to-Child logo ... as in Uganda.Such materials for children and teachers need not be confinedto health education. Story books incorporating Facts for Lifemessages have been widely produced and are read by millions ofchildren.At teachers' collegesPrepare trainee or serving teachers in both facts ani. approaches.Colleges set up their own student-led health committees. Collegescan be linked to neighbouring schools and help to plan and monitortheir child health action programmes ... as in Sierra Leone.At school and community levelEncourage schools or groups of schools to make individual schoolhealth action plans in co-operation or consultation with healthworkers, as in Tanzania (Zanzibar) and other East Africancountries. 3438 A SCHOOL HEALTH ACTION.PLANSchools identify and plan their own implementation of Ricts forLife priorities in consultation with their communities.Plans can be generated by a single school, by a group ofschools or by schools co-ordinated by a teachers' college.Choosing prioritiesPriorities are chosen by the head, staff and children of the schoolin consultation with local health workers and communityleaders. Often a school aims to cover all or most of the Facts forLife messages but emphasizes them a few at a time.Making a planThe plan for a term, semester, or year includes four elements:Teaching vital health facts, usually through carrier subjectssuch as science. These may be reinforced by short, intensive'health information spots' at regular intervals.Reinforcing these messages across the curriculum, e.g. inmathematics, making budgets for good nutrition, weighingchildren and recording their weights; in language, writing storiesand plays about caring for people with AIDS.Action at school level, e.g. in cleanliness, nutrition, safety.Action planned from school to community, e.g. a campaign onimmunization.The plan in actionOnce the plan is jn action it is monitored by the school staff andfacilitated by a health committee in which the girls and boystake a leading part.In many schools pupils are 'twinned', with older childrenspecifically charged with the care and instruction of youngertones.School and communityThe school-baiwd plan is complemented by community action andcommunity health education so that children are seen as just onevital element alongside others in changing knowledge, attitudesand practice.Supporting the initiativesThe initiatives taken by schools do not go unrecognized. They aresupported by advice, training and materials from the ministriesof education and health at national level, and encouraged bylocal managers, advisers and inspectors.3935 From schoolSchools can set up and encourage extra-curricular groups to act aschild health workers to spread messages and take action incommunities. Local school health advisers monitor and takeresponsibility for these groups ... as inIndonesia.Outside schoolPreschool children's groups can be helped by older childrenespecially in child development but also to learn simple hygieneand safety through games and songs ... as inIndia (Gujarat state).Local health gcout programmes can involve children who havenot attended or who no longer attend school ... as in Guatemala.Children in specially difficult circumstances need also to bepartners in receiving and providing Factsfor Life: refugee children;street and working children; children in institutions; children whoare disabled. Taking action to pass on these messages empowersthese children... asin Pakistan, Philippines, Romania, and Mexico.6. EvaluationWe have suggested that involving children as partners inspreading Facts for Life can benefit many people. If we are to provethis we.need to evaluate what changes have resulted from theactions that have been taken. In order to assess.changes, we needif possible to find out and describe what existed in the first place.Thus evaluation needs to take place 'before' as well as 'after'. Whenthis is not possible we may be able to compare outcomes, e.g.between somewhere which has undertaken a new programme andsomewhere else which has not. In other cases it will be valuable todescribe how an activity is being carried out and the effects whichit is having. The best evaluations often contain all three kinds ofevidence. l'eople often think ofetyduation being done bypeople like this. . . 36 :. but it is usually betterdone by people likeourselves It is important to remember that evaluation is not a technicalacti- ity generally undertaken by experts. It is, rather, a way offinding out information which different kinds of people need toknow. Through evaluation we can learn from our failures as well asour successes.Measuring the effectsFinding our whether a programme is well organized and popular isrelatively easy. Finding out whether a programme has made adifference is not, however, a straightforward task.Some effects are quite easy to measure:What facts have been learnt.What skills have been acquired.What actions have been taken ... immediately following theactivities which have been organized.Other effects are more difficult to measure but still possible if wedo it in the right way:Whether knowledge and skills are retained over a period of time.This can be measured by retesting.Whether attitudes have changed this is best measured throughindicators such as interest (attends health club) or actions(always washes hands).The most difficult effect to measure is whether the activities haveresulted in changes in the health status of those who undertookthem and those who received the messages. 374 It is extremely hard to say whether children's activities wereresponsible for the effect, or partly responsible, or whether theeffect was caused by something else entirely. It is much better tobe honest but cautious in our claims, e.g.:Children in five schools in the community concentrated on aclean water campaign in which they also spread messages on oralrehydration. During the year there was a radio and postercampaign. The health centre reported a 30 per cent drop in cases ofyoung children with serious dehydration and only seven deaths asagainst 11 in the same season in the previous yearThe schools concluded that their campaign had probablymade some difference.How do we evaluate?Most methods of evaluation can be used by anyone who organizesa programme or uses an activity. Indeed they are actions we doevery day, We evaluate by:Asking questions (often comparing answers to questions asked5e/bre an activity with answers to the same questions askedafter it):Written questions.0 Are children's stools more or less likely to spread diseasethan adult ones?Oral questions:0 How can you recognize the danger signs of pneumonia?Observing and recording:0 Are more water pots covered?0 Do children play with babies more? Have they made any toys?Practical tests:0 Asking people to use and read a growth monitoring scaleand chart.Meetings and discussion:0 Letting people talk freely about what they have observed ordone gives much information, e.g. discussions at aparent/teacher meeting about what children have said anddone.Using written material:0 Keeping and consulting diaries and records, e.g. minutes ofschool health committee; records of health club.Games and role-playing:o Setting a problem and noting responses, e.g. A person withAIDS is shunned by other people in the neighbourhood.What would you do if this happened? 3842 What do we evaluate?We need to evaluate the effects of activities on the children whocarry them out.For example:Changes in knowledgeBefore starting the unit on coughs, colds and pneumonia, all thechildren were tested. Seventy per cent thought that colds could betreated by medicines from the market and only 10 per centmentioned the danger signs of pneumonia.Later two classes were tested (six weeks after they had beengiven the information). In both, the belief in market medicineshad decreased but the results of the question on signs ofpneumonia were very interesting. In one class where the teacherhad given the information on the blackboard only 45 per cent ofchildren had remembered it correctly. In another the children hadmade pendulums with a stone and string (see page 130) to countfast breathing; 90 per cent of children remembered the message.Changes in skillsAs a result of the first aid activities in the Red Cross club,children gained a number of practical skills and gained badgesonce they passed their aptitude tests.However, the club organizer was also interested to discoverwhether they had gained skills in observation and problemsolving. It seemed from a survey of parents that some childrenwere noticing hazards at home and taking action, particularly inthe kitchen. (`Can we put up a shelf to keep those bottles out ofbabyk reachnChanges in attitudes and behaviourHealth workers, youth leaders and project organizers had a longdiscussion on how to evaluate attitudes. They all agreed that testswere not likely to be useful for this. Finally they made a list ofsome of the ways of behaving (indicators) which they should lookfor in children, e.g.:i] Attends health club regularly.Notices and reports poor hygiene or safety hazards.Makes a toy for baby, etc.Making the list taught them a lot about what to look for andencourage.Note: A guide to evaluation entitled /how ii Better, published by the Child-to-Child Trust,helps those ss ho work with children to understand simple evaluation techniques. Available fromTM A'. address im page 183.43 39 '11 We also need to evaluate the effects of children's activities ontheir families, schools and communities.For example:Changes in knowledgeChildren, helped by their teachers and club organizers, wereinvited to design their own knowledge tests both for other childrenand for some adults at home (where they agreed to take part).They made simple questions, pictures, and a story aboutdiarrhoea with gaps in it for people to fill in either orally or inwriting. They found this difficult but learnt a great deal by doingit. They were helped by project organizers.In some cases, these questions were the same as thosewhich they had asked right'at the beginning of the project. Fromasking these questions they discovered that most children andsome parents had gained a good deal of knowledge, butadditional questions showed that some of the messages had notbeen properly understood. (Some people thought that the oralrehydration drink was a 'medicine' to be taken in smallquantities.)Changes in practiceAfter the health scouts had visited families in the communityregularly (each pair was responsible for five families), the healthworker herself visited a sample of families and talked to mothers.She found that many more of them were cooking green vegetablesdaily with their main meal.Changes in health statusAfter the school had finished the activity, the health workerwaited for three months and then compared her records withthose of the same period last year 'I can't say for certain that it isthe result of your Child-to-Child project on safety,' she told thechildren, 'but what I can say is that fewer babies have beenbrought into the health centre with burns than during the sametime last year'Changes in approaches at schoolIn the project schools, children were 'paired' with older childrenresponsible for the hygiene and safety of the younger ones. Olderchildren also had responsibilities in the health committees.A survey made over a number of schools reported aconsiderable improvement in hygiene ... both older and youngerchildren had gained skills (e.g. older children had taught youngerones how to clean their teeth more thoroughly and, in so doing,learnt a lot themselves). 4044 My school brother neverchecked my fingernails today Some comments also reflected that older children weregetting more skilful in helping the younger ones help themselves(instead of just telling them what to do).Changes in participationA group from the curriculum centre was appointed to visit anumber of schoolS, colleges and health scout programnies indifferent areas. In one district, far more activity was noted thananother Questioning revealed that:0 The organizing committee was more active.o A local in-service centre was particularly involved andinterested. 0 7)-ansport was available to visit schools and clubs.Visits were arranged so that others could come to the area tosee the good work that was going on.'4541 Are the approaches well planned andmanaged?At the same time as looking at the outcomes of new approaches, weneed to ask whether they are.well planned and well managed.Experience with many programmes suggests that the followingquestions need to be asked at the planning stage:Do those who seek to implement the approach really understandit? Are they committed to it? Do they respect children?Is what we are expecting of children reasonable, feasible andinteresting for children to do?Do the new approaches complement and fit into other healthprogrammes and priorities?Has necessary co-ordination and co-operation been foreseen andplanned between health and education sectors?When the programme is implemented we may need to ask thefollowing:Are the original goals being kept in mind? Are childrenremaining in the centre of the activity and continuing to be givenresponsibility?Is management efficient and cost-effective?Are approaches being well adapted to local needs and cultures?Is the right training being provided to the right people?Are thoe who undertake the programme (including the children)monitoring activities and changing their programme as a result?Who finds the answers to thesequestions?These questions all need to be asked and answered by those whoplan and organize programmes, but there will be occasions whenthey will need to ask outsiders for help. These outsiders do notalways have to be specialists in evaluation.They can be:Doctors and other health workers, who can check whether themessages are correct and whether health has improved.Administrators and planners, who can assess whether activitiesare cost-effective.Community leaders and community members, who can be asked tojudge whether attitudes or actions of children or the communityhave changed. 4246 Remember: Experts are often needed to help us find the answersto some of the questions we ask, but many different people areexperts in different things. Often children themselves are the bestexperts we can find.1.-;IttsBooK ts EASIERID REft.D -MAN THATONE Children for health?Are there things we do not need to measure? Evaluating andmeasuring is necessary but takes time. Certain effects must bemeasured, but do we have to prove that children co-operate betterin families if they help to improve the health of their brothers andsisters?Do we have to prove that schools serve their communitiesbetter if they teach their children to meet health problems in their.communities?Do we need to prove that someone learns a fact or skill betterif he has to teach it to someone else?Do we need to be persuaded that child citizens whose concernis directed towards improvement of their neighbourhood becomebetter citizens?We do not! These are truths we all know from experience.Our problem, therefore, is not whetherchild action forRwts forLifeis valuable. It is rather that we need to examine howchildrencan best be served and how ihey can best serve their communities.47 prepared for Health.48 45 TWELVE MESSAGES TO SAVEAND IMPROVE LIFEIn this part we show what health ideas children need to know andpass on about the prime messages from Facts for Life. We haveadded two messages which are essential for children to know andaround which many activities can be developed. The primemessages appear as they are in Facts for Life but in a few cases thesupporting information has been shortened. The text of TimingBirths has been incorporated into Safe Motherhood. The text ofMalaria has been expanded to include more information onNursing Children with Fever.Each of the 12 sections has:The prime message and supporting informationThe supporting information provides a great deai of backgroundknowledge for teachers and health workers.ObjectivesThese summarize what children should know and be able to do.Activities for understandingThere are many activities that teachers can do with children tohelp them understand important health ideas. We have selected asmall number of activities that work well and which are examplesof different methods that help children learn. E.g. Dehydration isan important idea which is made easier to understand if childrendo an experiment that shows how babies lose fluids when theyhave diarrhoea.Activities for taking actionAs well as understanding health messages, it is important forchildren to be able to apply and pass on what they have learnt. Wehave chosen activities that show what children can do, bythemselves or together, to contribute to their own health and thatof others in their families, schools and neighbourhood.A range of methodsActivities have been chosen because they represent a range ofmethods which can be used. It is very likely that those described infull in one section may be also useful in another, even though theydo not appear there, e.g. techniques for interviews, story-writing,surveys, and using pictures to promote discussion may be useful inalmost every section. 4649 A 'basket of ideas'In each section there is a 'basket of ideas' which can be developedby those working with children. You will be able to think of manymore activities that both promote understanding and help childrento take action for health.Evaluation questionsAt the end of each section there are evaluation questions to helpchildren, teachers and health workers ask themselves how wellthey remember and use what they have learnt, and whether theiractions were effective.Messages reinforce each otherMany messages in ftwts for Life overlap because different aspectsof health influence each other. It is therefore important, whenpreparing activities on one theme, e.g. Diarrhoea, to read throughand study both the information and the activities in related themes,e.g. Hygiene and Breast feeding. 5 o47 .. What children need to know and pass on aboutBreastfeeding 4851 1Babies fed on bieastmilk have fewer illnesses and lessmalnutrition than babies who are bottle-fed on other foods.If all babies were exclusively breastfed for about the firstsix months of life, then the deaths of more than one millioninfants a year would be prevented.Bottle-feeding is a special threat in poor communitieswhere parents may not be able to afford sufficient milk-powder, may not have clean water to mix it with, and maynot be able to sterilize teats and feeding bottles.The six prime messages in this chapter can help toavert that threat and promote the healthy growth of youngchildren. Children need to be aware of these messagesbecause they are the next generation of mothers andfathers. They can also help spread these messages in thecommunities in which they live as well as being especiallyhelpful to their mothers at home when they arebreastfeeding babies.Activities in this section should be related to those inChild Growth and Food for the Family.PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationBreastmilk alone is the best possible food and drink for ababy. No other food or drink is needed for about the first sixmonths of life.From the moment of birth up to the age of about six months,breastmilk is all the food and drink a baby needs. It is the bestfood a child will ever have. All substitutes, including cow's milk,infant formula, milk-powder solutions, and cereal gruels, areinferior.Even in hot, dry climates, breastmilk contains sufficient waterfor a young baby's needs. Additional water or sugary drinks arenot needed to quench the baby's thirst. They can also be harmful.If the baby is also given water, or drinks made with water, then therisk of getting diarrhoea and other illnesses increases.5249 ft Other foods and drinks are necessary when a baby reaches theage of about six months. If monthly weighing shows that a childunder six months of age is not growing well, then the child Mayneed more frequent breastfeeding. If the child is already beingbreastfed frequently, then lack of weight gain shows either that thechild has an illness or that other foods, in addition to breastmilk,are now necessary.f: Until the age of nine or ten months, the baby should be breastfedbefore other foods are given. Breastfeeding should continue wellinto the second year of life and for longer if possible. Babies should start to breastfeed as soon as possible afterbirth. Virtually every mother can breastfeed her baby.Mothers and newborn babies should not be put in differentrooms. The baby should be allowed to suck at the breast as often ashe or she wants.If a mother gives birth in a maternity unit, then she has a rightto expect that her newborn baby will be kept near her in the sameroom, 24 hours a day, and that no other food or drink will be givento her baby except breastmilk.'Starting to breastfeed immediately after birth stimulates theproduction of breastmilk. Breastfeeding should begin not later thanone hour after the delivery of the baby.The thick yellowish milk (called colostrum) that the motherproduces in the first few days after birth is good for babies. It isnutritious and helps to protect them against common infections.The baby does not need any other food or drink while waiting forthe mother's milk to 'come in'. In some countries, mothers areadvised not to feed this colostrum to their babies. This advice iswrong.Many mothers need help when they begin to breastfeed,especially if the baby is their first. An experienced and sympatheticadviser, such as a woman who has successfully breastfed, can helpa mother avoid or solve many common problems.Almost all mothers can produce enough milk if:o The baby takes the breast into his or her mouth in a goodposition.o The baby sucks as often, and for as long, as he or she wants,including during the night. 5053 it Crying is not a sign that a baby needs artificial feeds. Itnormally means that the baby needs to be held and cuddled more.Some babies need to suck the breast simply for comfort. If the babyis hungry, more sucking will produce ntore breastmilk.0 Mothers who are not confident that they have enough breastmilkoften give their babies other food or drink in the first few months oflife. But this means that the baby sucks at the breast less often. Soless breastmilk is produced. To stop this happening, mothers needto be reassured that they can feed their young babies properly withbreastmilk alone. They need the encouragement and practicalsupport of their families, the child's father, neighbours, friends,health workers and women's organizations.a Husbands, families, and communities can help to protect thehealth of both mothers and babies by making sure that the motherhas enough food and by helping with her many tiring tasks.Breastfeeding cari be an opportunity for a mother to take a fewminutes of much-needed rest. Husbands or other family memberscan help by encouraging the mother to lie down, in peace andquiet, while she breastfeeds her baby.Breastfeeding causes more milk to be produced. A baby needsto suck frequently at the breast so that enough breastmilk isproduced to meet the baby's needs.From birth, the baby should breastfeed whenever he or shewants tooften indicated by crying. Frequent sucking at thebreast is necessary to stimulate the production of more breastmilk.`Topping up' breastmilk feeds with milk-powder solutions, infantformulas, cow's milk, water, or other drinks, reduces the amount ofmilk the baby takes from the breast. This leads to less breastmilkbeing produced. The use of a bottle to give other drinks can causethe baby to stop breastfeeding completely. It can also confuse thebaby because the sucking action of bottle-feeding is very differentfrom sucking at the breast. Babies who are confused betweensucking at the breast and sucking at the bottle may drink lessbreastmilk. This will cause less breastmilk to be produced.Breastfeeding helps to protect babies and young childrenagainst dangerous diseases. Bottle-feeding can lead to seriousillness and death.Breastmilk is the baby's first 'immunization'. It helps to protect5 451 5the baby against diarrhoea, coughs and colds, and other commonillnesses. The protection is greatest when breastmilk alone is givento the baby for about the first six months.S. Cow's milk, infant formulas, milk-powder solutions, maize grueland other infant foods do not give babies any special protectionagainst diarrhoea, coughs and colds, and other diseases.Bottle-feeding cah cause illnesses such as diarrhoea unless thewater is boiled and the bottle and teats are sterilized in boilingwater before each feed. The more often a child is ill, the more likelyit is that he or she will become malnourished. That is why, in acommunity without clean drinking water, a bottle-fed baby is manytimes more likely to die of diarrhoea than a baby fed exclusively onbreastmilk for about the first six months.Mothers should be helped to breastfeed their babies. If for anyreason a mother does not breastfeed, then she should be helped inother ways to give her baby good nutrition and protection againstdisease.The best food for a baby who, for whatever reason, cannot bebreastfed, is milk squeezed from the mother's breast. It should begiven in a cup that has been very well cleaned. Cups are safer thanbottle's and teats because they are easier to keep clean.The be.t food for any baby whose own mother's milk is notavailable is the breastmilk of another mother.If non-human milk has to be used, it should be given from aclean cup rather than a bottle. Milk-powder solutions should beprepared using water that has been boiled and then cooled.Cow's milk, infant formula, or milk-powder solutions can causepoor growth if too much water is added in order to make it gofurther.Cow's milk and milk-powder solutions go bad if left to stand atroom temperature for a few hours. Breastmilk can be stored for atleast eight hours at room temperature without going bad.In low-income communities, the cost of cow's milk or powderedmilk, plus bottles, teats, and the fuel for boiling water, can be asmuch as 25-50% of a family's income.A variety of additional foodii is necessary when a child isabout six months old, but breastfeeding should continue wellinto the second year of a child's life and for longer if possible. 52Although children need additional foods after about the first six os-55 months of life, breastmilk is still an important source of energy andprotein, and other nutrients such as vitamin A, and helps toprotect against disease during the child's second year of life.* Babies get ill freqUen :ly as they learn to crawl, walk, and play. Achild who is ill needs breastmilk. It provides a nutritious, easilydigestible food when the child loses appetite for other foods.Between the ages of one and two, a baby benefits frombreastmilk as well as needing family foods. Breastfeeding is goodfor the child as part of a meal, or between meals, or whenever thechild feels hungry. But at this time, all children need other foods.In the second year of life, breastfeeding should be an addition to,not a substitute for, normal meals.Breastfeeding also comforts a child when he or she is f ightened,hurt, angry, or tearful.Breastfeeding gives a mother 98% protection againstpregnancy for six months after giving birth - if her babybreastfeeds frequently, day and night, if the baby is notregularly given other food and drink, and if the mother'speriods have not returned.N.B. Some of the supporting information included in Facts for Lifehas been omitted or shortened.OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand the benefits of breastfeeding. Breastmilk providesall the food and drink a baby needs for about the first six months oflife, and protects against disease.0 Understand the dangers of bottle-feeding and how it can lead todisease and malnutrition.Understand the importance of slowly introducing foods at aboutsix months while carrying on breastfeeding until beyond thesecond birthday.0 Know how to prepare food for babies from about six months.O Know how to help breastfeeding mothers by taking care ofyounger children.5653 UNDERSTANDING about breastfeedingand first food for babies1. An interview and discussion ... How long did youfeed me? What was my first.food?Make a list of questionsAsk children what questions they will ask their mothers to find outhow they were fed as babies. Write some of ihe questions on theblackboard. Children decide which questions relate to very youngbabies and which questions relate to older babies. Then they putthe questions in a sequence. The final list might look like this:oHow long was I breastfed?o When did I first start having food as well as breastmilk?oWhat kind of food did you give me for my first food? Is it thesame for boys and girls?o How old was I when I began eating full family meals?o How often in the day did I have food as well as breastmilk?o How old was I when I stopped having breastmilk?Plan the interviewChildren write out the list of questions they will ask. Remind themto save some space to record the answers. Help them to decide:o What is the best time for mother to answer my questions?o What will I say to mother to explain why I want to knowabout this?Use the information from the interviewsAsk children to tell the class about the results of their interviews.Help them to compare their findings. Fbllow this with a discussion.Ask children to record and learn the main health messages aboutfeeding babies.2. Learning by reading graphs ... comparing deaths ofchildren who are breastfed and bottle-fedDraw a graph on the blackboard or a piece of paper and then askquestions about the information on it to help children think aboutthe reasons why bottle-feeding is so dangerous.Sample questions on the graph:oHow many NUMBER How many more bottle-fed babies died than breastiedbabies?o Why do you think there is this difference?o How would you like your baby to be fed?3. Learning from stories ... breastfed babies arehealthierMake up stories, or adapt stories using characters well known inthe culture: stories could contrast the experience of two mothers,one who breastfed her baby and one who (for one reason oranother) decided to bottle-feed. Remember to present these reasonssympatheticallymothers who bottle-feed nearly always do sobecause they believe it is the best way to help their families.Use incomplete stories and let children complete them. Here aretwo:o A mother who is quite poor went to town and had her babythere. She stayed with friends for three weeks afterwards.Soon after the baby was born someone gave her some milk-powder and persuaded her to start feeding her baby with abottle. After three weeks she went back to the village ......When the baby was four months old it was very thin andsuffered from diarrhoea.What happened in between?0 A mother in town got a full-time Job when her baby was twomonths old. She decided to employ a childminder who hadnot been to school. She gave her a bottle and showed her howto clean it and feedbaby with it.What happened later? 55 Discuss the stories based on children's experience. If manychildren have been involved in making up stories or completingstories, collect different versions and compare them.In particulat; discuss:o Why do breastfed babies grow up healthier?o Why do mothers bottle-feed instead of breastfeed? (e.g.Because-they received poor advice, or insufficient support.)o What are the dangers of bottle-feeding?oIf mothers do not breastfeed, what are some of the ways inwhich babies can be kept healthier? (Use supportinginformation on page 52 as a reference.) 4. An enquiry and discussion ...how much does it costto bottle-feed a baby?.Find out from the health worker what milk-powders are mostcommonly used locally to make up feeding bottles for babies.Get a tin of milk-powder and discuss with children theinstructions for making up the feed. Help children to calculate:0 How long a tin lasts when a baby is fed according to theinstructions.0 How much it costs to feed a baby on milk-powder for a week,and compare this to what families earn.Are there other costs (e.g. for bottles, teats, firewood)? Discusswhat can happen if families cannot afford all this money. 5. Looking carefully at advertisements ...what do theywant us to think (and buy)?In most countries advertisements for milk-powder for babies are nolonger permitted on radio or television, or in public places.However, there are many advertisements for preparedsupplementary foods for babies. While these foods may benutritious, they are expensive and no improvement on home-prepared foods.Advertisements may also suggest that mothers introducethese foods far too early.Children observe, describe and discuss advertisementsappearing in public places or on food labels. Here is an example: 565 9 WHAT IS THIS ADVEIMSEMENT TRYING TO MAKE US THINK? BEAST FEEDING IS BESTOUT SOME BABIEs HEED EXTRA children to describe what the advertisement contains, andanalyze how it tries to persuade mothers to buy the product. Lookat both the pictures and the wording, e.g. a successful, well-dressed mother; words such as 'recommended by nutritionists'.Is the wording trying to make mothers feel they may not befeeding their babies properly? e.g. 'Extra food after three months';'the best for your baby'.6057 6. Demonstration and discussion ...-preparing food foryoung babiesChildren prepare and cook some food suitable for a baby of aboutsix months, using the ingredients below or other high-energymixtures that are given to young babies locally. This recipe is fromAfrica and is also suitable for older babies.Banana and banana1 largeOil or margarine1 (i.e. 3 small leavesof kale)MethodWash, peel and cut up the banana and potato.Wash and cut up the vegetables.Boil everything together in one cup of water in a covered Onfor 15 minutes or until well cooked.Mash and pass through a sieve.Serve warm.This makes about one cup of cooked food. A young baby willonly eat a few spoonfuls of this at one mealtime, afterbreastfeeding.After the activity of making the food, children can:oDescribe the taste.o Describe-why the vegetables are washed and peeled andwhy the food is mashed.o Write a description of the steps they followed.

If children are not properly fed whenthey are small, their mental growth also suffers.Sometimes parents are unable to feed their childrenproperly because of drought, famine, war or poverty.But sometimes it is possible to improve child growth bybetter knowledge and better practice. Older children oftencare for their younger brothers and sisters; sometimes theyhave gained knowledge in school which their families lack.They can therefore help greatly in pronoting more frequentfeeding of small children, in weighing and measuring them,and in recognizing danger signs when they are not growingproperly.PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationChildren from birth to the age of three years should beweighed every month. If there is no weight gain for twomonths, something is wrong.Regular monthly weight gain is the most important sign of achild's overall health and development. It is the child's own weightgain which is important, not how the child compares in weight toother children.4, It is therefore important to weigh young children every month. Ifa Child does not gain weight over a two-month period, then parentsand health workers should act. The child is being held back eitherby illness, or poor food, or lack of attention. The following paragraphscover the most likely causes of poor growth and the most importantactions parents can take to keep a child growing well.Breastfeeding helps protect a baby from common illnesses andensure growth for the first few months of life. A full course ofimmunizations in the first year of life is also essential it protectsagainst diseases which cause undernutrition.When additional foods are given, the risk of infection increases.From now on, it is specially important to check that the child is64 61 putting on weight regularly from one month to the next. If a childunder the age of three is not gaining weight, and if the child hasgood food, these are the 10 most important questions to ask:o Is the child eating frequently enough? (a child should eatfive or six times a day)0 Do the child's meals have too little energy in them? (smallamounts of oil or fats should be added)o Is the child frequently ill? (needs medical attention)o Has the child been refusing to eat when ill? (needs temptingto eat when ill and extra meals to catch up afterwards)0 Is the child getting enough vitamin A? (needs dark greenvegetables every day)oIs the child being bottle-fed? (bottle and water may not beclean, sugary drinks may be being used instead of milk)o Are food and water being kept clean? (if not, child will oftenbe ill)0 Are faeces being put into a latrine or buried? (if not, childwill often be ill)0 Does the child have worms? (needs deworming medicinefrom health centre)o Is the child alone too much? (needs more stimulation andattention)Recording the child's weight with a dot on the child's 'growthchart' and joining up the dots after each monthly weighing gives aline which enables a mother to see her child's growth. An upwardtine means the child is doing well. A flat line is a cause forconcern. A downward line is a sure sign that all is not well with thechild. A child who is given only breastmilk will almost always growwell in the first few months of life. Seeing this good progress on agrowth chart helps give the mother confidence.Breastmilk alone is the best possible food for about the firstsix months of a child's life.From the moment of birth up to the age of about six months,breastmilk is all the food and drink a baby needs to grow well. Inthese early months, when a baby is most at risk, breastmilk helpsto protect against diarrhoea and other common infections.Breastmilk is the best food a child will ever have. If possible,breastfeeding should continue well into the second year of life andfor longer if possible. 6265 3 4By the age of about six months, the child needs other foods inaddition to breastmilk.sle At the age of about six months, most infants need bther foods inaddition to breastmilk. Before the age of six months, an infant whois not gaining enough weight may need more frequentbreastfeeding.If the child is already being breastfed frequently, then failureto gain weight shows that other foods in addition to breastmilk arenow necessary.Fbr an infant who continues to grow well, additional food maynot be necessary until seven or even eight months. After that, allchildren need other foods in addition to breastmilk.The baby should be breastfed before being given other foods sothat the mother will have more breastmilk for a longer period.Boiled, peeled and mashed vegetables should be added.to ayoung child's gruel or other weaning food at least once each day.The greater the variety of foods the child eats, the better. 5A child under three years of age needs food five or six times aday.A child's stomach is smaller than an adult's, so a child cannot eatas much as an adult at one meal. But its energy needs, for its size,are greater. So the problem is how to get enough 'energy food' intothe child. The answer is:o Feed the child frequently five or six times a day.o Enrich the child's gruel or porridge with mashed vegetablesand a little oil or fat.A child's food should not be left standing for hours. Germs cangrow in it which may make the child ill. As it is usually notpossible to cook fresh food for a child five or six times a day, driedfoods or snacks should be given in between meals fruits, bread,patties, biscuits, nuts, coconut, bananas or whatever clean food iseasily available. Breastmilk is also an ideal 'snack' and is alwaysclean and free from germs.A child under three years of age needs a small amount of extrafat or oil added to the family's ordinary food.The family's normal food needs to be enriched to meet thespecial energy needs of the child. This means adding mashed 63 6 7vegetables and small amounts of fats or oils butter, ghee,vegetable oil, soya oil, coconut oil, corn oil, groundnut oil, nuts.Breastmilk also enriches a child's diet, and breastfeeding shouldcontinue, if possible, until well into the second year of a child's life.All children need foods rich in vitamin A breastmilk, greenleafy vegetables, and orange.coloured fruits and vegetables.4) Over 200,000 children go blind each year because they do nothave enough vitamin A in their bodies. Vitamin A may also protectchildren against other illnesses such as diarrhoea. It shouldtherefore be a part of every child's daily diet.e, Vitamin A comes from breastmilk, dark green leafy vegetables,and from orange or yellow fruits and vegetables such as carrots,papayas, and mangoes.a, If a child has had diarrhoea or measles, vitamin A will be lostfrom the child's body. It can be replaced by breastfeeding moreoften, and by feeding the child more fruit and vegetables.Mter an illness, a child needs one extra meal every day for atleast a week.One of the most important skills of a parent is the skill ofstopping illnesses from holding back a child's growth. In times ofillness, and especially if the illness is diarrhoea or measles, theappetite falls and less of the food that is eaten is absorbed into thebody. If this happens several times a year, the child's growth will beheld back.So it is essential to errourage a child who is ill to eat and drink.This can be difficult if the child does not want to eat, so it isimportant to keep offering food the child likes, usually soft, sweetfoods, a little at a time and as often as possible. Breastfeeding isespecially important.When the illness is over, extra meals should be given so that thechild catches up on the growth lost. A good rule is to give a child anextra meal every day for at least a week after the illness is over.The child is not fully recovered from an illness until he or she is atleast the same weight as when the illness began.If illness and poor appetite persist for more than a few days, thechild should be taken to a health worker.It is also important to protect a child's growth by preventingillness: 6467 ID Give a child breastmilk alone for about the first six monthsof life. Then introduce other foods, and continue tobreastfeed.E) Make sure your child is fully immunized before the age ofone year.o Always use latrines and keep hands, food, and kitchensclean.OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that for babies and young children to grow strong,they need enough of the right kind of food and to eat frequently.Understand that babies and young children need to eatfrequently because their stomachs are much smaller than those ofadults.0 Understand that babies are well and healthy if they gain weightregularly.Understand that it is important to weigh babies regularly andknow how to keep records to check that they are gaining weight.Know how to measure height and weight of themselves andother children.Know how to recognize children who are too thin, and somereasons why children might be thin.'Know how to help children who have been ill by giving themextra meals.UNDERSTANDING about child growth1. Keeping a record of our growthChildren keep a scrapbook on 'Growing up'In it, they note how their height changes, what happens to theirteeth, the size of their shoes, how their likes and dislikes change,how their faces change, and any other changes in their appearance.Make a height measure in the classroomMark 10 centimetre intervals on the wall, or on a door or windowframe. (If one centimetre intervals are not marked, these can bemeasured with a ruler.)6865 Children measure their heights against it. They do thisregularly, perhaps every month or two. Help them to keep a properrecord in their 'Growing up' books..Older chirdren can plot a graph.If possible, keep a record of weight as well. (This depends onthe availability of scales.)Discussion about different heightso What are our ages?0 How tall are our parents and grandparents?0 Do most of us grow to the same height as our parents?o Are we quick growers or slow growers?0 Have we been ill recently?0 Are we eating enough good food?2. Using and interpreting growth chartsChildren study and learn how to use growth charts available tomothers through the Ministry of Health Health workers and teachers arrange for parents to bring babiesinto school so that children can watch them being weighed, andtheir weight recorded on the chart. The class takes a specialinterest in one baby and, with the agreement of the mother andfather, the baby's growth chart is regularly MMM oXX0020 OXUS':OSINk0 08E1VO0'161'10 NOS.00 3. Calculating how much and how often young childrenshould eatCHH.DRE NtukviSMALLSTOMACHS50 FEEDl'HENolOFTSA Children calculate how many meals a young child needsThe young child's stomach holds 180 ml.The young child needs to eat 900 ml a day.3 meals a day: 3 x 180 ml in the stomach = 540 ml.4 meals a day: 4 x 180 ml in the stomach = 720 ml.5 meals a day: 5 x 180 ml in the stomach = 900 ml.Demonstrate this practically, using a small cup to represent achild's stomach and a bowl (about five times larger) to representthe food a child needs every day. 6871 Children find out and record which oils and fats are locallyavailable for cookingOils used in cooking add calories without adding volume. Askchildren how much oils and fats cost. Are some cheaper thanothers?4. Children who are too thin ... a game to make childrenthinkOften we accept very simple answers to the complex questions ofhealth and development, e,g. children are too thin because they donot eat the right foods.Yet it is important for children to understand that conditionssuch as malnutrition have many related causes.Discuss with children whether they know any children whoare 'too thin', and how to recognize signs of malnutrition. Thenshow a drawing of an imaginary child, 'Pedro', and ask, 'Why isPedro so thin?' Each child suggests a different answer, forexample, 'He does not get enough to eat'; 'Hehas been ill'; 'The rains didn't come'.The children begin to think of who could help Pedro and how.What action can be taken by his family, the community, and thegovernment? What can children do? Children list ways in whichthey can help Pedro.CHILDREN'S ACTIONI CanHelp to record the weight of a baby at home.Children with small babies at home are asked to:o Find out whether the baby is weighed regularly and theweight recorded on a growth chart. (Children may be ableto help mothers to get a growth chart.)o Help every time the baby is weighed and fill in the chartwith mother (usually at the clinic).o Help explain the meaning of the growth chart when this isnecessary, e.g. to father, aunt, childminder.Help mother to feed the baby.Help to feed my brother or sister after they have been ill.Explain to others at home why this is important.Look after the other children while mother takes the baby to theclinic.Measure the heights of younger brothers and sisters at home bymarking heights on a wall (with name and date).7269 We CanOrganize a 'better food' fair based on the school:oGive cooking demonstrations, especially of food forgrowth (see pages 63 and 64 for ideas, e.g. porridge enrichedwith mashed vegetables and a little oil or fat).o Show results of a poster competition.o Put on plays and puppet shows about feeding childrenoften.o Have games and sideshows about feeding and growth foryoung children.(Many other activities are possible. Once a child-ledcommittee is established, they will identify and planactivities themselves.)Have partners in the youngest class in the school and measuretheir heights regularly.BASKET OF IDEASChildren visit the health workerwho can tell them how familiesare advised about good feeding.Children learn how healthworkers recognize malnutritionby measuring mid-armcircumference of childrenbetween one and five years.Children find out how mothersin their community know whentheir babies are getting thinner.Some mothers put strings aroundthe babies' arms, legs or hips.These strings need changing asthe baby grows.Children make up a drama or a puppet show about two families,one with children who are growing well and one with children whoare not. Why is this so? What can the families do? Can they helpeach other?Children make up songs about normal weight gain (e.g. a babywho is growing well doubles its birth weight by about five to sixmonths). 7073 EVALUATION QUESTIONSChildrenDo we know our own height (and weight, if scales are available)?Have we measured the heights of our younger sisters andbrothers?Can we fill in the growth chart?Have we been to the clinic to see how babies are weighed?Have we helped to give babies and young children four or fivemeals a day?Have we helped brothers and sisters who have been ill byencouraging them to eat an extra m-eal each day?TeachersDo children understand:The meaning of a growth chart?Why it is important to weigh babies monthly?The different reasons why some children are too thin?Health WorkersHave we helped children understand the importance ofweighing babies and filling in the growth charts? 74 71 What children need to know and pass on aboutChildDevelopment 1 Everyone who loves, cares, and plays with babies can helpthem to learn and develop. Children, who spend so muchtime with their brothers and sisters, are among their mostimportant 'teachers'.The seven prime messages in this chapter can assistolder children, together with theii parents, to help youngchildren grow up bright and happy - and to build thefoundations for them to learn well at school. 7275 PRIME MESSAGESand supporting information1Babiesb'eginto learn rapidly from the moment they are born.By age two, most of the growth of the human brain is alreadycomplete. For good mental growth, the child's greatest need isthe love and attention of adults.A baby's five sensessight, smell, hearing, taste, touch are allworking from the moment of birth. And from the moment of birth,a baby begins learning about the world.* From birth, one of the greatest needs of all children is to betalked to, touched, cuddled, hugged, to see familiar faces andexpressions and to hear familiar voices, and to see that others willrespond to them. Children also need riew and interesting things tolook at, listen to, watch, hold, and play with. This is the beginningof learning. Human voices are the most important thing for thebaby to hear. Human faces are the most important thing for thebaby to see. Babies should not be left on their own for long periodsof time.* If a child has plenty of love and attention, and babyish play, aswell as good nutrition and health care, then the child's mind willalso grow well.Play is important to a child's development. By playing, a childexercises mind and body, and absorbs basic lessons about theworld. Parents can help a child to play.O Children play because it is fun. But it is now known that play isalso an important part of a child's development.By playing with simple objects and imitating the world of adults,children begin to learn about the world around them. Play alsohelps develop the skills of language, thinking, and organizing.Children learn by trying things out, comparing the results,asking questions, setting themselves new challenges, and findingways to succeed. Play builds knowledge and experience, and helpsa child to grow in curiosity, confidence, and control.7673 Parents can help a child's play and learningby providingthings to play with and suggesting new things for the child to tryto do. But parents should not control or dominate the child's playtoo much. They should watch closely and follow the child's ideasand wishes.Parents can help a child to do what he or she wants to do; butif parents do too much then the child loses the chance to learn bytrying to do things for himself or herself. Children learn most fromtrying to do something and failing and then trying a different wayand succeeding.0 When a very young child insists on trying to do something forhimself or herself, parents should be patient. As long as the child isprotected from danger, struggling to do something new and difficultis a necessary step in the child's development even if it meanssome frustration. A little bit of frustration helps a child to learnand master new skills. Too much frustration can be discouragingand gives the child a sense of failure. Parents are the best judge ofwhen to offer help and when to leave children to find their ownsolutions.it Children love to dress up and pretend to be someone elsemother, father, teacher, doctor, or some imaginary character. Thiskind of play is also important. It helps the child to understand andaccept the ways in which other people behave. It also helps todevelop the child's imagination. Parents can encourage these 'leespretend' -games by giving children old clothes, hats, bags, beads, orpieces of fabric to play with and dress up in.Children sometimes need to play alone. But sometimes theyneed to play with adults as well. Talking to infants, repeatingwords and sounds, singing, music, nursery rhymes, repetitivebabyish gamesall of these are vital to the child's happiness andnormal growth and development.Children learn how to behave by imitating the behaviour ofthose closest to them.The example set by adults and older children is more powerfulthan words or `orders' in shaping the growing child's behaviour andpersonality. If adults show their anger by shouting, aggression, andviolence, children will learn that this is the right way to behave. Ifadults treat children and others with kindness, consideration, andpatience, children will follow their &ample.4 Children under the age of about four years are naturally self-centred. Only gradually do they learn to share and consider others. 7477 4Selfish and unreasonable behaviour is normal in young childrenbecause they are emotionally as well as physically immature. Asthey grow up, children will learn to be unselfish and 'reasonable ifothers are unselfish and reasonable with them. They will learn totreat others as they themselves have been treated.Young children easily become angry, frightened, and tearful.Patience, understanding, and sympathy with the child'semotions will help the child to grow up happy, well balanced,and well behaved.A child's emotions are very real and powerful, even if theysometimes seem unreasonable to adults..Children may befrightened of strangers, or of the dark, or they may be very upset andcry about something very small.. Or they may become unreasonablyfrustrated and angry if they are unable to do something or if theyare told they cannot have something they want.Parents need to understand and sympathize with the child'semotions. If crying or anger or fearfulness is laughed at orpunished or ignored, children may grow up shy, withdrawn, andunable to express emotions in a normal way. If parents are patientand kind when a child is struggling with strong emotions, the childis more likely to grow up happy and well balanced.Young children sometimes appear to lie because they cannot yettell the difference between the real world and the world of theimagination.e* When a child does something wrong or unacceptable, it shouldbe pointed out firmly but calmly that this is not the way to behave.Simple and reasonable explanations should be given. Childrenremember explanations and rules given to them by adults whomthey love and wish to please. Gradually they come to accept theseexamples and explanations as the basis for their own actions. It isin this way that the child comes to have a conscience and tounderstand the difference between right and wrong.e Crying is a young child's way of saying that something is wrong.Maybe the child is hungry, or tired, or in pain or discomfort, or toohot or too cold, or has been startled, or needs to be held andcuddled. Crying should not be ignored.S Some babies cry a lot and nothing seems to comfort them.Usually, this kind of crying begins at the age of three or four weeksand often happens at the same time each day. This may go on forup to three months. The cause. of this kind of crying is not known.It does not seem to harm the child.7875 Young children soon outgrow their fears if they have confidencethat their home is safe and that they are loved and protected bytheir parents or other familiar adults.5 6Children need frequent approval and encouragement.Physical punishment is bad for a child's development.If parents show approval of a child's behaviour, this encourages achild to be good. So it is important for parents to look out for goodbehaviour and to show their pleasure and approval. This is a muchbetter way of teaching a child to behave than constant criticism,shouting, and punishment.414 Parents should show their delight when a child learns a newskill, however small. If the child receives no encouragement, or toomuch criticism, the desire to learn and develop new skills isreduced.CY Physical punishment i.,bad for children. It makes children morelikely to grow up being unreasonable and violent towards others. Itcan also make children frightened, and this can destroy the child'snatural desire to please and to learn from his or her parents andteachers.The foundations of learning well in school can be built by theparents in the earliest years of a child's life.4-7) In the earliest years of life, parents can help build thefoundations for successful learning in school. From birth, a childwho feels loved, secure, and approved of is more likely to have thedesire and the confidence to learn rapidly.Parents can also help a child to learn by playing. All childrenneed simple play materials so that there is always something to door to explore at each new stage of the child's development. Thisneed not cost a lot of money. Water, sand, cardboard boxes,containers, wooden building blocks, safe household items, objects ofdifferent colours, a ball, and many traditional playthings are justas good as shop-bought toys. Whenever it is possible and safe,children should be allowed to make their own decisions. They learnbest from their own successes and their own mistakes. Parentsshould try to guide but not control the child's play.Preschool and child-care programmes can help prepare a child tolearn well at schoolif they provide lots of care and attention anda variety of play activities to help a child develop skills.Too much pressure on a child to learn and to do well in school isnot helpful. Teaching things like reading and writing and numbers 7679 at too early an age is like trying to build the top of a building first.Like a building, a child's capacity for learning grows in stages, eachstage built upon the last. The child learns best if parents andschool teachers provide the opportunity to learn whatever isappropriate at each stage. To do this requires skill and patience. Itmeans watching very closely and knowing when a child isbecoming too frustrated or too bored. And it means constantlyproviding new opportunities and just the right kind of newchallenges and interests for the child to continue his or her ownlearning process.Learning to speak and understand language is one of the mostimportant and complicated tasks facing young children. They learnbest if parents are constantly helping, right from birth, by talking,singing songs and nursery rhymes, pointing at things or people andgiving them names, asking questions, and reading or telling storiesas soon as the child'is able to understand. Children are able tounderstand language long before they can speak.It is possible to have 'conversations' with a child from the veryearliest age. It does not matter how simple or babyish theconversation is. What matters is `bathing the child in words'. Thechild needs tO respond to words and sounds and to see othersrespond to his or her own attempts at sounds and words. When achild begins to make sounds, words, and sentences, parents shouldshow their delight and encourage the child to build on the thingsthat have been learnt.Children learn to speak at different ages. In general, they beginto talk from about the age of one and can use complete sentencesby the age of four. By age six, all the basics of language haveusually been learnt. Encouragement and practice during these firstsix years is very important to the child's later success in learningto speak, read and write, and to do well at school.40 There is no difference between the physical, mental, andemotional needs of boy and girl children. Both have the same needfor play and the same capacity for all kinds of learning and bothhave the same need for expressions of love and approval.A parent is the best observer of a child's development. So allparents should know the warning signs which mean that achild is not making normal progress and that something maybe wrong.Some children progress more slowly than others, and this initself need not be a cause for alarm.The following is a parents' guide to what children should be able8077-111 to do at three months, twelve months, two years, four years, andfive years of age. If a child cannot do these things at the right age,this.does not necessarily mean that there is a serious problem. Butit does mean that the matter should be discussed with a healthworker.At three months, does your child:Turn head towards bright colours and lights?Move eyes to loud sounds?Make fists with both hands?Wiggle and kick with legs and arms?Smile?Make cooing sounds?At twelve months, does your child:Sit without support?Crawl on hands and knees?Get up to standing position (with support)?Pick things up with thumb and one finger?Follow simple directions?Give affection?Say two or three words?At two years, does your child:Use two- or three-word sentences?Recognize familiar people and objects?Carry an object while walking?Repeat words that others say?Red himself or herself?Identify hair, ears and nose by pointing?At four years, does your child:Balance on one foot?Play simple games with others?Ask questions?Answer simple questions?Show different emotions?Wash hands alone?Point to six colours?At five years, does your child:Speak clearly?Dress without help?Copy a circle, square, triangle?Count 78Si OBJECTWES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that babies and young children pass through certainstages of development, e.g. learning to smile, sit, walk, talk.Understand that at each stage of development babies can behelped to learn. Playing and talking with babies helps themdevelop faster.Know how to encourage play, and make and use toys that helpbabies and young children to develop their curiosity and knowledgeof the world around them.Understand that babies need love and attention for mentalgrowth and that neglecting young children or treating them badlylimits their development.Understand why young children may easily become angry,.frightened or tearful.UNDERSTANDING about childdevelopment1. Making a record of baby's developmentBaby's development cardChildren mark a sheet of paper into 4 sections across and 13sections down the page as is partly shown in the diagram. Thesections across are the weeks in the month; 1, 2, 3 or 4. Thesections down are themonths 3-15.

In school, they display it and explain to other children howthey observed the exciting development of their baby brother orsister.2. Looking at ourselves now ... how are we differentfrom babies?Children tell, then mime the stages they passed through fromwhen they were very small until now.First we...(smiled)Then we... (sat up)Then we...Then we...Other children (and the teacher) challenge the order orsuggest what has been forgotten.3. Recording songs and gamesChildren discuss what songs and games they know for playing withbabies before they can walk and talk. They ask grandparents whatsongs and games they know.List the songs and games under headings, e.g.:0 Lullabies.o Songs with actions.0 Games using fingers and toes. 8083 o Games using objects (like passing a small box or a soft ballfrom one hand to another).o Action games (such as gently throwing baby into the air and,catching her).Children try out all the songs and games with babies at home.Which did they like best? Back in class, children make anillustrated class book of games for babies.4. Understanding feelingsStories ... when I was littleOlder children remember and tell stories about 'When I was little'.They describe what made them happy; what made them sad; whatfrightened them most ... why? They write down and illustrate thestories.Observing and reporting from homeWhat makes the baby happy? What makes the baby cry? Whatfrightens the baby?Imagining ... if I were one year oldHow big would the goat seem to be?How big would the chair seem to be?What would make me cry?Children draw or write about what they imagine.Miming and talking about feelingsChildren mime simple situations and show feelings. For example: Aboy is lost. A girl has torn her new book. A child snatchessomething from another.Other children watch and discuss how they would feel in thatsituation. Then they suggest how they can help.CHILDREN'S ACTIONI CanPlay with babies at home. Help them to smile and laugh; graspand hold things; hide and find things; sit up, crawl and walk.Talk with babies, and sing to them. Help them look at and talkabout objects and pictures they see.Encourage them to say more words. Make a list of the wordsthat they learn.Make toys and books for babies.6481 We CanMake toys together: A TOY-MAKING WORKSHOP IN A SCHOOL OR YOUTH GROUPChildren make: 4404 111.611\u00b0Play materials for building, sorting, fitting together Play materials for imagination and pretending a rPlay materials for outside games Play materials to start reading and counting 8 2 The toys and games that are made can be used by youngchildren at home, in play groups and preschool groups, at the clinicwaiting for treatment, or in hospital.M Help to set up and organize safe places to play for ourselves andyounger children.Watch over young children when they play.BASKET OF IDEASOlder children give younger ones many different kinds of thingsto play with and sort: flowers with different colours and differentsmells; scraps of cloth which look and feel different; dull thingsand shiny things; big things and small things.'E. Older children provide materials to help younger ones dress upand pretend. Paper, leaves, sticks and bits of cloth are used tomake hats, dresses, and other 'pretend clothes'.Older children design games of throwing and catching, jumpingand skipping, climbing and sliding, etc., that help youngerchildren use the muscles in their bodies. What kinds of equipmentdo children need? What can this equipment be made from?Older children make simple drums and rattles, and teachyounger ones to dance and sing, and play their instruments intime with songs.Older children provide materials that float and sink inwater, or make water flow long distances. Theymake reed pipes of different sizes that waterflows out of at different rates, or that are usedfor blowing bubbles. They collect containers ofdifferent shapes and sizes for younger ones touse when playing with waterand mud.Older children collectscrap paper, cardboard,newspapers, etc., for youngchildren to paint and drawon. They make paints frominks, dyes or local plants, andbrushes from chewed sticks.They make glue from a localfood like flour, mixed with alittle water.E 683 EVALUATION QUESTIONSChildrenAre we playing with our baby more? differently?Who talks to the baby now?

The seven prime messages of thischapter can help families and communities to prevent thespread of germs and so reduce illness and deaths.It is important to stress that these messages, to be fullyeffective, must be acted upon by everyone in the community.Children have a particular part to play because of the carethey provide for younger children and the example they canset for their peers and families.In communities without latrines, without safe drinkingwater, and without safe refuse disposal, it is very difficultfor families to prevent the spread of germs. It is thereforealso vital for the government to support communities byproviding - as a minimum - the materials and technicaladvice needed to construct latrines and improve drinkingwater supplies.To demand such services, everyone in the community,including children, needs to know the facts about howillness is spread. Today's children are tomorrow'scommunity leaders.PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationIllnesses can be prevented by washing hands with soap andwater after contact with faeces and before handling food.Washing hands with soap and water removes germs from thehands. This helps to stop germs from getting onto food or into themouth. Soap and water should be easily available for all membersof the family to wash their hands.#/# It is especially important to wash hands after defecating, beforehandling food, and after cleaning the bottom of a baby or child whohas just defecated. It is also important to wash hands afterhandling animals and after preparing raw foods.8987 6-1 Children often put their hands into their mouths. So it isimportant to wash a child's hands often, especially before givingfood.4T\" A child's face should be washed at least once every day. Thishelps to keep flies away from the face and to prevent eye infections.Soap is helpful for washing, but not absolutely essential.Illnesses can be prevented by using latrines.t%. The single most important action that families can take toprevent the spread of germs is to dispose of faeces safely. Manyillnesses, especially diarrhoea, come from the germs found inhuman faeces. People can swallow these germs if the germs getinto water, onto food, onto the hands, or onto utensils and surfacesused for preparing food.-' To prevent this happening:o Use latrines.o If it is not possible to use a latrine, adults and childrenshould defecate well away from houses, paths, watersupplies, and anywhere that children play. After defecating,the faeces should be buried. Contrary to common belief, thefaeces of babies and young children are even moredangerous than those of adults. So even small childrenshould be taken to use the latrine. If children defecatewithout using a latrine, then their faeces should be clearedup immediately and put down the latrine or buried.o Latrines should be cleaned regularly and kept covered.o The faeces of animals should be kept away from homes andwater sources.Illnesses can be prevented by using clean water.Families who have a plentiful supply of safe piped water, andknow how to use it, have fewer illnesses.Families without a safe piped water supply can reduce illnessesif they protect their water supply from germs by:o Keeping wells covered.o Keeping faeces and waste water (especially from latrines)well away from any water used for cooking, drinking,bathing or washing.0 Keeping buckets, ropes and jars used to collect and store 88 water as clean as possible (for example by hanging upbuckets rather than putting them on the ground).o Keeping animals away from drinking water.Families can keep water clean in the home by:o Storing drinking water in a clean, covered containek.o Taking water out of the container with a clean ladle or cup.o Not allowing anyone to put their hands into the container orto drink directly from it.o Keeping animals out of the house.Illnesses can be prevented by boiling drinking water if it is notfrom a safe piped supply.t Even if water is clear, it may not be free from germs. The safestdrinking water is from a piped supply. Water from other sources ismore likely to contain germs.rc) Boiling water kills germs. So, if possible, water drawn fromsources such as ponds, streams, springs, wells, tanks, or publicstandpipes should be brought to the boil and cooled beforedrinking. It is especially important to boil and cool the water thatis given to babies and young children; they have less resistance togerms than adults.If boiling or disinfecting water is not possible, it can be madesafer by using sunlight. Choose containers made of colourless orlight blue glass or plastic. You must be able to see through them.Remove all labels, fill with the cleanest water available, and coverthe containers to keep out dirt and insects. Put them in an openspace where the sun can shine on them all day. Spread them out sothat they do not shade each other. Leave the containers in thesunlight for at least a day. The longer the containers are insunlight, the greater the chance that the water will be safe. Thismethod of making water safer does not work on cloudy days.LWRaw food is often dangerous. It should be washed or cooked.Cooked food should be eaten straight away - not left to stand.armed-up food should be thoroughly reheated.7 Thorough cooking kills germs. Food should be cooked rightthroughespecially meat and poultry.Germs like warm food. Cooked food should be eaten as soon aspossible after cooking so it does not have time to collect germs andcause illness.9 189 0 If food has to be kept for more than five hours, it shouldeither be kept hot (above 60\u00b0c) or kept cooled (below 10\u00b0c).0 If cooked food is saved, it should be thoroughly reheated allthe way through before being used again.o Raw food, especially poultry, usually contains germs.Cooked food can be contaminated by even the slightestcontact with raw food. So raw and cooked foods shouldalways be kept away from each other. Knives, choppingboards, and food-preparing surfaces should always becleaned after preparing raw food.o Pasteurized or freshly boiled milk is safer than raw cow'smilk.0 If possible, food prepared for infants should be freshly madeand not stored.0 Cloths for cleaning dishes or pans should be changed everyday if possible and boiled before being used again.Illnesses can be prevented by keeping food clean.Germs on food can enter the body and cause illness. But food canbe kept safe by:0 Keeping food-preparing surfaces clean. Germs grow in spotsof dirt or food.0 Keeping food clean and covered and away from flies, rats,mice, dogs and other animals. Sealed containers are best.Illnesses can be prevented by burning or burying householdrefuse.Germs can be spread by flies, which like to breed in refuse suchas food scraps and peelings from fruit and vegetables. Every familyshould have a special pit where household refuse is buried orburned every day.OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that many illnesses, including diarrhoea, wormsand other intestinal parasites, result from poor hygiene and in particular from contamination of food and water by germs fromhands infected by faeces.Understan'd that illnesses can be prevented by washing handswith soap and water after contact with faeces and before handlingfood.Understand why latrines must be built and used; and know howto keep them clean and safe.Understand that little children's faeces are especially dangerous;know how to get rid of faeces in a safe way; and how to train youngchildren in cleaner habits.Know how to keep water clean and safe, both where it is foundand when it is being stored and used.Know how food can be prepared and stored to make it safe toeat; and understand the importance of washing utensils forcooking and eating, to remove all traces of food.Understand that flies spread germs; know where flies breed; andhow to prevent illness by burying or burning refuse (rubbish).UNDERSTANDING about hygiene1. Pictures to promote discussion of how faeces spreaddiseaseWith the help of a picture or blackboard drawing, hold a classdiscussion about ways in which faeces spread disease.In groups of eight to 10, each child then draws a picture toshow how faeces of children, adults and animals spread diSease.Children in the group look at the pictures, and discuss and list thedangers. They make an oral report to the whole class.Afterwards each child draws a second picture of how thedisease could be prevented by better hygiene.2. A survey ... where and how do we get our water?Help children do a simple survey to find out for themselves that:oThere may be different water sources with varying waterquality used for different purposes, e.g. washing clothes,drinking.oEveryone in the community can affect water quality bytheir actions, such as covering wells and protecting thesurroundings from cattle.9391 OneHelp children to organize their work in six stages:Lea find out the answers to these questions:0 Where are the different water sources in the area?0 How much water is provided in each place?0 How clear is the water?o What are the surroundings like in each place at the well,the stream, the tap?0 How is the water source protected?0 How could it be contaminated?'0 How do we carry our water?0 How long does it take to walk home?TwoHow will we collect the information?o Each child reports on the water source the family use,answering the questions above, ORo Older pupils divide into groups and each group visits one ortwo sources, OR0 If the sites are quite close, the whole class visits the sources.ThreeHow will we inake a record of the information!o Make a table with the water sources along the top, and thequestions down the side. Fill in the answers across the page.Four 'Five 92How will we display the information!n Make a big map of the area, with each water source shownand comments next to it.0 Children draw the container used in their family to fetchwater, cut round the drawing and fix it alongside their watersource.0 They mark the approximate position of their house on themap.What can we learn from the inlbrination!n The number of sources of water available in the wet and dryseasons.o The number of families in the class using each source.S4 , o The quality of water at each source.o The water sources which need community action to improvethem.o Who collects water and how much time it takes.o If people did not have to collect water, how might the timesaved be used to itnprove health?SixHow can we use the information?o To show which water sources need improvement.o To encourage community action.3. An experiment and demonstration ... how latrinescan pollute water suppliesHelp children choose a large container and fill it with sand.Sprinkle plenty of water on the sand. The water will collect at thebottom and form an underground pool equivalent to the 'watertable' from which wells draw their water. Stick a cylinder piercedwith small holes in the sand (use half a plastic bottle without abase), removing sand as necessary. This repnsents a well. Waterwill rise in it. Stick another, smaller cylinder close to the well. Thisis the latrine. Pour acoloured liquid such as ink or dye into thelatrine. This represents urine and faeces. The dye will reach theunderground pool and colour the water. After a while the water inthe well with also be coloured. Ask children to:o Draw and write about the experiment.u Explain it to another class.9593 4. Looking at dirty water from a pondBorrow a lens, or better still a microscope, from the local secondaryschool, to see the tiny organisms swimming about. Some of theseare harmful (the germs). Boiling water kills most of these germs,but placing it in sunlight, in a clear glass or plastic bottle, also killsgerms. Filtering water is another way of making it safer to drink.5. Model-making...dirty fliesChildren Make large model flies using available materials such asseeds, clay, six bent twig legs and two leaf wings. Other children make models or pictures of food for the flies to'walk' on (or use real food).The flies are made to 'walk' in dirt and then on a cleansurface. This shows.how they spread germs on their feet.Hang some of the flies on a sloping string across the classroomto show how flies pass from a picture of human or animal faeces toa picture of food on a plate. 94PG 6. Stories and drama...action to improve hygieneChildren write stories and then act them. Here are some ideas tohelp children start their stories. Discuss these story beginningswith children and then let them develop them in their own way.Pairs of children can co-operate in writing stories. The best storiescan be dramatized.The Water DirtiersoSome powerful and selfish people in the community make thevillage water source dirty with their animals or by throwingrubbish in it...(What can children do?

Nearly all thesedeaths can be prevented and children helped to grow anddevelop.The main causes of diarrhoea are poor hygiene, lack ofclean drinking water, overcrowding, and the trend towardsbottle-feeding rather than breastfeeding. It is theresponsibility of government to support the community intackling these basic problems.Older children have a key role, both as family membersand as future parents, in understanding the dangers ofdehydration and learning to take action to prevent it athome. They can recognize when dehydration is severe andneeds medical help. They are also powerful agents inspreading messages concerning the importance of feedingyounger children with diarrhoea.PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationDiarrhoea can kill children by draining too much liquid fromthe body. So it is essential to give a child with diarrhoeaplenty of liquids to drink.c;l) Diarrhoea is dangerous. Roughly one in every two hundredchildren who get diarrhoea will die from it.Most often, diarrhoea kills by dehydration. This means that toomuch liquid has been drained out of the child's body. So as soon asdiarrhoea starts, it is essential to give the child extra drinks toreplace the liquid being lost.Suitable drinks to prevent a child from losing too much liquidduring diarrhoea are:o Breastmilk.o Gruels (mixtures of cooked cereals Rice water.o Fresh fruit juices.102'101 o Weak teas.o Green coconut water.o Water from the cleanest possible source (if possible, broughtto the boil and then cooled).oOral rehydration salts solution.In almost all countries, special drinks for children withdiarrhoea are available in pharmacies, shops, or health centres.Usuaily, these come in the form of packets of oral rehydration salts(ORS) to be mixed with the recommended amount of clean water(see box on next page). Although ORS is especially made for thetreatment of dehydration, it can also be used to preventdehydration.Do not add ORS to liquids such as milk, soup, fruit. juice orsoft drinks.If ORS is not available, dehydration can be treated by giving thechild a drink made from four level teaspoons of sugar and half alevel teaspoon of salt dissolved in one litre of clean water.This is less salt and less sugar than recommended in the firstedition of Picts for Life. In practice, too much salt and sugar havesometimes been used because spoon sizes differ and becauseparents sometimes add more salt and sugar in the belief that thiswill make the treatment more effective. But too much sugar canmake the diarrhoea worse and too much salt can be harmful to thechild. Therefore a more dilute formula is now recommended. If themixture is made a little too dilute, no harm can be done, and thereis very little.loss of effectiveness.To replace the liquid being lost from the child's body, one of thesedrinks should be given to the child every time a watery stool ispassed:o Between a quarter and a half of a large cup for a childunder the age of two.o Between a half and a whole large cup for older children.The drink should be given directly from a cup or by a teaspoonnot from a feeding bottle. If the child vomits, wait for 10 minutesand then begin again, giving the drink to the child slowly, smallsips at a time.Extra liquids should be given until the diarrhoea has stopped.This will usually take between three and five days. 1021 0 3 ORS a special drinkA special drink for diarrhoea can be made by using a packet of oralrehydration salts (ORS). This drink is used by doctors and healthworkers to treat dehydrated children. But it can also be used in thehome to prevent dehydration.o Dissolve the contents of the pacl5et in the amount of waterindicated on the packet. If you use toolittle w4er, the drinkcould make the diarrhoea worse. If you use too much water,the drink will be less effective.oStir well, and give to the child to drink in a cup or feed witha spoon. A child with diarrhoea needs food.It is often said that a child with diarrhoea should not be givenany food or drink while the diarrhoea lasts. This advice is wrong.Food can help to stop the diarrhoea. Also, diarrhoea can lead toserious malnutrition unless parents make a special effort to keepfeeding the child during and after the illness.A child with diarrhoea usually has less appetite, so feeding maybe difficult at first. But the child should be tempted to eat asfrequently as possibleby offering small amounts of his or herfavourite foods.After the age of about six months, all children need extra food inaddition to breastmilk. They should be given soft, Well-mashedmixes of cereal and beans, or cereal and well-cooked meat or fish.Add one or two teaspoonfuls of oil to cereal and vegetable mixes ifpossible. Also good for the child are yoghurt and fruits. Fbodsshould be freshly prepared and given to the child five or six times aday. This diet should be continued if the child has diarrhoea.When a breastfed child has diarrhoea, it is important tocontinue breastfeeding.Mothers are sometimes advised to give less breastmilk if a childhas diarrhoea. This is wrong advice. Breastfeeding should continue- and if possible the child should be fed more often.If the child is being fed on milk-powder solutions or cow's milk,then feeding should continue as usual. 1 0 4 103 4 51A child who is recovering from diarrhoea needs an extra mealevery day for at least two weeks.44 Extra feeding after the diarrhoea stops is vital for a full recovery.At this time, the child has more appetite and can eat an extra meala day for at least two weeks. This will help the child to catch up onthe food 'lost' while the child was ill and the appetite was low. Achild is not fully recovered from diarrhoea until he or she is at leastthe same weight as when the illness began.e Breastfeeding more frequently than usual also helps to speed uprecovery. 6Trained help is needed if diarrhoea is more serious than usual,if it persists for more than two weeks, or if there is blood inthe stool.Parents should seek help from a health worker without delay ifthe child:0 Has a fever.0 Is extremely thirsty.0 Will not eat or drink normally.0 Vomits frequently0 Passes several watery stools in one or two hours.0 Passes blood in the stool (a sign of dysentery).or:0 If the diarrhoea persists for more than two weeks.If a child has any of these signs, qualified medical help is neededquickly. The doctor or health worker will give the child a drinkmade with special oral rehydration salts (see box page 103).In themeantime, keep trying to make the child drink liquids.Medicines other than ORS should not be used for diarrhoea,except on medical advice.Most medicines for diarrhoea are either useless or harmful. Thediarrhoea will usually cure itself in a few days. The real danger isusually not the diarrhoea but malnutrition and the loss of liquidsfrom the child's body.Do not give a child tablets or other medicines for diarrhoeaunless these have been prescribed by a trained health worker.Antibiotics should be given after seeking medical advice if a 104105 child has diarrhoea with blood in the stool. Other drugs shouki notbe used. Diarrhoea can be prevented by breastfeeding, by immunizingall children against measles, by using latrines, by keeping foodand water clean, and by washing hands before touching food.0 Diarrhoea is caused by germs from faeces entering the mouth.These germs can be spread in water, in food, on hands, on eatingand drinking utensils, by flies, and by dirt under fingernails. Toprevent diarrhoea, the germs must be stopped from entering thechild's mouth.Poverty and lack of basic services such as clean drinking watermean that many families find it difficult to prevent diarrhoea. Butthe most effective ways are to:o Give breastmilk alone for about the first six months of ababy's life (breastmilk helps to protect babies againstdiarrhoea and other illnesses).o At the age of about six months, introduce clean, nutritious,well-mashed, semi-solid foods and continue to breastfeed.o If a milk-powder solution or cow's milk has to be used, giveit to the child from a cup rather than a bottle.o Use the cleanest water available for drinking (water fromwells, springs or.rivers should .be brought to the boil andcooled before use).o Always use latrines to dispose of faeces, and be sure to putchildren's faeces in a latrine immediately (or bury them).(Children's faeces are even more dangerous to health thanthose of adults.)o Wash hands with soap and water immediately after usingthe latrine and before preparing or eating food.o Cover food and drinking water to protectlt from germs.ri If possible, food should be thoroughly cooked, and preparedjust before eating. It should not be left standing, or it willcollect germs.o Bury or burn all refuse to stop flies spreading diseaseMeasles frequently results in serious diarrhoea. Immunizationagainst measles therefore also protects a child against this cause ofdiarrhoea. There is no vaccine to prevent ordinary diarrhoea.106105 OBJECTWES for children'sunderstanding 'and and andthat diarrhoea can kill, rapidly through dehydration or laterbecause it causes malnutrition and weakens a child's resistance todisease.Know how to recognize the signs of diarrhoea and dehydration,especially the danger signs in severe diarrhoea which needsimmediate treatment by a health worker.Understand the causes of diarrhoea, and especially the linkbetween poor hygiene and diarrhoea.Know how diarrhoea is commonly treated in the community, andwhether such treatments effectively prevent dehydration.Know how to make appropriate drinks and when to give them tochildren with diarrhoea.Understand that a child needS' food as well as drink during andafter diarrhoea; and that babies with diarrhoea should continue tobe breastfed.UNDERSTANDING about diarrhoea1. A discussion...what is diarrhoea and what causes it?Start off with children's own experience. Describe the symptomsof diarrhoea and ask children:o Who has been ill like this?o When did you last have it?o What do you call it at home?o Has anyone heard the word 'diarrhoea'?Base the discussion around key questions - not too many - suchas: 106o How do you recognize diarrhoea?o Is diarrhoea just a nasty thing to have, or is it dangerous?o Which age group gets it more often and why?o Is there a particular time of the year when you and peoplein your family more often have diarrhoea? Do you knowwhy?o Are babies more likely to get it if they are fed with a bottleor if their mother breastfeeds them? Do you know why?107 llow the discussion with a summary of the main pointslearnt about diarrhoea.2. A survey...diarrhoea in our communityHelp the children do a simple survey to find out for themselves:o How common diarrhoea is in their community.0 That it is most common among children under five,particularly bottle-fed babies and babies who have startedto eat other fcods in addition to breastmilk.0 That it is most common in rainy seasons.0 That it may lead to dehydration and death.Children organize their work on this survey in five stages:One TwoLetb find out answers to these questions:0 Which children have had diarrhoea (either looking at thewhOle school, or at just one household)?0 Which age group has had it most often?0 Is there a season in which it is most common for children toget diarrhoea?0 Are there any babies or children who have dif;c1 after theyhad diarrhoea?How will we collect the information?0 By.asking other children in the school.0 By asking family members/members of the household.o By asking neighbours.0 By asking a village health worker or traditional healer.Three Four FiveHow will we make a record of the information?0 Make a chart showing the names of children, their ages, themonths of the year and the number of cases of diarrhoea.What can we ledrn from the information?0 The frequency of diarrhoea in the community.0 Which age group has diar iioea most often.0 In which season it is most common.How can we act on the infbrmatione0 Find out more about it.o Tell others.o Learn how to help when children have diarrhoea.198107 3. An experiment... explaining dehydrationThis simple experiment demonstrates what is happening to babies'body fluids when they have diarrhoea.Ask children to bring a small, hollow gourd to school. (If nogourd is available, an old ball, plastic bottle or anything similarwill do.) Draw a mouth and some eyeS on the gourd (seeillustration). Make a hole in the top of the gourd and two smallholes near the bottom, as in the drawing, to show where urine andstools come out. 108o Pour in water that has somesalt in it. First,.pour in somewater and let it all run rightthrough. Next, keep on pouringin enough water to keep somein the gourd even while wateris still running out.o Tell children the gourdrepresents the body of a childwho has diarrhoea. If the waterin the gourd 'baby' falls too low,this causes dehydration andcan cause death.o Explain that children withdiarrhoea need liquid (see page102 for amount) each time theypass a loose stool, to replace thewater and salt they have lost.Discuss the experiment with children, using questions like:oWhat happened to the water which was in the gourd baby'sbody?oHow can we replace the water and salt in the body that waslost through the diarrhoea?oHow do we keep enough water and salt in the body all thetime? (Water and salt must be replaced every time they arelost!)o What happens to the gourd baby's urine (from the fronthole) when the water level 'falls below the hole?o What happens to people, animals and plants if they havenothing to drink?109 Summarize the main ideas children have learnt aboutdehydration, e.g.:0 When we have diarrhoea, our bodies lose a lot of water(especially if we are vomiting and have fever).o When we lose water from our bodies, we lose salt too.0 Water and salt are essential to our bodies if we lose toomuch of them and they are not replaced quickly, we will die.4. A labelling game to help children remember the signsof severe dehydrationChildren write labels describing the following signs of severedehydration:Sunken fontanelle.Eyes and hands not moving.Dry mouth and tongue.Sunken eyes, no tears.Loose skin.Draw the outline of a baby on paper: on the blackboard; or onthe ground. Can children think of ways to play the game: label the baby?Remember: All games should emphasize that severely dehydratedbabies need attention from a trained health worker.1 1 0109 5. Dramatization...caring for children with diarrhoeaBefore writing and acting the playDiscuss with children to make sure they understand the followingkey messages:o It is important to be sure that children with diarrhoea drinkas much liquid as they lose.0 The extra drinks should be given right from the time thediarrhoea starts.o Giving lots of liquid to a child with diarrhoea may at firstincrease the amount of diarrhoea. This is natural. Most ofthe liquid will be absorbed and the body is trying to get ridof the germs with the diarrhoea.0 Children with diarrhoea need a drink each time they pass aloose stool (see page 102 for amounts).0 Getting a child to drink is not easy. We need to try, and tryagain, encouraging the child and giving a little of the drinkat a time.A play: When Baby had DiarrhoeaAsk children to make up their own play built around this outline:0 Mother and father are away.o The older children are left to look after younger ones.0 One of them recognizes that the baby has diarrhoea.0 The nearest clinic is five miles away.o A neighbour tells them that the baby needs an injection, butfortunately, they have learnt about diarrhoea at school sothey know this is wrong.o They go to their aunt who is very sensible and who learns alot about health at a women's group.0 She tells them the same thing that they've learnt at school...that the baby needs lots to drink and also food.0 She comes to their home and they make the drink together(see pages 101-102 for suggestions of suitable drinks).0 They go on giving the baby the drink: even after it hasvomited, they wait for a few minutes and then carry ongiving it smail sips on a spoon.o They keep on and on, even though they are tired and it isnot easy for them.0 After their parents return they go on helping to give thebaby drinks and food. 110111 oThe baby s'Arts to get better during the first day, but thediarrhoea continues for two more days and the children goon giving the baby extra drinks as well as food.Don't write the words for the play. Let the children make themup but make sure they get the facts right. Talk about the differentkinds of drinks that are suitable.

Without immunization,many children die or become disabled.Immunization campaigns worldwide have alreadyhelped to save millions of lives and children in manycountries have played a part in them. However, much moreneeds to be done to persuade all families to bring allchildren to be immunized at the right time, and to completethe full course of immunizations.Children are among the most powerful agents tocommunicate these messages and help their parents tomake full use of immunization services. 114115 1 2PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationImmunization protects against severid dangerous diseases.A child who is not immunized is more likely to becomeundernourished, to become disabled, and to die.Immunization protects children against some of the mostdangerous diseases of childhood. A child is immunized by vaccineswhich are injected or given by mouth. The vaccines work bybuilding up the child's defences. If the disease strikes before a childis immunized, immunization is too late.A child who is not immunized is very likely to get measles andwhooping cough. These diseases can kill. But even children whosurvive these diseases are weakened by them. They may not growwell. And they may die later from malnutrition or other illnesses.Measles is also an important cause of malnutrition, poor mentalgrowth, and blindness.* An unimmunized child will almost certainly be infected with thepolio virus. And for every 200 children who are infected, one will becrippled for life.ht Tetanus germs grow in dirty cuts and kill most of the people whobecome infectedif they are not immunized.Breastfeeding is a kind of natural immunization against severaldiseases. Some of the mother's resistance to disease is passed to thechild in her breastmilk, and especially in the thick yellow milk(called colostrum) which is produced during the first few days afterthe birth.Immunization is urgent. All immunizations should becompleted in the first year of the child's life.a It is vital to immunize children early in life. Half of all deathsfrom whooping cough, one.third of all cases of polio, and a quarterof all deaths from measles, occur before the age of one year.It is vital for infants to complete the full course ofimmunizations, otherwise the vaccines may not work. Some116115 vaccines need to be given only once. Others have to be given threetimes, with a gap of at least four weeks between each dose.The important thing for parents to know is that a child should betaken for immunization five times in the first year of the child's life:0 At birth, or as soon as possible afterwards, babies should beimmunized against tuberculosis.o In countries where polio is still a problem, newborn babiescan also be given a dose of polio vaccine. This is in additionto the three doses given at the ages of six, 10 and 14 weeks.0 At the age of six weeks, parents should bring their babiesfor a first immunization against diphtheria, whoopingcough, and tetanus. These three vaccines are given togetherin a single injection called DPT. The first of three doses ofpolio vaccine should also be given at this time.0 At the ages of 10 and 14 weeks, parents should return fortheir infants to complete the full course of DPT and poliovaccines.0 As soon as possible after the age of nine months, parentsshould bring their babies for immunization against measles.t Measles is one of the most dangerous of all childhood diseases.Fbr the first few months of life, the child has some naturalprotection against measles. This natural protection is inheritedfrom the child's mother. It may prevent measles vaccination fromdoing its job. But after about nine months, natural protectioncomes to an end. The child is now at risk from measles and can andshould be immunized. So it is vital to take a child for measlesvaccination as soon as possible after the age of nine months.If for any reason a child has not been fully immunized in thefirst year of life, it is vital to have the child immunized as soon aspossible.Immunization schedule cough, tetanus, polioDiphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polioDiphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polioMeasles (12-15 months in industrialized countries)and polio in some countries' National immunization schedules may differ slightly from country tocountry 11611 7 3It is safe to immunize a sick child.One of the main reasons why parents do not bring their childrenfor immunization is that the child has a fever, a cough, a cold,diarrhoea, or some other mild illness on the day the child is to beimmunized. Even if the child With a case of mild illness ormalnutrition is brought for immunization, health workers mayadvise against giving the injections. This is wrong advice. It is nowknown that it is safe to immunize a child who is suffering from aminor illness or malnutrition.0 After an injection the child may cry, develop a fever, a rash, or asmall sore. As with any illness, a child should be given plenty offood and liquids. Breastfeeding is especially helpful. If the problemseems serious or lasts more than three days, the child should betaken to a health centre.Every woman between the ages of 15 and 44 should be fullyimmunized against tetanus.In many parts of the world, mothers give birth in unhygienicconditions. This puts both mother and child at risk from tetanus, amajor killer of the newborn. If the mother is not immunizedagainst tetanus, then one baby in every 100 will die from thedisease.4* Tetanus germs grow in dirty'cuts. This can happen, for example,if an unclean knife is used to cut the umbilical cord or if anythingunclean is put on the stump of the cord. (Anything used to cut thecord should first be cleaned and then boiled or heated in a flameand allowed to cool.)If the tetanus germs enter the mother's body, and if she is notimmunized against tetanus, then her life will also be at risk.(e4 All women of child-bearing age should be immunized againsttetanus. All women who become pregnant should check to makesure they have been immunized against tetanus. In this way, bothmothers and their newborn babies will be protected..1:k If a woman is not already immunized, a first dose of tetanusvaccine should be given as soon as she becomes pregnant. Thesecond dose can be given four weeks after the first. This seconddose should be given before the last two weeks of the pregnancy.A third dose should be given six to 12 months after the seconddose, or during the next pregnancy.These three tetanus vaccinations protect the mother, and her118117 newborn baby, for five years. All infants should be immunizedagainst tetanus during the first year of life.If a girl or a woman has been vaccinated five times againsttetanus, then she is protected against the disease throughout heryears of child-bearing. Any children she may then have will also beprotected for the first few weeks of life.OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that all children need to be protected byimmunization against six killer diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria,whooping cough, tetanus, polio, measles); and that immunizationshould be completed in the first year of a child's life.Understand the dangers of not immunizing children.Know the national immunization schedule; and when and whereimmunization takes place locally.Know how to spread the immunization message; and help theirfamilies when they take children to the clinic.UNDERSTANDING about immunization1. Story-telling...what happened to children who werenot immunized?Tell stories to help children understand that:0 Babies must be immunized against the six killer diseases.o Babies.should be immunized in their first year of life.0 Babies who are not immunized against these diseases mayget very sick and die.Make up a story or build one from one of these outlines:o Our village is not far from the health centre. Theimmunization clinic takes place regularly. Most familiesbring their children, but one family never goes. They areamong the most successful farmers in the community. Thefather is strong and healthy.'Why should I take my children to the clinic?' he laughs.The clinic is for sick people. We are happy and lucky. Ourchildren will not be ill.' 118119 They had a daughter aged 10 who went to school. Whenthe youngest baby was born, she pleaded with her parents totake him to the clinic as she had-learned aboutimmunization, but they would not listen to her Then therewas an epidemic of polio in the village. The baby and anolder boy of three became sick. Neither died but both areseverely disabled..The baby may never be able to walk.0 I live in a town with my mother brother and baby sister Ourfather went away. We do not see him any more. The baby isstill small and when she was six weeks old my mother tookher to be immunized. She was told to come back four weekslater for the baby:s second immunization. But when the timecame my baby sister had a cold and our neighbour advisedmy mother not to take her to the clinic. My mother never tookmy sister to the clinic after that. I think she was worriedabout what the health worker would say to henThen our neighbourk boy caught whooping cough, andour baby caught it too. She has been coughing, vomiting,losing weight and becoming weak. Sometimes she goes bluewith the cough. The health worker has told my mother thatour baby may die.0We live in a big house outside town. My family is rich andthere were only two of us, me and my brother who was oneyear old. I know my parents took him to be immunized fourtimes when he was very small, but I don't think they evertook him for a measles immunization when he was ninemonths. He was so healthy and I heard my uncle tell themthat healthy children don't need to be taken. .Then last month I caught measles. I wasn't very sick,but then my brother caught it. It was terrible. He had a highfever for six days with red eyes, a runny nose, noisybreathing and a cough. He had a rash all oven On the sixthday his breathing got worse. They told me he had caughtpneumonia. Two doctors came to the house. They tried tosave him. It was too late, and now my baby brother is dead.Remember that whichever story you use, it will work better if:n You make sure the children understand the language.The story has some excitement, action and drama in it.o The story shows children what they themselves can achieveas a group.0 It captures their interest because it appeals to their sense of120U9 adventure, or their desire to help, or is about .,omethingimportant to them.Involve the children in the story right from the beginning andhelp them to contribute to it. Here are some suggestions:El The children can name the characters and the story itself.o Give them something to look for in the story before youbegin:want you to tell me why the child was notimmunized.'El Allow them to predict the action: 'Well, she can do threethings, what do you think she will do?'o Invite their suggestions: 'Who would listen to him? What doyou think they should do?'o When the story is over, ask them`to consider alternatives:'Suppose she had immunized the baby, what might havehappened?' 'Would the story be different if people in thecommunity knew all the facts about immunization?'EI You need to make sure that they have understood the healthmessage. To help them remember the messages in the storyyou can do some of these things:Help the children to draw the story in a series of pictureswhich they can mix up and put back in the right order.Help them to make their own story book complete withpictures and cover.Ask a group of children to tell the story, each contributing apart, or to tell the story from different characters' points ofview.2. Role-play ... why have children not been immunized?Children discuss in class and list the reasons why families do notimmunize their children and why the reasons are wrong.Then they form groups and pretend to be adults.

Most coughs and colds getbetter without special medicine. But sometimes colds turnto pneumonia. Four million children die of pneumonia everyyear.The clearest sign of pneumonia that everyone can learnto recognize is QUICK BREATHING. Pneumonia needsimmediate treatment with special medicine given only by adoctor or health worker.Breastfeeding, good food, a smoke-free home, andimmunization against whooping cough, measles anddiphtheria can help prevent pneumonia.Children can help others with coughs and colds recoverand grow strong by making sure they have good food andplenty to drink. They can also learn to recognize the dangersigns of pneumonia so that babies at risk can get medicalhelp quickly.PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationIf a child with a cough is breathing much more rapidly thannormal, then the child is at risk. It is essential to get the childto a clinic quickly.`.' Most coughs and colds, sore throats and runny noses will getbetter by themselves. But sometimes pneumonia develops andthreatens the child's life. Millions of child deaths from pneumoniacould be avoided if:o Parents know when a cough or cold is becoming a seriousinfection that needs medical attention.o Medical help and low-cost drugs are available.Parents of a child with a cough should know that it is essentialto get the child to a clinic or a trained health worker quickly if:oThe child is breathing much more rapidly than normal (over50 times a minute).oThe lower part of the child's chest (the area between the tWohalves of the child's ribcage) goes in as the child breathes in1 2 6125 2instead of expanding outwards as normal.0 The child is unable to drink anything.If a child is breathing normally, coughs and colds and runnynoses can be treated at home without drugs. Most medicines soldfor coughs and colds are useless or harmful.Families can help prevent pneumonia by making sure thatbabies are breastfed for at least the first six months of life andthat all children are well nourished and fully immunized. 3* BreastfeedingBreastrnilk helps to protect against infections. On average, babieswho are bottle-fed have twice as many bouts of pneumonia asbabies who are breastfed. It is particularly important to givebreastmilk alone for about the first six months of a baby's life.FeedingAt any age, a child who is well fed is less likely to become seriouslyill or to die because of pneumonia.Vitamin AVitamin A, from orange or yellow fruits arid dark green leafyvegetables, also helps to protect against pneumonia.0 ImmunizationImmunization should be completed before the child is one year old.The child will then be protected against some of the most commoncauses of serious respiratory infections, including whooping cough,tuberculosis and measles.0 CrowdingOvercrowding helps the spread of coughs and colds. At night,infants who are breastfed can sleep with the mother. But olderchildren should be encouraged to sleep on their own.A child with a cough or cold should be helped to eat and todrink plenty of liquids.Important things to remember when treating a child at home areto:g7, Continue feedingA breastfed child with a cough or cold may be difficult to feed. But 126127 feeding helps both to fight the infection and to protect the child'sgrowth. So it is important to persist in frequent attempts to givebreastmilk. Clearing the child's blocked nose will help the child tosuck. If a child cannot suck, it is best to squeeze out the breastmilkand feed the child from a clean cup.Children who are not being breastfed should be coaxed intoeating frequent small amounts. Periods of 'starvation' caused byillness and lost appetite are a major reason for poor growth. Whenthe illness is over, a child should be fed an extra meal each day fora week. Recovery is not complete until the child is at least thesame weight as when the illness began.II Give plenty of fluidsAll children with coughs and colds need to drink plenty of liquids. A child with a cough or cold should be kept warm but not hot,and should breathe clean, non.smoky air. Keep warm not hotBabies and very young children lose their heat easily, so it isimportant to keep them covered and warm, but not too hot or tootightly wrapped.Fever is not always a sign of severe illness. But if a child has afever, paracetamol (or other temperature-reducing medicine) can begiven.Help in breathingA child's nose should be frequently cleared, especially beforebreastfeeding or when being put to sleep. A moist atmosphere canhelp to ease breathing. It can also help if the child inhales watervapour from a bowl of hot but not boiling water.The air in the child's room should be kept fresh by opening adoor or window two or three times a day. But a child with a coughor cold should be kept away from draughts.Clean airChildren who live and sleep in smoky surroundings, either becauseof cooking fires or tobacco smoking, are more likely to getpneumonia. Tobacco smoke in the air that a child breathes cancause long-term damage to the child's health.Spitting and sneezing by other people close to children alsoincreases the risk. People with coughs and colds should be keptaway from young babies.1 8 127 OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that most coughs and colds get better on their ownand that most medicines sold for coughs and colds are useless orharmful.Know how to help children with coughs and colds by giving themgood food and plenty of drinks, and keeping them warm and awayfrom smoky places.Be able to recognize the danEer signs of pneumonia in babiesand young'children, and know that they should be taken to ahealth worker immediately.Know that children are less likely to get pneumonia if they arebreastfed, well nourished, protected by adequate vitamin A, andimmunized against whooping cough, measles and diphtheria.UNDERSTANDING about coughs, coldsand pneumonia1. A story or play, followed by discussion and drawing...right and wrong ways of treating a coldPresent the following outline:The Market 'Doctor'o A child gets a heavy cold and makes a big fuss.o His family take him to the market.o A 'doctor' is there with his own medicines including a strongand very expensive antibiotic. Injections cost even more,and he always recommends them.o The family choose an injection.o The child's arm swells up and the cold gets no better.o They consult the health worker who tells them they havewasted their money and put their child at risk. Sherecommends the right practices (refer back to objectives andFbcts for Life messages) and advises the family to buy andgrow more fruit and green vegetables to help protectchildren against coughs and colds in future.Children make either plays or stories, based on the outline. 128129 They discuss the play or story in relation to their own experience,and draw a series of pictures to illustrate it.2. A discussion .about pneumonia led by the healthworkerInvite the health worker to come to the school and talk to thechildren about pneumonia.Fb llow the talk by a discussion reinforcing children'sknowledge and relating it to theif own experience. The followingquestions may be,included:0 How can we tell the difference between a bad cold andpneumonia?0 What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonia?0 Do we know anyone who has had pneumonia? For how long?What time of the year was it? Did it start on its own, orfollow from a cold, or from measles, diphtheria or whoopingcough? Did it get better? What helped? Was any medicinemade at home, or did it come from the doctor or healthworker?From the discussion children should learn that:0 All children (and also adults) can get pneumonia, but babiesunder one year are more likely to get it than older children.0 Pneumonia can start on its own, follow from a cold, or followfrom measles, diphtheria or whooping cough.0 The clearest and surest sign of pneumonia is quickbreathing. A healthy baby, lying still and not crying, takesabout 30 breaths a minute. But a baby with pneumonia,lying quietly, takes more than 50 breaths a minute, andpersistently breathes at this rate (for over 10 minutes).0 Other signs are also important and easy to recognize (seepages 125-126).3. How to count breathsWe need to learn how to count breaths to be sure to recognize quickbreathing. (Mothers usually know when their babies are breathingtoo fast even without a watch.)Counting breathsIf a watch or clock is available, children work in pairs, countingeach other's breaths for one minute. They write down the numberof breaths. Then one child does any activity from List A, the otherany activity from List B. They count each other's breaths after each139129 activity, then chanv over and continue, each time writing downthe result. ASitting quietlyReadingStanding stillHummingWritingDigging,Rubming on the spot very fastSkipping 30 timesJumping as high as possible 30 timesStepping on and off a chair or bench 30 timesLifting something heavyCountingBy comparing different rates of breathing, children soon begin tounderstand what is normal and what is fast breathing.If they do not have a watch or clock, a third child can act astimekeeper, counting up to 100 at a steady speed, or walking upand down at the same pace. Children can compare the rate ofbreathing for different activities, even if they cannot measureaccurately.Making pendulumsChildren make pendulums from string which does not stretch, andstones. The string should be 225cm long before the stone is tied on.Then three loops should be tied: 35 cm from the stone; one metrefrom the stone; and two metres from the stone.Children hold the loop and swing the pendulum. The stoneswings from side to side. All the children should breathe in timewith the stone: breathe in as it swings one way; and breathe out asit swings the other way:21 times per minute when the string is two metres long (anormal adult's, or older child's, rate of breathing).30 times per minute when the string is one metre long (anormal baby's rate of breathing).50 times per minute when the string is 35 cm long. This is therate at which a baby with pneumonia breathes. Danger! If ababy breathes at this rate for over 10 minutes, it should betaken to a health worker fast. 130131 35cm.

Children are particularly at risk whenthey are made weak by other diseases and poor nutrition.Children can contribute to national malaria controlprogrammes by helping to prevent mosquitoes frombreeding and biting people.They can also learn how to help a child with fever bypreventing the temperature from rising too high and givingthe sick child plenty of liquids. 134135 1 2PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationPreventing and managing malariaYoung children should be protected from mosquito bites,especially at night. 3Malaria is spread by the bite of a mosquito. Care should betaken to keep mosquitoes away from young children. There areseveral ways of doing this:o By using bed nets (preferably impregnated with a mosquitorepellent).OBy using fumigants such as mosquito coils.o By putting screens on house windows and doors.o By killing mosquitoes in the house.All members of the community should be protected againstmosquito bites. A mosquito can pick up malaria from an infectedperson and pass it on to someone who is uninfected.Communities should destroy mosquito larvae and preventmosquitoes from breeding.Mosquitoes breed wherever stagnant water can collect: in ponds,swamps, pools, pits, drains, sometimes even tin cans and hoof-prints. They may also breed along the edges of streams, in overheadtanks, and in rice fields. Filling in or draining places where watercollects can kill the mosquito larvae. Overhead tanks can becovered. The larvae in rice fields can be killed by alternately dryingout the field and introducing larvae-eating fish into the water.Regular clean-ups of the nuighbourhood help to reduce mosquitobreeding.Wherever malaria is common, pregnant women should takeanti.malarial tablets throughout pregnancy.Pregnant women are more than twice as likely to suffer from136135 malaria. The disease is also more dangerous during pregnancy. Itcan lead to severe anaemia ('thin blood'), and may cause amiscarriage, premature birth, or stillbirth. Babies born to womenwith malaria are also very likely to be \"small, weak, and vulnerableto infections.Pregnant women can be effectively protected against malaria bytaking anti-malarial tablets regularly throughout pregnancy.41 Anti-malarial tablets should be obtained from a clinic or healthworker as not all anti-malarials are safe to take during pregnancy.Wherever malaria is common, a child who has a fever shouldbe taken immediately to a health worker. If malaria appears tobe the cause, the child should be given a full course of an anti-malarial drug. 5 6A child with a fever, believed to be caused by malaria, should begiven a course of anti-malarial tablets (young babies may be givenan anti-malarial syrup). Treatment for malaria should beginimmediately. Even a day's delay can be fatal. A health worker canadvise on what type of treatment is best and how long it should last.A child should be given the full course of treatment, even if thefever disappears rapidly.If the symptoms continue, the child should be taken to ahealth centre or hospital -- the malaria may be resistant to the -drugs.Nursing children with fever (from malaria or othercauses)A child with a fever must drink frequently. ORS solutionreplaces salt as well as water lost through sweating.When children have fever, they sweat. Sweating is importantbecause it helps to cool them by evaporation. But they also losewater from their bodies.A child with fever needs to drink frequently and this drink needsto put back the salt which has been lost, as well as the water. ORSdrinks should therefore be given to children with fever.A child with a fever should be kept cool but not cold. A childwith a very high temperature (fever) is in danger of fits whichcan cause brain damage.Malaria and other infections can cause a very high temperature 136137 and make a child have fits (convulsions). If the fits go on for morethan 10 minutes they can lead to brain damage, particularly inyoung children and babies.When a child has a very high temperature this should bebrought down immediately by:o Giving a temperature-reducing medicine (such asparacetamol).o Removing the child's clothes. Never put many clothes orblankets on children with fever.o Sponging, particularly the forehead, hands and feet. Ifnecessary, bathe the child in cool (not cold) water.These activities will also prevent a moderate temperaturegoing very high.7 1A child recovering from a fever (or other disease) needs plentyof liquids and food.I A fever, from malaria or other causes, burns up energy and thechild loses a lot of liquid through sweating. Once children arewilling to eat, they should be encouraged to eat plenty to make upfor the food missed while they had a poor appetite. They shouldcontinue to drink plenty.N.B. Some of the prime messages and supporting information inthis section have been expanded in order to give more informationabout nursing children with fever.OBJECTWES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that malaria is spread by mosquitoes which breed instagnant water and bite at night, spreading germs from infected tohealthy people.Know how to prevent malaria by stopping mosquitoes breedingand biting; and understand that bed nets impregnated with amosquito repellent are the best means of protection againstmosquito bites.Understand that malaria can be treated by anti-malarial tabletsavailable from a health worker and that the full course of tabletsmust be taken.138 137 Know how to help a child with a fever by keeping them cool butnot cold.Understand that children with a fever need plenty of drinks toreplace the water and salt they have lost through sweating.Know how to help a child recover by giving plenty of liquids andextra food for at-least a week afterwards.UNDERSTANDING about malaria andfever1. Making a map* of places around the school or theneighbourhood where mosquitoes might breedFrom this children can learn to:O Identify places where mosquitoes are likely to breed.0 Check the places where water collects to see if they havelarvae.o Plan actions to destroy potential breeding places.Before making the map, ask the children to:0 List the kinds of places where they might find mosquitolarvae.0 Decide how they will record what they find. .0 Decide how they will work as a group to investigate and torecord.0 Discuss and decide who they need to ask for perMission andhow they can ask with courtesy.Organize the investigationo Decide the best time for the investigation.o Set a time limit on it.o Supervise children's safety especially if the investigation isoutside the school compound.Help children make the mapo Children use their findings and make a map to show theplaces they have found where mosqito larvae might breed.o They display their maps and discuss their findings, e.g. Where arethe spots that are potential breeding places? Where did we findmosquito larvae? What actions can we take to prevent mosquitoesbreeding in these places?*There are many ways to make a map - it can be drawn on the ground, on the blackboard, onlarge pieces of paper for display, on graph paper or in the children's books; it can be modelledwith clay or snap material. 138139 2. A survey...how do we treat children who have feier?Plan which questions to askChildren may need to ask some of the following:0 How do families decide whether a child has fever?0 How do they decide when to.Oke the child to the healthworker?0 How do families treat and nurse a child with fever? (Askabout medicines and drinks given; and whether children arekept cool, or covered with blankets.)o Are children fed during and after fever? If so, how?Decide how to record the information0 Make a questionnaire with enough space to record answers.After the survey is completedo Discuss the results.0 Discuss and decide what information children can pass on,and to whom, about what they have learnt.3. Drawing or miming the malaria cycleExplain the four steps in the malaria cycle:o Mosquito bites person with malaria (at night).o Healthy mosquito sucks in parasites.0 Malaria parasite develops inside mosquito.0 Healthy person is bitten by malarial mosquito and getsmalaria.Children in groups decide how to present this information toeach other. They can draw it, mime it, or sing it.CHILDREN'S ACTIONI CanKill mosquitoes in the house.Make sure that nets are properly used.Make sure that younger children stay under the nets until firstlight and that nets are well tucked in.Check regularly for holes and tears in nets and sew them up(but even nets with some holes help to prevent malariaparticularly if they have been impregnated).140139 IP When the spray teams come, help carry food and other thingsout of the house.0 Care for children with fever ... wipe them with a cloth to coolthem, give plenty of drinks or the ORS drink, and food to makethem strong. When the health worker has prescribed medicine,help make sure that children take the full course.We Cane Destroy mosquito larvae. Fill in or drain places wheremosquitoes breed.0 Make and fit covers for water pots and containers.Act, mime or dance, at a school open day:o The life cycle of a mosquito.o Careless and careful families and villages (some can act thepart of clever mosquitoes).o How to care for a child with fever.Make posters to show:o How malaria is spread.o How it can be controlled.o That children need to take the full course of medicine.MALARIIKILLSSTOP Nioso 14 ITO( 5Bill NC,MALARIAgiLksSTOP MOVPut=BREEDNGI \u00b0 BASKET OF IDEASIn mathematics, children make graphs of the increase anddecline of malaria in different seasons of a year, either in oneschool or based on records from the health centre. 140141 it In social studies, children do surveys and make maps (whereare there most cases of malaria? where do mosquitoes breed?)-2 In science, children learn about thelife cycle of the mosquito.In language, children write storiesand plays about malaria, and sharethem with others. Some titles mightbe:o Mrs Mosquito and Her Friends.oThe Day the Spray Pam Canze toOur Village.oCareless Moses (who did not takethe full course of medicine).In cultural subjects, children make upsongs and dances, and draw pictures.The agricultural worker tells thechildren about breeding fish whichdestroy mosquito larvae.EVALUATION QUESTIONSChildrenDo we know how malaria is spread and how it can be prevented?Have we taken any action to prevent mosquitoes breeding andbiting?Do we know how to look after a child with fever?TeachersDo children know which mosquitoes carry malaria, when theybite, and how the malaria germ is passed from one person toanother?Have we included messages about malaria in different subjectsacross the curriculum?Health WorkersHave children helped to spread new knowledge about how onurse children with fever (e.g. keep children cool not hot; givedrinks and food)? 142 141 What children need to know and pass on aboutAIDS How can we stay safe?AIDS is at present incurable. IIW, the virus which causesAIDS, kills by damaging the body's defences against otherdiseases.Millions of people worldwide are infected, and numbersare rising every year. Increasing numbers of babies arebeing born with HW. In addition, millions of uninfectedchildren will be orphaned by AIDS during the 1990s.At the moment, the only effective weapon against thespread of AIDS is public education. That is why everyperson in every country should know how to avoid gettingand spreading HIV.Children have a key role in protecting themselves,spreading messages to others, and helping those who haveAIDS or who have been left without parents. In order to dothis, they must understand how the virus which causesAIDS is acquired and spread. 142143 \"kg 1PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationAIDS is an incurable disease. It is caused by a virus which canbe passed on by sexual intercourse, by infected blood, and byinfected mothers to their unborn children.t AIDS is caused by a virus known as the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV). HIV damages the body's defence system.People who have AIDS die because their body can no longer fightoff other serious illnesses.e- People infected with HIV usually go for many years without anysign of disease. They may look and feel perfectly normal andhealthy for all of that time. But anybody infected with HIV caninfect others.Co AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection It takes an average of 7-10 years to developfrom the time when a person is first infectedwith HIV. AIDS is not curable, although some medicines have beendeveloped to keep people with AIDS healthier for longer.e Anyone who suspects that he or.she may be infected with HIVshould contact a health worker or an AIDS testing centre. It isvital for those who have the virus to learn how to avoid passing itto others, and to receive advice about how to take care of their ownhealth.HIV can only be passed from one person to another in alimited number of ways:oBy sexual intercourse, during which the semen or vaginalfluid of an infected person passes into the body of anotherperson. HIV can be passed in this way from man to man,man to woman, and woman to man. Worldwide, nine out often infections in adults have been passed on through sexualintercourse.o By the use of unsterilized needles or syringes for injectingdrugs.oBy blood transfusions, if the blood used has not been testedfor HIV.0 By an infected woman to her unborn child.144 143 If a mother is infected with HIV, then there is a risk thatbreastfeeding may give the virus to her baby. But where otherdiseases and malnutrition are a common cause of death in babies,not breastfeeding is a much greater risk. Without safe water,sterile bottles and teats, and enough milk-powder, bottle-fed babiesare much more likely to become ill and malnourished, and to die,than babies who are breastfed. In such conditions, it is safer for thechild to be breastfed even if the mother is infected with HIV.If, It is not possible to get HIV from being near to or touching thosewho are infected with the virus. Hugging, shaking hands, coughingand sneezing will not spread the disease. HIV cannot betransmitted by toilets seats, telephones, plates, glasses, spoons,towels, bed linen, swimming pools, or public baths.A person infected with HIV is not a public health danger.People who are sure that both they and their partner areuninfected and have no other sex partners are not at risk fromAIDS. People who know or suspect that this might not be thecase should practise safer sex. This means either sex withoutintercourse (penetration), or intercourse only when protectedby a condom.Mutual fidelity between two uninfected partners protects bothpeople from HIV.The more sex partners<you have, the greater the risk that one ofthem will be infected and can infect you. The more partners yourpartner has, the greater the risk that he or she will be infected andcan infect you.People who have genital sores, ulcers, or inflammation, or adischarge from the vagina or penis, are at greater risk of becominginfected with HIV and of passing it to others. Prompt treatment forall genital infections is therefore very important.Unless you and your partner have sex only with each other, andare sure you are both uninfected, you should reduce your risk ofHIV by practising safer sex. Safer sex means kissing, caressing andother kinds of non-penetrative sex (where the penis does not enterthe mouth, vagina or anus), or using a condom (a sheath or rubber)every time you have intercourse.Even if a condom is used, anal intercourse (in which the penisenters the rectum or back passage) is much more risky thanvaginal or oral penetration. .The only way to avoid any such risk is to abstain from sex. 1441 45 Any injection with an unsterilized needle or syringe isdangerous.Iv A needle or syringe can pick up small amounts of blood from theperson being injected. If that person's blood contains HIV, and if thesame needle or syringe is used for injecting another person withoutbeing sterilized first, then HIV can be injected.Those who inject themselves with drugs are thereforeparticularly at risk from AIDS. So are people who have sex withthose who inject drugs.Drug injecting is in itself dangerous. But because of theadditional risk of HIV, those who do inject drugs should never useanother person's needle or syringe or allow their own needle orsyringe to be used by anyone else.';. National child immunization programmes use needles that aresterilized between each use and are therefore safe. All infantsshould be taken for a full course of immunization in the first yearof life. 4f Other injections are often unnecessary, as many usefulmedicines can be taken by mouth. Where injections are necessary,they should be given only by a trained person using a sterilizedneedle and syringe.Ear-piercing, dental treatment, tattooing, facial marking andacupuncture are not safe if the equipment used is not sterilized. Itis also not safe to be shaved by a barber using an unsterilizedrazor. Women infected with HIV should think carefully about havinga baby - and seek advice. There is a one-in-three chance thattheir babies will also be born infected with IIW.Women with HIV infection have about a 30% chance of givingbirth to a baby who will also be infected with HIV. Most babiesinfected with the virus will die before they are three years old.In some countries, HIV tests are available to couples who areconcerned that one or both of them might be infected. The resultscan help them decide whether to have children. Even if only theman is infected, the woman may become infected through sexualintercourse while attempting to conceive, thereby putting herselfand her baby at risk.146 145 5All parents should tell their children how HIV is spread.Apart from protecting yourself and your partner, you can alsohelp to protect your children against HIV by making sure theyknow the facts about how to avoid getting and spreading theinfection.Children also need to know the facts about how HIV does notspread. They need to be reassured that they run no risk of gettingthe virus from ordinary social. contact with HIV-infected children oradults. Children should be encouraged to be sympathetic towardspeople who are infected with HIV.Everyone can help in the worldwide effort to stop HIV fromspreading to the new generation.OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that AIDS is incurable.0 Understand how HIV is spread and that it can be spread bypeople who appear to be well.Understand that HIV is not spread by normal social contact.* Understand what decisions they have to make to avoid beinginfected with HIV.Know how to resist sexual pressure from adults, e.g. those inauthority, friends of the family.0 Understand that people infected with HIV and AIDS in familiesand communities need help and friendship from other communitymembers including children.UNDERSTANDING about AIDS1. Collecting health information material and using itto find out about HIV and AIDS(This activity is suitable for children from 10 years old.)Finding outAsk the children to collect pamphlets, posters and otherinformation material available in the community that tells aboutHIV and AIDS and other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). 146147 Learning about itOrganize the children in groups to look at the materials and toshare what they have learnt. They find the answers to threequestions: Why is HIV dangerous? How is it spread? How can weavoid getting it?Checking that we know and understand about itWhen children display the posters and the material they havecollected, organize a quiz to check that they know the facts aboutHIV and AIDS, e.g.:Ask children to give sentences on what they know about HIVand AIDS. Make a list by writing them on the board. Eachgroup then has a chance to respond to one sentence by saying'true' or 'false', whichever they think is correct. Another groupcan challenge if they disagree. They use the pamphlets andposters to decide the right answer.(See Facts for Life information to check that all information iscorrect.)2. Role-play. . .to practise saying 'no' Talk with children about situations when it is sometimes difficultto say `no'.List the situations and decide if they involve unsafe healthpractices.List the reasons why it is difficult to say `no' to unsafe healthpracticeslike drinking alcohol, smoking, taking drugs.Discuss strong ways to say 'no' to people who try to get us todo something we know is an unsafe practice.148 147 Ask children to imagine how people might try to persuadethem into an unsafe practice; how would they say 'no' in a waywhich is polite but firm? For example, when asked to have acigarette; to drink alcohol; to go somewhere with a stranger; to gosomewhere with a-person they know but think it is not right to bealone with; to try taking drugs; to have sexual intercourse.Put the children in groups or pairs and let them choose asituation to practise saying 'no'. In each group, one or two of themare the persuaders and the others are the 'no-sayers'. They act outthe situation.Help them to discuss the role-play:o How did you feel when you were asked to do the unsafething?0 How did you feel when the persuaders would not acceptyour 'no'?o In the real situation, what might make you change yourmind?andCI Why did you want to persuade your friend to do the unsafething?o How did you feel when your friend said 'no\"?t=1 What kind of answer would make you stop trying topersuade your friend to do what they did not want.to do?At the end, summarize the importance of saying 'no' to unsafepractices that can lead to getting HIV and AIDS and spreading it.3. Activities about attitudes to people who have AIDSHelp children to:Use pictures, e.g. of someone caring for a friend with AIDS. Askthem to imagine how they would feel in the role of one person inthe picture. They can ask questions about what events led to thescene shown and what might happen in the future.Create short plays, for example about caring at home for a personwith AIDS. They can first act the play for themselves, then eachmake a simple puppet for their character and perform the playwith puppets for the rest of the school or the community.Fill in the details of a story, for example about an imaginaryschool pupil thought to have AIDS. The children divide into groupsrepresenting the pupil, other pupils, teachers and parents. Each 148149 group separately considers: 'What do I feel?', 'What are the maineffects on me?', and 'What do I want to happen?' After 15 minutesthe groups reassemble and share their discussions.CHILDREN'S ACTIONI CanBe strong and say 'no' to unsafe practices.- Help someone who has HIV or AIDS. .Write a poem about AIDS and read it to the family.Collect and share stories from religious books of people caringfor the sick.We CanMake a drama about a bad character (HIV). It tries to leadpeople into unsafe practices. Some, but not all, adults can bepersuaded. A group of children have learnt how to avoid it and howto tell other people about the dangers. The HIV character findsthat fewer and fewer people will listen to it.Perform the play for other children-and in the community (Inmany countries, such children's performances have been usedwidely in AIDS campaigns.)

In many countries parents and communities may feeluneasy about transmitting the explicit information inthis AIDS section to children. Those who transmit themessages need to be aware of cultural sensitivities whenthey decide at what age different information is given.They must reflect, however, on the need for children toknow these life-preserving facts before they becomesexually active and it is too late. 152 151 What children need to know and pass on aboutSafeMotherhood 1\\ .P 152153 1Although the prime messages concerning Timing Births andSafe Motherhood appear to be mainly for adults, childrenalso need to understand them, for two reasons. First,children are future parents and second, there are ways, asfamily members, that they can help their mothers andfathers to keep babies safe and healthy before birth andafter they are born.In societies where customs persist which can harm thehealth of mothers (e.g. very early marriage and pregnancy;use of untrained people as birth attendants), the school,together with the health worker, may have a responsibilityto transmit correct messages to future parents.PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationTiming birthsBecoming pregnant before the age of 18, or after the age of 35,increases the health risks for both mother and child.Every year over half a million women die from problems linkedto pregnancy and childbirth, leaving behind over one millionmotherless children. Most of these deaths could be prevented byacting on today's knowledge about the importance of planning'pregnancies.All girls should be allowed the time to become women beforebecoming mothers. In societies where many girls marry at an earlyage, couples should delay the first pregnancy until at least the ageof 18.Fbr health reasons alone, no girl should become pregnant beforethe age of 18. A woman is not physically ready to begin bearingchildren until she is about 18 years of age. Babies born to womenyounger thab 18 are more likely to be born too early and to weightoo little at birth. The birth itself is likely to be more difficult.Babies born to mothers who are too young are also much morelikely to die in the first year of life. The risks to the mother's ownhealth are also greater.154 153 0 After the age of 35, the health risks of pregnancy and childbirthbegin to increase again. If a woman is over the age of 35, and hashad four or more preyious pregnancies, then another pregnancy isa serious risk to her own health and that of her unborn child.The risk of death for young children is increased by about 50%if the space between births is less than two years.Fbr the health of both Mothers and children, parents should waituntil their youngest child is at least two years old before havinganother baby.O Children born too close together do not usually develop as well,physically or mentally, as children born at least two years apart.O One of the greatest threats to the health and growth of a childunder the age of twa is the birth of a new baby. Breastfeeding stopstoo suddenly, and the mother has less time to prepare the specialfoods a young child needs. Also, she may not be able to give theolder child the care and attention he or she needs, especiallyduring illness. As a result, the child often fails to grow and developproperly.O A mother's body needs two years to recover fully from pregnancyand childbirth. The risk to the mother's health is the'refore greaterif the next birth follows too closely upon the last. The mother needsto give herself time to get her strength and energy back before shebecomes pregnant again.(?: If a woman becomes pregnant before she is fully recovered frombearing a previous child, there is a higher chance that her newbaby will be born too early and too light in weight. Low-birth-weight babies are less likely to grow well, more likely to fall ill, andfour times more likely to die in the first year 'of life than babies ofnormal weight.Having more than four children increases the health risks ofpregnancy and childbirth.r:31 After a woman has had four children, further pregnancies bringgreater risks to the life and health of both mother and child.Especially if the previous births have not been spaced morethan two years apart, a woman's body can easily become exhaustedby repeated pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and looking aftersmall children. Further pregnancies usually mean that her ownhealth begins to suffer.7, After four pregnancies, there is an increased risk of serious 154155 health problems such as anaemia ('thin blood') and haemorrhage(heavy loss of blood). The risk of giving birth to babies withdisabilities, or with low birth weight, also increases after fourpregnancies and after the mother reaches the age of 35.There are many safe and acceptable ways of avoidingpregnancy. Family planning services can give couples theknowledge and the means to plan when to begin havingchildren, how far apart to have them, and when to stop.0 Most health clinics can offer different methods of familyplanning so that all couples can choose a method which isacceptable, safe, convenient, and effective. Couples should askadvice about the most suitable means of family planning from thenearest trained health worker or family planning clinic.Family planning is the responsibility of men as well as women.All men should be aware of the health benefits of family planningand of the different methods now available.Safe motherhoodThe risks of childbirth can be drastically reduced by going tothe nearest health worker for regular checkups duringpregnancy.q4 Many of the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth can be avoidedif the mother-to-be goes to a health centre as soon as she believesshe is pregnant. A health worker will help ensure a safe birth anda healthy baby by:o Checking the progress of the pregnancy so that if problemsare likely the woman can be moved to a hospital for thebirth.o Checking for high blood pressure, which is a danger to bothmother and child.o Giving tablets to prevent anaemia ('thin blood').o Giving the two injections which will protect the mother andher newborn baby against tetanus.o Checking that the baby is growing properly.o Giving anti-malarial tablets where necessary.o Preparing the mother for the experience of childbirth andgiving advice on breastfeeding and care of the newborn.156 155 6 7o Advising on where to go or how to get help if problems ariseduring childbirth.o Advising on ways of delaying the next pregnancy.A trained person should assist at every birth.A trained birth attendant will know:0 When labour has gone on for too long (more than 12 hours)and a move to hospital is necessary. 70 How to keep the birth clean and reduce the risk of infection.o How to cut the cord cleanly and safely.o What to do if the baby is being born in the wrong position.0 What to do if too much blood is being lost.o What to do if the baby does not begin breathing straightaway.o How to help the mother to start breastfeeding immediatelyafter the birth.o How to dry and keep the baby warm after delivery.o How to help the mother prevent or postpone another birth.If serious problems arise during childbirth, a trained birthattendant will know when medical help is needed and how to get it.To reduce the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, allfamilies should know the warning signs.With any pregnancy, it is important to ask the advice of a healthworker about where the baby should be born and who shouldattend the birth. If a family knows that a birth is likely to bedifficult or risky, it may be possible to have the baby in a hospitalor maternity clinic. Or it may be possible to move, temporarily,closer to a clinic or hospital so that the mother is within reach ofmedical help. The following are the warning signs to note duringpregnancy:0 Failure to gain weight (at least six kilos should be gained inpregnancy).0 Paleness of inside eyelids (should be red or pink).0 Unusual swelling of legs; arms, or face.Four signs which mean get help immediately:0 Bleeding from the vagina during pregnancy. 156157 8 9o Severe headaches (sign of high blood pressure).o Severe vomiting. .o High fever.Dangerous problems can arise during the process of giving birth.In at least half of all cases, there are no warning signs inpregnancy. Therefore all couples should know in advancewherethe nearest hospital or maternity unit is to be found and how to getthere. In case problems arise during labour, the father-to-be shouldmake advance arrangements for moving the mother-to-be to thenearest hospital or maternity unit. In particular, transport shouldbe arranged in case it is needed. All women need more food during pregnancy. All pregnantwomen need more rest.The husband and family of a pregnant woman should ensurethat she has a variety of extra foods every day starting as soon aspregnancy is confirmed. She should also have more rest than usualduring the daytime, especially in the three months before the birth.* A pregnant woman needs a variety of the best foods available tothe family: milk, fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, pulses, andgrains. There is no reason to avoid .any of these foods duringpregnancy.If possible, a woman should be weighed as soon as she knowsthat she is pregnant. It is important to gain weight every monthduring pregnancy, and to try to gain a total of 8-10 kilos before thebaby is born.Spacing pregnancies at least two years apart, and avoidingpregnancies below the age of 18 or above the age of 35,drastically reduces the dangers of child-bearing.,14 One of the most effective ways of reducing the dangers ofpregnancy and childbirthfor both mother and childis to planthe timing of births. The risks of child-bearing are greatest whenthe mother-to-be is under 18 or over 35, or has had four or moreprevious pregnancies, or when there is a gap of less than two yearssince the last birth.Avoiding births by having an unsafe abortion can be verydangerous. Illegal abortions carried out by untrained persons killbetween 100,000 and 200,000 women every year.158157 10 11Girls who are healthy and well fed during their own childhoodand teenage years have fewer problems in pregnancy andchildbirth.Safe and successful child-bearing depends most of all on thehealth and readiness of the mother-to-be. So special attentionshould be paid to the health, feeding, and education of adolescentgirls. The first pregnancy should wait unW at least the age of 18. If a woman who is pregnant smokes, or takes alcohol or drugs,her child may be damaged in the womb.A pregnant woman can damage her unborn child by smokingtobacco, drinking alcohol, and using narcotic drugs. It isparticularly important not to take medicines during pregnancyunless they are absolutely necessary and prescribed by a trainedhealth worker.N.B. Some of the supporting information included in Facts for Lifehas been omitted or shortened.OBJECTIVES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that a pregnant woman needs to have rest, and asufficient and balanced diet; and should avoid harmful drugs,alcohol and smoking.Understand that a pregnant woman needs to go to the nearesthealth worker for regular check-ups and advice; and also needs tobe immunized against tetanus.Understand that a trained attendant needs to be present atevery birth. The attendant will know when medical help is neededand how to get it.Understand that the health of both mother and children cansuffer when the space between births is too short.Know how to help mothers who are pregnant, by helping in thehome and with younger children. 158159 UNDERSTANDING about safe motherhood1. Discussion and role-play based on a pictureShow a picture of a mother and four children (aged six months, twoyears, three-and-a-half years, and five. years).Discuss:o What does mother have to do for each of these children?o What can each of these children do on their own?0 What can they do to'help each other?o WhO helps mother?0 Who lAps the children?o What happens.if nobody helps mother?0 What happens if mother gets sick, or if more than one childgets sick at the same time?Role-play:o Children take the roles of the mother and each of the foursmall children, including the baby.o The role-play should explore possible problems and benefits,from each one's point of view, e.g. 'My mother gets very tiredand cannot spend much time with me'; 'I am jealous of thebaby'; 'We can all play together'.2. A demonstration and discussion ... what happenswhen plants (food plants or trees) grow too closetogether?Children:o Grow seeds in two pots, or plots; one with seeds plantedvery close together, another with seeds properly spaced.o Visit a farm, or a wood, before plants are thinned.o Look at a picture: 1roo acneTOGETHER.ENOUGH SPACE BETWEENTHEMThey discuss:n In what'way do these relate to child-spacing?In what way are they different?1 60159 3. A visit from the health worker ... protecting theunborn childThe health worker explains to the children how a baby grows in thewomb and why it can be damaged if the mother drinks alcohol ortakes harmful drugs, or the mother or father smoke.Are there are any posters or pamphlets on this theme? If so,children collect, display and make their own copies.4. A demonstration ... the shortest and most dangerousjourneyIf it is culturally acceptable, the health worker and teacher candemonstrate, using diagrams (or, better still, models*) how a babymakes the shortest and most dangerous journey of its life, i.e. fromthe womb to the world.This activity helps children to understand why it is necessaryfor a trained person to assist at birth.CHILDREN'S ACTIONI CanHelp my mother or aunt when she is pregnant, so that she hastime to rest.Tell my older sisters and aunts about anti-tetanus injections.We CanPut on a play,'Who knows best?',comparing nutrition before andafter pregnancy in two families.Help look after younger children when mothers go for healthchecks during pregnancy.BASKET OF IDEASChildren draw a map to show wheretrained birth attendants live.Children write a story about earlymarriage and pregnancy: a girlmarries and has a baby while she isstill very young and at school.

This is where most deaths and serious accidents occur.Almost all can be prevented.The main causes of accidents for little children are:n Burns from cooking pots, lamps and electrical equipment,hot food, boiling water, steam and hot fat (scalds); and strongacids or corrosives (like battery acid) which damage the skin.:3 Cuts from broken glass, rusty pins, rough wood or sharpknives and axes.-2, Obstruction (prevention) of breathing from choking on smallobjects like coins, buttons and nuts.L3 Poisonous plants and fruit.Internal (inside) bleeding from swallowing sharp objects.I) Electric shock from touching a broken electrical appliance orelectrical wire. Electrical wires and connections should bechecked regularly. Bare wires are particularly dangerous.Families need to take special care to make their homeenvironment safe and to watch little children to prevent themfrom unsafe behaviour. Remember that houses are notdesigned for children, particularly children under two. Tryalways to look at safety at home with a young child in mind.164 163 DANGER FROM BURNSThe kitchen is the most dangerous place for children, and burnsand scalds the most common causes of death and serious accidents.Take particular care. There are many ways to prevent burns athome:o Watch babies and young children very carefully. Do not letthem go near the fire.o Raise the family cooking stove, or make an open cooking fireon a raised mound of cla3; instead of directly on the ground.o Be very careful that the handles of cooking pots are out ofreach of babies arid turned so that they are not easilyknocked over.o Put petrol, petrol lamps and matches out of reach of smallchildren.DANGER FROMPOISONft Young children are often injured or even killed when they eat ordrink dangerous things.6' Never put dangerous products (e.g. bleach, plant poison, paraffinkerosene I, petrol or pesticides) in a soft drink bottle. Children candrink them by mistake.t Keep all med ales and poisons out of reach, and out of sight, ofchildren. Lock medicines and poisons in a cupboard or trunk, orput them on a high shelf. Label all poisons and medicines carefully.Medicines are particularly dangerous because little children ofteneat tablets thinking they are sweets.IT6 Teach young children not to drink out of strange bottles or eatstrange fruits and plants which may not be safe.DANGERFROMSHARP THINGSMany cuts can be easily prevented:o Keep the floor clean of broken glass and nails. Get rid ofnails or splinters of wood which stick out.o Keep sharp knives and razors out of the reach Of youngchildren., DANGERFROM FALLSi Discourage little children from climbing into unsafe places.5 Where there are windows, be very careful. Children can fall fromthem and can also be cut if they break the glass. 164165 3Places where children often play should be made as safe aspossible. All glass bottles should be banned. Older childrenmust learn to take responsibility for the safety of youngerones at play.-6 Children above four years are particularly at risk outside thehome as they begin to explore their environment.0 Encourage children to avoid dangerous places in theneighbourhood where there may be machinery, animals, snakes,glass or sharp metal. -* Make wells safe so that children cannot fall in.it==- Teach children to teach each other to play safely, in particular toavoid:0 Climbing in dead trees.0 Swimming in swift-flowing rivers, and swimming alone.0 Throwing stones and other sharp things.q' Where there is a playground, check carefully and regularly:o That the equipment is safe and not rotten.0 That children of the right age are using the equipment.0 That little children are supervised.4Chilren under five years old are particularly at risk on theroads. They should be watched and taught appropriate safetybehaviour as soon as they can walk.Little children do not think before they run out into the road.They cannot estimate how fast vehicles are travelling, and cannottell by listening where a vehicle is coming from.Families need to watch little children carefully, and teach themwhen they are young, always to:o Stop at the road side.0 Hold the hand of an older person when crossing the road.Older children should be taught to:0 Choose safe places to cross.o Look both ways and listen every time they cross.Older children must always take responsibility for younger ones.Little children should be discouraged from playing with ballsnear the roadside.166 165 Children who ride bicycles need to be given special training. All families need to know simple first aid - particularly thatrelated to burns, cuts and wounds, and swallowing poisonsand other objects. Many common practices are dangerous tohealth. FIRST AID FOR WOUNDS AND CUTS0 If the wound is not serious:o Wash the wound with very clean (or boiled) water and soap.o Dry the skin around the wound.o Cover the wound and the skin around it with a very cleanpad of cloth (not cotton wool or any fluffy material) andbandage it in place.o Wash the wound and put on a clean bandage every day.6 If the wound is serious:o If there is a lot of bleeding, press firmly against the wound(or near to it if there is something stuck in it). Use yourhand if you have no cloth.o Put a bandage on the wound and take the person to thehealth worker.o If the person has not been recently immunized againsttetanus, tell the health worker, who should begin theimmunization course immediately.REMEMBER:tk Do not put any plant or animal matter on the wound.FIRST AID FOR BURNSRemove the person from the source of the heat. If a person'sclothing is on fire, wrap them in a blanket or roll them on theground to put out the fire.* Cool the burnt area immediately using lots of cold, clean water.It may take up to half an hour to cool the burnt area. If the burn isvery large, put the person into a bath of cold water.For small burns (less than the size of a large coin or stamp):o Keep the burnt area clean and dry, and protect it with aloose bandage. If the burn is bigger than a large coin, showit to a health worker. 166167 For large (serious) burns:0 Cover the burnt areawith a dry and very cleanpiece ofcloth, and get medical helpimmediately.REMEMBER:Do not break the blisters.Do not remove any clothingwhich is sticking to theburnt area.* Do not put grease, oil orherbs on the burn.FIRST AID FOR POISONDo not try to make the person vomit.Seek the help of a healthworker immediatelyTry to find out what thepoison was and take it with you to thehealth worker.N.B. The prime messagesand supporting informationin thissection do accidents in the home andhow they can be prevented.Understand their responsibility, alongside adults, to watch overothers, particularly youngerchildren, to prevent unsafebehaviour.Know and practise roadsafety rules for themselvesand withfriends.Know how to make theirneighbourhood safe and choose safeplaces to play.Know and practise simplefirst aid for burns, cutsand wounds.Know which practices They makethree lists or on theroad, out-of-doors; anddecide whichkind of accidents happenmost often Why do children think theseaccidents happen? If theycan discover why they happen,they can also find out howto prevent them from happeningso often.Children discuss which accidents are most common for children at different ages (and why) under two years, from twoto six years, after six years.2. Role-play basedon pictures At home Outsidee2, a03 Discussion... what is it like to be a baby or young child? 168169 Children make a 'dangerous home' and a 'safe home' in theclassroom. They crawl the hazards.S. First aid ... practising what to doChildren watch a demonstration and then practise in pairs howthey would act in situations where simple first aid is needed, e.g. aburn on a child's arm; a cut on a child's foot.4. Drawing and discussion about road accidentsDraw some different road situations on the board:o A school on a wide straight road with heavy lorry traffic.0 A bend on the road with trees and bushes alongside.0 A playground on a street with many parked cars.Make the drawings very simple.Children look at the drawings and suggest where and whyaccidents can happen, and what they should do to prevent them:0 If they are children drossing the road.0 If they were adult road users.5. Using the school playground to teach children aboutroad safetyDraw 'roadways' on the ground and ask children to practisecrossing the road. Make it more interesting by creating somedangerous situations.Some children act as fast cars, overloaded lorries, bushes,parked vehicles, policemen, or careless drivers.Back in the classroom, children in pairs or groups make listsof rules for crossing the road safely and present them to the class.Which set of rules is the clearest and most useful?CHILDREN'S ACTIONI CanSurvey my own home. What dangers are there? What does myfamily do to protect babies and small children from these dangers?What more could I do? What could I suggest to my family?Watch over younger children at home, on the roads, and on theway to school.Make up a song about road safety to a popular tune, and teach itto little ones.170 169 Practiseroad safety as a pedestrian and a cyclist.We CanMake up, illustrate and display our own safety codes for homeand school, e.g. a big sister's/brother's code for looking after littleones; a cyclist's code. Different groups can make then' own codes onthe same theme, then discuss and combine them to make a finalversion.Organize a safety campaign based on the school. (Do not try tocover everything. Find out the most common causes of accidentsand concentrate on those, one at a time.) The campaign shouldinclude practical actions to make the school safe.Learn, and teadh each other simple first aid.Make first aid kits for school and home.A metre of clean cloth cut in halfEstablish a first aid post at school.BASKET OF IDEASChildren make a hazard map of their localarea and identify the danger spots.Children hold a traffic survey outsideschool and watch for dangerousbehaviour.The teacher invites a policeman tovisit the school and talk to childrenabout accidents.Children write and perform playsand puppet shows about accidents and whatcan be done to reduce them. 170171 The school organizes a poster competition on a particular theme,e.g. dangers in the kitchen. Children make up catchy slogans.EVALUATION QUESTIONSChildrenWhat dutnges have we and our families made in our homes tomake them safer?What changes have we made in our school to make it safer?What changes have we helped to make in our neighbourhood tomake it safer?Do we watch little children to protect them from danger?Do we help younger children to cross the road?Have we taught them our safety rules?Are we following our safety rules when we walk and cross theroad? if we ride a bicycle?TeachersHave the children carried out a safety campaign?Do they know simple first aid for cuts, wounds and burns?*Have they made first aid boxes ft& home and classroom?Are they used and re-stocked?Health WorkersIs there any change in the number of accidents since the safetycampaign?Are people in the area more aware of correct, simple first aid?Are adults more aware of the consequences of careless anddangerous practices, and have they changed their behaviour, e.g.putting medicines out of reach; encouraging auth orities to buildroad humps? 172 171 What children need to know and pass on aboutFood for theFamily r-r 77ze radishes we grew Lowther4A ye' .1'-- Good nutrition in childhood contributes to both physicaland mental growth. Although children, and adults, may nothave control of the amount of food svailable, and when itcan be eaten, it is vital to provide the best possible nutritionfrom what is available. In order to do this, co.operation willbe necessary from the whole family, most especially fathers. 172173 1 2PRIME MESSAGESand supporting informationChildren need food for their minds as well as their bodies.Good food in the first years increases potential for doing wellin school and living a successful and happy life.Energy food such as oils, fats and sugar, and food cooked withthese, is important for young children. They need energy to runand play. Play is an important part of the learning process.In many parts of the world, children are now growing taller thantheir parents. This is due to better feeding early in their lives.Children also grow rapidly during puberty. Good food during thisperiod will help children become healthy mothers and fathers whenthey are adults.All children need access to the best food available in thefamily; girls as well as boys, children as well as adults.In many cultures, customs suggest to mothers that they shouldgive their husbands and boys more, and the best, food. As a resultthe difference in size between men and women is greater than itshould be.Girls who are well fed will do better at school and be moresuccessful in bringing up children. For the best pregnancy. awoman needs to eat well but also to have eaten well as a child.Traditional beliefs which suggest that some food, for exampleeggs and fiSh, should not be eaten by girls, are being questioned inmany countries.Parents should understand that even small children need half asmuch food as their fathers and need varied foods which containproteins and vitamins.In cultures where children share the family meal, mealtimes areseen as a time when adults can share ideas and experience withtheir children and can pass on their moral and ethical values.Children need to be encouraged to talk about their own activities(e.g. in school) and adults to listen to these.174173 3All children need to be given the opportunity, and encouraged,to eat frequently. They need a wide variety of available food tohelp their growth. 4fa Growing children need continual supplies of energy food tomaintain their growth. Therefore it is essential for them to eatoften. Social pressures, and those of modern life, often preventthem from doing so.O Children often suffer from:o Missing early morning meals because adults go early towork or children go early to school.o Leaving long gaps between meals in the middle of the day.oEating main meals late in the evening when they are tootired to eat properly.It- Parents should do their utmost to ensure that their children donot suffer as a result of infrequent or irregular meals.A wide variety of food will ensure that children receive vitaminsand minerals as well as the energy and protein needed for activityand growth. These foods include:oStaple foods, e.g. millet or rice.0 Energy-rich foods, e.g. red palm oil, sunflower oil,margarine, sugar.oBody-building foods, e.g. beans, peas, lentils, eggs, fish,meat.0 Protective foods, e.g. carrots, oranges, green vegetables.Many foods, e.g. milk and avocado, fall into more than one ofthese categories.Wherever possible, families need to grow at least some of theirown food. Orange or yellow fruits and vegetables, and darkgreen leafy vegetables, are easy to grow and necessary toprovide vitamins which protect the body from illness.Orange or yellow fruits and vegetables, and dark green leafyvegetables, are important sources of vitamin A. If people do nothave enough vitamin A their resistance to diseases is lowered andthey are more likely to be ill and even to die. Severe lack of vitaminA can cause eye problems and even blindness.Fruit and vegetables can be grown even in small gardens or intins or pots. The whole family, including the children, can thus be 174175 5encouraged to contribute to their own diet, and children can learnskills which they can use as adults.tio Sharing knowledge and skills about growing food, e.g. betweenolder and younger children, between grandparents and children,helps families to live happily and effectively together.Some foods, such as fruit, leaves of certain trees, and spinach,have always been collected and eaten. Families can learn torecognize and cook what is available.Soil is a resource that cannot be replaced. With more people inthe world there is a greater need to make better use of it.Families should preserve and enrich their soil for themselvesand their descendants.t9 Families must protect their soil from being washed away orblown away. This happens particularly when:o There is overgrazing.0 The land is not carefully protected, e.g. through contourplanting and ridging, and good drainage for water.o Too many trees are cut down.<P. Soil can be enriched by wise choice of crops, and by good use ofcompost and, where appropriate, animal and human waste.0 Tree planting needs to be encouraged but trees need to beplanted in the right places and well tended. .All families need to become aware of ways of protecting andenriching their soil.N.B. The prime messages and supporting information in thissection do not appear in Facts For Life. This section has beenspecially prepared for Children for Health.OBJECTWES for children'sunderstanding and actionChildren should:Understand that different types of food contribute to energy,body-building and protection against disease.Understand that all children, girls as well as boys, need goodfood to promote their physical and mental growth. ,Understand that even small children need half as much food astheir fathers. They need to eat often throughout the day,particularly energy-rich foods.176 175 Understand that orange or yellow fruits and vegetables anddark green leafy vegetables can help to prevent illness; and knowhow to tend them.Understand the need to conserve soil and know how to enrich itand protect it from erosion.UNDERSTANDING about food for thefamily1. A discussion about food ...good food at good pricesChildren discuss what foods they usually eat, and how these foodscontribute to their health.Based on their new knowledge (see pages 17 3-175), are thereany improvements which could be made in their diets withoutincreasing the costs of food?2. An eating timetableMake a simple timetable. Select -certain children and ask them tofill in what they ate and when. NA ME M It important that children who come from the same incomegroup are chosen. (Note that John's food may even cost more thanSarah's but his diet is not as nutritious.)Make another timetable for children's younger brothers andsistets. (Five or six entries may be needed, rather than just threeor four.)Children discuss in pairs, groups or as a class: 1 76177 o Did we eat enough at the right time?Ei Do our younger brothers and sisters eat often enough?This is followed up with 'why' and 'what' questions:o Why do children not have breakfast?o Why do we eat very late?o Why do we eat only twice or three times a day?o What can be done so that children eat more food, moreoften?3. A visit to the market ... food value for money Children visit the local market to find out the cost of food for all thefamily's meals during one day, and discuss how he- lthy andappetizing meals can be provided within the family's budget.4. Learning from a story ... the importance of vitamin ATell stories to help children understand that eating orange andyellow fruits and vegetables and dark green leafy vegetables isimportant for good eyesight and protection against disease.Stories featuring animals that talk and act as humans arepopular in many societies and often a particular characteristic (e.g.wisdom, foolishness) is associated with each animal. Such storiescan readily be used to pass on health messages, as the followingexample shows.How Hyena tricked HareHyena is miserable. He can no longer see in the dark. He feels weak.7'he other animals laugh at him, none louder than Hare. Fat andhealthy from eating carrots and greens, Hare teases Hyena without178177 mercy, keeping just out of reach. 'Old chicken-eyes,' Hare calls him.In despair, Hyena consults Dr Guinea Fbwl who tells him to eatfruit and vegetables. Gradually Hyenak sight and strength comeback but he does not tell Hare. Every night Hare continues to teaseHyena. Every night Hyena seems blinder; he even begins to weardark glasses and use a white stick. Every night Hare gets closer,until one night he gets too close. Hyena pounces. He has his revenge! (For ideas about developing stories with children, and follow-upactivities, see the section on Immunization.)5. An experiment and observation ...how do we care forour soil?Discuss with the children:o Is all soil suitable for growing food?o Why is it important to look after the soil on the top? Howcan we increase it and make it rich?o How can the soil be lost?o When it is lost, can it be replaced?o If it is lost, how could that affect our health?In the rainy season, children take some containers and collectsamples of run-off water. Is it clear or muddy? Muddy water means 178179 that soil is being washed downstream and lost for farming. Whyare the plant roots not holding the water in the soil?Children look at farming on hills. Are the rows of plants arrangedaround the hill (contour planting)? Are there terraces to reduce theamount of soil being washed away?As a result of the observation, discuss how soil could be preservedbetter.CHILDREN'S ACTIONI Canfit Help mother give plenty of small meals to younger brothers andsisters.if* Eat more fruit and green leafy vegetables, if they are available.eg= Collect edible wild fruit, nuts and leaves (make sure you knowwhich ones are safe and good to eat).We Cane4 Help to grow fruit and vegetables in a school garden, or agree tohave a home plot, and report back to school about what we aregrowing and doing with the produce. AI*V o Before starting, discuss practical points. Is it possible tohave a vegetable garden at school? Is there enough land,and water? Is fencing needed to keep animals out? Can acrop be grown within one term? Is there a danger of theft?oFbr some schools it may be better to plant fruit trees inthe compound, e.g. pawpaw, mango, orange, banana,160 179 avocado, or whatever grows well. The trees need to be .protected from goats and cattle when young. Each classcould plant and 'adopt' one tree, watering it with hand-washing water. Later, the trees will provide shade as well asfruit.o If a vegetable garden is likely to be successful, growspinach, carrots and other plants rich in vitamin A. Seedscan be planted at home. A small prize, e.g. for the largestcarrot, will provide encouragement.* Make and display posters about foods with vitaniin A protectingus from disease.Make compost at home and at school to enrich the soil.Plant trees and tend them, to prevent soil erosion on slopes.Persuade the school food-sellers to stock healthy snacks anddrinks, and follow the rules of hygiene.BASKET OF IDEAS* Children discuss what foods are eaten at festivals, and why.Children survey school food-sellers which ones sell healthyand clean food?* Children put on puppet plays to show the importance ofvitamin A. Plays can feature animals or people whocannot see well in the dark and show how eatingorange or yellow fruits and vegetables, and darkgreen leafy vegetables, can help them see better.(Remember that vitamin A also improves generalhealth and resistance to disease.)15 Children make and sell healthy snacks tofriends.* Children keep animals for food fish, rabbits,ducks, chickens and pigs, etc. all provide good food.gih Children ask older people about edible wildplants. They make a display of these plants inclass.O Children hold a cookery demonstration, e.g.new ways to prepare staple foods.The teacher asks the local agricultural officeror farmer to advise and help children to make acompost pit, and tell them about mulching. 180 EVALUATION QUESTIONSChildrenAre we trying to eat more of the right kind of food, e.g. morevegetables?Are younger brothers and sisters eating often enough?Are we eating often enough (e.g. do we eat before we startschool)?Do we know ways to conserve soil (especially from erosion)?Have we watered and protected the vegetables and trees weplanted?Are they growing?TeachersDo children know which foods promote growth, energy andhealth?Do they know that orange and yellow fruits and vegetables anddark green leafy vegetables help to provide vitamin A, and whythis is important for health?Do they understand the idea of 'food value for money in themarket'?Is school routine organized so that children have time to eatsnacks before starting, and during, the school day?Are the fruit trees and/or vegetables planted in the schoolcompound well cared for? Will they provide food?Are children enthusiastic about planting and watering them? Dothey work together?Agricultural WorkersAre there any changes in the variety of vegetables and fruitpeople are growing round their homes? Have the childrensuggested ideas to their parents? 1S2 181 Some Useful ResourcesBooks in EnglishBonati, G and H (eds) (1992).
