A supportive mind/body approach We help you heal from your harsh inner critical voice so that you can begin to feel emotionally and physically lighter, healthier, self-assured, resilient, and more at peace in your life. Is the as-soon-as mindset keeping you stuck? \"as soon as work slows down\" or \"as soon as I make enough\"...then, I can take care of myself. Are you a high achiever who tends to be perfectionistic? Do you feel like you are never doing enough or accomplishing enough? Do you emotionally eat when stressed and then feel overcome with guilt and self-loathing? Are you a mom who is exhausted from the constant pressure of feeling like you have to do it all and be it all for everyone? Has a divorce or break-up led you to overly fixate on past mistakes? Do you have that depleting sense of never feeling good enough? Are you anxious about being anxious? Do you feel like something is wrong with you, which then makes you more anxious? Have you been turning to Netflix, alcohol or junk food for comfort, even though it leaves you feeling guilty and dissatisfied? Do you find yourself constantly comparing yourself to others, leaving you feeling bad about yourself? Does rumination or overthinking keep you from sleeping at night? Does it feel like you are barely keeping your head above water? Is stress breaking you down emotionally and physically? Do you want to feel more self-assured and stop second-guessing yourself? Are you burning the candle at both ends, so much so that you never relax or enjoy life? Do you feel like you haven't been taking care of yourself? Are you ready to feel stronger and healthier in your body and in your mind? Is your default thinking: \"worst-case scenario\"? Does your high-pressure job give you the income and title you want, yet you still feel like an imposter? Do you want to feel lighter and more at peace with yourself, in your relationships and in your world? Are you looking for therapy that offers tools aimed at helping you make real change in your life? Are you second-guesing what you should be doing in school, career and/or in life? Has it been difficult for you to try new things out of fear of failure? You don't have to feel this way. You can feel better. There is a new -old- way to feel better, and it seems reimagined...but actually, it's just coming back to the wisdom of the mind-body connection. Because Mental Health Isn't Just About Your Mind... Imagine getting the support and tools you need to let go of old patterns and current struggles so that you can be the best version of yourself. Imagine feeling lighter, less overwhelmed, more confident, and finally being able to enjoy your life. We welcome you to explore SoundMind/SoundBody Therapy: An outcome driven holistic approach that integrates both the mind and the body in your treatment. On average, our clients reach their goals and start to feel better within 8-12 weeks. We are outome-driven. Getting Back to The Basics Beyond using therapy and coaching to help you process emotional pains and learn coping skills and tools, we invite you to bring it back to the BASICS. These modern times are beckoning, if not requiring, us to: Move our bodies more often. Cut down on the junk and eat whole foods. Spend time in nature. Find moments to pause and breathe. Nutritional Psychology: An emerging field outlining how nutrients can affect mood and behavior. Nutrition for mental health explores gut health, nutritional deficiencies, as well as food and supplements that nourish the body and mind. Equally important is to look one's relationship with food. It isn't just about knowing what to eat; it's also very much about supporting the challenging, yet worthwhile, pursuit of behavior change. Exercise for Emotional Wellness: Exercising alleviates stress and anxiety, decreases risk of depression, improves self-esteem and elevates mood. Exploring one's motivation for exercise is essential for any fitness program to lead to lasting emotional wellness. Remember it's actually the tortoise, not the hare that wins the race! Forest Therapy: The medicine of simply being in the forest. Taking a \"forest bath\" is grounding and soothing to the mind, body and soul. It has been proven that simply just being in nature decreases stress, elevates mood and strengthens the immune system. Walk & Talk Therapy: The act of walking used in combination with talk therapy helps you to open up, knock down barriers, reconnect to the body, release what is no longer serving you, restore balance and regain perspective. Walk & Talk Therapy has been shown to reduce depression, relieve anxiety, lower stress, and boost self-esteem. Mindfulness & Meditation: Mindfulness is the art of bringing your awareness to the present moment; it is an effective tool for changing your stress level in the here-and-now. Meditation takes it a step further to give your body deep, healing rest, thereby helping you alleviate your current stress and release stress from the past. Yoga & Embodiment: Connecting to your body through postures and gentle movement allows for mind-body centering--it grounds you at the cellular level. Integrating yoga and embodiment into therapy allows your overthinking brain to go offline so that you can lead with the wisdom of your body. This is essential in healing core pains because it allows you to soften your nervous system--teaching your mind, body, spirit and soul to feel safe with yourself, as yourself. About Us We are a group of compassionate therapists and coaches who have been in your shoes. We get it - professionally and personally - because we have all experienced our own emotional and physical health struggles. It is from our collective experiences, education, background, skills and passion that we can support you in feeling better, the whole you--Mind & Body. We like to call what we offer \"a gentle upgrade to your operating system\". No matter the therapist/coach you choose to work with, they will be there, in your corner supporting you as you navigate making subtle and profound changes that leave you feeling lighter, less stressed, more self-assured and happier in your life. We work in partnership with you. During treatment, we check in with you to see what's working and what isn't. We make necessary shifts in order to make sure you are reaching your goals. We don't hesitate to offer referrals when needed. Our Approach Change is hard. It really is. But it's not impossible. Change happens overtime in the little things you do consistently. It starts by becoming aware of old patterns that aren't serving you; it starts by noticing the struggles that you haven't addressed or are avoiding. It is only once you become aware, that you can begin to gently shift how you think, act, behave and relate. By blending movement, nutritional guidance, mindfulness and breathwork into therapy sessions, we offer an upgrade to traditional therapy. Our integrated approach will help to you change the way you live and change the way you feel, for the better. We are in your corner supporting you, as you discover what helps you live a healthier, happier life. We are in your corner. We offer support both in, and in-between, sessions. Our availability to our clients outside of session far surpasses other therapy practices. We Can Help You Feel Better Therapy shouldn't stress you out.
