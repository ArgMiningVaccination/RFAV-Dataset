The purported abilityof black cohosh to help alleviate climacteric symptoms, premen-strual syndrome, and osteoporosis has secured its ranking amongthe 10 top-selling supplements in the United glycosides ( l \"Fig. responsible for black cohosh s pharmacological activity even though they are not phytoestrogens [4,5]. As such, most commercial black cohoshproducts are chemically standardized to triterpene glycosides,with 23- epi-26-deoxyactein (also known as 27-deoxyactein) being the most abundant congener [6].At present, black cohosh does not appear to be a potent modula-tor of human drug metabolism. In vitro studies found individual triterpene glycosides to be relatively weak inhibitors (IC 50 > 100 \u00b5M) of human CYP3A4 [7,8], while whole extracts elicitedgreater inhibition, a finding suggestive of synergy [7]. The inhib-itory effects of whole black cohosh extracts may stem not fromtriterpene glycosides but rather fukinolic and cimicifugic acids.These compounds CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, and 3A4 in vitro [8]; however, their quantities vary con- siderably among commercially available black cohosh products[9], a factor that can profoundly affect their inhibitory activity in vivo. In human liver microsomes, IC 50values for CYP2B6, 2C19, and 2E1 were approximately 50, 30, 10 respectively,for methanolic extracts of black cohosh [10]. standard regimens of clarithromycin (500 mg dailyfor 7 days) or rifampin (600 mg daily for 7 days), black cohoshsupplementation (40 -80 mg extract daily delivering 3 -6m gt r i - terpene glycosides for pharmacokinetics [11,12]. not modulator of or ABCB1 activity in vivo . Black cohosh supplementation also had clinically phenotypic human CYP1A2, 2E1, or triterpene glycoside, 23-epi-26- deoxyactein, reaches the systemic circulation intact, albeit in verylow concentrations (< 10 ng/mL) [6]. This apparent lack of bio-transformation bolsters the idea that black cohosh triterpeneglycosides are unlikely to be inhibitors of human XMEs in vivo . Black cohosh extracts incorporating DMSO inhibited (~ 47%) uptake of estrone-3-sulfate, a SLCO2B1 substrate, into human embryonic kidney cells stably expressingthe transporter [14]. Whether this effect translates to the in vivo condition remains to be determined.As with most commercially available botanical supplements,black cohosh products exhibit considerable variability in phyto-chemical profiles, and label claims for \"standardized \"marker compounds can deviate considerably from actual content [9].Such variations can have considerable influence on how resultsof clinical studies evaluating black cohosh efficacy or its herb-drug interaction potential are interpreted. Nevertheless, basedon the currently available data, standardized black cohosh sup-plements, when taken at recommended doses, pose little risk forherb-drug interactions.Interaction risk: Moench ,E .a n g u s - tifolia DC., E. pallida [Nutt.] Nutt.) of the family Asteraceae are North American perennials whose roots and aerial parts havebeen used traditionally for a variety of medicinal purposes [15,16].Echinacea formulations containing either root or whole plant extracts are marketed for their \"immune stimulatory \"properties and for prevention of the common cold [15,16]. Echinacea 'sp o p - ularity as an immune stimulator has placed it among the 10 top-selling botanicals in the U.S. for many years. While evidence fromin vitro and animal studies lend credence to Echinacea prepara- tions as immunomodulators, clinical findings remain equivocal.(For reviews of clinical efficacy see references [15 -19].) The three species most commonly encountered are chemically dissimilar.Both E. purpurea and E. angustifolia contain alkamides as their major lipophilic constituents, although of differing structuraltypes ( l \"Fig. 2 ). By contrast, the lipophilic fraction of E. pallida is characterized by polyacetylenes and is practically devoid of alka-mides. These phytochemical dissimilarities also extend to theirrespective plant parts (i.e., roots vs. aerial parts). As PSMs, poly-acetylenes and alkamides are natural pesticides that, when in-gested in relatively high amounts, can be toxic. In low concentra- Fig. 1 Representative phytochemicals (triterpene glycosides, 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Other like acid esters (e.g., cichoric alkenes are also thought to contributeto echinacea s activity. Because commercially available Echinacea supplements often consist of extracts from various species andplant parts, considerable variation in phytochemical profile andcontent is common acid conjugates, crossthe intestinal mucosa reaching the systemic circulation intact. Fol-lowing single doses of Echinacea alkamides (~ 11 mg) adminis- tered as tablets manufactured from ethanolic liquid extracts, plas-ma concentrations varied considerably with maximum plasmalevels not exceeding 350 ng/mL [26]. Individual Echinacea alka- mides are metabolized to varying degrees by several human CYPs,but when combined (as in an extract), metabolism is markedly re-duced [27 -29]. This appears to arise from (2 E)-N-isobutylundeca- 2-ene-8,10-diynamide ( l \"Fig. 2 ), which contains a terminal al- kyne and may act as a mechanism-based inhibitor [27]. Aconsiderable number of in vitro studies the XME and ABCB1 modulatory effects of echinacea extracts and individ-ual PSMs [30 -44]. A recent review of the bulk of these studies concluded that alkamides exhibit at least mild to moderate inhib-iton of CYP3A4 in most of the model systems tested, with themagnitude dependent upon alkamide content [29]. This conclu-sion is strengthened by a recent animal study, in which standard-ized E. purpurea extracts reduced rat CYP3A mRNA levels by [45]. of CYP1A effects on ABCB1- [43,44] and SLCO2B1- mediated [14] transport have also been demonstrated.Very few prospective clinical studies examining the interactionpotential of Echinacea supplements have been conducted in hu- mans. Using the CYP3A probe midazolam, Gorski et days of E. purpurea supplementation selectively modulated CYP3A activity in the intestine (inhibition) and liver (induction)of healthy volunteers [46]. The authors concluded that due toEchinacea 's seemingly opposing effects on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4, any interaction would depend upon the substrate sh e - patic and intestinal extraction ratio. Mild inhibitory effects wereobserved for CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, while CYP2D6 was unaffected.In this instance, however, Echinacea 's effect pales in comparison to those reported by these same investigators for known CYP3A4 in-hibitors (e.g., clarithromycin) and inducers (rifampin) It would appear that Echinacea 'se f f e c t on CYP3A expression is modest at best, as neither standardizedextracts nor purified alkamides upregulated CYP3A4 mRNA levelswhen exposed cells [41]. In contrast, ri-fampin exposure increased CYP3A4 mRNA expression by 3.8-fold.Using various phenotypic probe drug ratios to assess CYP1A2,CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 activity, Gurley et al. found thathealthy adults supplemented with E. purpurea for either 14 (800 mg extract daily) [49] or 30 days (1500 mg extract daily)[50] produced no clinically significant changes in CYP pheno-types. More recently, Penzak et al. reported that 28 days of E. pur- purea supplementation in healthy volunteers (500 mg three times daily) produced modest reductions in midazolam AUC Fig. 2 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

(27% decrease), but had no significant effects on the pharmacoki- netics of This study,like that of Gorski et al., suggests that E. purpurea may have mild inductive effects on human CYP3A4 in vivo . However, when com- pared to rifampin s effects on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates [12,48], any clinically important drug interactionswith Echinacea seem remote. To date, only two clinical studies have evaluated Echinacea 'si m - pact on drug transporters. Fourteen days of supplementationwith a standardized, well-characterized E. purpurea product (800 mg extract daily) had no effect on digoxin (an ABCB1 sub-strate) pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers [52]. By contrast,7 days of rifampin (600 mg daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg daily)produced marked reductions and increases, respectively, in di-goxin AUC, a finding that underscores Echinacea 's clinically insig- nificant effect on these transporters. In addition, the pharmacoki-netics of fexofenadine, a nonspecific ABCB1 and SLCO substrate,were not impacted by 28 days of E. purpurea supplementation [51]. Taken together, these data render it unlikely that E. purpurea will produce clinically relevant interactions with coadministereddrugs through ABC or SCLO modulation.Based on the collected evidence to date, it appears that dietarysupplements formulated with standardized Echinacea extracts - when ingested per label recommendations -are not likely to yield alkamide concentrations sufficient enough to dramaticallymodulate human CYP, ABC, and SLCO isoforms in vivo . Therefore, Echinacea supplements pose minimal risks for interacting with most conventional medications, an opinion concordant with thatof other recent reviews [29,53].Interaction risk: low. Garlic ! Members of the family Alliaceae have been an important part ofthe human diet for thousands of years. Allium species, such as garlic ( Allium sativum L.) and onions ( Allium cepa L.), are a rich source of sulfur-containing compounds, many of which are vola-tile and give rise to the characteristic flavor and aroma of thesespecies. Fresh garlic has little smell but tissue damage by cutting,crushing, or biting results in alliin (2-propenyl- L-cysteine sulfox- formation of allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate), which gives crushed garlic its characteristic smell. Because allicin is very un-stable to heat, cooking results in its degradation to a number oforganosulfur compounds including diallylsulfides and ajoenes[54] (l \"Fig. 3 ). Bad breath, which follows the ingestion of garlic products, is due to a range of sulfide compounds that appear inthe systemic circulation and expired air.Garlic is reputed to have benefits for protection against cardio-vascular diseases, cancer, microbial infections, and vampires!Although there is some evidence for the first two effects, the restare largely the result of speculation and folklore [54]. The putativeanti-hypercholesterolemic effect of garlic supplements makesthem one of the most widely used botanical supplements in theUnited States. Their efficacy, however, remains in doubt due toconflicting results from numerous published clinical trials [55 - 58]. This is probably a function of the type of product used, itsquality, and poor characterization of the phytochemical agent(s)responsible for garlic s lipid lowering effect. Three general categories of garlic supplements are available com-mercially (garlic oil, dehydrated garlic powder, and aged garlicextract) each with their own unique composition of purportedbioactive components [59 -61]. Within these products a plethora of organosulfur compounds, steroid saponins, and other phyto-chemicals have been identified [54,59 -62]. Of ( l \"Fig. 3 ). Allicin has long been touted as the agent responsible for garlic s lipid lower- ing effects, yet the compound is unstable in the gastrointestinaltract, is not bioavailable, and is rarely found in commercial serum cholesterol levels; however, many prod-ucts, particularly those containing garlic oil, have relatively poorefficacy [63,64]. In addition, many in vivo studies indicate that garlic oil and individual alkyl sulfides, most notably diallyl CYP2E1 [65 - This is likely a result of enzyme[66,69]. Despite inhibition of human CYP2E1 in vitro , few inter- actions involving garlic products and CYP2E1 substrates havebeen reported, a consequence that probably reflects the paucity Fig. 3 Representative phytochemicals (sulfur- containing compounds) present in garlic.1493 Gurley BJ 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Conversely, prolonged ad- ministration of diallyl GSTs,UGTs) [65,70 -76] through activation of CAR and Nrf2 nuclear re- ceptors [77].The ability of garlic to inhibit other human CYP isoforms alsoappears dependent upon product type and composition. In vitro assessments of allicin, fresh garlic, or commercially preparedsupplements (e.g., garlic oil and garlic powder) either found noeffect [32,78] or modest inhibition (< 50%) isoforms freeze-dried CYP3A4in vitro (> 95%) [80]. Because the chemistry of garlic is complex and because different types of processing can significantly alterits phytochemical composition, lyophilization may stabilize thoseorganosulfur compounds capable of inhibiting CYP3A4. Agedgarlic extracts (AGE), on the other hand, do not appear to inhibitany of the major CYP isoforms present in human liver micro-somes [81]. This may stem from a dearth of oil-soluble organo-sulfur compounds in AGE and a preponderance of L-cysteine, saponins) [59]. The shift oil- to water-soluble ingredients arises from the aging pro-cess and subsequent aqueous extraction, which makes AGE dis-tinct from the other types of garlic products.Based upon in vitro and murine in vivo findings, garlic s effects on transporter activity also appear dependent upon the hydrophilic-ity of specific organosulfur compounds. The preponderance of in vitro data regarding ABC isoforms implies that garlic s oil-soluble organosulfur compounds are not potent inhibitors of the effluxtransporter ABCB1 [80,82 -85] but may, however, When ex-posed to both Caco-2 cell monolayers and the rat intestine at highconcentrations (~ 12 \u00b5g/mL), water-soluble compounds in AGE (e.g.,S-allyl- L-cysteine) the activity ABCB1, ABCC2, and SLCO transporters [86,87]. In a HepG2 cell however, ABCC2activity was reduced, suggesting that AGE-mediated regulationof ABCC2 proteins in the liver is different from that in the intes-tine [88]. Tissue-specific regulation of ABCC2 activity has alsobeen observed for other xenobiotics [89], and this may only addto the difficulties of predicting garlic-drug interactions.A modest number of prospective human studies have investigatedthe drug interaction potential of garlic supplements or purifiedgarlic organosulfur compounds [90 -102]. Owing to the variety of products evaluated and diverse dosages of garlic phytochemi-cals administered, results have been mixed. A number of drugs,whose biotransformation pathways run the gamut substrates ofCYP2E1 are significantly affected [90,92,98]. The first prospec-tive study by Gwilt et al. found that daily administration of agedgarlic extract (~ 19 mg S-allyl- L-cysteine) produced no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen, a putativeCYP2E1 substrate to volun-teers reduced plasma 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazoneratios (a phenotypic measure of CYP2E1 activity) by an averageof 31% [92]. This finding confirmed in humans what had beenpreviously observed in murine models that lipophilic, and not hydrophilic, organosulfur compounds were CYP2E1 inhibitors.Subsequent studies confirmed that prolonged garlic oil supple-mentation (500 mg, three times daily for 28 days) inhibited hu-man CYP2E1 activity in both young [90] and elderly adults almost 40% and 25%, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4. In contrast, 21days of twice daily supplementation with garlic powder (~ 9 mgallicin and 23 mg alliin) reduced by 50% the mean AUC, 8-hourtrough concentrations, and mean maximum plasma concentra-tions (C max) of the protease inhibitor saquinavir [93]. The authors concluded that the garlic powder supplement might have in-duced intestinal CYP3A4 and/or P gp, since saquinavir is a sub- strate for both proteins. A similar, although less dramatic, effecton ritonavir AUC, was observed after a four-day course of garlicextract (5 mg, twice daily) [94]. Subsequent studies examiningthe prolonged effects of garlic supplementation on other CYP3A4substrates, however, failed to note any significant changes [95 - 97]. Nor have any clinically important garlic-mediated interac-tions been reported for warfarin, a recognized substrate forCYP2C9 and 3A4 [100,101]. However, large doses of the organo-sulfur compound allicin (~ 150 mg daily) did reduce the metabo-lism of omeprazole by inhibiting CYP2C19 activity in individualsboth homozygous and heterozygous for the but CYP2C19*2 CYP3A4-mediated in saquinavir and concentrations noted inearly studies appear attributable to garlic-mediated upregulationof intestinal ABCB1 or ABCC2 activity as was demonstrated inseveral recent in vitro investigations [84 -89]. The extent to which garlic supplementation affects human ABC and SLCO substratesin vivo was recently addressed in healthy volunteers receiving a standardized garlic extract for 21 days [103]. A 31% increase inthe duodenal expression of human ABCB1 correlated with amodest reduction in saquinavir AUC while no effectswere noted in the pharmacokinetic of simvastatin (aCYP3A4 substrate) or pravastatin (an SLCO1B1 substrate).Taken together the accumulated findings imply that most com-mercially available garlic supplements pose only a limited riskfor producing clinically important herb-drug interactions. Pres-ently, only human CYP2E1 appears to be inhibited by garlic oilproducts, but because only a few drugs are substrates of CYP2E1and most of those have fairly broad therapeutic indicies, this in-teraction is not cause for great concern. On the other hand, pro-longed consumption of garlic extract appears to modestly inducethe human efflux transporter ABCB1. Accordingly, prolonged ex-posure to concentrated garlic extracts may reduce the efficacy ofdrugs whose disposition is strongly dependent on ABCB1.Interaction risk: low. Ginkgo biloba ! Termed living fossils, ginkgo trees (family Ginkgoaceae) have ex-isted since the early Jurassic period 150 million years ago. Thelone species that avoided extinction ( Ginkgo biloba L.) is now cul- tivated in Asia, Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Argen-tina. Ginkgo is a popular ornamental tree recognizable by its un-usual fan-shaped leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. InAsia, the tree has long been held sacred for its therapeutic value.Today, dosage forms incorporating G. biloba leaf extracts are used throughout the world for treatment of insufficient blood flow,1494 Gurley BJ et al. 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. memory deficits, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer s disease, de- pression, vertigo, tinnitus, and intermittent claudication [104].Ginkgo s popularity has made it one of the most intensely studied botanicals in the world. Currently more than 2500 ar-ticles related to G. biloba have been published in the medical lit- erature.Clinical trials on the efficacy of G. biloba extracts are numerous and controversial [105 -109]. Much of the research has centered on products formulated with EGb 761, an extract produced bythe German company Schwabe. EGb 761 is a and 2.9% bilobalide), 5 -10% organic acids, and other constituents [104]. Several other companies pro-duce ginkgo extracts with similar chemical profiles. Terpene lac-tones are unique to G. biloba and include the ginkgolides, a group of diterpene trilactones (e.g., ginkgolide A, B, C, J, M), and sesquiterpene lactone ( l \"Fig. 4 glycoside derivatives, with quercetin, kaempferol,and isorhamnetin being the most prevalent. Other PSMs presentinG. biloba that may have allergenic, immunotoxic, and other un- desirable properties (e.g., ginkgetin, amentoflavone, ginkgolicacids, ginkgotoxin, and others) are typically removed duringprocessing [104].Discrepancies among clinical studies regarding efficacy may betraced to significant interproduct variability in phytochemicalcontent and biopharmaceutical characteristics of ginkgo extractdosage forms (e.g., disintegration, dissolution, bioavailability)[110,111]. These same discrepancies may also underly the confu-sion surrounding the herb-drug interaction potential of G. biloba . Depending upon which experimental model is utilized, differentinterpretations of ginkgo s drug interaction capabilities emerge. In many in vitro experimental systems, ginkgo extracts [14,33, 35,38,112 to inhibit various XMEs and transporters, although inmost instances IC 50values were well in excess of 20 \u00b5M. Agly- cones of quercetin, kaempferol, while ginkgo- lides and bilobalide exhibit least and in many cases, none atall [79,116 -119,123,124,127]. In contrast, ginkgo extracts andindividual terpene lactones of inducing the ex- pression of several CYP, UGT, and ABC isoforms in rat other cell lines[132,134] revealed that ginkolides A and B are activators of PXR,whereas quercetin and kaempferol activated PXR, CAR, and AhR.Bilobalide exerted no effects on nuclear receptors in these assays.The discovery that specific ginkgolides and flavonoids are ligandsfor several xenobiotic receptors provides an explanation for ahost of recent in vivo studies in which prolonged administration ofG. biloba extracts to rats, often in high doses, not only induced a multitude of XMEs [135 -140] but reduced the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen via CYP3A induction [147].However, several of these vivo studies contradicted cell-based reporter assay findings when bilobalide was implicated as anXME activator [148 -150]. Evidence from in vitro and animal investigations clearly points to G. biloba extracts and their constituents as inducers of XME and transporter activity. These findings have led investigators to warnof significant drug interactions with G. biloba . Clinical evidence substantiating these claims, however, is not as compelling. Todate, 29 prospective clinical trials assessing the effect of G. biloba supplementation on the pharmacokinetics of a variety of drugs,including several specific CYP probes, have been published[90,98,139,151 -176]. Twenty-nine different drugs whose me- tabolism or 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

The majority of these studies followed a G. biloba supplementation regimen of 240 mg leaf extract twice daily from as few as 3 to as many as 90 days,while others utilized smaller doses. In addition, most utilizedproducts containing the standardized EGb 761 extract. Of the 29studies (many of which evaluated more than one drug), 23 ob-served no significant effects of G. biloba on drug disposition, 5 ob- served a modest inhibitory on drug interaction criteria [177,178], those few stud-ies demonstrating a modulatory effect of G. biloba on drug dispo- sition do not appear to be clinically important.Discrepancies in G. biloba seffect on rat and human XMEs in vivo do not appear to reflect species differences in PXR activation[129,179], but rather seem to be dose related [136,139]. Mostrat studies administered G. biloba extracts at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose comparable to 1300 mg/day or greater in humans; however,most human studies incorporated doses of 240 mg/day or less.Additionally, several studies have assessed the pharmacokineticsof ginkgolides and bilobalide in human volunteers. Following240 mg doses of standardized G. biloba extracts, C maxvalues for ginkgolides and bilobalide rarely exceeded 40 ng/mL [180 -182], concentrations well below the 4000 ng/mL at which ginkgolidesA and B activated PXR in vitro [133]. It is possible that concentra- tions exceeding 40 ng/mL may be achieved within intestinal en-terocytes, but this depends upon disintegration and dissolutionprofiles of individual dosage forms (characteristics that can varyconsiderably between brands [183,184]), as well as the perme- ability individual absorptive permeability and high efflux[185]; two conditions that would further preclude their exposureto enteric XMEs.In summary, dosage forms containing standardized G. biloba ex- tracts, when administered at doses of 240 mg/day or less, do notpose a risk for clinically relevant herb-drug interactions. However,daily doses exceeding 240 mg/day may increase prospects for in-teractions.Interaction risk: low, at doses 240 mg/day or lower. Ginseng spp. ! Of the five major Panax species (family Araliaceae) worldwide, Asian ginseng ( Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) are the most widely used and extensively studied. P. ginseng root has an almost 2000-year history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as an adaptogen (a plant thatincreases resistance to stress and fatigue) and a restorative tonic.Today, ginseng root, either as a TCM or dietary supplement, is oneof the most popular herbs in the world; used to improve libidoand sexual performance, prevent cancer, regulate blood sugar,lower blood pressure, improve cognition, fight fatigue, and boostimmunity [186]. With the possible exception of its mild hypogly-cemic effect, ginseng s efficacy remains questionable, as many clinical trials have produced confounding results [187 -189]. Am- biguity in clinical findings may be linked to differences in the gin-sosenoside content of products evaluated.Ginsenosides, a group of triterpene glycosides (steroidal sapo-nins), are unique to Panax species. More than 40 ginsenosides have been identified in the roots of P. ginseng andP. quinquefolius . Ginsenoside nomenclature employs the designation Rx, where xrepresents the retention factor (Rf) value from the sequence ofspots (from bottom to top) on thin-layer chromatography plates.Ginsenosides exhibit considerable structural variation. They dif-fer from one another by the type, number, and site of attachmentof sugar moieties. The -are classifed number of sugar (glucose, rhamnose, xy-lose, and arabinose) residues on the steroidal skeleton Rc, and are ginseno-sides, Rf, Rg1, and Rg2 are examples of protopana-xatriols ( l 5 ).P. ginseng and P. quinquefolius differ signifi- cantly in type and proportion of ginsenosides, with P. ginseng having a high Rg1:Rb1 ratio and P. quinquefolius a low Rg1:Rb1 ratio [191]. Such distinctions may account for differences in pur-ported efficacy between the two species. Ginseng root extractsare often standardized to contain a particular percentage (~ ratio of ginsenosides. When ingested, ginsenosides undergopartial hydrolytic deglycosylation in the stomach are furtherdeglycosylated in the large intestine through enzymatic glucosi-dase activity of gut microflora [190,192 -194]. It is metab- olites (e.g., compound K, l \"Fig. 5 ) that ultimately reach the sys- temic circulation and are alleged to have pharmacologic activity[192,194 -196]. From a drug interaction perspective, clinical and nonclinical evi-dence regarding ginseng extracts and their effects on XMEs andtransporters is particularly confusing. This confusion stems froman assortment of variables affecting ginsenoside disposition.

These include, but are not limited to, variability in ginsenoside type and content [190,191], efflux by ABC transporters to inhibit most CYPs and transporters in vitro are not only high (> 50 \u00b5M), but are not likely to be realized in vivo , especially if normal dosing recommendations of ginseng products are fol-lowed [37,120,127,200 -207]. This also holds true for the even higher ginsenoside concentrations (> 100 \u00b5M) required for in However, products of ginse-noside hydrolysis (e.g., deglycosylated metabolites) have beenshown to competitively inhibit a variety of CYPs and transporters,oftentimes at concentrations well below 20 \u00b5M [203 -208]. Only a limited number of animal studies have examined the ef-fects of orally administered ginseng extracts (> 30 mg/kg) on drugdisposition. From these, it appears that P. ginseng orP. quinquefo- liuseither mildly induce [209 -211] or have no significant effects [212 -214] on rat XMEs and ABCB1 activity in vivo . Substantially more prospective human trials have investigated the effects of P. ginseng and P. quinquefolius supplementation on human drug disposition, with the CYP2C9 substrate, warfarin, being exam-ined the most. Like the murine studies, clinical results fall intotwo catgories: no effect [90,98,215 or mild Concerns regarding possible ginseng-drug interactions first sur-faced when two case reports speculated that ginseng reducedwarfarin anticoagulation [223,224]. As single case reports cannotestablish causation, a prospective clinical trial by Yuan et al. dem-onstrated that international normalized ratios (INR, a measure ofanticoagulation), peak plasma warfarin levels, and warfarin AUCswere reduced by P. quinquefolius in healthy volunteers, and these effects reached statistical significance [221]. Subsequent clinicaltrials with P. ginseng , however, have failed to observe influ- ence on warfarin pharmacokinetics [216,222] or pharmacody-namics may reflect the dispar- ity in ginsenoside profiles between P. ginseng andP. quinquefolius ; however, several methodological concerns have been raised aboutthe Yuan et al. study including it being underpowered, that inad-equate sampling was used to determine AUC, and a non-stereo-selective assay was used to measure warfarin enantiomers[222]. Therefore, it appears that whatever effect(s) P. quinquefo- liusextracts might have on human CYP2C9 activity, their magni- tude does not reach clinical significance. As a result, the availableevidence that links ginseng supplementation to potentiallyharmful drug interactions remains unconvincing.Interaction risk: low. Methylenedioxyphenyl-Containing Phytochemicals ! The plant kingdom is replete with species that harbor phyto-chemicals whose structures contain methylenedioxyphenyl(MDP) moieties ( l \"Fig. 6 ). Popular botanical supplements known to contain substantial PSMs (MDP-PSMs) often function as insecticides[225], but when consumed by humans they can act as mecha-nism-based inhibitors of CYPs [226,227]. This type of inhibitionis thought to arise from CYP-dependent oxidation of the methy-lenedioxy carbon to a carbene that subsequently interacts withCYP heme iron to produce a stable heme-adduct, termed a meta-bolic-intermediate (MI) complex [227]. It is through the formationof MI complexes that CYP isoforms are inactivated by MDP-PSMs[227,228]. Because MDP-PSMs can function as mechanism-basedCYP inhibitors, they pose significant risks for herb-drug interac-tions.Prolonged administration of MDP-containing compounds has al-so been shown to induce CYP1A and expression species [227 -229]. Induction of CYPs by MDP-PSMs may be mediated by AhR or through mechanisms that promote pro-tein stabilization [228,229]. Whether CYP inhibition or inductionpredominates in vivo may depend upon the length and bulk of MDP side chains as well as the individual CYP isoform examined[230]. MDPs with long bulky side chains appear to be more po-tent inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, nunculaceae), a perennial herb indigenous to eastern NorthAmerica, are often taken as an antimicrobial to prevent commoncolds and upper respiratory tract infections. Often formulatedwith Echinacea species, goldenseal ranks among the top-selling botanicals in the United States.Goldenseal s medicinal properties are attributed to several isoqui- noline alkaloids, of which berberine and hydrastine ( ) are the most prevalent. berberine and hydrastine are MDP-PSMsthat inhibit that commercial extracts of Hydrastis canadensis were potent in vitro inhibitors of CYP3A4 [30]. Follow-up investigations by these authors found that goldenseal reduced CYP3A-mediatedconversion of testosterone to its 6 -hydroxy metabolite inhibition oftestosterone 6 -hydroxylation by goldenseal extracts and ex- Fig. methylenedioxyphenyl-containing phytochemicals (broken = methylenedioxyphenyl moiety).1497 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

They demonstrated that hydrastine was a more in-hibitor of CYP3A4 (IC 50= 25 \u00b5M) than berberine (IC 50= 400 \u00b5M). It is seldom that prospective clinical studies corroborate in vitro - based predictions of CYP-mediated herb-drug interactions; how-ever, goldenseal appears to be an exception. Using phenotypicmeasures of CYP activity, Gurley et al. first observed that golden-seal supplementation significantly inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4in healthy volunteers [13]. In subsequent investigations with theCYP3A4 probe midazolam, Gurley et al. further demonstratedthat goldenseal 209 mg isoquino-line alklaoids daily) significantly increased midazolam AUC, C max, and elimination half-life, and that the effects were proportionalto those produced by the well-recognized, mechanism-based in-hibitor clarithromycin (1000 mg daily) [232]. s inhibition of human CYP2D6 in vivo was confirmed with other commercially available supplement brands [49]. Interest-ingly, another prospective study evaluating the influence of gold-enseal on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir (aprotease inhibitor substrate) failed to register any sig-nificant effects [233]. This discrepancy may stem from the rela-tively high oral bioavailability of indinavir, which renders it a lesseffective probe for assessing herb-mediated changes in CYP3Aactivity. Thus, goldenseal may have its greatest impact on thoseCYP3A substrates exhibiting high intestinal metabolism and loworal bioavailability.In China, berberine (an OTC remedy for diarrhea of bacterial ori-gin) has also been shown to significantly increase the AUC, C max, and trough concentrations of the immunosuppressive drug cy-closporine [234,235]. Since cyclosporine is both a CYP3A4 andABCB1 substrate, the activity of both of these proteins could con-ceivably be affected by hydrastine and berberine. There is con-vincing in vitro and animal evidence that berberine is a substrate for certain ABC isoforms [236 -240], and thus, it may compete with other ABC substrates for efflux across intestinal and canalic-ular membranes. Recent clinical evidence, however, indicatesthat goldenseal s effect on digoxin (an ABCB1 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index) disposition in humans is not signifi-cant [241]. Therefore, goldenseal s propensity for eliciting herb- drug interactions appears limited to those mediated by CYPs.Dissolution profiles of commercially available goldenseal supple-ments reveal that berberine and hydrastine are rapidly and com-pletely released from extract formulations [242], producing in-testinal luminal concentrations comparable to those required forCYP inhibition in vitro [241]. In humans, both berberine and hy- drastine are readily absorbed and extensively metabolized, withberberine phase I metabolites being preferentially sulfated, while those of hydrastine are primarily glucuronidated [243]. Extensivemetabolism is conducive to the formation of MI complexes andmay explain goldenseal s penchant for CYP inhibition. isoquinoline alkaloids significantly inhibit bothCYP3A4 and CYP2D6 activity (the two most important drug me-tabolizing enzymes in humans), its herb-drug interaction family Piperaceae) has long been a traditional beverage consumed among South Pacificislanders to imbue psychotropic, hypnotic, and anxiolytic effects[244]. Since the 1990s, commercial kava extracts formulated astablets and/or capsules have been marketed as dietary supple-ments for the alleviation of stress, anxiety, or insomnia [244,245]. Reports linking kava use to liver toxicity have led to the re-moval of these products from Australia, Canada, and severalEuropean countries, and prompted the FDA to issue warnings ofpossible hepatotoxic side effects associated with kava supple-mentation [244]. For those case reports documenting possiblekava-related hepatotoxicity, prolonged usage (> 60 days), andco-medication with prescription drugs or other botanical supple-ments were frequent and confounding variables [244]. Modula-tion of human drug metabolism and/or transport has been postu-lated as an underlying mechanism for kava-induced liver toxicity.Accordingly, a significant body of literature exists exploring kava s ability to alter XME and transporter activity. The preponderanceofin vitro data points to kava as an inhibitor of various CYPs and ABCB1 [79,245 -251], whereas other evidence suggests kava to induce CYP and -254]. In cordance to kava phytochemicals acting as nuclear receptor li-gands, most studies that administered high doses of kava extractsto murine species for prolonged periods observed an induction and 3A activity methysticin MDP-containing compounds, al-so appears to induce CYP3A isoforms in vitro through activation of human PXR [253]. In addition, both methysticin and dihydro-methysticin have good dissolution profiles in simulated intestinalfluid at pH values greater than 4, a property favorable for produc-ing gut lumen concentrations in excess of 10 \u00b5M [242]. As a re-sult, one might anticipate that kava supplementation would sig-nificantly modulate human XMEs and transporters in vivo .T o date, only five prospective clinical studies have attempted toevaluate the drug interaction potential of kava and the resultshave been mixed [13,49,232,241,259]. Russman et al. found thatin chronic users of traditional kava-containing beverages (e.g., 7 - 27 g kavalactones per week) significantly reduced CYP1A2 activ-ity, yet this practice had no effect on the phenotypic markers ofCYP2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4 function [259]. that 30 days of kava supplementation in healthy vol-unteers had no effect on the phenotypic markers of CYP1A2,CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 activity; however, CYP2E1 activity was sig-nificantly reduced [13].Discrepancies between these studies with regard to kava se f f e c t on CYP1A2 and 2E1 may be traced to variations in extract compo- Fig. 7 Representative phytochemicals (isoquinoline 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Traditional kava beverages are made from aqueous extrac- tions of P. methysticum root, whereas formulations of many com- mercially available kava supplements are products of nonaqueoussolvent extractions. Kavalactone profiles can vary considerablyamong the two extraction processes [245]. Subsequent studiesconducted by Gurley s group found that, when compared to known CYP inducers and inhibitors, 14 days of supplementationwith well-characterized kava products had no clinically relevanteffects on or ABCB1 activity and dihydromethysti-cin as mechanism-based inhibitors in vivo may stem from the structure of their MDP side chains. In examining a series ofMDP-containing compounds, Nakajima et al. noted that thosewith short, nonbulky side chains were less effective inhibitors ofCYP activity [230]. This, coupled with the fact that kava extractsoften have lower amounts of methysticin and dihydromethysti-cin compared to the isoquinoline alkaloid content of goldenseal,may explain the difference in herb-drug interaction potentials forthese two MDP-containing species. In short, consumption ofcommercially available kava supplements per product label rec-ommendations is not likely to affect the efficacy or toxicity ofconventional medications.Interaction risk: low.Black pepper/piperine nigrum L.; family Piperaceae) has been used since antiquity as both a flavoring agent and med-icine [260]. In fact, for almost two millennia Piper species (e.g., P. nigrum andP. longum ) have been essential components of several Ayurvedic medicine preparations [261]. Black pepper is one ofthe most commonly used spices and may be found on nearlyevery dinner table in the industrialized world. Black pepper isproduced from green unripe berries of the pepper plant; thefruits are dried following a heat treatment that releases brown-ing enzymes from the cell walls [262]. The spiciness of black pep-per is due to the \"Fig. 9 ). These compounds function as insecticides in the pepper plant[263 -265], but in mammalian systems they are inhibitors of var- ious XMEs [266 -277] and transporters [278 -283]. While inhibi- tion is clearly the most prevalent finding, especially upon acuteexposure, several animal studies report upregulation of GSTs[284], certain CYPs [285,286], and ABCs [278,280,281] withlong-term exposure to piperine, a finding in line with other stud-ies examining chronic feeding of MDP-PSMs.Piperine s ability to inhibit drug metabolism was first recognized by Atal et al. more than 30 years ago when its administration torats increased the oral bioavailability of the alkaloids sparteineand vasicine by factors of two and three, respectively [266]. In ad-dition, piperine increased the pharmacodynamic effects of hexo-barbital and zoxazolamine dose-dependent fashion [266]. Fig. phytochemicals (kava lac- in kava kava.

Follow-up studies by Atal s group observed that piperine admin- was a noncompetitive inhibitor well on murine XMEs -273] and also found that it and piperamides were selective inhibitors ofhuman CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and [274,275,277,282]. Piperine on UGTs is more pronounced in intes- tinal epithelial cells than hepatocytes [270]. Moreover, structure - activity relationship studies involving more than 35 separateanalogues revealed that piperine is especially suited for CYP inhi-bition [273]. Modifications to either the MDP moiety side chain significantly reduced its potency [273]. (Millionsof years of plant-animal warfare have clearly optimized piperinepharmacology.) In addition to its inhibitory effects on XMEs andABCB1, piperine may also promote drug absorption by modulat-ing the permeability characteristics of intestinal membranes aswell as through stimulating increases in microvilli length [287].One of the most compelling aspects of piperine is its ability todramatically enhance the oral absorption of concomitantly ad-ministered medications [266,279,283,288 -293]. To date, every prospective human trial investigating black pepper s and/or pi- perine s effect on drug pharmacokinetics has demonstrated a profound improvement in oral bioavailability. Drugs affectedand the observed percent increase in practically every case, piperine s effect can be considered clinically relevant. This is especially so for drugs withnarrow therapeutic indices.Recognizing piperine s utility as a bioavailability enhancer, many dietary supplement manufacturers incorporate P. nigrum orP. longum extracts into botanical formulations as a means of im- proving phytochemical efficacy. This positive herb-herb interac-tion is best exemplified by curcumin, a dietary phytochemical intumeric with promising chemopreventative properties but ex-ceedingly poor due to extensive CYP- andUGT-mediated metabolism [294 -295]. When administered with 5 mg of piperine, a twofold increase in curcumin AUC was ob-served in healthy volunteers [294]. In another study, 20 mg of pi-perine produced an almost 20-fold increase in curcumin AUC[296]. Similar bioavailability enhancing effects on green tea poly-phenols have also been reported [297]. As an added benefit to en-hancing phytochemical bioavailability, piperine also has a broadsafety profile [260].When used in quantities typical for flavoring food, black pepperis not likely to affect the disposition of most medications. Howev-er, excessive use of black pepper or intake of dietary supplementsformulated with P. nigrum orP. longum extracts may produce clinically significant interactions with drugs. This may be of par-ticular concern when CYP3A and/or ABCB1 substrates are mg.Interaction risk: high. Schisandra spp. Preparations of fruits from woody vines in the family Schisandra- ceae are a staple in traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Russianmedicine [298]. Among their many uses, berry extracts of Schi- sandra species [ Schisandra togenic and hepatoprotective properties [298,299]. In the UnitedStates, chinensis andS. sphenanthera are often incor- porated into multicomponent dietary gomisins A -C, schisandrin, schisandrol B, and schisantherin are found in Schisandra species (l \"Fig. 10 ). Like many MDP-PSMs, those present in Schisandra species are modulators of mammalin XMEs and transporters. Rec-ognition of these properties is important as Schisandra products are often taken in conjunction with conventional medications inChina, Japan, Russia, and other Asian countries. In addition, die-tary supplements containing Schisandra extracts are becoming Fig. 10 Representative methylenedioxyphenyl- containing phytochemicals in Schisandra species.1500 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. more popular in many Western cultures. This too may increase the chance of Schisandra -related herb-drug interactions. Ample evidence points to Schisandra MDP-PSMs as both sub- strates and inhibitors of ABC efflux transporters in vitro [300 - 306]. A number of in vitro studies also point to Schisandra MDP- PSMs as both competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors of and human CYP isoforms [307 -312]. In particular, gomisins B, C, and G were shown to be particularly effective inhibitors ofhuman CYP3A4 with IC 50values < 1.5 \u00b5M [308]. In the presence of NADPH, gomisin C s inactivation of CYP3A4 was time- and con- centration-dependent, as well as irreversible, in-dicative of mechanism-based inhibition. Moreover, the inhibitoryeffect of gomisin C that of ketoconazole, aknown potent CYP3A4 inhibitor [308]. In contrast, reporter extracts and its constitu- ents, schisandrin and schisandrol, activated rat and human PXR[310], certain natural gomisin H analogues (e.g., tigloyl-gomisin H, angeloylgomisin H) significantly activated phase II de-toxification gene expression via the Nrf2 nuclear receptor path-way [313].Of the available animal studies investigating Schisandra 'se f f e c t on xenobiotic metabolism, two outcomes emerged (inhibition orinduction), each dependent upon the duration of administration.When single doses of Schisandra extracts ( 250 mg/kg) were ad- ministered to inhi-bition. However, when administration periods exceeded 6 days,rat XME and transporter function were consistently induced[310,311,315,316].Unlike the murine study results, prospective clinical trials assess-ingSchisandra 's effect on CYP3A and/or ABCB1 substrate not biphasic. Whether Schisandra was admin- istered once or for up to 14 days, talinolol(ABCB1 Based on these data,it appears that Schisandra is a potent inhibitor, not an inducer, of human XMEs and transporters. Such species differences maystem from the fact that humans not only received lower mg/kgdoses of Schisandra , but that gomisin C concentrations necessary for PXR activation in humans are twice those required for murinespecies [311]. Accordingly, the clinical data currently availablestrongly suggests that Schisandra extracts pose a significant risk for elevating blood levels of drugs that are CYP3A and/or ABCB1substrates.Interaction risk: high. Milk Thistle ! Silybum Gaertn. Asteraceae), commonly known as milk thistle, is an herbaceous plant native to the Medi-terranean region, although it has been naturalized throughoutthe world [320]. Extracts of milk thistle fruits extracts are touted for their antioxidant and hepato-protectant properties, and their utility as therapy for treatingvarious liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis, hepatotoxicity)has been examined in numerous clinical trials [322 -326]. While many smaller trials have revealed improvements in various clini-cal indicies, several larger studies have yielded equivocal results.However, an unequivocal conclusion gleaned from the clinicalstudies is that milk thistle has an excellent safety profile [322 - 326].Milk thistle is one of the few popular botanicals in which thepharmacokinetic profile of its principal phytochemicals has beenthoroughly examined in humans [327 -331]. Components of standard milk thistle extracts, as a general rule, have very loworal bioavailability and short elimination half-lives. This stemsfrom a combination of the poor water solubility of silymarin phy- Fig. 11 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. tochemicals coupled with extensive presytemic metabolism (both phase I and II) and biliary secretion. As an example, C max values for unconjugated silybin A and B (the two most prevalentflavanolignans in milk thistle products) rarely exceeded 20 ng/mL for single 600 mg doses of milk thistle extract in healthy vol-unteers [330]. Even when milk thistle extract (700 mg) was ad-ministered every 8 hours for 7 days, the maximum steady stateconcentrations of silybin A and B rarely exceeded 1.5 \u00b5g/mL[331]. At doses exceeding 1500 mg daily, there was also evidenceof nonlinear pharmacokinetics [331]. Liver disease, of silybin and isosilybin diastereomers may be 3 -5- higher in patients with cirrhotic or nonalcoholic fatty liverdisease, which may account for milk thistle s purported efficacy in these populations [329,331].Given its popularity as one of the most utilized botanical supple-ments in the world, milk thistle s ability to modulate human XMEs and transporters has received considerable attention. A va-riety of in vitro methodologies have been utilized to assess the ef- fect of milk thistle extracts or SLC1B1 uptake transporter [347] activity. The majority of studies are in general agreement that flavanolig-nan concentrations in excess of 10 \u00b5M are required for inhibitionof most CYP isoforms, and even higher concentrations are inhibition. Of all the CYP isoforms tested,CYP2C9 appears to be the most sensitive with IC 50values ~ 8 \u00b5M for human liver microsomes. At concentrations exceeding 30 \u00b5M,silybin diastereomers have been reported to function as mecha-nism-based inhibitors of CYP2C9 and 3A4 [336]. UGT1A1, how-ever, may the easily thistle withan IC 50value of 1.4 \u00b5M [336]. SLC1B1 also IC \u00b5M for silymarin [347].Because milk thistle flavanolignans exhibit poor oral bioavailabil-ity, several technologies have been employed to enhance thisproperty [348]. One of the more successful has been complexa-tion silymarin components with phytosomes, exhibit improvements in flavanolignanbioavailability three to five times those of conventional milk this-tle extract formulations [348 -352]. In addition, recent clinical studies in prostate cancer patients have shown that doses of Sili-phos \u00aeranging from 2.5 to 20 grams daily for up to 4 weeks pro- duced C maxvalues between 10 and 100 \u00b5M for unconjugated bin diastereomers [353,354]. Conceivably, various XMEs and efflux transport-ers, and episodes of hyperbilirubinemia reported in these studiesmay indeed reflect inhibition of UGT activity [353,354].To date, a considerable number of prospective human studieshave examined milk thistle s drug interaction potential. Supple- mentation regimens utilizing standard milk thistle extracts hadno observable effects on the clinical pharmacokinetics [347]. Taken together, these findingsimply that standard milk thistle products generate flavanolignanconcentrations in vivo that are incapable of affecting most humanXMEs and transporters. However, a few clinical studies challenge this assumption. For example, 14 days of silymarin supplementa-tion (140 mg thrice daily) increased the AUC of talinolol (ABCB1substrate) in healthy volunteers by 36% (a finding suggestive ofABCB1 inhibition); however, this effect is not considered clinical-ly relevant [362]. In contrast, 140 mg of silymarin administeredto healthy adults for 9 days reduced the mean AUC for metronida-zole (CYP3A4/ABCB1 substrate) by 29% [363], and while this ef-fect hints at possible induction, it too is of little clinical concern.More concerning is a recent finding that silymarin inhibits themetabolism of losartan to its active metabolite E-3174, and thatthe magnitude of the interaction is dependent upon CYP2C9 ge- notype [364]. In subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, a 14- day course of silymarin produced a 2-fold increase in losartanAUC and C max, but these parameters were not affected in subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype. This finding supports that of Brantley et al. who noted that CYP2C9 appeared most vulnerableto inhibition by clinically achievable concentrations of silybin B[340].At present, no prospective studies have examined the effects ofphytosomal milk thistle preparations on the pharmacokineticprofiles of conventional medications. As such, it remains to beseen whether milk thistle products with enhanced bioavailabilitypose a greater risk for herb-drug interactions. A recent clinicaltrial of Siliphos \u00aefor treatment of chemotherapy-related hepato- toxicity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia suggests oth-erwise, as investigators observed no adverse interactions be-tween milk thistle and methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, or vin-cristine during the 28-day course of supplementation [365].Therefore, based upon the existing clinical data, the drug interac-tion risk for milk thistle products appears minimal.Interaction risk: low. St. John sW o r t ! With more than 2000 peer-reviewed articles published on its safety and efficacy, St. John sw o r t( Hypericum perforatum L.; family Clusiaceae) is the most studied botanical dietary supple-ment in the world. Hypericum perforatum is a yellow-flowering, perennial herb indigenous to Europe that has been introduced tomany temperate areas of the world and grows wild in manymeadows. The common name comes from its traditional flower-ing and harvesting on 24 June, the birthday of John the Baptist(St. John s Day). Extracts of H. perforatum have gained international recognition for their antidepressant activity although the efficacy of manySt. John s wort (SJW) products remains questionable [366]. Nevertheless, many clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy su-perior to placebo and comparable to standard antidepressantsbut with fewer side effects than conventional antidepressiveagents [367]. When used as a single agent, a favorable risk/bene-fit ratio has made St. John s wort one of the most readily con- sumed dietary supplements in the world. In turn, the popularityof SJW has also contributed to its distinction as being one of themost problematic dietary supplements with regard to herb-druginteractions.Both the antidepressant effect and drug interaction potential ofSJW hinge upon the extract s contentof hyperforin, a 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ing the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin, dopamine, norepi- nephrine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid with similarefficiency. Hyperforin s mode of action appears unique in that the phytochemical does not interact directly with uptake transportersbut elevates intracellular concentration, thereby inhibit-ing gradient-driven neurotransmitter reuptake [368]. As previ-ously mentioned in Part 1 of this review, recent investigations re-veal that hyperforin alleviate depression [369].While recognized as a natural antidepressant, SJW is equally wellknown for its ability to induce the activity of several XMEs andtransporters, thereby reducing the efficacy of a multitude of pre-scription medications. As discussed in Part 1 of this review, theclinical severity of SJW-mediated interactions was first recog-nized in 1999 -2000. At that time, several clinics around the world reported that concomitant use of SJW and cyclosporineproduced dramatic reductions in blood levels of the immunosup-pressant among organ transplant recipients resulting in graft re-jection. Since that time, a plethora of clinical studies have borneout SJW s effect on the pharmacokinetics of various medications [370 -374]. Hyperforin, a principal mediator of SJW s antidepressive action, lies at the heart of the herb s drug interaction potential. The prenylated phloroglucinol is a high-affinity ligand for human PXR,an orphan nuclear receptor selectively expressed in the liver andintestine that mediates the induction of XME and efflux -377]. According to estimate, hy- perforin is the most potent PXR activator discovered to date[375], with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50)o f 23 nM -a value well below plasma concentrations often achieved in humans (~ 100 -300 nM) [378,379]. (Unlike many of the unique phytochemicals described previously, hyperforin is bio-available and exhibits an elimination half-life of 8 -12 hours, thus allowing for significant accumulation with repeated dosing [378,379].) Of the XMEs and transporters regulated by PXR, mostaffected by SJW are CYP subfamilies as severalABC efflux transporters [370 -373]. As a result, more than 70% of all prescription medications are susceptible to SJW-mediated in-teractions, the consequences of which are decreased oral bio-availability, enhanced systemic clearance, and reduced drug effi-cacy.As with all botanicals, phytochemical content can vary consider- ably and such is the case with hyperforin [380,381]. Most SJW ex-tracts are currently standardized to contain 3% hyperforin, yetmany brands may possess amounts well below this value. Severalclinical studies have demonstrated that SJW extracts containingless than 1% hyperforin are less likely to produce clinically rele-vant herb-drug interactions [381 -384]. Unfortunately for con- sumers, few SJW products are specifically labeled as having lowhyperforin content. Accordingly, to avoid significant drug interac-tions, consumers should avoid concomitant use of SJW and pre-scription medications.In addition to content variability, another factor affecting themagnitude of hyperforin s effect on CYP3A expression and drug efficacy is PXR haplotype. Like many CYPs, PXR is polymorphic,and certain mutations produce significant functional defects interms of CYP3A transcription. Recent studies indicate that indi-viduals with H1/H1 haplotype pair appear Furthermore, once SJW has been discon-tinued, as much as a week may be required before CYP3A activityreturns to basal levels [386].SJW s penchant for producing herb-drug interactions has been scrutinized in several recent reviews [370 -374].l \"Table 1 sum- marizes those drugs in which SJW produces clinically significantinteractions.Interaction risk: high. Conclusions and Future Perspectives ! Humans possess a complex system of gastrointestinal XMEs andtransporters that are proficient at precluding absorption and fa-cilitating elimination of numerous structurally diverse dietaryphytochemicals. As a result, most botanical dietary supplementspose only minimal risks for modulating human drug metabolism.However, several distinct PSMs can either inactivate or highjackthe controls of this innate gastrointestinal defense network.MDP-PSMs, functioning as mechanism-based inhibitors of CYPs,may potentiate the toxicity of allopathic medications, whereaspotent nuclear receptor ligands like hyperforin may dramaticallyreduce drug efficacy. What differentiates these PSMs as signifi-cant modulators of human drug disposition from the multitudeof others is their combination of favorable physicochemical prop- Fig. 12 Representative phytochemicals (phloroglucinols, 2012; 78: 1490 -1514Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. erties and unique pharmacophores. As discussed in previous sec- tions, many PSMs modulate human XMEs and transporters in vi- tro, but due to various factors, this activity is rarely realized in vivo. Recognizing that poor dissolution characteristics represent majorobstacles to phytochemical bioavailability and efficacy, severaldietary supplement manufacturers have recently incorporatednovel methods of formulating botanical extracts as a means ofimproving oral absorption [387,388]. Such a CYP3A4 and ABCB1 inhibitor [387,388]. In each instance,when compared to conventional extract formulations, the oralbioavailability of various phytochemicals can be increased sev-eral fold. To date, no clinical assessments of the herb-drug inter-action potential of botanical extracts incorporating these novelformulations have been reported. Accordingly, many botanicalswhose drug interaction potential is minimized when adminis-tered as conventional dry extracts may increase significantlyupon ingestion of formulations utilizing novel delivery systems.Phytochemicals that heretofore had been casualties of man s xenobiotic defense system may emerge as inducers and/or inhib-itors of human XMEs and transporters. Improved phytochemicaldelivery, therefore, may open up a new theater of operations inthe \"drug war \"between humans and plants. Currently, thousands of botanical supplements are available inthe United States and abroad, and hundreds of new products areintroduced onto the market each year. Not surprisingly, the vastmajority of these botanicals have yet to be evaluated in a clinicalsetting. From a practical perspective, most may not warrant clin-ical study; logistics alone clearly preclude such an endeavor.Nevertheless, in vitro studies and compelling case reports suggest that many more botanical supplements may indeed be potentmodulators of human drug disposition.
