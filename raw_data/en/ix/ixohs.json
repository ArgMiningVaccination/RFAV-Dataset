Alcohol can exacerbate motion sickness, so it's best to avoid it. Most importantly, practising deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help calm the mind and reduce motion sickness symptoms,\" he added. Listing some additional prevention tips that can be practised to avoid the onset of motion sickness altogether while on a journey, Dr Chaudhary shared: - Focus on the Horizon: When possible, look at the horizon. This can help synchronize your visual and vestibular senses. - Choose the Right Seat: In cars, sit in the front seat and face forward. On a ship, opt for a cabin in the middle, where motion is less pronounced. - Maintain Good Ventilation: Fresh air can alleviate symptoms. Crack a window or step outside for a breath of fresh air. - Gradual Exposure: If you're prone to motion sickness, consider gradual exposure to the triggering activity to desensitise your body over time. Motion sickness can turn any journey into an uncomfortable experience. However, with Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle adjustments, you can alleviate its symptoms naturally. Dr Chaudhary also warned, \"While Ayurvedic remedies can be effective for many people, severe or persistent motion sickness may require medical attention. If your symptoms are severe, consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment. Understanding your dosha and incorporating Ayurvedic herbs like ginger, Triphala, Ajwain, and Shatavari into your routine can provide relief.\" By following the suggestions of Dr Chaudhary and taking a holistic approach, you can make your travels more enjoyable "}
