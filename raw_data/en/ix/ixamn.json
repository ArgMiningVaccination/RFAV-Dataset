Most are removed during the vaccine purification process, but trace quantities remain in some vaccines. Because antibiotics can cause severe allergic reactions in children (like hives, swelling at the back of the throat, and low blood pressure), some parents are concerned that antibiotics contained in vaccines might be harmful. However, the antibiotics most likely to cause severe allergic reactions (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporins and sulfa drugs) are not contained in vaccines. Antibiotics used during vaccine manufacture include neomycin, polymyxin B, streptomycin and gentamicin. Only minute quantities remain in vaccines (see table below). These small quantities of antibiotics have never been clearly found to cause severe allergic reactions. Therefore, the possibility that the trace quantities of antibiotics contained in vaccines cause severe allergic reactions remains, at best, theoretical.
