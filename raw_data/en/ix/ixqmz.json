Have you found yourself waking up with teary eyes, itchy eyes, runny or itchy nose or maybe with skin irritations and feeling tired? You may be suffering from Hay fever. Did you know that having hay fever is an allergic condition to the environment around us and it affects 30% of people world wide! Hay fever can really take over our lives if left untreated. Hay Fever in Ireland The pollen released by plants, trees and grasses around this time of year triggers an allergic reaction in hay fever sufferers, leaving us scratching, sneezing, feeling congested and sometimes downright miserable. And while you can't lock yourself in a darkened, airtight room until the end of August, armed with the right information, there are some things you can do to make the sneezing season more bearable. Hay fever facts Treatment of Hay Fever The best way to control most allergies is to avoid the trigger substance. However, it is very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months when you want to spend more time outdoors. A range of products is available to treat the symptoms of hay fever. Some may be prescribed by your GP, but others are available over-the-counter. Antihistamines, nasal sprays, eye drops and anti allergy cream are all available over the counter.
