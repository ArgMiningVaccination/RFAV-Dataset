Associate Tehri, TehriGarhwal , Uttarakhand, India Traditional medicines are used by about 60% of the world's population. These are used for primary he alth care, not only in rural areas of developing nations but they are also used in the developed countries where modern medicine are pre dominantly used. In the western world the use of medicinal herbs is continuously growing , approximately 40% of the populatio n is using herbs for medical illness due to increased incidences of adverse effects of allopathic medicine. There are about 45000 plant species in India, Eastern Himalayas, Western Ghats and Andman and Nicobar Islands are the hot spot for medicinal plants. Officially documented plants with medicinal potential are 300 0 but traditional practitioner use more than 6000. Seventy percent of the population in the rural India is dependent on the ayurvedic system of medicine. M ost of the drugs used in modern medicine and ancient Indian medicinal system are of plant origin. Beside plants many minerals, salts and animal products ar e used in Ayurvedic medicines. Homoeopathy originated in west, German physician Samuel Hanemann was t he father of homoeopathy (1796), the homeopathic remedies are prepared by successive dilution followed by shaking forcefully. Homoeopathy uses animal , plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. A rsenicum album (arsenic oxide), Natrum muriati cum (sodium chloride), opium (plant), and thyroidinum (thyroid hormone) are some of the homoeopathic medicines extracted medicine is a system of traditional medicine, native to India. In Sanskrit word ayush means longevity and veda means related to knowledge[1]. The earliest literature on Indian medical practice appeared during the vedic period in India. All the Vedas -Rig, Yajur, Sam, and Atharv have contributed to the development of Ayurveda. The Shushrut samhita and the charaka samhita are great encyclopedias of medicine compiled from various sources from the 600 -BC to about 500. Charaka samhita has mentioned about 341 plants while Shushrut samhita have listed 760 medicinal plants[2,3]. They are among the foundational works of Ayurveda. A number of drugs and surgical methods are developed by ayurvedic practitioners for various ailments. Ayurveda stresses on a balance of three elemental energies or humors vata (air & space - \"wind\"), pitta (fire & water -\"bile\") and kapha (water & earth \"phlegm\"). According to ayurvedic medical theory, these three dosas are important for health, because when they exist in equal quantities, the body will be healthy, and when they are not in equal amount s, the body will be unhealthy. Ayurveda stresses on the use of plant -based medicines and treatments. Hundreds of plant -based medicines are employed by ayurvedic practioner s. Some animal products may also be used, like milk, bones and minerals Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry Vol. 2 No. 1 2013 www. phytojournal .com Page | 270 including sulphur, arsenic, lead , copper sulphate. Some metals like gold, silver and mercury are also consumed as prescribed. Many ayurvedic herbs used for therapy have shown very promising results like turmeric and its derivative curcumin[4] are very good antioxidants. Tinspora cordifolia has been tested for its hepato - protective nature, Salvia officinalis (Common sage) may improve Alzheimer's patients[5]. Many plants used as rasayana (rejuvenation) medications are found potent antioxidants. Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine in which patients are treated with highly diluted preparations that are supposed to show similar symptoms in healthy persons as the patients. The basic principle of homeopathy, known as the \"law of similars\" , is \"let like be cured by like[6]. It was first stated by German physician Samuel Hanemann in 1796 . Homeopathy is a vitalist philosophy that interprets diseases and sickness as caused by disturbances in a hypothetical life- force (vital force). Homeopathy states that the vital force has the ability to react and adapt to internal and external causes, which homeopaths refer to as the law of susceptibility . Hahnemann proposed homeopathy in reaction to the traditional western medicine at that time, which often was brutal and more harmful than helpful. He believed that by using drugs to induce symptoms, the artificial symptoms would stimulate the vital force, causing it to neutralise and expel the original disease . Homeopathic remedies are prepared by successive dilution with shaking forcefully, it uses much animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. Depending on the dilution, homeopathic remedies may not contain any pharmacologically active molecules (12x )[7], it is based on the belief that a substance in large amount will produce a symptoms of a specific disease will cure it in very small doses and during the process of dilution a lot of energy is released whi ch helps in curing the ailment. 2.
