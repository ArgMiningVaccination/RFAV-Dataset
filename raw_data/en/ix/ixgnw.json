Many people will turn to traditional medicine to treat these conditions. Of course, these are designed to help; however, if you want to try something alongside these medicines or try something more natural, then acupuncture and herbal remedies may be just what you are looking for. To help you decide the right choice, we have put together how acupuncture and herbal remedies can help with bruising, joint pain and arthritis, for all ages. How does acupuncture help with joint pain? Acupuncture is an alternative therapy that has been used to treat a range of conditions for many years. It is not only effective, but it is also kind to your body too. It can also help treat a range of issues at once, although it can also be targeted to one particular problem you are having. Joint pain is an example of this. When an acupuncture needle is inserted into the skin, it tells the body to produce cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone designed to help control inflammation throughout the body. Therefore, it helps to reduce the inflammation that is felt in the joints. Not only this but acupuncture is also designed to stimulate other pain-relieving chemicals in your body. This, alongside the cortisol, will ensure that your joints feel as good as possible. Along with acupuncture, we have designed our own herbal mixture to help ease joint pain and arthritis discomfort. How does our herbal mixture help with joint pain? It contains peony extract, which has been proven to help support healthy joint function and reduce pain and inflammation as much as possible. Another ingredient in the mixture is silver root; much like peony extract, this particular root can help with any inflammation found in your joints (which will then cause the pain you feel). Licorice root has been used for thousands of years and is an effective treatment for inflammation throughout your body, even that which impacts your joints. As well as this, it can also be helpful if you have any digestive issues or if you need to treat an upper respiratory problem. In conclusion As you can see, many natural remedies help with bruises and joint pain on their own or when it is caused by arthritis. So, if, no matter what age, you want to live without the pain impacting your everyday life, then look at how alternative therapies can help you.
