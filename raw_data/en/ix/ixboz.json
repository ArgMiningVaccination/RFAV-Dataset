Yesterday was geared towards opening up space so you could each expand. This ultimately will bring more awareness of your personality. As you expand imagine that you your personality is standing in the center and as you grow you are able to take more distance as you view yourself so that you can see yourself more clearly. But also, as you are moving in a spiral you see yourself three dimensionally. If you are looking in a mirror you are not seeing the back of your body. You must turn around with another mirror in order to check yourself from behind. Moving in a spiral you have the potential to see all sides of yourself. That is the goal of life \"know thyself\". Accepting the self allows you to know the self better. Many times a person will reject parts of themselves that they do not feel are acceptable before examining or taking a closer look. Always better to take a very close look at those parts of you that you want to eliminate or change if you see that you get angry too easily...Any questions before we give you the activity today? Anything at all, here we are. In the Netherlands I met a person that I feel very connected to, like me in a female form. I am very attracted to this personality. There have been many lifetimes shared in many different ways of relating: brothers, mother and daughter...Those experiences of love leave open the opportunity for more experiences of love taking it from a different point, you see? Best to be friends first. Do you have a friendship with this person? Yes. Very well, that is how it begins before you move to more intimacy, if you both desire. The goal of any relationship is divine friendship no matter how you start. Whether you start as mother-son, lovers, friends, the goal is divine friendship. And what is divine friendship? Unconditional love. I have this kind of love already. That's perfect. [Login](https://spiritualhealing.com/membership-login/) Not a Heart member "}
