In a statement this morning, February 14, a representative says, \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall has tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating. We continue to follow government guidelines.\" While aides refuse to specify when the duchess tested positive, her status was confirmed as negative last week when she carried out engagements in London on February 10, including visits to a community kitchen and a sexual assault referral center. She has been triple vaccinated, receiving a booster in November. The news comes amid an ongoing mystery surrounding Queen Elizabeth's coronavirus status. Charles tested positive less than 48 hours after visiting his mother at Windsor Castle last Tuesday, February 8, meaning he would have most likely been infectious at the time of their afternoon tea. But while Buckingham Palace sources told BAZAAR two days later that the queen was \"not displaying any symptoms,\" officials refused to clarify whether she had taken a test or not. \"The situation will continue to be monitored,\" a representative added. The vague response, and refusal to also confirm whether the monarch has received booster vaccine shots, left many questioning whether Queen Elizabeth has COVID-19 or not. Though her first vaccination was made public in January 2021, palace officials have chosen not to share further information (and refused to comment when approached by BAZAAR last week). Though there is expectation for the British public to be told if their head of state is temporarily unable to carry out duties, it is also understandable that palace aides want to respect the medical privacy of a 95-year-old woman. \"We don't comment or guide on private medical matters,\" a spokesman says. This week, the queen is still expected to carry out virtual engagements from her Windsor base, including video calls with ambassadors and dignitaries. Both Charles and Camilla, who last saw each other on Wednesday, \"will continue to follow all government guidelines and review engagements on that basis,\" a royal source tells BAZAAR. \"We will not, however, be providing a running commentary on medical issues.\" Under current COVID rules in the United Kingdom, you are not required to self-isolate if a person in your home tests positive, providing you are fully vaccinated and test negative.
