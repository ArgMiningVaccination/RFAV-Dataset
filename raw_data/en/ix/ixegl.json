B UT ................................ ................................ ........................... SPECIMEN 9 For the qualitative detection and identification of Bordetella pertussis DNA from nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis . AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 2 of 17 Limit The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of Bordetella pertussis nucleic acids isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis . The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay the sequence IS481 and a self - contained disposable amplification detection device that allows for manual evaluation of assay results . The IS 481 sequence may also be found in strains of other organisms (i.e., B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica ). B. holmesii infection may cause clinical illness similar to B. pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both B. pertussis and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be performed if necessary to differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a rare cause of infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, othe r clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines. Negative results for the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay do not preclude B. pertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co -infection with other respiratory pathogens. Results from the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay should be used in conjunction with information obtained during the patient's clinical evaluation as an aid in diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay is intended for use in hospital, reference or state laboratory settings . The device is not intended for point -of-care use. SUMMARY AND EXPLANAT ION The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay combines simple sample isothermal amplification named -dependent amplification (HDA), and a self -contained disposable amplicon detection device, for the detection of Bordetella pertussis from nasopharyngeal swabs . Patient samples are collected using a nasopharyngeal swab and placed into a liquid transport medium . Fifty microliters (50 \u00b5L) of the sample are then transferred to a process buffer that is provided with the kit and mixed . Fifty mic roliters (50 \u00b5L) of the Process Buffer containing sample is added to a reaction tube containing lyophilized mix of HDA reagents . Included in the reaction mix are the isothermal polymerase, helicase and single stranded binding protein . After completion of t he HDA reaction the reaction tube is transferred to the amplicon cartridge containing the running buffer . The amplicon cartridge is closed and inserted into the detection chamber . The detection chamber is activated by depressing the detection chamber handl e. Upon activation, the reservoir containing the running buffer and the 0.2 mL tube containing the amplicon is punctured and the solutions are wicked to the lateral flow strip. AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 3 of 17 PRINCIPLE OF THE PRO CEDURE The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay detects B. pertussis DNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. After the swab is transferred to a liquid transport medium, a n aliquot of the sample is then transferred into a Process Buffer Tube and undergoes a simple heat lysis treat ment. Following heat treatment, an aliquot of the lysed sample is added to a 0.2 mL Reaction Tube containing a lyophilized mix of HDA reagents , dNTPs, primers, and probes. A competitive Process Control is included in the assay to monitor inhibitory substances in sample s, sample processing , and confirm the integrity of the assay reagents and the Detection Chamber . The asymmetric HDA r eaction results in the generation of excess single -stranded DNA amplicons, which hybridize to target -specifi c probes . The B. pertussis amplicon hybridizes to two specific probes labeled with biotin and 6 -carboxyfluorescein (FAM). The Process Control amplicon hybridizes to two specific probes labeled with biotin and dinitrophenyl (DNP). Following completion of the HDA reaction, the Reaction Tube is transferred to a proprietary Detection Chamber for detection. The Detection Chamber is comprised of two components: 1) an Amplicon Cartridge that holds the running buffer and the 0.2 mL Reactio n Tube and 2) the Detection Chamber which houses the Amplicon Cartridge and an embedded vertical -flow DNA detection strip . The DNA detection strip is coated with anti -FAM and anti -DNP antibodies . Once the Detection Chamber is closed, a razor blade and plastic pin located at the bottom of the Detection Chamber opens the Reaction Tube and running buffer bulb , resulting in the release of their contents. The contents flows through a fiberglass paper connected to the DNA detecti on strip that is attached to a fiberglass pad pre -loaded with streptavidin - conjugated color particles. The B. pertussis amplicon with biotin - and FAM -labeled probes is captured by the anti -FAM antibodies at the test ( T2) line, and the Process Control amplicon with biotin - and DNP -labeled probes is captured by the anti-DNP antibodies at the control ( C) line. The streptavidin -conjugated color particles bind to the biotin in the probe - amplicon hybrid and the test results are displayed in the Detection Cha mber window as colored T2 and/or C lines that are visible to the naked eye. Detection of B. pertussis is reported when the T2 line is visible through the detection window of the Detection Chamber . No detection of B. pertussis is reported when only the C line is displayed. The assay is regarded as invalid when none of the lines are displayed. BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE S Bordetella pertussis is a Gram -negative bacterium that targets the human respiratory tract and is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease known as whooping cough, or pertussis. Despite the availability and widespread use of pertussis vaccines, pertussis annually affects 16 million people worldwide, is responsible for approximately 195,000 annual deaths, and is one of the leading worldwide causes of vaccine -preventable deaths.1 The majority of pertussis - related cases and deaths occur in infants too young to receive the vaccine, unvaccinated children or under -vaccinated children. In the pre -vaccine era, the number of pertussis cases in the U.S. peaked at 250,000 and was significantly reduced to 1,010 cases in 1976 after the introduction of the vaccine in the 1940s.2 However, the incidence of pertussis has since steadily risen over time and as recently as 2012 and 2013, the number of combined reported pertussis cases exceeded 72,000.3 Factors that have likely contributed to the increased incidence of pertussis include waning vaccine -induced immunity in adolescent and adult populations, as current vaccines do not offer lifelong immunity and members of this population may not receive booster immunizations to maintain immunity, a decline in vaccine use for nonmedical reaso ns, and continued circulation of B. pertussis in the population.4-5 The incubation period for pertussis is typically 7 -10 days but can range from 1 -3 weeks. Following the incubation period, a mild onset of symptoms occurs including mild coughing, sneezing, or runny nose. Within one to two weeks, symptoms progress into a paroxysmal cough followed by a high pitched \"whoop\" sound in infected infants and children or persistent cough in adolescents and adults. The coughing stage can last up to six weeks before s ubsiding. Pertussis is clinically diagnosed by culture, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), or serology. Although culture is considered to be the gold standard diagnostic test method, as it is the only method that can achieve 100% specificity, its sens itivity is low and results can take as long as 7 days. In addition, culture relies on the presence of viable bacteria in the specimen, which declines as the disease progresses, therefore limiting specimen testing to the first two weeks post -cough onset. NA AT does not require viable bacteria, is highly sensitive and provides rapid turnaround of results within 24 to 48 hours. Testing should be performed within 4 weeks post -cough onset. Serological testing must be performed at least 2 weeks post -cough onset, a nd is ideally performed 4 -8 weeks post -cough onset, which is useful for late diagnosis or post -antibiotic use.6 AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 4 of 17 MATERIALS PROVIDED Cat. # M209 16 Tests per Kit Component Quantity Storage Detection Chamber s 16/kit 2\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C Process Buffer 16 tubes/kit 1.45 mL 30\u00b0C 2\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C MATERIALS REQUIRED B UT NOT PROVIDED External controls for Bordetella pertussis (e.g. Quidel Molecular Bordetella Control Set , Cat. # M117 , which contains positive and negative controls, serves as an external processing and extraction control) Sterile DNase-free filter -blocked or positive displacement micropipett e tips Micropipett e Stopwatch or timer Scissors or a blade Heat block capable of 95\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C temperature Heat block with heated lid capable of 64\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C temperature Thermometer WARNINGS AND PRECAUT IONS Treat all specimen s/samples as potentially infectious. Follow universal precautions when handling samples, this kit and its contents. Proper sample collection, storage and transport are essential for correct results. Store assay reagents as indicated on their individual labels. Reagents are not interchangeable between lots. Never pool reagents from different tubes even if they are from the same lot. Do not use the reagents after their expiration date. Do not interchange caps among reagents as contamination may occur and compromise test results. Only open the tubes when adding aliquots into tubes or removing aliquots from tubes. Keep the tubes closed at any other time to avoid contamination. To avoid contamination of the environment with B. pertussis amplicons, do not open the reaction tubes post - amplification. Avoid microbial and deoxyribonuclease ( DNase) contamination of reagents when removing aliquots from tubes. The use of sterile DNase-free disposable filter -blocked or positive displacement pipettor tips is recommended. Use a new pipett e tip for each specimen or reagents. Performing the assay outside of the recommended time ranges can produce invalid results. Assays not completed within specified time ranges should be repeated. Additional controls may be tested according to guidelines or requirements of Local, State, Provincial and/or Federal regulatio ns or accrediting organizations. In cases where open -tube PCR tests are conducted in the same general area by the laboratory, separated or segregated working areas should be used for specimen preparation and amplification/detection activities. Supplies and equipment should be dedicated to each area and should not be moved from one area to another. Gloves must always be worn and must be changed before going from one area to another. Gloves must be changed before manipulating the reagents. Do not pipette by m outh. Do not smoke, drink or eat in areas where specimens or kit reagents are being handled. For accurate results, pipette carefully using only calibrated equipment. AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 5 of 17 Maintenance and decontamination of workspace and equipment should follow and be performed according to established laboratory protocols and schedules. Use micropipettes with an aerosol barrier or positive displacement tips for all procedures. Testing should be performed in an area with adequate ventilation.

STORAGE AND HANDLING OF KIT REAGENTS Store assay reagents and Detection Chamb ers as indicated on their individual labels. SPECIMEN COLLECTION, STORAGE AND HANDLIN G Specimen Type : Nasopharyngeal swabs . Nasopharyngeal swabs used for the validation of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay were obtained using standard techniques from patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis . These specimens were collected, transported, and stored at 2C to 8C for up to 72 hours before processing . Any additional leftover specimen should be stored -70C. The swabs were liquid media (i.e. E -Swab), or viral transport media. A series of studies were performed evaluating a number of routinely used transport medi a at a volume of 3 mL: M4, M4 -RT, M5, and UTM . No significant difference in assay performance was seen between the four different types of viral transport media , saline (0.85%), ASSAY PROCEDURE Heat Lysis 1. Warm the heat block to 95\u00b0C , 25 minutes prior to Heat Lysis Step 2. 2. Transfer 50 L of specimen -containing medium to a labeled Process Buffer tube and vortex for 10 seconds.

Tear open a new Detection Chamber package. Label the Detection Chamber appropriately. Make sure a buffer bulb is attached to the Amplicon Cartridge. 2. Place the Reaction Tube into the Amplicon Cartridge (Fig ure 1, Step 1). Note: Be sure to insert the hinge of the Reaction Tube cap into the largest slot adjacent to the buffer bulb . 3. Close the Amplicon Cartridge (Fig ure 1, Step 2) and ensur e that it snaps shut. If the cartridge does not snap shut, reposition the tube within the cartridge. 4. Insert the closed Amplicon Cartridge into the Detection Chamber (Figure 1, Step 3). Ensure that the arrow faces the detection strip (Reaction Tube should face the razor blade and the buffer bulb should face the pin). Label the Detection Chamber on the top and/or side of the outer casing. AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 6 of 17 5. Keep the device upright and press the handle of the outer casing to close the device (Fig ure 1, Step 4). The handle will lock into place when closed completely (Fig ure 1, Step 5). Figure 1 6. Results are read at 10 minutes . Note: The results are stable for up to 60 minutes. 7. Discard the used Detection Chambers in sealed bags and as appropriate for your laboratory. Warning 1. DO NOT open the AmpliVue Detection Chamber after use . Opening the Detection Chamber after use may result in amplicon contamination of the test area. 2. Remove the required number of reaction tubes from the protective pouch, remove the excess air and reseal the bag. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Any pink - to red -colored visible line should be recorded as positive (+) and no line should be recorded as ( -); for example, \"T2+\" = Visible T 2 line and \"T 2-\" = No T 2 line (See diagram below) . The T 2 line detects B. pertussis DNA. The C line detects the process control DNA. The control line intensity may vary with each test. Any pink to red colored visible line in the control signifies a valid test. Positive for Negative for Invalid B. pertussis DNA B. pertussis DNA C Line *T1 Line T2 Line AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 7 of 17 The assay results are interpret ed a ccording to the following criteria: Test line (T)Reading Control line (C) Reading Interpretation of result T2+ C+ B. pertussis DNA detected (Positive) T2+ C- B. pertussis DNA detected (Positive) T2- C+ No B. pertussis DNA detected (Negative) T2- C- Invalid : failure due to inhibitory specimen, reagent failure, or device failure. Repeat test with original specimen . *Note 1: The T1 line is not used on this assay. The presence of a T1 line should be considered invalid for this assay. Repeat test with original specimen . QUALITY CONTROL The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay incorporates several controls to monitor assay performance. 1. The Process Control is used to monitor sample processing, detect HDA inhibitory specimens and confirm the integrity of assay reagents and chamber detection . The Process Control is included in the Process Buffer Tube. 2. External positive controls may be treated as a patient specimen . The control should be sampled and tested as if it were a sample in Transport Medium . The external positive control is intended to monitor substantial reagent and Detection Chamber failure. 3. External negative controls may be treated as a patient specimen . The control should be sampled and tested as if it were a sample in Transport Medium . The external negative control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry -over) by B. pertussis DNA or amplicon . LIMITATIONS Although there is no need for reagent preparation , the main laboratory technique required is pipetting . Good laboratory technique is essential for the proper performance of this assay. Due to the high analytical sensitivity of this test, extreme care should be taken to preserv e the purity of all reagents, especially in cases where multiple aliquots are taken from a tube. The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay procedure must be carried out in an environment that does not exceed 30\u00b0C. The IS 481 sequence used in the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay can also be found in strains of other organisms (i.e., B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica ). B. holmesii infection may cause clinical illness similar to B. pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both B. pertussis and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be performed if necessary to differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a rare cause of infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines. This device has not been evaluated for monitoring treatment of Bordetella pertussis infections. As with all molecular bas ed diagnostic tests, (A) False -negative results may occur from the presence of inhibitors, technical error, sample mix -up or low numbers of organisms in the clinical specimen; (B) False -positive results may occur from the presence of cross -contamination by target organisms, their nucleic acids or amplified product, and from non -specific amplification signals. Organism nucleic acids may persist in vivo , independent of organism viability. The Am pliVue Bordetella assay does not distinguish between viable and n onviable organisms. Environmental contamination of an exam room from a prior patient or a recent pertussis vaccination administration may result in false -positive test results. Respiratory infections can be caused by Bordetella pertussis as well as other p athogens. Positive results do not preclude coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. False -negative Bordetella pertussis results are more likely if patients are tested later in the disease course (more than two weeks after symptom onset), due to declin ing concentrations of Bordetella DNA. False -negative results may also be increased in patients treated with antibiotic therapy. AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 8 of 17 Prevalence of Bordetella pertussis will affect the positive and negative predictive values for the assay. Bordetella parapertuss is which causes a pertussis -like illness is not detected by the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay. Illness caused by B. parapertussis is generally milder than illness caused by B. pertussis because the bacteria do not produce pertussis toxin. Results from this test must be correlated with the clinical history, epidemiological data, and any other data available to the clinician. This test has not been evaluated for specimens other than nasopharyngeal swab specimens, for immunocompromised individ uals or from patients not suspected of infection with Bordetella pertussis. EXPECTED VALUE Performance characteristics of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay were established during a prospective study conducted April to August 2014 . Eight hundred forty two (842) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected at five distinct geographical sites across the United States from female and male patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis . A single specimen was collected per patient and were collected and transported to each laboratory for testing with the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay. The gender and age demographics for each category are listed below.

Eight hundred forty two (842) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from female and male patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis which were collected and transported to each laboratory for t esting with the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay. Clinical performance was based on comparison of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay results to those obtained by Composite Reference Method that included two manufacturer validated, IS481 -targeted real -time specimens The protocols included 37 amplification cycles . Bi-directional sequencing was performed for all specimens producing amplicon prior to the end of 37-cycle amplification . Specimens were considered positive when bi -directional sequencing results from either AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 9 of 17 comparator PCR assay confirmed the presence of Bordetella pertussis amplicon . Specimens were considered negative when neither comparator PCR assay produce d Bordetella pertussis amplicon at the end of the 37 -cycles. Combined Data Eight hundred forty two (842) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens were tested as described above . Six (6) specimens (0.7%) were invalid (in both the initial and repeat test neith er the T2 or control lines were detected) and have been removed from additional analysis.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) The reactivity of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay was evaluated against an additional six (6) additional strains of Bordetella pertussis (BP) tested in triplicate at concentrations near the level of detection of the assay ( 2,358 CFU/mL ). All six (6) strains were detected by the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay in this study at a LOD of 2,358 CFU/mL Bacterial The Precision/Within Laboratory Repeatability was determined via a study, where a three -member panel (5x, 2x, and a negative sample) was tested by two (2) operators, twice a day (2X) for twelve (12) days. The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay produces results that are reproducible. This observation is based on the following findings: AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 10 of 17 All negative samples generated negative results for BP. The percentage of positive of the Low Positive (2x LOD) samples was 100%. The percentage of positive of the Moderate Positive (5x LOD) samples was 100%. Reproducibility Study In order to confirm the reproducibility of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay a blinded and randomized study panel containing Bordetella pertussis (BP) negative and positive samples (5x and 2x,) were tested at three (3) test sites (one in -house laboratory and two (2) clinical sites) . Each site tested a reproducibility panel and Assay Controls for five (5) days in triplicate. Testing was done by two operators at each site. Each operator ran the panel once a day u sing one lot of AmpliVue Bordetella Assay. A total of four hundred fifty (450) specimens were tested (including controls). The AmpliVue Bordetella Assay generated reproducible results in this study. Category SITE Overall Percent Agreement 95% Confidence Interval Site #1 Site #2 Site #3 #expected results/# tested % Agreement #expected results/# tested - Microbial Interference A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay in the presence of seventy -nine (79) other microorganisms potentially found in specimens collected to test for Bordetella pertussis (BP) infection. Each potentially interfering microorganism was tested in the presence of 2x LOD BP in the presence of clinically relevant levels of viruses (105 pfu/mL) and bacteria (106 cfu/mL) or higher. The organisms and their concentrations included in the interference study are shown in the table below. Organism Test Concentration Acinetobacter Page 12 of DNA copies/mL None of the organisms used in the study demonstrated interference with the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay. Analytical Specificity - Cross -reactivity A study was performed to evaluate the cross -reactivity of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay with seventy -nine (79) other microorganisms potentially found in specimens collected to test for Bordetella pertussis (BP) infection. Each microorganism was tested at clinically relevant levels of viruses (105 pfu/mL) and bacteria (106 cfu/mL) in the device. The organisms included in the cross -reactivity study and their tested concentrations are shown in the table below. Organism Test Concentration Acinetobacter Concentration Epstein -Barr Virus 1.34 x106 Virus copies/mL The Cross Reactivity study tested a panel of 79 microorganisms. This study determined that 1 of 4 Bordetella bronchiseptica strains (strain 4617) and 4 of 4 Bordetella holmesii strains tested were cro ss-reactive with the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay . These results can be expected as 5% of all Bordetella bronchiseptica strains and all Bordetella holmesii strains are known to carry the IS 481 target sequence. These cross -reactive results are noted in the intended use and limitation sections. Analytical Specificity - Interfering Substances A study was conducted to determine if the AmpliVue Bordetella assay is inhibited in the presence of a panel of sixteen (16) substances potentially present in specimens collected to test for Bordetella pertussis (BP) infection . Each of the potential interfering substances was tested in three replicates in the presence and absence of near LOD (2x) levels of BP bacteria in the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay . Substances were introduced into the assay at concentrations which were medicall y relevant. Common Name Test Concentration Cepacol Sore Throat Lozenges 5% (Tamiflu) 10 mg/ml There was no evidence of interference caused by the substances tested. AmpliVue Bordetella Assay Page 15 of 17 Carryover - Cross Contamination A stock of high positive sample containing greater than 1x 106 CFU/ml of Bordetella pertussis (BP) was prepared for testing in the assay workflow. In each run of testing, proces sing of high positive samples in UTM was alternated with negative UTM only samples to assess the risk of cross contamination. In total, three runs consisting of 11 samples positive for BP and 11 negative samples were tested for a total of 33 positive and 3 3 negative samples. All positive BP samples were positive and all negative BP samples were negative . No carryover/contamination was seen when performing t he AmpliVue Bordetella Assay in acco rdance with the package insert.
