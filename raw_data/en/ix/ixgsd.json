The National Institute of Justice is a component of the Office of Justice Programs, which also includes the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office of JuvenileJustice and Delinquency Prevention, and the Office for Victims of the Intersection of Public Health and Criminal Justice Research on Drugs and practitioners who deal with drugs and crime day in and day out,the reality of the drugs-crime nexus isindisputable. In a manual designed to helppolice chiefs and sheriffs control drugabuse, the International Association ofChiefs of Police (IACP) stated unequivocal-ly its belief in \"a significant though com-plex\" relationship between drug abusersand criminal offenders. Change one group,IACP proposed, and you change the other:\"If there is a reduction in the number ofpeople who abuse drugs in your communi-ty, there will be a reduction in the commis-sion of certain types of crime in yourcommunity.\" 1 When IACP released its manual more thana decade ago, researchers already wereconfirming what practitioners believed anddocumenting the relationship betweendrugs and crime. 2Public policy and pro- grams were and continue to be developedon the basis of this knowledge. 3But although researchers and practitionersalike knew the relationship existed, thenature of that relationship eluded themthen and continues to elude them today. 4 To shed light on the drugs-crime link requires research, and the first step is tospecify the research topics to be covered.Taking the lead, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the National Institute onDrug Abuse (NIDA) brought together aca-demics and other researchers and askedthem to answer three questions: What dowe know about drugs and crime, what dowe not know, and, most important, whatdo we need to know? Both agencies seethis knowledge not as an end in itself but as a means to accurately define the prob-lem of drugs and crime and promotefuture research. The agenda for researchwas developed under NIJ and NIDA spon-sorship at a forum held in Washington,D.C., in April 2001. The findings of theDrugs and Crime Research Forum are pre-sented here. In pursuit of the drugs-crime link If we are going to make progress toward solving the problem of drugs and crime,we need to shed light on the nature of thedrugs-crime link by designing effectiveresponses. Developing a research agendaon drugs and crime means tackling thecentral issue of the drugs-crime link. Is thelink a matter of cause and effect or is itsomething far more complex? There is no lack of theories. The direct cause model of the drugs-crime relation-ship has attracted its share of supporters.It states simply that either drug use leadsto crime or crime leads to drug use. Thesimplicity is appealing. Who would notfind it tempting to believe that reducingdrug use can lower the crime rate? In fact,some policies and programs have beendeveloped on the basis of the direct causemodel or the belief in a significant rela-tionship between drugs and crime. AsIACP recognized, the relationship is realenough. And NIJ's Arrestee Drug AbuseMonitoring program has demonstratedIntroduction Henry H. Brownstein with Christine Crossland2SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 year after year that among people appre- hended and charged with a crime, a largepercentage uses drugs. 5 However, as sociologist Erich Goode hascautioned, \"Even the fact that drugs andcrime are frequently found together or cor- related does not demonstrate their causal connection.\" 6The consensus among re- searchers who study the issue confirmsGoode's observation. The evidence for thedirect cause model is just not there. 7 We seem more willing today to accept the complexity of the drugs-crime relationship,more open to the notion that \"[t]here isconsiderable uncertainty . . . about thedegree to which drug use causes crime orthe degree to which criminal involvementcauses drug use.\" 8In a recent review of the literature, sociologists Helene RaskinWhite and Dennis M. Gorman definitivelydismissed the direct cause model. Theyconcluded instead that the drugs-crimelink is best explained by the commoncause model, in which any association ofdrugs and crime has a cluster of causes. 9 Those who subscribe to the commoncause model believe that to adequatelyunderstand the relationship of drugs tocrime requires attention to many issues,social, cultural, chemical, and biologicalamong them. What the model means forpolicy and practice is that any response todrugs and crime that works in one set ofcircumstances may not work in another.For researchers, it means the researchagenda is vast. Policy and practice can beinformed by what we know up to thispoint, but progress in responding to thedrugs-crime problem requires knowingmore.Building on the past: The Drugs and CrimeResearch Forum NIDA and the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, NIJ'spredecessor organization, were asked byCongress in 1976 to find out what wasknown about drugs and crime. The prod-uct of the agencies' collaboration wasDrugs and Crime: A Survey and Analysisof the Literature. Though not strictly a research agenda, the survey was a firststep \"to identify where the gaps in ourknowledge lie and to direct research to fillthose gaps.\" 10It was intended to \"set the stage for more focused future research.\"11 In 2000, NIJ's call for the developmentof a research agenda was another steptoward meeting that need. The authors ofDrugs and Crime noted at the time that \"few if any [studies] directly address thedrugs-crime nexus issue.\" 12This report on the development of the research agendawill demonstrate that although much hasbeen learned in the intervening yearsabout drugs, drug use, drug abuse, drugmarkets, and drug law enforcement, muchwork is needed to shed light on the com-plexities of the drugs-crime link. Three papers were commissioned for the research forum. Each addressed the ques-tions of what we know, what we do notknow, and what we need to know aboutthe drugs-crime link. Prepared by expertsin epidemiology, public policy, social work,and allied disciplines, the papers served asthe focal point and framework for discus-sions by forum participants. (The forumsummary, agenda, and a list of the partici-pants are presented in appendixes A, B,3TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY and C.) After the forum adjourned, NIDA created a listserv for participants to contin-ue to exchange their thoughts. The discussions did not all fit the same mold. Roundtables were generated fromone-sentence statements by participantsabout drugs and crime. What we do not know about the drugs-crime relationshipwas treated at length. The many strands ofthought, lines of discussion, and themescame together when Forum participantsaddressed the final question: What futureresearch is most important, and what re-search is needed most urgently? Mindfulthat the next generation of researchers willbe tackling the problem of drugs and crime,Forum participants recommended topicsfor research by their graduate students. Probing drugs and crime: Three perspectives \"At the Intersection of Public Health and Criminal Justice Research on Drugs andCrime\" was commissioned by NIDA fromJames C. Anthony with Valerie Forman.Anthony asked such questions as\u2014 Have we made effective and adequateuse of recent developments in scienceand technology to advance the study(and hence the understanding) of therelationship between drugs and crime?Given the vast literature generated dur-ing past decades on this subject, havewe adequately, appropriately, and effec-tively integrated research from boththe public safety and public health perspectives? Are the tensions between the two per-spectives greater than our ability toovercome them? Given what we knownow and the current tension betweenresearchers in public safety and publichealth, how can we conceptualize andorganize our thinking and research toenhance our knowledge and under-standing of the relationship in the most productive ways? What do we really know about the suspected causal connection betweendrugs and crime? In looking at drugsand crime, what is the intersection atwhich public health and public safetymeet? How can we achieve the goalsof greater understanding and definitiveevidence and greater mastery in designand application in policy, programs, andtechniques to prevent and reduce harm-ful health and safety consequences ofdrug use? What do we need to do to integratemolecular biology, genetics, and neuro-science into discussions of drugs andcrime? What do we need to do to placediscussions of the drugs-crime nexus inthe context of history? How can we clar-ify the question of causal inference?How can we use the notions of scaleand rubrics to help understand the rela-tionship between drugs and crime? \"Research on Drugs-Crime Linkages: The Generation\" was commissioned byNIJ from Robert MacCoun, Beau Kilmer,and Peter Reuter. Among the questionsasked by MacCoun and his colleagueswere\u2014 Are our conceptualizations of the rela-tionship between drugs and crime adequate to move forward in our under-standing of that nexus? How must weconceptualize the relationship to be ableto address questions not only of con-comitance and statistical correlation, butalso of social significance and causality? To the extent that the drugs-crime re- lationship is causal, to what extent dowe understand the nature of the causalinfluences? How can we use PaulGoldstein's tripartite taxonomy to buildon work already done, and how can wemove beyond the taxonomy? Howthe dynamic tension between drug poli- cy as it shifts and the drugs-crime con-nection as policy changes? What is thevalue of interventions and treatmentwhen dealing with drug-using offenders? What do we need to learn? It will come as no surprise that the ques-tion of what we know about drugs andcrime was eclipsed by that of what we donot know and what we have yet to learn.The papers and accompanying discussionsyielded an abundance of ideas on researchtopics for the coming decades. The majorthemes included the following: Drug-related crime. Drug enforcement. Drug markets. Drug offenders. Drug policy. Treatment and intervention. Drug use and abuse. Ethnographic studies. Health sciences perspectives. Minority research. Research methods. Victimization studies. Categorized more broadly, the topics pro- posed for research are the drugs-crimenexus, the social contexts of drug use andcrime, and refining study methods anddesigns. What explains the drugs-crime nexus? We know that drugs and crime are related. We also know something about the differ- ent ways they might be related, and per-haps something about the ways they maybe related in time and space. What wehave yet to learn is how they are related. In other words, we need to probe theunderlying dynamics of the relationship.We do not know, for example, why so many people who commit crime also use 4SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 can we use notions such as Bruce Johnson's conduct norm analysis orAlfred Blumstein's drugs-gun diffusionhypothesis? 13 How does the considerable heterogene-ity of users, substances, locations, andsituations as well as differences in mar-ket dynamics affect what we need tohave and to do to address the drugs-crime nexus? How do we address thequestion of causal influences? How willresearch in the coming decade deal withthe heterogeneity substances, cities, neighbor-hoods, and situations? \"The Drugs-Crime Wars: Past, Present, and Future in Theory, Policy,and Program Interventions\" was commis-sioned by NIJ from Duane C. McBride,Curtis J. VanderWaal, and Yvonne M.Terry-McElrath. In this paper, McBride and his colleagues raised the followingquestions: In the past two or three decades, whatprogress has been made in our knowl-edge and understanding of the relation-ship between drugs and crime? Doesknowledge of the statistical relationshiphelp us understand the nature of therelationship? What do we know aboutthe nature of the nexus and what do weneed to do now to advance the state ofour knowledge? In the past century,how have we used that knowledge toguide public policy? Could we do a bet-ter job of linking what we think andwhat we know about drugs and crimeto what we do to address individual andsocial problems in the realms of publichealth and public safety? Do we knowenough about what has been tried (forexample, programs and program evalua-tions) to know what works? How is the idea of social capital impor-tant to our understanding of the drugs-crime nexus? What is the significance of5TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY drugs or why some people who use drugs commit crime but others who use drugsdo not commit crime. Research in thisbroad area might take several directions. Find new ways to conceptualize the drugs-crime nexus. Several years ago, Goldstein proposed a tripartite frameworkas a way to disentangle the relationshipbetween drugs and crime, specifically vio-lent crime. Violence could be the directoutcome of ingesting drugs, the result ofauser's compulsion to obtain drugs or money for drugs, or a product of the disor-ganization and violence inherent in thesocial systems in which drugs are manu-factured and exchanged. 14Over the years, this framework has been useful for study-ing drugs and violent crime but of limitedvalue for studying drugs and other typesof crime. Beyond what has been learnedfrom this model, how can researchersconceptualize the way or ways drugs andcrime\u2014not just violent crime\u2014are related? Combine research perspectives. Re- search on drug use illustrates how differentdisciplines can combine forces. Social sci-ence research is beginning to merge withbiological research, particularly genetic re-search. Questions include the following: How can the study of genes, the socialenvironment, and behavior help us bet-ter understand the link between drugsand crime? Are there physiological propensities fordrug user's environment? Are alcohol and marijuana complementsof or substitutes for other drugs? Do different drugs have different effectson groups of people who are geneticallydifferent? How can we address the ethical con-cerns of such research?Give more attention to minorities. A disproportionate number of the peoplearrested, charged, and in custody for drugand other criminal offending are fromminority groups. The reason is unknownbut needs to be probed. What can welearn about the involvement of variousethnic and racial groups in the drugs-crimelink? What can we learn about gender andthe drugs-crime link? Some answersmight be found in comparative, multisitestudies of drug use and drug markets indifferent ethnic communities. What is therelationship of gender, age, race, and cul-ture to drug involvement and crime? Whatis the effect of disparity (in income, forexample), prejudice, and discrimination onthe distribution of resources used fortreatment and prevention? How can weexplain racial and ethnic differences indrug use and involvement in crime? Dopeople view the drugs-crime link different-ly because of their race, gender, or age? From these general research areas on racial and ethnic diversity, it is possible toderive many specific topics. What can wefind out about the relationship betweendrugs, crime, and the increase in the num-ber of women of color who are incarcer-ated? Have changes in the economyaffected the involvement of disadvantagedblack and Hispanic/Latino males in drugsand crime? If so, how? What is the impactof drug-related incarceration on familiesand children or on prospects for educationand employment in minority communities? What do we need to know about the social context ofdrugs and crime? It is widely believed that drug use ad- versely affects users. But drug use andcrime are affected by and in turn affectforces operating in society at large. Drugusers interact with many people: sellerswith buyers, buyers with sellers, criminal6SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 offenders with their victims. There is a social context of drug use. Social patterns in the drug world. There have been many studies of drug users andsome studies of drug markets. But whatdo we need to learn about the social rela-tions and interactions of the people whoselives are affected by drugs? The commerce of drugs and crime: drug markets. Theories about and the opera- tions and institutional arrangements ofdrug markets are plentiful, but not enoughresearch has been done to test them.How stable are drug markets, and how dothey change over time? For example, hasthe maturation of the crack cocaine mar-ket in some cities affected those cities'crime rates? What is the connection be-tween local market activity and fluctua-tions in supply and demand at the nationallevel? What influences the relationshipbetween sellers and buyers? How andwhy do new markets emerge, and whatimpact do they have on existing markets?How are prices set in local drug markets,and how are wages set? Patterns of use and abuse. We know something about the demographics ofdrug use, but what do we know aboutintergenerational patterns? How do usepatterns vary with social or biological dif-ferences? How do patterns of alcohol usecompare with patterns of use of otherdrugs? Can drug use help explain juvenileinvolvement in crime or violence? Are pat-terns of use of certain drugs, such as clubdrugs, designer drugs, or inhalants, differ-ent from patterns of use of other drugs?What can we find out about how and whypeople start or stop using drugs? Criminal offending by drug users. There are some studies of drug offenders, buthow much do we know about how or whydrug offenders commit crime? Are somepeople genetically predisposed to druguse? Is there a relationship between druguse and social status, and if so, how might social status in turn be related to involve-ment in crime? Beyond using illicit drugs,to what extent are drug users and sellersinvolved in other crime? Can we realistical-ly estimate how much other crime is com-mitted by drug offenders? What risk dothese people pose to their own health andsafety? Victims of drug users and drug use. Drug users are in some ways their own victims,but are there other victims? What do weknow about other people with whom drugusers relate? How can we define for re-search and policy purposes what we meanby \"victims of drugs\"? How do we definevictimization in this context? Are there indi-rect victims, such as families and commu-nities, as well as direct victims? The public's response to drug use and drug-related crime. Society considers drug-related crime and illicit drug use asaffronts and responds accordingly. En-forcement strategies are one example. Towhat extent are the responses based on areal understanding of these problems? Arethe responses making a difference? Enforcing drug laws. What is the effect of enforcement policies, programs, and prac-tices on drug use, drug dealing, and drug-related crime? What is the relationshipbetween street-level enforcement andstreet-level drug market activity, particular-ly violent activity? What impact do drugseizures, drug arrests, and asset forfei-ture, among other interdictions, have ondrug and drug-related crime? What is theimpact of public concern about racial pro-filing and police corruption on the ability oflaw enforcement to respond to drugs andcrime? Treating drug use and abuse. With so many different drugs and so many differ-ent types of users, what can we sayabout the efficacy of drug treatment inaddressing drugs and crime? What is the7TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY nexus of drug treatment and criminal jus- tice? For example, what are the results oftreatment in correctional settings andwhat do evaluations reveal? Do incentivesor disincentives help drug users to suc-ceed in treatment? How do we definesuccess? How important are aftercare pro-grams and family interventions? What isthe best way to treat drug users who aredually diagnosed (for example, those whoare also mentally ill)? What are the dropoutrates for treatment, and what does it mat-ter? What treatments work best with whattypes of drug use? How do we distinguishusers from abusers? What differencedoes that distinction make for treatmentplanning? Intervening to prevent drug use or crime. Although relatively little is known aboutpreventing drug use, the topic receives agreat deal of attention. To what extent canmedia campaigns help prevent drug use?Is the impact of prevention programs thesame for all social categories of users orirrespective of type of drug? How can weeducate young people about the impactthat drugs can have on their lives? Shouldmore attention be paid to problem behav-ior, norm violations, and rule breaking thanto drug prevention? Public policy. When we think about public policy on drugs, we typically do not thinkabout policy in general but rather aboutspecific aspects, such as interdiction,enforcement, treatment, and prevention.But can we step back and think broadlyand measure the impact of drug policyover the past decade, or even the pastcentury? Can we learn from policy simu-lations that examine past and prospectiveviews of drug use? Can we learn fromcomparative studies of different coun-tries? What is the impact of differentdirections in drug policy? What policieshave worked or not worked with adult andjuvenile drug offenders? Can researchexamine drugs, crime, and public policytogether? Can we find out from policy- makers and practitioners what decisionsthey need to make and what questionsthey need to answer about drugs andcrime? How can we move drug policyanalysis beyond econometrics (supply anddemand, for example) and begin to studydrug use from the perspective of politics,criminal justice, public health, and socialwork? Methods of studying drugs and crime Research methods are dictated by the questions researchers ask. Some of thequestions already explored indicate thatcertain methodological concerns mightneed to be addressed. Attention to measurement and design. What are the best measures currentlyavailable to study drug use and involve-ment in drug markets and drug treatment?How can they be improved? How can weconstruct integrated data collection meas-ures? What is the best way to designmeasures and procedures to evaluatedrug control programs? What are the bestmeasures for assessing drug treatmentoutcomes? What is the role of cost-benefit analysis in drug studies? What canwe learn from longitudinal studies aboutthe long-term effects of drug use andabuse? How can we introduce randomiza-tion to long-term studies of drug treat-ment? How can statistical techniquesdeveloped by other sciences be adoptedby the social sciences? How can weencourage multidisciplinary teams ofresearchers to work together to studydrugs and crime? Ethnography. There is a long, distinguished tradition of ethnographic research in thefield of drug studies. Ethnographic stud-ies, however, are almost by definition lim-ited to a single area or a small group ofpeople. What might we learn by second-ary analyses of ethnographic studies?8SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 What might we learn by replicating ethno- graphic studies in other communities oramong other groups of drug users? Howuseful might it be to link ethnographicstudies of community structure with studies of drug users and dealers in theircommunities? What can we learn fromstudying communities of sellers andusers? Would it be useful to establishprospective, qualitative field sites in vari-ous communities as a type of surveillancesystem to monitor changing drugs anddrug-use patterns? Using available data and studies . How can we make better use of available datato study drugs and crime? Are there obsta-cles to making better use of available datato learn from them what we can? Whatcan we learn from meta-analyses of previ-ously conducted research studies of drugsand crime? What is in this report? Following this introduction are the threepapers commissioned for the forum andappendixes containing a summary of theforum proceedings, the agenda, and a listof the names and organizational affiliationsof the participants.

An importantpoint of departure for this paper is a wide-ly held assumption about two goals ofresearch on this topic. The first goal is toachieve greater understanding and devel-op a body of definitive evidence on drugsand crime. The second goal is to achievegreater mastery of the design and applica-tion of policies, programs, and techniquesto improve public health and public safetyby preventing and reducing harmful conse-quences of drug use. The outline for this paper corresponds with assignments delegated at a planningmeeting held at the National Institute ofJustice (NIJ) in January 2001. This intro-ductory section provides some back-ground notes on the literature reviewedfor the paper and describes an organizingconceptual framework that can be used toassess gaps in the current evidence. Thenext section identifies some tensions thatmerit discussion as we try to forge a newresearch agenda on drugs and crime. Wethen address the central question posed inour planning meeting for the drugs-crime research forum: \"What do know aboutthe drugs-crime interrelationship?\" Wecannot provide a comprehensive answerto this question in a relatively short paper,but we will offer a starting point for dis-cussion, focusing on suspected causalrelationships between drugs and crime.We also present a few concluding state- ments that were designed to facilitate discussion at the forum on drugs-crimeresearch held at NIJ in April 2001. A burgeoning literature on a variety of fronts A scholar interested in the topic of drugs and crime has much to read. Some of theclassics of the field include Terry andPellens's The Opium Problem (1928); early papers on drug taking and sociopathy byKolb and Pescor, who were two of theearly clinical leaders in research at thefacility that ultimately became the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA's) Intra-mural Research Program and and work Dunhamand Lindesmith, whose surprisingly con-temporary remarks and observations start-ed to systematize some of the field'sresearch questions on the social psycholo-gy of the drugs-crime relationship. Manyof the issues that confront the drugs-crimeresearcher today were articulated by Terryand Dunham,1939), Lindesmith (1938), and their con-temporaries in the first half of the 20thcentury.At the Intersection of Public Health and Criminal Justice Researchon Drugs and Crime James C. Anthony with Valerie Forman About the Authors James C. Anthony, Ph.D., is a professor in the Department of Mental Hygiene at Johns Hopkins University. Valerie Forman is a National Institute of Mental Health predoctoral fellow with the Psychiatric Epidemiology Training Program at Johns Hopkins University.12SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 These issues were re-articulated and a new set of themes was clarified in subse-quent research, such as The Road to H investigations led by Chein (1964), thework of Preble and Casey as described in\"Taking Care of Business\u2014The HeroinUser's Life on the Street\" (1969), Cohen'sDelinquent Boys (1955), and Robins' De- viant Children Grown Up (1966). Two of the most important emerging themesfrom this research offer a challenge toconventional thinking about the drugs-crime relationship: There is no single drugs-crime relation-ship. Rather, there are drugs-crime rela-tionships, most of which are complexrather than simple. There is no simple solution to the com-plex challenges faced when drugs-crimerelationships come into play. By way of illustration, Brownstein and Goldstein offered and refined a tripartiteconceptualization of drugs-crime relation-ships, which serves as a useful guide tosome of the surrounding issues. Withinthis tripartite framework, one set of crimi-nal offenses is described as psychophar-macologically induced (e.g., responses tointoxication states after drug taking). Asecond set of offenses is described aseconomic-compulsive in nature (e.g.,instrumental income-producing criminalacts as needed to stave off symptoms ofwithdrawal states that appear once druguse has stopped). A third set of offensesis described as \"systemic\" and might beunderstood best as a consequence of adrug user entering or living within a socialcontext in which extraordinary drug use isjust one of a set of often intercorrelatedcriminal behaviors. That is, we do notneed an appeal to drug intoxication, drugwithdrawal states, or drug-induced com-pulsive behavior to account for offensesobserved in this third category (Goldstein,1985; Brownstein and Goldstein, 1990).The tripartite framework clarifies three separate types of drugs-crime relation-ships, none of which is simple. As foranalysis of simple solutions for these com-plex problems, a therapeutically orienteddrug maintenance program might reducethe economic-compulsive type of offend-ing without influencing the occurrence ofcrimes determined by poor judgment orother manifestations of intoxication states.A successful supply-side drug eradicationprogram might reduce both pharmacologi-cal and economic-compulsive types ofoffending, but not offending of the sys-temic variety. Imprisonment of the druguser within a drug-free prison environmentmight extinguish today's crimes but mightnot influence tomorrow's offending whenthe prisoner is released back to the homecommunity. Even if the prisoner remainsdrug free during the immediate postre-lease period, the history of incarcerationand a criminal record might constrain jobopportunities and economic success tothe point of inducing crimes that other-wise would not have been committed ifthe drug user never had been incarceratedin the first place. Illuminated in this manner, the facets of multiple drugs-crime relationships be-come more clear; new opportunities forresearch open up. As these opportunitieshave been recognized, there has been atremendous growth in scholarship andresearch activity on the topic of drugs andcrime (see exhibit 1). Scholars may benefit from an assembled listing or bibliography of this literature,now available in electronic form as a tech-nical report from the Electronic Collabora-tory for Investigations about Drugs atJohns Hopkins University (Forman, 2001).Readers interested in a recent compre-hensive review of these publications canturn to the Harrison and Backenheimer-edited issue of Substance Use & Misuse on the drugs-crime nexus in the United The tripartite framework clarifies three separate types of drugs-crime relationships, none of which is simple.13TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY States, which was published by Stanley Einstein and Marcel Decker, Inc., in 1998. A conceptual framework for drugs-crime research Confronting the accumulated body of evidence and new literature, we haveattempted to sort each element of evi-dence in relation to a conceptual frame-work originally devised for the field ofpsychiatric epidemiology and epidemiolog-ical research in general (Anthony and VanEtten, 1998). This conceptual frameworkis used as we train public health scientistsfor advanced research on drug depend-ence and related conditions. The frame-work may prove to be useful in the domainof criminal justice research as well, per-haps with suitable amendments by inter-ested teachers and scholars.The rubrics. Early in their public health research training, we ask our predoctoraland postdoctoral fellows to master the epi-demiology of drug dependence. Here, drugdependence is defined as a syndrome or\"running together\" of clinical features, andsometimes is called drug addiction, espe-cially when the focus is on such clinicalfeatures as obsession-like cravings andcompulsion-like repetitive behaviors inwhich drug taking is central. The clinicalfeatures of the drug dependence syn-drome include pharmacological tolerance,characteristic withdrawal signs and symp-toms, almost obsessional thinking aboutdrugs and drug-related behavior, and otherobservable mental, behavioral, and socialadaptational manifestations of neuroadap-tational processes that get started andprogress with repeated drug taking. 1975 19761977 19781979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985Number of citations Year16 141210 8642 0 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000Exhibit 1. Number of Medline citations for \"drugs & crime\" as of March 200114SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 This epidemiology of drug dependence is a subject matter to be mastered by thepublic health research fellows, just as theymaster the concepts, principles, and tech-niques used as methodological tools in thepublic health sciences. Mastery of thissubject matter begins with study of thejust-mentioned clinical features, the histo-ry of diagnostic criteria or case definitionsused in public health research on drugdependence, and what has been learnedabout its neuroadaptational and geneticsubstrates. In the process, research fel-lows learn of patterned variation in drugdependence syndromes, some of whichcan be understood in relation to the phar-macology and pharmacokinetics of differ-ent drugs, such as cocaine versus heroinor methamphetamine versus oxycodone.Research fellows also learn about differentmeasurement techniques used in labora-tory, clinical, and field studies of the drugdependence syndromes. For example,under certain conditions, an appropriatedose of a narcotic antagonist can be usedas a bioassay to check for the presence ofdependence on heroin or other opioiddrugs (e.g., via precipitated withdrawal).Nonetheless, in general, the measure-ments of drug dependence rely heavily onself-report information obtained underspecially protected confidential circum- stances. To the extent that subjectivelyfelt experiences such as \"craving\" andobsessional thinking about drugs are cen-tral clinical features for drug dependence,we cannot substitute human urine, saliva,or sweat samples for self-reports (Anthony,Neumark, and Van Etten, 2000). Once issues of definition and measure- ment have been mastered, research fellows move on to what we call the\"rubrics\" of epidemiology\u2014its main sub-headings and associated research ques-tions. These main rubrics and primaryassociated research questions are dis-played in exhibit 2. Successful research fellows learn these rubrics and use them to master not onlythe state of currently available evidenceon each form of the drug dependence syn-drome, but also the current gaps in evi-dence and the research concepts andtools needed to fill the gaps in evidence. The relationship of each rubric to an asso- ciated set of research concepts and toolssometimes helps to clarify and differenti-ate the rubrics. Links between each rubricand corresponding research concepts andtools are presented in exhibit 3. Exhibit 2. The rubrics of epidemiology Main rubrics Primary associated research questions Quantity How many in the population are becoming affected, have become affected, and are now affected? Location Where in the population are affected individuals more or less likely to be found, with variation in occurrence and frequency differentiated by characteristics of time, place, and person? Causes What accounts for some individuals becoming becoming affected whereas others are not? Mechanisms What are the underlying liked sequences of events and processes that account for the occurrence and for the persistence of the condition? Prevention and control What can be done to prevent occurrence of the condition, shorten its duration, or ameliorate its circumstances?15TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Quantity. Under the rubric of quantity, the main associated research question isHow many in the population are becomingaffected, have become affected, and arenow affected?\" In this context, \"becom-ing affected\" can refer to becoming a druguser, developing drug dependence, initiat-ing criminal behavior, or some combinationthereof (e.g., see Kosterman et al., 2000; Golub andJohnson, 2001a). As reflected in the published scientific literature and technical reports made available by NIJ, the Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration, and other Federal agencies, a substantialfraction of the Nation's research expendi-tures on drugs and crime is directed to-ward the \"report card\" function of publichealth and criminal justice research underthe rubric of quantity. A recent NationalResearch Council report (Manski et al.,2001) tallied more than 60 Federal agen-cies with data systems designed to keeptrack of estimates on the number ofdrug users in households, among school-attending youths, among arrestees, amongpatients seen in emergency rooms, and invarious other segments of American life.Exhibit 3.

Onthe U.S. Department of Justice side, wehave other ambitious survey operations,such as the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitor-ing (ADAM) program (formerly Drug UseForecasting [DUF]), which monitors drugtaking among arrestees through both self-reports and bioassay techniques, and theNational Crime Victimization Survey. Evaluated as part of the public health and criminal justice research enterprise, thesesubstantial efforts may be understoodbest as examples of surveillance opera-tions. The label \"surveillance\" does nottrivialize the important work of the profes-sionals and scientists whose daily labors,year in and year out, yield the hard-wonsurveillance data. In fact, many of ourcountry's surveillance operations in thisdomain of inquiry truly are gems and tendto be regarded as the best of the best inthe world. In some respects, they are theenvy of the world. Nonetheless, by defini-tion, surveillance activities are designedwith timeliness and practicality in mind,sometimes with deliberate decisions tosacrifice validity of measurement in favorof enhanced survey response rates. For example, NHSDA, MTF , and the CDC survey all use self-report methods tomeasure drug-taking and crime-relatedbehavior (e.g., weapon carrying). Theoption of bioassays to confirm self-reportdata now is regarded as impractical or too costly for surveys on a mass populationscale, and there has been concern ex-pressed that bioassays might reduce sur-vey participation rates below acceptablevalues. NIDA is engaging in survey re-search experimentation with bioassays tocomplement self-report data to assesspractical questions of this type. In themeantime, serious concerns have beenexpressed about the capacities of thesedata systems to provide evidence for poli-cy evaluation (see, e.g., Manski et al.,2001). Nevertheless, evaluated from thestandpoint of original plans for the data,these criticisms are somewhat imperti-nent as surveillance indicators. The criticisms are asking the surveillance operations to do far more than they origi-nally were designed to offer. The first rubric of epidemiology also en- compasses studies of birth cohorts thatare intended to estimate risks of adversity,plot trajectories of normative develop-ment, or quantify important populationcharacteristics such as rates of officiallyrecognized offending. The concept of acohort study is familiar to criminal justiceresearchers and public health scientistsalike. Prominent examples in the criminaljustice research arena include Robins'classic nonconcurrent cohort study of chil-dren seen by child guidance workers inthe early 20th century (1966), and thework of Tracy, Wolfgang, and Figlio enti-tled Delinquency Careers in Two Birth Cohorts (1990). The fact that the rubric of quantity is men- tioned first does not mean that researchunder this rubric is easy or a methodologi-cal snap. Not at all. From the standpoint ofdata gathering, those of us who haverecruited, trained, and supervised teamsof 60 or more field worker-interviewersand quality control staff for data entry,documentation, and management canappreciate the operational challenges insurveillance work. From a statistical 17TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY vantage point, the nature of the surveil- lance operations often includes interde-pendent observations within samples (e.g.,sampled students within samples ofschools; sampled household residentswithin neighborhoods; multiple respon-dents within sampled households, emer-gency rooms, or criminal justice facilities).These interdependencies motivate solu-tions that call on the calculus (e.g., inTaylor series linearization for variance esti- mation). In some estimation applications,there is a need for Bayesian statistics notyet taught widely in graduate researchtraining programs. As to the importance of these \"counting\" operations, we may turn to a recent re-search contribution by Cohen, who incor-porated values from these surveillanceoperations in his attempt to estimate themonetary value of rescuing a high-riskyouth from a life of delinquency, crime,and other socially maladaptive behavior(1998). To complete this work, Cohen hadto turn to an array of previous results fromcounting operations that ranged from theNational Institute of Mental Health Epide-miologic Catchment Area surveys we con-ducted in Baltimore during the early 1980swith colleagues at four other university-based sites to work that Blumstein and hisgroup completed to estimate basic param-eters of criminal justice research, e.g., anestimated 6 percent of all boys accountfor more than half of all arrests (Blumsteinet al., 1986). There can be little doubt that investigators in the drugs-crime arena should be interest-ed in Cohen's conclusions about varyingprogrammatic investments and the mone-tary returns from programs to intervenewith high-risk youths. Nevertheless, it issomewhat startling to know that Cohenhad to turn back to counting evidence gathered in the early 1980s and before toproduce estimates to be used for policyand programmatic decisions almost twodecades later. These quantitative estimatesare not Avogadro's number; rather, they are values expected to change over time, if notfrom place to place. If we value probingquantitative criminological research exem-plified by Cohen's work, then we mustensure that the drugs-crime research agen-da includes periodic repetition of surveys toyield the required estimates. Studying the accumulated evidence on the drugs-crime relationship, we have beenable to sort much of it into the rubric ofquantity. Quite clearly, NIJ and NIDA nowmake a considerable investment in thebasic counting tasks required to estimateand quantify such parameters as howmany adult arrestees and juvenile offend-ers are taking drugs each year. Each repe-tition of these surveillance operationsprovides evidence on variation in the esti-mates from time to time and from place toplace. The study of this type of variationfalls under the second rubric, which iscalled location. Location. Our second rubric is location, and the main associated research ques-tion is \"Where in the population are affect-ed individuals more or less likely to befound, with variation in occurrence and fre-quency differentiated by characteristics oftime, place, and person?\" On occasion,work under this rubric is guided by theory,but more often the research has a moredescriptive character. James et al. (2002) provide an illustration of the nature of research and evidenceabout location. The research team setout to plot geographic variation in theoccurrence of drug purchase opportunitiesexperienced by young adults in the UnitedStates. In this figure, a \"drug purchaseopportunity,\" a special form of drug-related crime opportunity, is measuredby a survey response to a standardizedassessment in interviews conducted forNHSDA. As depicted in exhibit 4, and sub-stantiated with a univariate responseregression model for description, there is18SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 variation in the occurrence of these drug purchase opportunities across locationalregions of the country and for young menversus young women. In this context, thestatistical methods are not intended toprobe the causes of the observed variationfrom place to place, nor the observedmale-female differences. Rather, themethods are used simply to help quantifythe uncertainty in the survey-based esti-mates and substantiate the presence ofvariation from place to place and the male-female differences (James et al., 2002). This illustration is useful because it re- minds us that location refers not only togeographic variation but also to variation inrelation to individual-level characteristics (e.g., sex, age, socioeconomic status, eth-nicity). For example, Fendrich et al. (1995)studied juvenile and older murderers tounderstand varying degrees of drug in-volvement in murder. Locational researchalso plots temporal changes, as illustratedin a recent NIJ report on the possibility ofnew marijuana epidemics, to be describedbelow (Golub and Johnson, 2001b). Estimates of the consistency of associa- tion between drug use and various arrestand criminal behavior types also serve toillustrate analyses focused on locationwithin population experience: Crime wasfound to be more common among drugExhibit 4.

As Harrison and Gfroerer (1992) make clearin their NHSDA analyses on this topic, theresearch questions they were trying toanswer concerned the number of drugusers, the number of individuals engagedin criminal behavior, and the overlap inthese numbers. With respect to location,their work clarified the proportion of drugusers who were engaged in criminal be-havior and the prevalence of criminalbehavior in relation to drug use. As is truein the work of James et al., these investi-gators did not draw on the apparatus ofcausal inference, matching, or other scien-tific maneuvers to disentangle whetherthe criminal behavior was a response tothe drug use or vice versa. Nonetheless,taking a step beyond studies of officiallyrecognized crimes, arrestees, and convict-ed criminals, Harrison and Gfroerer helpedconfirm links between drugs and criminalbehavior, but they did not seek to producedefinitive evidence about the causes ofdrug use or criminal behavior. Much of our current research enterprise at the interface of drugs and crime has thistype of descriptive character. SubstantialHHS investments in the MTF study andNHSDA already have been mentioned.On the NIJ side, we call on ADAM to helpclarify variation in the occurrence of druguse among arrestees across multiple juris-dictions, not only in the United States butalso overseas. For the most part, we donot require these investments to yielddefinitive evidence that might be centralin causal inference. Nonetheless, the evi-dence from these studies helps to de-scribe the location of drug taking, criminalbehavior, and the intersections of thesebehaviors, and sometimes to describe orpredict the co-occurring and separate pat-terns of drug use and criminal behavior. Analyses conducted under this rubric with- out a special push toward causal inferencecan be especially important in identifyinghot spots within geocoded areas as wellas health disparities that might differential- ly fall on one or another racial or ethnicminority group. Here, it is a predictive aswell as a descriptive purpose that can beachieved. However, when the task is topredict and not to explain, there is no spe-cial calling for the methods required forfirm causal inferences, as depicted inexhibit 3. Within the drugs-crime arena, there are many different examples of surveillanceoperations under the rubric of location,such as we can see in recent work byGolub and Johnson (2001b) in which theyused DUF/ADAM data as evidence toadvance their claims about a new and pos-sibly expanding epidemic of marijuana usein the United States. True to the descrip-tive character of locational research, Goluband Johnson present evidence of the newand possibly expanding epidemic amongoffenders in some areas (e.g., Atlanta) andevidence of no epidemic in other areas(e.g., Miami), but they do not seek toexplain why there should be an epidemicin one place but not in another. Becausethese data are from incarcerated individu-als, an important set of complications aris-es in their interpretation. One suspectsthat the observed time trends and varia-tion from place to place might reflect oper-ations of local police departments asmuch or more than it reflects any underly-ing change in the dynamics of marijuanaepidemiology. This rubric of location also encompasses studies in which the investigators may bestriving toward causal explanation, butthey fall short, often demonstrated in ashift toward the language of \"prediction\"and away from the language of \"explana-tion.\" Two different hypothetical conclud-ing statements can illustrate this point.When the research team falls short of itsgoal, the researchers may summarize theirwork by saying something like \"Based onthis study's evidence, the level of druguse in early adolescence predicted later20SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 delinquency and criminal behavior in the young adult years.\" A different verb isselected for the alternative, stronger formof concluding statement: \"Based on thisstudy's evidence, the levels of delinquen-cy and criminal behavior in the young adultyears depend on levels of drug use inearly adolescence.\" As the focus shifts from description or prediction toward explanation and causalinference, we move from the rubric oflocation to the third rubric of causes. Theshift in focus calls into play a new set ofresearch concepts, principles, and tools,as outlined in exhibit 3. Many scholars will appreciate that a single study may contribute evidence under sev-eral rubrics at once. For example, the peri-odic reports of NHSDA, MTF , and ADAMroutinely present evidence that falls underthe rubric of quantity as well as the rubricof location. Rarely, the authors of thesereports seek to make causal inferencesfrom their surveillance data. The yield of a study often is not clear at the outset or in the stages of study plan-ning, and the study orientation to theory isnot always a discriminating feature. Sometheory-based studies have started as in-vestigations of causes but have ended upmaking contributions solely in the domainsof prediction and description. Other atheo-retic studies end up making useful contri-butions in our studies of cause. Considerthe first conclusive study on the topic ofage-related risk of Down syndrome (DS)and associated mental retardation, com-pleted some 50 years ago. The investiga-tors sought to plot the risk of DS by theage of the mother at the time of delivery.An exponential increase in risk after age40 was clear in the first graphs. We still donot know what causes the chromosomaltrisomies that give rise to DS, nor do weknow why these trisomies and DS aremore common when older mothers givebirth. But even in the absence of firmcausal theory and evidence, it has been possible to reduce the occurrence of DSin human populations by encouragingmothers to bear their children before age40. Hence, a strictly descriptive study pro-voked an effective intervention to reducethe occurrence of an important geneticcondition. It is regrettable that our studies of dispari- ties affecting racially and ethnically definedsubgroups of the American populationgenerally fall under the rubric of location,as do our studies of the changing dynam-ics of household and family compositionin the United States. For example, wenow can say with some certainty thatAfrican-American males experience ratesof arrest, prosecution, and incarcerationfor drug possession offenses that cannotbe explained by their rates of drug taking,but we do not have good evidence onthe causes of this racial disparity. Initialinquiries suggest differential law enforce-ment and judicial practices, which some-times encompass racial profiling, butrigorous scientific evidence on these practices is scarce. With respect to the dynamics of house- hold and family composition, the phenom-ena of youthful drug taking and relatedcriminal offending have links back to thefamilies of origin, now often characterizedby absence or infrequent appearance ofthe father in many of our populationgroups. This is not to say that female-headed households are homogeneous oruniformly deleterious with respect tosocially maladaptive behavior of youngpeople. It would be a mistake to presumethat the traditional mother-father house-hold always and in all contexts is moreprotective than a female-headed house-hold with respect to the risk of youthfuldrug taking or delinquent behavior (e.g.,see Chilcoat, 1992). Mothers often mobilize family resources or draw onassets that in some measure may helpcompensate for absent fathers (e.g., by The yield of a study often is not clear at the outset or in the stages of study planning.21TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY involving grandparents, neighbors, church groups), as described by Kellam, Ensminger,and Turner (1977), Pearson et al. (1990),and others. A research agenda on race, ethnicity, and family or household composition can bemotivated by an awareness that thedrugs-crime relationships will depend tosome extent on demographic trends.Against the backdrop of demographictrends such as these, including an in-creased prominence of Hispanic childrenand families in the United States, it will beimportant to sustain the research agendain the domain of locational variations ofthis type. Important steps in this directionhave been taken in the Federal agenciesresponsible for surveillance of drug-relatedbehaviors, including increased attention tomeasurement of ethnic self-identification(e.g., with respect to Cuban origin, PuertoRican origin, and other subgroups of theHispanic population; with respect toChinese origin, Samoan origin, and othersubgroups within the Asian-Pacific Is-lander category). Similar attention is re-quired in criminal justice research such asADAM and I-ADAM (International ADAM)and in administrative statistics compiledon operations of the criminal justice sys-tem in this country. Whereas the human genome project is challenging conventional views about\"race\" as a scientific concept, studies onself-identified race-ethnicity will have asustained importance in the NIJ-NIDAresearch agenda on the topic of drugsand crime. This evaluation of importance can be grounded in an awareness of the demo-graphic trends described above, but it alsodraws on an appreciation of what studiesof self-identified race-ethnicity may teachus about the influence of cultural contextsand socially learned behaviors with respectto drug taking and criminal behavior.Finally, a note on ethnographic studies should be added here. In general, thesample size and \"sample space\" charac-teristics of these studies do not makeethnography an especially fertile disciplinewith respect to the first rubric of quantity,except when the characteristic understudy has extremely limited dispersion.For anyone who looks to ethnographicstudies for quantitative values, there oftenare some unanswerable questions aboutgeneralizability and precision of the studyestimates. In some respects, ethnographymight be characterized as a search for theboundaries of no variation in a sociallyshared human characteristic. This is not to say that ethnography is bar- ren when it comes to quantitative data.Tothe contrary, the small scale of ethno- graphic research makes it possible forethnographers to shift directions morequickly than is possible in ordinary surveil-lance operations. As a result, ethnographicfield workers helped in the early identifica-tion of crack cocaine, methamphetamine,and oxycodone outbreaks\u2014years beforethese outbreaks could be identified inlarge-sample surveillance data. Under the rubric of location, ethnographic field workers were among the first to noteinner-city adolescents whose drug takingstarted with marijuana rather than with themore normative experiences with alcoholand tobacco. They also were the first tocharacterize a growing use of \"blunts\"\u2014tobacco cigars hollowed out and filled withmarijuana for a combined tobacco-marijuanaintoxication (Golub and Johnson, 1999). Ina recent round of observations, there is asuggestion that for some youths, the typi-cal \"gateway\" drugs have been skipped\u2014an example of subgroup variation in themore typical developmental sequencesrunning through alcohol, tobacco, and mar-ijuana to drugs such as heroin, stimulants,and hallucinogens. Large-sample epidemi-ological surveillance data now seem to22SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 confirm the initial ethnographic observa- tions on this topic (e.g., see Golub andJohnson, 1999; Golub and Johnson,2001a). One of the reasons ethnographic research is important under the rubric of location isthat it can open our eyes to new concep-tions of time, place, and personal charac-teristics that impinge on the drugs-crimerelationship. These ethnographic studiesare especially useful in descriptions of thecultural context and socially learned be-haviors described above. Their evidencecan add depth and insight to otherwisesuperficially understood intersections ofdrug taking and criminal behavior. Causes. The third rubric of epidemiology pertains to the study of causes and drawson the research apparatus required forcausal inference (exhibit 2). On occasion,this research apparatus can be quite sim-ple in concept. For example, a relativelysmall sample of monozygotic (MZ) twinsdiscordant for an important outcome issufficient to provide definitive evidenceabout environment with respect to thecauses of that outcome. These MZ twinsare genetically matched: If they are discor-dant for outcome, one may look for gene-environment interactions, but more oftenone looks for differences monochorionic sacs), the time of delivery), or in laterdevelopment (e.g., head trauma for onetwin but not the other during infancy orchildhood). The National Institutes ofHealth (NIH) investment in recent twinresearch to estimate heritability of differ-ent forms of drug use now generally ispaying off in two ways: Each study is indicating at least somedegree of heritability of drug depend-ence, and sometimes heritability of druguse, especially legal drug use (e.g.,tobacco).Each study is indicating ample room forgene-environment interaction or forinfluence of environmental conditionsand processes. These results from causal research help substantiate a case for a future researchagenda on the genetic sources of variationand on environmental modulation of thesegenetic sources of variation. Randomized trials with relatively simple structure also can be used to probe causalhypotheses with definitive results. Forexample, these trials may offer our bestavenues toward definitive evidence onwhether cessation of illegal drug use is fol-lowed by reductions or elimination in crim-inal behavior. An alternative is to nest thestudy of causes within a more expandedagenda of systems research on drugs-crime relationships (Manski et al., 2001).To the extent that systems research entails a finely detailed specification ofmechanisms that link events and process-es within a system, this type of researchfalls more clearly under the rubric of mech-anisms, as described below. Outside of the simplicity of research on discordant MZ twins and randomized con-trolled trials, a complex apparatus of studydesign and statistical method is requiredto extract definitive evidence in researchon drugs-crime relationships. Given theimportance of inferences about causes inthe drugs-crime relationship, it may beunderstandable that graduate researchtraining programs have become increas-ingly methodological in their orientations. It may be appropriate to discuss the po- tential contribution of ethnographic re-search in relation to the causes of thedrugs-crime relationship. To date, mostethnographic research on drugs and crimehas been descriptive in character. It hasprovided leads for more probing causalinvestigations, but it has not produceddefinitive evidence on the links between To date, most ethnographic research on drugs and crime has been descriptive in character.23TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY drugs and crime. In this respect, ethno- graphy's contribution may be most impor-tant under the rubric of location. Beforeanyone could mobilize large-sample sur-veillance operations to study the newdrugs-crime phenomena connected withcrack cocaine (e.g., crack and prostitution),it was possible for ethnographers to movein and make headway. To some extent,ethnographers have been pioneers inresearch on methamphetamine and clubdrugs such as MDMA (Ecstasy), and wecan expect more of the same in relation toour first new drugs-crime outbreaks of the21st century, which involve sustainedrelease oxycodone. An NIJ-NIDA investment in ethnographic research on drugs-crime relationships ofthis type will continue to be important\u2014ifonly to help us begin to understand theunusually circumscribed geographic distri-butions of methamphetamine and oxy-codone use in the United States and thepatterns of criminal behavior associatedwith use of these drugs. Ethnography canbe used to produce a catalog of causalexplanations for methamphetamine'semergence as a threat to public healthand public safety in rural sectors of theAmerican Midwest and for oxycodone'semergence in small cities and towns ofthe Appalachian mountain range, especial-ly from West Virginia southward. It is notclear that ethnography or any other scien-tific field will be capable of producingdefinitive evidence about specific explana-tions in this catalog of causes. Nonethe-less, there is value and importance in theattempt to do so, and ethnographers canbring rigor and scientific discipline to thisprocess of investigating these causes. Thealternative seems to be to leave theseinvestigations to the field of journalism. Mechanisms. Within epidemiology gener- ally, mechanisms refer to linkages ofstates and processes that lead towardexpressions in clinical features of healthand illness or disease. As applied to thedrugs-crime relationship, one might ask about the mechanisms of linked statesand processes leading to or away from anassociation between illegal drug use andcriminal behavior. For an illustration of these mechanisms, one may turn to the coercive process anddeviancy training models introduced inthe work of Patterson and Dishion. TheirOregon Boys study has provided longitudi-nal evidence on what surely must be cen-tral linkages in the mechanisms underlyingdrugs-crime relationships (e.g., see Patter-son, Dishion, and Yoerger 2000). For exam-ple, studying these school-based samplesof boys through ages 17-18, and usingstandardized coding of a 30-minute freediscussion-interaction between bestfriends, they found substantial over-timecorrelation of deviant friendship process(e.g., duration of rule-breaking talk boutsas coded from videotape). Dishion alsohas reported on a link from initial druguse to increased affiliation with deviantpeers and onward to initiation of criminalbehavior that is more consistent with thedelinquency-to-drugs link that emerged inthe longitudinal research of Johnston andcolleagues based on MTF analyses pub-lished more than 20 years ago (Dishionet al., 1996; Johnston, O'Malley, andEveland, 1978), as well as on more recentstudies (e.g., Elliott and Huizinga, 1989). The use of multiwave longitudinal study designs to probe into suspected causalmechanisms is well known in both publichealth and criminal justice research circles.The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and MentalHealth Administration (the precursor toSAMHSA), and more recently NIH andOJJDP have maintained support for aseries of important longitudinal studiesover the years (e.g., see the work ofJessor and Jessor, Kellam and Ensminger,Block and Block, McCord, Bachman, Kandel,Robins, Elliott and Huizinga, Hawkins andCatalano, and many other studies of thistype, as listed in compendiums such as24SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Verdonik and Sherrod, 1984). Advantages of long-term investment in these longitudi-nal studies can be seen in the researcharticles from many of the research proj-ects with multiwave assessments, forexample, the Pittsburgh Youth Study (e.g.,Loeber et al., 1998), the Denver YouthStudy, and the Rochester Youth Develop-ment Study (Loeber et al., 1999); andthe research groups led by the Brooks,Newcomb, and Bentler (e.g., see Brook etal., 1996, Brook et al., 2000; Newcomband Bentler, 1988; Newcomb 1992). One of the questions in the design of an agenda for future research on drugs andcrime is how the evidence from large- andmedium-sized samples from longitudinalstudies of this type might be linked withevidence from the generally much smallerintensive studies of cases. Until there isconsensus about effective interventions todisrupt the drugs-crime relationship, possi-bilities for a linkage exist through the con-cept of natural history. In the history of medicine and medical research, the first natural historians of dis-ease were clinicians and clinically orientedobservers who made careful observationsat the bedside of patients, in the absenceof effective interventions. They watched,measured as best they could (e.g., bodytemperature), and described change inrelation to the passage of time from thefirst recognition of clinical features. Withinthe realm of drugs and crime research,ethnographers and social scientists gener-ally have taken over the responsibilities ofcareful clinical observers in relation to ille-gal drug use and criminal behavior. Duringthe last 50 years, thanks to the work ofRobins (1966), Winick (1962), Preble andCasey (1969), (Nurco al., 1975, 1996; Nurco,1998), and their successors, we havelearned much about the natural history ofdrug use, drug dependence, and associat-ed criminal behavior through ethnographicand social science research. The natural history of a disease proves to be an important element under the rubricof mechanisms. In the past, a careful de-scription of a disease's natural historyoften has guided investigators towardunderlying causal mechanisms. In the years before effective drug treat- ments, Winick and others drew attentionto the maturing out process for drug ad-dicts, and there is a parallel literature onmaturing out with respect to criminal be-havior in general (Winick, 1963). Thematuring out process continues to be animportant locus for new research on thedrugs-crime relationship. Other clues about causal mechanisms are being produced in observational and longi-tudinal studies of individual cases or fami-lies characterized by some feature of thedrugs-crime relationship. For example, wehave Dunlap's intensive studies of familiesin which one of the members is a crackcocaine dealer (Dunlap and Johnson, 1996;Dunlap, Johnson, and Manwar, 1994); re-search such as Spunt's study of adoles-cent offenders with a history of violentcrime (Spunt et al., 1990), Longshore'slinkage of DUF and California Bureau ofCriminal Statistics data (Longshore 2000),and the related studies (1987); andinvestigations led by Inciardi, Johnson,and 1994, 1995). Several interesting elaborations of these intensive case studies have developedin the realm of criminal justice research.For example, Logan (2001) has addedbioassays for metabolites of the neuro-transmitter serotonin as well as testos-terone assays as part of his intensivefollowup studies of crack users. Thisexample serves to illustrate a potential25TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY intersection of public health and criminal justice research that should be explored inmore depth as we work through a futureagenda for research on drugs and crime. A conceptual shuttling back and forth between these intensive smaller samplestudies and the generally larger samplelongitudinal studies would seem to haveadvantages for investigators who work inone or another of these arenas, and thereare a few investigators who conduct bothtypes of studies Dishion andLoeber, 1985; bridgework between the microsocialand ethnographic research traditions andlarge-scale longitudinal sample researchdeserves to be a deliberate focal point onthe future drugs-crime research agenda.This focal point is important because thestudy of causal mechanisms and process-es can draw attention to potentially vulner-able links where new interventions mightbe directed. In epidemiology generally, the focus of research on causal mechanisms is shiftingto genes and encoded gene products, asdisplayed in our most recently emergingsubspecialties of genetic epidemiologyand molecular epidemiology. To someextent, Elliott has a head start in a poten-tial cross-fertilization between criminal jus-tice research, genetic epidemiology, andmolecular epidemiology. He already hasintroduced harvesting of DNA samples inthe context of his national longitudinalstudy (Elliott, 2001). Opportunities forcase-control studies and other geneticallyinformative designs, including wholegenome scans nested in a case-cohortstudy design, will become possible as thisresearch evolves. Eventually, this type ofwork should lead us toward more defini-tive evidence on causal mechanismsunderlying the drugs-crime relationship,including gene-environment interactions.It is possible to make a forecast of likely integrations of genetic research, cognitivesciences, and the more traditional disci-plines of behavioral and social sciences fora future agenda for NIJ and NIDA researchon drugs-crime relationships. For example,exhibits 5-7 represent an elaboration ofconceptual models our research group hasdeveloped as an aid to our study of transi-tions from drug use to drug dependence.Exhibit 5 expresses a suspected causalinfluence of drug use on criminal behavior.It also expresses a separate influence ofdrug dependence on criminal behavior.These two specifications are consistentwith the Goldstein-Brownstein distinctionsbetween drug-related crimes that mightarise from acute drug intoxication statesversus crimes that are rooted in the eco-nomic-compulsive behavior of an individ-ual who suffers withdrawal states as aresult of sustained drug use and neuroad-aptation. There are many law-abiding drugdependent individuals who do not commitcrimes, even when they are suffering fromwithdrawal pains. Hence, exhibit 5 in-cludes a speculative causal pathway thatruns directly from withdrawal to the occur-rence of criminal behavior, over and abovethe separately specified role of the drugdependence syndrome for which with-drawal serves as a manifest indicator. We speculate that an individual's genome can contribute to the drugs-crime relation-ship in different ways. Exhibit 5 concen-trates on a possibility that some geneticpolymorphisms or mutations may be inter-correlated manifestations of an underlyingdiathesis or vulnerability to make the tran-sition into drug dependence from a stateof nondependent drug taking, as reflectedin pathway 1. It also specifies a possibilitythat a specific polymorphism (or mutation)has an additional influence on this transi-tion, as reflected in pathway 2. As indi-cated by pathway 3, we may hope fordevelopment of effective intervention26SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 techniques that can disrupt what other- wise might be an expression of the diathe-sis. If effective, these interventions willslow or disrupt the natural history of drugdependence at a step in the process thatlinks nondependent drug taking and thesubsequent transition into drug depend-ence. This effect of intervention, by itself,may be sufficient to alter the drugs-crimerelationships depicted to the right of theexhibit. The potential role of the cognitive sci- ences is expressed in the intermediatepathways that link nondependent drug tak-ing and drug dependence to later criminalbehavior. Here, aggression may be con-ceptualized in a generic sense as rowdymisbehavior or social maladaptation sec- ondary to drug taking, which can occurwith or without criminal behavior. Execu-tive dysfunction refers to impairments inthe cognitive processes that subservehuman capacity to plan, direct, and controlone's future behavior within adaptationalboundaries and may encompass moregeneralized planning behavior (e.g., seeTolman, Edleson, and Fendrich, 1996). As depicted in exhibit 5, during states of acute drug intoxication, there may be arelease of aggressive behavior and a disruption of regulatory executive func-tions. As levels of drug dependence in-crease, levels of aggressive behaviorcan change in an upward or downwardExhibit 5.

The complexity of interrelation-ships between aggression and executivedysfunction is reflected in the reciprocalcausal paths between these two con-structs. Increased executive dysfunctiontranslates as inept decisionmaking aboutaggression and the subjective utility func-tions that govern decisions about whetherto commit a crime. As part of generallyadaptive fight-flight responses and modula-tion of monoamine neurotransmitter signaling pathways during bouts of aggres-sion, there can be a cascade of executivedysfunctions: Mere rowdiness can betransformed into aggravated assault.To be sure, exhibit 5 is only a model that represents little more than an oversimpli-fied representation of the complexitiesthat link an individual's genome with cog-nition and behavior. Models by definitionare oversimplified representations. It is fairto ask whether the model requires addi-tional specifications, such as the possibili-ty that religious convictions might tend tomodulate the relationship between drugtaking and aggression or criminal behavior.In this oversimplification, exhibit 5 doesnot convey all such possibilities. Thesepossibilities for elaboration of the longitu-dinal model should help the reader under-stand some of the complexities faced in Exhibit 6.

For example, the level of drug use might produce intoxicating states that give rise to violent criminal beha vior, even when the level of drug dependence is held constant (or kept at zero levels). Here, the level of drug dependence is tapped via a measure- ment model with clinical features of drug dependence, such as loss of control and withdrawal as the manifest indicators for lev els of dependence. In this simplification, analogous measurement models for the level of drug use and the level of criminal behavior a re not drawn but may be presumed. In this depiction of the drugs-crime relationship, there is an allowance for reciprocity between levels of drug use and levels of drug dependence, once dependence begins. That is, there is not an acyclic dose-response relationship that links drug use to drug dep endence. Rather, once the drug dependence process begins after first drug taking, the dependence process becomes a determinant of later levels of drug use. Most current conceptual models do not provide for this reciprocity. This model is one that makes no allowance for the possible effect of criminal behavior on levels of drug use or dependence, but this defect is remedied in later elaborations of this model (e.g., see exhibit 7). Reproduced with permission of copyright holder James C. Anthony, 2002.28SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 observational studies of causal mecha- nisms that account for observed drugs-crime relationships. Exhibit 6 presents even more simplifica- tion to sharpen focus on the drugs-crimerelationship specifically. The geneticallybased diathesis and other covariates ofexhibit 5 are set into the background (i.e.,presumed to exist but not explicitly depict-ed). In exhibit 6, we see a readily appreci-ated reciprocity between the level of drugtaking and the level of drug dependence:(a) the more drug taking, the more we findincreased drug dependence levels, and (b)the more drug dependence, the more wefind increased levels of drug taking. Wealso see the level of criminal behavior ex-pressed as a function of levels of drug tak-ing and drug dependence, as shown inexhibit 5. An additional elaboration in-volves the longitudinality of this model.We have levels of criminal behavior at onepoint in time influencing levels of criminal behavior at future points in time, but inexhibit 6, we do not specify a link fromlevels of criminal behavior to subsequentdrug taking or drug dependence levels. Atleast in theory, and in some prior sugges-tive evidence, this omission represents apotentially important mis-specification ofour model for the drugs-crime relationship(e.g., see Johnson et al., 1995). Exhibit 7 adds a level of complexity to the model depicted in exhibit 6 and poses asubstantive question for the agenda ofaction research: \"How might an interven-tion lead to change in this system of in-terrelationships?\" We introduce thepossibility that social status (e.g., statusin the community, socioeconomic status,lawful income) depends on criminal behav-ior and also on the level of drug depend-ence, and that criminal behavior influencesthe subsequent level of drug dependence Exhibit 7.

The model depicts criminal behavior's influence on subsequent levels of drug use via differential association as well as a possi- ble influence on subsequent levels of drug dependence via changes in social status. Once the drug dependence process begins, th ere is a reciprocity, with the level of dependence influencing the level of drug use and vice versa. As in exhibit 5, the level of dru g dependence is manifest in the covariation of clinical features, such as loss of control and withdrawal signs. Reproduced with permission of copyright holder James C. Anthony, 2002.29TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY by its intermediate influence on social sta- tus. The model depicted in this exhibitalso provides for a plausible link from thelevel of drug dependence to subsequentcriminal behavior. Namely, as drug depend-ence increases and social status (e.g., lawful income) falls short, criminal behav-ior may increase (as in the Goldstein-Brownstein tripartite model). In addition,subsequent levels of drug dependencemay be influenced by the changes insocial status, either upward or downward. The model in exhibit 7 also introduces a conglomerate concept of \"assortativepeering,\" expressing a well-known truism:\"birds of a feather flock together.\" Theoccurrence of drug taking is linked to laterformation of peer group relationships, asis the occurrence of criminal behavior. Tosome extent, we can say that past druguse and past criminal behavior influencecurrent peer group affiliations, and tosome extent, we can say that past peergroup affiliations influence future drug useand future criminal behavior. These com-plexities are expressed by hypothesizedcausal paths in exhibit 7. Conceptual models of this type are in- complete representations of the causalmechanisms that lie beneath observeddrugs-crime relationships, yet they areelaborations of the Goldstein-Brownsteintripartite model. Nonetheless, most read-ers will agree that these representationsare oversimplified. If they have value, it isto highlight some future directions for thejoint NIJ-NIDA research agenda on drugs-crime relationships. We do not yet have a longitudinal research program to investigate the relatively sim-ple model of interrelationships betweenlevels of drug use, drug dependence, andcriminal behavior as depicted in exhibit 6,let alone the more complex model ofexhibit 7, with its sociological construct ofsocial status and the social-psychologicalconstruct of affiliation with behaviorallysimilar peers (assortative peering, homo- phily, etc.). Fortunately, there already isacadre of criminologists and drug re- searchers who are trained in sociologyand social psychology and can readilyincorporate the biomedical and clinicalconcepts of drug dependence into theirresearch plans, if supported to do so. It will be more difficult to forge a research agenda that integrates the genetics re-search and cognitive sciences constructsdepicted in exhibit 5. For the most part,genetics and cognitive sciences are un-known territories for most NIJ and NIDAinvestigators who have made importantcontributions in past research on thedrugs-crime relationships. For most drugs-crime researchers, it would not be difficultto integrate concepts and measurementsof aggressive behavior and the clinical syn-drome of drug dependence within theirexisting research plans. Far more difficultywill be encountered during the process ofintegrating genetics and the neuropsycho-logical and neurophysiological measure-ments of the cognitive sciences. We can learn a lot about the drugs-crime relationship simply by replicating and refin-ing important longitudinal research ondrugs-crime relationships that was initiat-ed during the second half of the 20th cen-tury. Many of these longitudinal studieshave cohorts that still are intact, and fol-lowup studies are now underway to learnmore as these cohorts mature into adoles-cence and make the transitions into youngand middle adulthood. There are moun-tains of data from 20th-century studiesthat have not yet been fully exploitedthrough careful analysis. Nonetheless, as we look forward through the next decades of research, the NIJ-NIDA agenda must go beyond what hasdeveloped as the best 20th-century re-search on the drugs-crime relationship.Tendecades from now, if we are to leave the 21st century with an enhanced There are mountains ofdata from 20th-century studiesthat have notyet been fullyexploited 03 understanding of the drugs-crime relation- ship and with a greater capacity for effec-tive action to improve public health andsafety in this domain, we cannot continueto work within the narrow paradigms andmethodologies of the traditional scientificdisciplines mastered by drugs-crime in-vestigators of the 20th century. If we aresuccessful, then in a few decades, the bio-medical, genetic, and cognitive sciencesubstrates of the drugs-crime relationshipwill no longer be a matter of mere specula-tion, as depicted in exhibits 5 and 7. Therewill be definitive evidence, solid under-standing, and effective action-plans basedon what we learn from the pioneers whomove into that now-unexplored territory. Prevention and control. The long-term value of research on causal mechanismsdepends on identifying potentially vulnera-ble linkages in the sequence of states andprocesses that lead to illegal drug use andcriminal behavior. It may go without sayingthat increasingly definitive evidence aboutcauses and causal mechanisms will helpus achieve our goals in the domain ofeffective prevention and control. None-theless, a reminder may be useful withrespect to a dynamic interrelationshipbetween etiological studies (of causes)and the emergence of effective interven-tions. As illustrated in the circumstance ofDS and maternal age, with limited evi-dence on the underlying causal mecha-nisms of DS, by manipulating maternalage we have a very effective instrumentto prevent and reduce the risk of DS. Asexplained in our original paper on therubrics of epidemiology, many effectivepublic health preventive interventionsemerged before firm knowledge aboutcauses and causal mechanisms becameavailable (Anthony and Van Etten, 1998). A related concept involves the use of randomized preventive trials to provideincreasingly definitive evidence about suspected causal relationships. Some readers of this paper will know of workthat Kellam and our Johns Hopkinsresearch team have completed, using ran-domized field trials to probe the interrela-tionship between early aggressive andrule-breaking behavior and later druginvolvement among boys (e.g., Kellam andAnthony, 1998). In essence, we decidedthat more observational research on thelink from early aggression or deviance andlater drug use would be less importantthan an experimental test. Within theframework of a randomized field trial, wetried to and succeeded in reducing aggres-sive and deviant behavior of first-gradersusing an experimental intervention as-signed at random. For the boys assignedto experimental intervention, we havefound later reduced occurrence of druginvolvement, and we have replicatedthese results in a second cohort of firstgraders (Kellam and Anthony, 1998). Morereplications along these lines are neededbefore anyone can claim that early aggres-sion or deviance is a \"cause\" of later druguse, but this experimentation illustrateshow experimental research in the domainof prevention and control can yield bene-fits in the form of improved evidence totest causal theories. This idea is not new.Hawkins, Catalano, Offord, and othershave noted it as well and Catalano, 1991; Hawkins,Catalano, and Miller, 1992; Jones andOfford, 1989). But it is an idea that often isoverlooked by investigators more interest-ed in theory testing and who orient them-selves toward goal 1, described in thispaper's first paragraph. Under the fifthrubric, we try to orient the research toserve both goal 1 and goal 2. Because elements of this rubric of pre- vention and control are being covered inthe companion papers that accompanythis working manuscript, I will closethis section more quickly than might be31TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY customary. Before doing so, I would like to mention the contributions of operationsresearch and systems research in thisdomain, which often have been neglectedin epidemiology. Over the years, thethoughtful and quantitatively sharp workof Blumstein and colleagues has contin-ued to inspire an important line of re-search on prevention and control that ispertinent to the drugs-crime relationship.Although I am not confident about all ofthe data or assumptions of the underlyinganalysis approaches, I have been especial-ly impressed by the directions taken byBlumstein colleagues Caulkins and Cohenin this regard. For example, Cohen (1998) discusses potential synergy of programs and distin-guishes the aggregate benefits of pro-grams designed to reduce crime versusthe sum of the benefits of individual programs. It is possible that no single program would help city residents feelsafe enough to derive lifestyle-relatedexpenditure benefits (e.g., walking a milethrough a rough neighborhood versus tak-ing a taxicab because of concerns aboutsafety). Combinations of programs mightdo so. This distinction ties into the con-cept of marginal costs versus averagecosts associated with drug-using anddelinquent youths or criminals, where themarginal costs exclude fear of crime andprivate security expenditures becausethese costs are largely unaffected by anyone criminal's actions. Caulkins and his colleagues developed a challenging line of systems research thatcan ultimately yield new ideas and evi-dence about policy instruments in relationto the drugs-crime relationship. The evolu-tion of this work toward selection of poli-cies and programmatic instruments atdifferent stages of a drug-taking epidemicis especially important (Caulkins, Crawford,and Reuter, 1993; Behrens et al., 1999). A selective overview of tensions faced in researchon drugs and crime Numerous tensions are faced at the in- tersection of public health and criminal justice research on the drugs-crime rela-tionship. This section identifies and de-scribes a selection of these tensions, andin some instances recommendations areoffered for NIJ and NIDA action to helpresolve the tensions. Tensions in theoretical perspectives, concept, and definition Heterogeneity at the intersections of pub- lic health and criminal justice research isnot limited to differences of opinions andjudgment about empirical observations,the inferences we can draw from theseobservations, and the uses to which weapply the observations (e.g., cost analysesof alternative programs). There are somefundamental tensions within and acrosstheoretical perspectives and also approach. The concept of scale. Ecologists work with a concept of scale that may help usunderstand some of the tensions men-tioned above and may serve as an axisof orientation as we turn to future direc-tions for research (e.g., see Brown, 1995;Wiens et al., 1986). As a concept, scaleresonates with what educational researchersand behavioral and social scientists oftenhave termed multilevel or hierarchical mod-els, as in Ennett's and the Duncans' researchwith young people nested within ecologicalniches of higher order such as classrooms,schools, or families (e.g., see Ennett et al.,1997; Duncan et al., 1997; Duncan, Duncan, and Hops, 1998) and our ownresearch group's nesting of individualdrug users and collections of drug usersin their neighborhoods of residence (e.g.,32SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Bobashev and Anthony, 1998; Petronis and Anthony, 2000). Parker and Toth(1990) also have appealed to relatedmacro versus micro concepts in theirresearch on alcohol and homicide, as havePatterson and colleagues in their researchon peer groups (Patterson, Dishion, andYoerger, 2000). Bronfenbrenner's ecologi- cal systems theory for human develop-mental research slices scale into macro,meso, and micro divisions that many in-vestigators have found useful (Bronfen-brenner, 1979, 1986). Although not with any direct reference to a formal ecological concept of scale, wecan see resonance of this concept inMarkowitz and Grossman's studies oftaxes and regulations on alcohol and theirhypothesized effects on criminal behavior(Markowitz and Grossman, 2000), theresearch of Caulkins and colleagues onnational drug policy and programmatic ini-tiatives (e.g., Behrens et al., 2001), andHolder's research on preventive interven-tions directed toward communities inthe United States (Holder 1993, 2001;Holder et al., 1999, 2000). Scale is workedoutward from the individual organism inthe direction of larger social groups, organ-izations, and geopolitical units. In publichealth and criminal justice research, weoften refer to pre-established institutionalor geopolitical boundaries (schools, cen-sus tracts, nations) when we work at higher scale. In ecology, mathematicalmodels and methods such as advancedwavelet analysis are used to allow theempirical data to inform scale\u2014as inresearch on landscape ecology (Anthonyand Bradshaw, 2001). Some tensions arise in research when investigators ignore scale in their theoreti-cal perspectives or empirical researchreports. For example, most of us workwithin a conceptual framework that leadsus to comprehend estimates of the drugs-crime relationship without reference toscale. However, one should expect thedrugs-crime relationship to be of one order of magnitude when we are investigatingindividuals who all reside in the same localarea (e.g., as in much of the ethnographicresearch on the drugs-crime nexus), a dif-ferent order of magnitude when we workwith individuals and data from multipleneighborhoods, but with matching onneighborhood in the analysis, and a dif-ferent order of magnitude when our dataare from individuals across the Nation,with no analytical attention to who livesnear whom, except perhaps during theprocess of estimating variances for confi-dence limits and standard errors (e.g., seeBobashev and Anthony, 1998). Although not clearly within the scope of the original ecological concept of scale, aninvestigator may work inward from theboundaries of the whole organism towardsubunits, ultimately leading to the signal-ing pathways between neurons, messen-ger systems originating from geneticmaterial, and the simplest proteins andthe encoding genes themselves. Thiselaboration of the concept of scale createsyet another tension, in part because theconcepts of genetics and signaling path-ways for neurotransmission are morefamiliar in the public health research com-munity but are not yet in the mainstreamof graduate or postdoctoral research train-ing in the criminal justice research com-munity. To illustrate, when I have talkedwith my criminal justice research col-leagues about Elliott's inclusion of DNAassays in the most recent waves of hisNational Youth Survey, many of them haveasked, \"Why?\" To be sure, some skepticalbehavioral genetics colleagues also haveasked, \"Why?\" but this is an instance inwhich the same verbal behavior has ori-gins in substantially different theoreticalmodels. My point is that tension can arisewhen concepts of scale are not madeexplicit. Some of the work at the intersections of public health and criminal justice research33TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY will be to make our concepts of scale ex- plicit. In some respects, this will be morereadily accomplished as we work fromthe whole organism outward, and the taskmay be more difficult as we try to inte-grate molecular biology, genetics, andneuroscience into our discussions. None-theless, this hard work will be essential aswe make a 21st-century science of drugs-crime relationships. Orienting definitions and constructs. The literature also displays considerableheterogeneity in orienting definitions andconstructs. On the public health side, thereoften has been an orientation toward druguse and drug dependence or addiction asuseful constructs in their own right. Oneorientation often has been called the\"medical model,\" but it amounts to littlemore than an analysis of empirical syn-dromes (i.e., co-occurring manifestationsof the neuroadaptational processes thatget started when drug use begins, fol-lowed by a cascade of secondary and terti-ary adaptations, some of them occurringin the domain of social adaptational rolesand responsibilities). In a later section ofthis paper, I will return to this syndromeconcept. On the criminal justice side, druguse and the drug problems associatedwith drug use often are treated as if theyare not interesting in their own right butare something akin to interchangeableobservable manifestations of somethingelse that is more fundamental, such as the\"problem behavior syndrome\" constructfirst elucidated by Jessor and Jessor(1977) some 30 years ago. A more recentversion of this concept is a general de-viance construct used by Scheier, Botvin,and others in empirical studies (e.g., seeScheier and Botvin, 1996), and there alsois a recent respecification of the Jessorand Jessor model, with elaborationsthat encompass the epidemiological con-cepts of risk factors and protective factors(Jessor, 1998).The literature also shows heterogeneity in the typologies of criminal behavior orsocial maladaptation. Notions of childhoodconduct disorder followed by AntisocialPersonality Disorder appear prominentlyin some formulations, but are absent elsewhere (Loeber and Schmaling, 1985;Stevens, Kaplan, and Bauer, 2001; Lang-behn and Cadoret, 2001). These definitions and constructs in our theoretical perspectives demand work atthe intersection of public health and crimi-nal justice research. If we cannot bridgethese different approaches or marry themto produce adaptive offspring, they willprove to be an unending source of unre-solved tension with implications for re-search progress. Unresolved tensionsslow down our progress in researchthat depends on a peer review process,whether the peer review occurs at thestage of reviewing proposals or of vettingjournal articles. At NIJ and NIDA, an important part of the research agenda can be a series of meet-ings or technical workshops. The chargeto workshop participants is to bridge theseorienting concepts and definitions acrossdisciplines or create an articulation be-tween concepts that will accelerateresearch progress on drugs-crime rela-tionships rather than slow it down. Orienting conceptual frameworks and theories. The originating biomedical branches of public health research some-times take theory as a given or work withtheory in the background when there areemergent problems of human sufferingand disease to be solved. For example,the important 20th-century line of investi-gations required to identify lung canceras an adverse consequence of tobaccosmoking was guided more by implicit concepts of carcinogene sis secondary to tobacco smoking. Strongly articulated,34SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 explicit theories, if any, would have been mis-specified and incomplete in that theycould not possibly have incorporated thepostsmoking DNA adducts, proteinadducts, and gene-encoded metabolizingenzymes now prominent in the modelsof carcinogenesis. In criminal justiceresearch, true to its origins in the socialand behavioral sciences, the theoreticalunderpinnings are made more explicit(e.g., see Thornberry, 1997; Kaplan, 1995).One might say that without explicit theory,the research in this domain stands littlechance in peer review, no matter howimportant the empirical contribution. This is another source of tension at the intersections of and sometimes within thedomains of public health and criminal jus-tice research. In Public Health Servicestudy sections, I have seen study sectionmembers be less than enthusiastic aboutproposed epidemiological research ondrug use and Antisocial Personality Dis-order because the applicants had not ori-ented themselves to the major theories ofdeviance well known in criminal justice cir-cles: \"inadequate conceptual model\" isthe phrase that comes to mind. I also haveobserved major differences of opinionabout scientific priority among experts inthe criminal justice and social scienceworld, some of whom are comfortablewith \"psychologizing\" constructs withintheir theories (e.g., the self-derogationmodels developed by Kaplan), and otherswho are more focused on constructs witha behavior analytic origin (e.g., coerciveprocess and deviancy training modelsdeveloped by Patterson, Dishion, and theirresearch groups in Oregon). Tension in relation to theoretical models has been readily apparent in this NIJ-NIDAcollaboration, which has offered a chanceto step back and look over a broad ex-panse of scientific progress in publichealth and criminal justice research on thedrugs-crime association. This broad per-spective creates germs of ideas that mightbe useful in a synthesis or integration of various theoretical perspectives that rangefrom the disciplines of molecular or behav-ioral genetics to those of econometricsand the other social sciences. However,there clearly is diversity and tension evenwithin fields as narrow as behavior genet-ics, where some work is oriented towarddevelopmental family processes (e.g., asadvanced in the recent work of Neider-hiser and colleagues), and other work isnot (e.g., see Neiderhiser Kotler et al., 1999). These tensions surface most clearly in debate and discussion of an intersectionof genetics research and studies of thedrugs-crime relationship. Many investiga-tors from social science backgrounds arehesitant to take part in discussions ofgenetics, gene expression, and mecha-nisms of inheritance that might accountfor covariation of drug-taking behavior andcriminal offending. This hesitation can betraced in part back to serious and impor-tant concerns about ethical issues, eugen-ics, and the like. Some of the hesitationcan be traced back to a gap in graduateeducation: Graduates of social sciencetraining programs often have not mas-tered the basics of human biology andgenetics. Looking from a different perspective, an observer can see other sources of tensionin relation to conceptual framework andtheories. Graduates of human biology andgenetics programs often have not mas-tered the basics of behavioral and socialsciences research. The intersection of the Human Genome Project, gene expression, and proteomicswith research on drugs-crime relationshipsmerits close attention at NIDA and NIJ. Tosome extent, this intersection can be culti-vated in a gradual process of shaping newinvestigators. NIDA's peer review of its The intersection of the Human Genome Project, gene expression, and proteomics with research on drugs-crime relationships merits close attention at NIDA and NIJ.35TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY portfolio of research training programs and individual career development awards canspecify requirements for cross-disciplinemastery. On one side, new social scienceinvestigators can be required to masterthe basics of human biology and genetics.On the other side, new human biology andgenetics investigators can be required tomaster the basics of behavioral and socialsciences. NIDA already is sponsoring a series of train- ing workshops for new investigators toexpose them to the different disciplinesthat now contribute to its research mission.The initial workshops have focused on epidemiology, pharmacology, and neuro-science and introduced participants tothose fields. Future workshops are planned,with a broad agenda that cuts across thebehavioral and social sciences, includingethnography and behavior genetics, as wellas domains of medical sciences such asproteomics, drug development, and NIDA'sclinical trials network. Sustained investment in research educa- tion of these types will be needed at NIJand NIDA. Without attention to pharmacol-ogy, neuroscience, and pharmacogenetics,it will be difficult for future investigatorsto develop a fundamental understandingof the pharmacological and economic-compulsive categories of offending in theGoldstein-Brownstein tripartite conceptualframework. Without grounding in thesocial sciences, it will be difficult for themto develop a fundamental understandingof the systemic categories. There now are investigators who can bridge the gaps that appear as canyonsbetween disciplines. Elliott's attempt toarticulate his work with the NIH humangenetics initiative provides one example.In a primate lab run by Steve Suomi atNIH, research on gene-environment inter-actions as substrates of aggressive social maladaptation, and drug useprovides another example. This researchis especially useful because the environ- mental conditions experimentally manipu-lated in this lab have conceptual linkagesback to the deviancy training, inept parent-ing, and parent-infant relationship 1996; Brook et al., 1996;Brook, Tseng, and Cohen, 1996). More examples of this type of bridgework are emerging from the work of the researchpioneers who try to keep pace with evolv-ing contributions from the NIH HumanGenome Project. The NIJ-NIDA researchagenda can be enriched by a technicalreport series that brings examples of thistype to the community of investigatorsand research trainees. Tension that involves approach or methods Review of the drugs-crime literature cre- ates an opportunity for developing newinsights about the sometimes differentapproaches and methods that have beendeveloped in public health and criminaljustice research work groups. For exam-ple, ethnography with small groups hasexpanded to almost large-sample ethno-graphic research that bears some resem-blance to large-sample survey research,but in many ways is different. To an out-sider, this expansion is a puzzle to besolved and has not yet been grasped. Inthe public health research domain, theoriginal role of an ethnographer bore someresemblance to the role of the medicalpractitioner as a student of the natural his-tory of disease. The original natural historystudies were intensive case studies, withthe doctor at the bedside of individual sickpatients making careful systematic obser-vations about this individual case and thenthat individual case, in the days whenthere might have been symptom pallia-tion (e.g., cold cloths for fever), but no36SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 effective curative interventions to change the clinical course of disease. This hassome resonance with Agar's concepts ofthe ethnographer's attention to the detailsof behavior and verbal expression and ofwriting the narrative and taking down thestories of drug users in their own words(Agar, 1973). The link from this role of theethnographer to large-sample ethnographyremains unclear. Measurement methods pioneered in behavioral sciences research and intro-duced to studies of drug taking by Larson,Kaplan, and Schiffman have started to sur-face in criminal justice research as well.Experience Sampling Methods (ESM),originally developed to study the daily livesof high school students, have now beenintroduced in research on drug use (e.g.,see Csikzentmihalyi and Larson, 1987,1992). Their ESM procedure requiresstudy participants to wear an electronicpager device that beeps at randomlyscheduled intervals, signaling the partici-pant to record some predeterminedaspects of his or her present feelings,activities, and/or surrounding environmen-tal conditions. Usually, dozens of self-reports are collected over a week or moreto capture as much of participants' dailyliving as possible. One advantage of thismethod is the ability of the researcher toexamine drug use specific to each individ-ual, given the assessment of his or herbaseline characteristics for comparison.An additional benefit is the possibility oftaking into account measured social con-text of the behavior (e.g., see Farnworth,2000). ESM also creates new opportuni-ties to investigate the determinants ofdrug-taking behavior that might be uniqueto each individual and each situation (e.g.,see Kaplan and Lambert, 1995). These evolving ESM procedures require anumber of conditions if reliability and validity are to be enhanced. Kaplan andLambert (1995) identified the followingprerequisites: having a favorable and trust- ing relationship between study partici-pants and researchers, ensuring completeconfidentiality of responses, meeting laboror equipment and programming costsassociated with beeping the participantsseveral times per day, and addressing dif-ficulties faced when the participants areilliterate or challenged by technology. Several recent studies of delinquent and antisocial behavior may help clarify the util-ity of ESM procedures in research on thedrugs-crime relationship. For example,Farnworth (2000) studied a group of youngAustralian offenders on probation andfound that these respondents were en-gaged in such productive activities asemployment or education an estimated 10percent of the time. Compared with refer-ence norms for Australian adolescents,offenders spent 30 percent more time onpassive leisure activities. An estimated 42percent of the time, offenders on proba-tion reported being bored, while 62 per-cent of the time they were involved inunchallenging activities. The use of ESMto integrate studies of drug-taking andcriminal behaviors will provide new andimportant evidence on relationships thatgenerally have been studied via retrospec-tive reconstruction of behavior over longspans of developmental time. On another measurement front, there is arelated tension that involves the use of bioassay methods to study recent and pastdrug taking. Wish has been a pioneer inthe use of these methods for research onarrestees, and recent studies by Harrisonand Fendrich are extending this reach intogeneral household population samples ofthe type surveyed for the National House-hold Survey on Drug Abuse (Wish, 1988;Yacoubian, Wish, and Perez, 2001; Fendrich, 2001; Harrison, 2001). In future research,one may anticipate these differences inapproach to sustain a tension until a gener-al consensus has evolved.37TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY With respect to approach in the domain of statistical methodology, computationaladvances have contributed to an accelera-tion of innovation. There is a resulting airof optimism for what might be accom-plished, as in the domains of longitudinallatent transition modeling, multilevel ornested models, approaches to nonignor-able missing data, and alternative meth-ods of research on directed acyclicpathways with mediation versus cyclicalpathways with reciprocities. At the sametime, there is a tension because thesenew statistical approaches have not be-come integrated in most research trainingprograms, and there remains certain skep-ticism about heavily modeled data. Limitations on numeracy keep many of us from probing the assumptions of complexmodels, whether these are models of be-havior in individual studies, econometricmodels, or operations and systems re-search models to probe alternative pro-gram and policy decisions. Tension may beinevitable in the face of such complexities. Tension involving research ethics NIJ can play an important role in relation to investigations that probe drugs-crime rela-tionships. At present, a good part of theNIJ role has been ceded to HHS and itsnew Office of Human Research Protections(OHRP). True to its origins in NIH, OHRP isoriented toward the standards of experi-mental medical intervention research (e.g.,randomized trials to test safety and effica-cy of new drugs). OHRP specifications forinformed consent procedures and disclo-sure statements share this orientation. Many behavioral and social sciences re- searchers have expressed concern thatthe standards and specifications of experi-mental medical research are not appro-priate for studies of the drugs-crimerelationship. For example, in ethnograph-ic and observational survey research, dif-ferent specifications for informed consentprocedures and disclosure statements are required. NIJ officials can initiate a useful dialogue with OHRP on this important researchtopic. Perhaps more than any other gov-ernment agency, NIJ can help to stimulatea dialogue and negotiate a reorientation ofcurrent practices in a manner that fostersnew and creative research on the drugs-crime relationship without a lapse inresearch ethics or slippage in the protec-tion of human subjects in this research. Outside the Federal Government, re- searchers now face increasingly thornychallenges in the protection of their re-search participants and the assurance ofconfidentiality in relation to research data.For example, research that includesassessments of tobacco smoking nowrequires special handling as a result oflegal action by the tobacco industry. Theserequirements apparently extend to crimi-nal justice research in which tobaccosmoking is approached as a self-reportedindicator of deviance. The integration ofmolecular biology and genetics into theseresearch agendas, and even the introduc-tion of experience sampling methods orbioassays for drug testing, raise newquestions in the domain of research ethics,some of which have been scrutinized inrandomized experimental designs. Thesechallenges deserve the close attention ofthese research communities, with OHRPand its NIJ counterpart in suitable roles. Does drug use cause crime? A focal point Each author of working papers for the drugs-crime research forum was asked toidentify a circumscribed set of researchissues and probe what we really knowabout them. Mindful of other sections tobe written, we have been able to organizethese research issues in relation to a sin-gle focal point, expressed in the question,Computational advances havecontributed \"Does drug use cause crime?\" One ad- vantage of this specific focal point is thatit has a broad range and can encompassmany different strands of evidence devel-oped in public health and criminal justiceresearch. Another advantage is that it isacrucial open question for research on crime and drugs. As characterized byHarrison and Backenheimer (1998), \"Re-search has not been able to validate acausal link between drug use and criminalbehavior.\" When confronted with an etiological re- search question such as \"Does drug usecause crime?,\" a public health scientisttypically might turn to a 20th-century elab-oration of the 19th century Henle-Kochpostulates or conditions for judgingwhether a specific disease might becaused by specific bacteria. For a time,this 20th-century elaboration was knownas Hill's postulates (after Sir AustinBradford Hill, a medical statistician) andalso as Evans's postulates (after A.S.Evans, an epidemiologist; Evans, 1976;Hill, 1965). Today, students of epidemi- ology learn them as criteria for judgingwhether an association is causal or guide-lines for evaluating the evidence of acausal relationship, together with an analysis of the relative strengths andweaknesses of evidence from randomizedtrials, prospective and longitudinal studies,retrospective studies, and case-controlcomparisons. Exhibit 8 presents these criteria and guidelines. Before reviewing these criteria, four clarifi- cations may be in order. First, the criteriafor evaluating causal significance of ob-served associations represent standardsof scientific evidence that are substantiallydifferent from the standards used to judgecausal evidence in civil and criminal pro-ceedings. For some segments of thispaper's readership, the question, \"Doesdrug use cause crime?\" may sound silly:\"Of course drug use causes crime. Mygrandmother could tell you that.\" (Thiswas the type of reaction TV/radio personal-ity Rush Limbaugh gave to some of the Exhibit 8. Criteria and guidelines for judging the causal significance of an observed association Criteria/guidelines Associated questions Temporal relationship Is the temporal sequencing consistent with the idea that A causes B, or is there an ambiguity or the possibility that B causes A? Biological or other theoretical plausibility Is the idea that A causes B supported by theory or by trustworthy common experience and wisdom? Biological or other theoretical plausibility Is the available evidence consistent with the suspected causal link between A and B, or is there considerable inconsistency across studies? Alternative explanations ruled out If we are skeptical that A causes B or that B causes A, are there other specific alternative explanations for the observed statistical relationship between A and B, such as some background factor C that accounts for a spurious association between A and B? Dose-response or gradient relationship Is there regularity in the observed plot of B as a response to A? Where we see more of A, do we see more of B? Strength of association How strong is the relationship? Is it strong enough to make other alternative explanations less plausible? Cessation effects In this extension of the dose-response criterion, do levels of B drop substantially when A no longer is present?39TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY early work that Howard Chilcoat, Tom Dishion, and I published on the topic ofwhether inner-city mothers and fathersmight be able to help protect their childrenagainst risk of early-onset drug use if theymaintained levels of parental vigilancegenerally associated with good parentalsupervision and monitoring.) Our response to these gentle readers is to beg forbearance. Of course, some of whatour grandparents learned to be true is nottrue, and the analysis of responsibility fornegligent or criminal acts in the individualcase (as in a court of law) necessarily hasa different set of standards of evidence.For example, evidence beyond a reason-able doubt is not the same as the defini-tive evidence referenced in the firstparagraph of this paper. Our second clarification is that we acknowl- edge a possibility that delinquent or crimi- nal behavior might be a cause of drug use,the chicken-egg problem referenced byInciardi and advanced with evidence byothers. This possibility surfaces when oneconsiders earlier sociological models ofdeviance (e.g., Sutherland, Matza) or latersociopsychological developmental modelsfor youthful deviance, antisocial behavior,and delinquency, such as the coerciveinteraction deviancy training modelsintroduced by Patterson, Dishion, and col-leagues; Coie and his colleagues at Duke;and Kaplan at Texas A&M University (e.g.,see Patterson, Reid, and 1992;Patterson, 2001; Kaplan,1995). For example, minor rule violationsin early childhood, well before the years ofstarting drug use, might be followed bygeneral peer rejection, differential associa-tion or affiliation with other rejected anddeviant peers, and subsequent group-fostered delinquency and norm violations,including illegal drug use. We note thatthis possibility, and the more advancedidea of reciprocities between drug use and criminal behavior, do not necessarilyundermine inferences about drug use asacause of crime. We face a problem of slightly different conformation in our re-search on drug dependence: The use ofadrug is an absolutely necessary but not sufficient condition for development ofclinical syndromes of drug dependence,but once the drug dependence processhas started, the drug dependence takeson a life of its own and becomes a deter-mining influence for subsequent drug use(i.e., drug use causes drug dependence,and then drug dependence causes druguse). Our third clarification is to ask first whether it is plausible that there is no associationbetween drug use and crime or criminalbehavior or whether there might be aninverse association (the more crime, theless drug use). In our review of availableevidence, we must acknowledge the pos-sibility that in some subsegments ofhuman experience, there well may be anegative association between drug useand criminal behavior (e.g., in the highlydisciplined and controlled environmentsof industrial espionage), just as we mustacknowledge the fact that some 90-year-olds have smoked a pack or more oftobacco cigarettes virtually each day ofadult life and have not developed lung can-cer. We also acknowledge the high proba-bility that in certain times and places or incertain subsegments of population experi-ence, there is no association betweendrug use and criminal behavior (e.g., seeBlum and Associates' studies of cliniciansand professionals who used LSD beforeit was regulated by the Food and DrugAdministration; Blum and Associates,1964). Notwithstanding these exceptional circum- stances, there is a generally consistentoverall pattern of positive and sometimesquite strong associations between illegaldrug use and criminal behavior of other There is a overallpattern REPORT / JULY 03 types. These associations are observed not only in samples of offenders in thecriminal justice system (e.g., DUF andADAM), but also in general householdpopulation samples. This evidence hassome vulnerability due to constraints onmethods (e.g., refusals by study partici-pants to give informed consent for partici-pation), but recent consistent evidencefrom general population surveys indicatesthat the observed association extendsbeyond officially recognized crimes anddoes not suffer the transition bias that ispresent in DUF , ADAM, and other criminaljustice samples (e.g., perhaps the arrestedor incarcerated offenders were caughtbecause of impairments from drug use, orthe drug use of an offender is a manifesta-tion of a more general characteristic ofcarelessness that might lead more readilyto apprehension by the authorities). Fourth, a \"cloud of confusion\" sometimes descends when people begin talking aboutcauses and causation. We will try to beclear. Although we are asking whetherdrug use causes crime, we are not sayingthat there are no other causes of crime.This issue sometimes is subject to misin-terpretation. For this reason, it might bemore sensible to express the question in adifferent way: \"Under what conditions, ifany, does criminal behavior, as a responsevariable, depend in any substantive wayon drug use, such that we might be ableto shape criminal behavior by shapingdrug use?\" This question is not as pithyas, \"Does drug use cause crime?\" but itmight help us escape the cloud of confu-sion when we try to review available evi-dence pertinent to this issue of causalinference. Criterion/guideline 1: Temporal relationship If illegal drug use is believed to be a cause of criminal behavior, then we require evi-dence that illegal drug use has precededthe onset of that criminal behavior. Judg- ments about this criterion or guideline canbecome difficult when there are potentialreciprocities. For example, when sus-tained medicinal use of phenacetin andacetaminophen compounds (e.g., Tylenol,Datril) was nephritis and end-stage renaldisease (ESRD), one of the possibility that the earliest clinicalfeatures of ESRD include headaches. Ofcourse, headaches can promote the sus-tained use of pain-relieving medicines,including the acetaminophen compounds. The drugs-crime relationship presents this type of temporal complexity, as was seenin exhibits 6 and 7. Earlier aggression, con-duct problems, and criminal behavior mayfunction as a direct cause of illegal druguse (e.g., see Kellam and Anthony, 1998),and possibly as an indirect cause (e.g., bypromoting affiliation with other delinquentand drug-using peers). Earlier drug usealso may function to promote later growthof conduct problems or criminal behavior(e.g., see Johnson et al., 1995). Criterion/guideline 2: Biological or other theoretical plausibility Carrying books of matches is associated with the risk of developing lung cancer,tends to precede rather than follow theonset of lung cancer, and has at least amoderately strong association with lungcancer. However, except with respect tothe associated characteristic of tobaccosmoking, we have no biological or othertheoretical plausibility to link carryingmatches per se with the etiology of lungcancer. Even if the matches-cancer associ-ation were to withstand the challengesposed by the other criteria for evaluatingcausal significance of an association, wewould be inclined to ask about the under-lying theory and its plausibility and coher-ence in relation to known relationshipsand facts.41TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY The tripartite model for the drugs-crime nexus represents a substantiation of plau-sible causal links from illegal drug use tocriminal behavior. Other related strands inthe fabric of plausibility have been men-tioned (e.g., differential crime opportunity,differential association). The plausibility of a link between drug use and aggressive or violent crimes rests tosome extent on neuroscience theory andobserved clinico-pathological associations,as in contemporary thinking about cocaine'sinfluence on limbic-hypothalamic sub-strates of aggression (Davis, 1996). Inaddition, there is a line of preclinical andclinical laboratory experiments that hashelped to solidify the plausibility of a linkfrom drug use to aggressive or violentbehavior, and possibly to the types ofnorm violations associated with nonviolentcrime. The evidence on links from the useof psychostimulant drugs (e.g., metham-phetamine, cocaine) and aggression isnoteworthy in this respect. Administrationof cocaine to hamsters during adoles-cence increased the number of bites andattacks indicative of a surge of offensiveaggression (Harrison et al., 2000). Mooreand Thompson (1978), studying pigeons,found that high doses of cocaine elicitedaggressive behavior. In some species,increased levels of aggression also havebeen observed with the administration ofamphetamine stimulant drug\u2014not onlywhen a large single dose (e.g., Melega etal., 1997), but also after sustained lowerdoses (Haber, Barchas, and Barchas, 1981)are administered. These psychostimulantsalso may increase the risk of self-directedaggression (e.g., see Peffer-Smith et. al.,1983). Experimental laboratory research with human subjects also has produced sup-portive evidence along these lines, oftenwith computerized point-subtraction meth-ods used to evoke aggression after thedrug has been administered and undercontrol (no drug) conditions. For example,Licata et al. (1993) administered a high dose, low dose, and no dose of cocaineand found that subjects in the high-dosegroup expressed significantly greateraggression than subjects in the controlgroup; the low-dose group did not differfrom the control group. Notwithstanding these strands of plausibil- ity, there also is a considerable amount ofinconsistency in the observed data andsome complexity in relation to dose-response analyses. For example, Crowleyet al. (1992) found no increase in aggres-sion when cocaine was administered inprimate lab research; Darmani and col-leagues (1990) found increased aggres-sion among mice that were givenrelatively low doses of cocaine but notwhen the mice were given higher dosesof cocaine. Moro et al. (1997) found reduc-tions in the total number and length ofaggressive activities in mice after amphet-amine administration. Cherek et al. (1989),studying humans, examined the relation-ship between d-amphetamine on aggres-sion using point subtractions and foundan increase in aggression among thosereceiving 10 mg per 70 kg of body weightbut a decrease in aggression when 20 mgper 70 kg of body weight was administered. Police experience on the street implicates dissociative drugs such as phencyclidine(PCP) in relation to violent and aggressivebehavior and crime. We have been able tofind some supportive experimental labora-tory evidence consistent with this street-wise experience (e.g., Burkhalter thereis a complex pattern of inconsistent evi-dence that does not ring true with theexperience on the street and commonwisdom about PCP . Tyler and Miczek(1982), Emley and Hutchinson (1983),and Miczek and Haney (1994) reportedno increase in aggressive behavior afterexperimental administration of PCP andan erratic increase in aggression only in a The tripartite model for thedrugs-crime nexusrepresents asubstantiation ofplausible / JULY 03 subgroup of animals receiving low doses. Hence, it may be that PCP promotesaggression only in certain subgroups ofthe population (e.g., see McCardle andFishbein, 1989); and in some experiments,animals receiving high doses of PCP weremore likely to be victims of aggression bynondrugged animals (e.g., see Russell,Greenberg, and Segal, 1984; Tyler andMiczek, 1982). In sum, there is some plausibility to the idea that drug use might promote criminalbehavior, with strands of plausibility com-ing from neuroscience theory, the com-mon wisdom and experience of criminaljustice officials and drug users, and lab-oratory experiments. The links betweenbeing a drug user and becoming a crimevictim represent an understudied phenom-enon, and the inconsistent patterns of lab-oratory evidence provoke us to investigatethe possibility that there might be sub-stantial heterogeneity within the popula-tion with respect to links from drug use toaggressive behavior or to crime (e.g., seeParker and Rebhun, 1995). History demonstrates one of the difficul- ties with this criterion for judging causalsignificance of associations. Time and timeagain, new evidence has contradictedwhat appeared to be a biologically plausi-ble or theoretically pleasing link betweenasuspected cause and a suspected re- sponse. is truefor the other criteria and guidelines, byitself this one counts for little. Criterion/guideline 3: Consistency of the association We already have clarified the possibility that no association or a negative associa-tion might exist for certain subsegmentsof population experience. For example, atsome point, drug taking may incapacitatean individual who otherwise would be in- volved in criminal behavior. Despite exam-ples of this type, and notwithstandingcontrary evidence, the drugs-crime re-search literature now includes a generallyconsistent replication of positive associa-tions between illegal drug use and criminalbehavior (e.g., see Harrison and Backen-heimer, 1998). The body of laboratory experiments on drugs and aggressive or violent behavioris not as consistent as one might expect.As described under criterion/guideline 2,under some circumstances, laboratoryexperiments have established a small setof drugs as causal agents in relation toaggression and violence. However, formost drugs and many circumstances,there are negative findings, and the evidence is not consistent with causallinks from drug taking to aggressive andviolent behavior. Given the multiplicity of drugs, types of crimes, and varieties of social contexts,it may be inevitable that the accumulatedbody of evidence on the drugs-crime rela-tionship appears inconsistent. Variation inthe quality of the research also has a bear-ing on consistencies or inconsistencies inthe evidence. As every first-year graduatestudent learns, research with imprecisemeasurements will tend to yield evidenceof no relationship even when a relation-ship exists; research with measurementsof limited validity will tend to yield evi-dence of relationships where none exists. Although not generally introduced as a feature of studying consistency of rela-tionships between causes and effects, adevelopmental perspective may help tolead the reader to a greater appreciation ofinconsistencies and complexities faced inresearch on the drugs-crime relationship.That is, the timing of the onset of the drugtaking may condition the later expressionof criminal behavior and may lead to Given the multiplicity of drugs, types of crimes, and varieties of social contexts, it may be inevitable that the accumulated body of evidence on the drugs- crime relationship appears inconsistent.43TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY greater heterogeneity in the population with respect to the drugs-crime relation-ship. For example, we have some evi-dence on the possibility that earlier-onsetdrug use is associated with later risk ofdeveloping drug problems (e.g., seeAnthony and Petronis, 1995). We alsohave evidence that prompts us to concep-tualize earlier-onset drug use as a type ofprecocious adolescent development thatmay disrupt normative developmental trajectories (e.g., see Newcomb, 1992;Dawes et al., 2000). There may be a ten-dency to interpret these disruptions assources of increased levels of later crimi-nal behavior, consistent with the idea thatrisk of drug problems are increased forearly-onset drug users; this has been theperspective our research group has takenin its studies of this topic (e.g., Johnsonet al., 1995; Anthony and Petronis, 1995).Nonetheless, it is possible that precocious(i.e., early onset) drug taking is followedby disproportionately greater increases infrequency of drug use and in risk of drugproblems but that the early-onset drug usedampens the level of criminal behaviorthat otherwise might occur if the drug usehad not started so early. Our study of early-onset alcohol use and the later developmental trajectory of con-duct problems represents a case in point.In that study, cited above under criterion/guideline 1 (Johnson et al., 1995), wefound that baseline levels of conduct prob-lems were greater for boys who had start-ed drinking alcohol before the adolescentyears without parental permission and thatgrowth of conduct problems was greaterfor these early-onset alcohol users\u2014 when compared with boys whose drinking didnot start until later. Similar relationships were observed for girls with early-onsetalcohol use\u2014 when compared with girls whose drinking did not start until later.However, a discussion of this researchwith Blumstein has prompted us to re-approach this problem with a differentcomparison in mind. Using random effectsregression, we are seeking to hold con- stant the baseline level of conduct prob-lems and study boys who have a highinitial level of conduct problems but whostart drinking alcohol early on and com-pared them with boys with an equally highinitial level of conduct problems but forwhom alcohol consumption is delayeduntil adolescence. Approaching the con-trast in this manner, we may discover thatearly-onset drinking dampens the growthtrajectory for conduct problems; the steep-est trajectory for growth of conduct prob-lems may be observed for boys with highinitial levels of conduct problems but with-out the impairments associated with earlydrinking. The early drinking might leadto retardation in the growth of conduct problems for boys who otherwise wouldescalate to very high levels of conductproblems in adolescence. This is a somewhat counterintuitive propo- sition, and it may run counter to commonwisdom and experience with respect tothe effects of early-onset drinking or druguse and the later lifecourse of young peo-ple. However, our intuitions and commonexperience about these circumstancestend to reflect a type of population-averaged summary of developmental trajectories and generally do not encom-pass all varieties of human experience.We mention this open research question as an example of the complexities facedin developmental research on the drugs-crime relationship and as a possible expla-nation for the inconsistencies observed indrugs-crime research. The timing of thedrug use may induce subgroup variationin the drugs-crime relationship, whichthen is interpreted as inconsistency inand a challenge to causal significance ofthe observed associations. Fortunately, complete consistency of evi- dence is not required. What is required isafocused probing of the circumstances under which the drugs-crime relationshipis a causal relationship, with a deliberate44SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 effort to ferret out situations in which there is no causal linkage between drug use andcriminal behavior. Deliberate scientific pur-suit of these circumstances and situationsmay require investigators to look overseas,where use of such drugs as marijuana,cocaine, and heroin are not treated ascriminal behaviors. In social contexts ofthis type, by studying the developmentaltrajectories of criminal behavior amongyoung people with and without early drug-taking experiences, we may be able to illu-minate some of the inconsistencies nowobserved in the drugs-crime evidenceavailable to us. For example, longitudinalstudies of children growing up in theNetherlands are underway. The recenteffective decriminalization of marijuana usein the Netherlands creates a social contextfor research on this drug and later criminalbehavior that merits attention on the NIJ-NIDA research agenda. Criterion/guideline 4: Alternative explanations ruled out This criterion or guideline represents the Achilles heel for much of the priorresearch on the possible causal links be-tween illegal drug use and criminal behav-ior and represents a general difficulty forobservational research in general. Observ-ing a possible causal relationship betweenantecedent A and response B, the skepti-cal critic always can ask, \"Isn't there someunrecognized background factor C thatcan account for the A-B relationship thatyou have observed in this study?\" If so,\"Isn't this a poorly developed conceptualmodel?\" To some extent, these are a coward's questions about the drugs-crime relation-ship in specific and about empirical re-search in general. Of course, there mightbe some unrecognized background factorin empirical research plans and in complet-ed studies; if not the hand of the mischie-vous Norse god Loki, then something elseof a less celestial nature.The challenge for the courageous skepti- cal critic is to assert a specific backgroundfactor or set of background factors thatmight account for the observed A-B rela-tionship and that have not been consid-ered explicitly or taken into account in astudy plan or description of completedwork. For example, observing the suspect-ed causal association between tobaccosmoking and risk of lung cancer, the statis-tician Sir Ronald Fisher posed a questionof the following type: \"Can't we explainthe observed association as a manifesta-tion of an underlying predisposition or lia-bility that determines both the tobaccosmoking and the lung cancer?\" In relation to the drugs-crime relationship, the most plausible background factorsseem to be of the variety named by Fisher,namely, unmeasured predispositions; inthis instance, the predispositions mightinvolve who abides by the conventionalrules of society, who is willing to run afoulof the law by taking a drug illegally, andwho is willing to commit crimes other thanthe crime of drug possession for personaluse. To some extent, these predisposi-tions may be a manifestation of family her-itage, a manifestation of early experientialconditions and processes, or a synthesisof both. Nevertheless, no matter whattheir origin, until these predispositions aretaken into account, they represent a plau-sible form of alternative explanation when-ever a drugs-crime relationship is found inour empirical studies. One line of response to this criticism has been to measure personality or facets oftemperament in observational studies andto re-estimate the drugs-crime associationwith personality or temperament held con-stant (e.g., via stratification or statisticaladjustment in a regression model). Butthis response always is subject to the criti-cism that the wrong facets of personalityor temperament were measured or thatthe measurement of personality or tem-perament was not as good as it shouldhave been.45TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY It is in relation to this criterion that we now have new opportunities for researchat the intersection of public health andcriminal justice research on the drugs-crime relationship. Three important op-portunities at this intersection involve (1)genetics, twin, and family research; (2)longitudinal studies with \"subjects as theirown controls\" designs; and (3) controlledexperimental trials. Future genetics, twin, and family studies can help to narrow the alternative explana-tions in a useful manner. For example, inan earlier section we described a designthat exploits the genetic matching ofmonozygotic twins to search for environ-mental conditions that contribute to theoccurrence of disease. Discordant MZtwin designs also can be used to hold constant predispositions or liabilities linkedto the individual genome of the twins,while studying differences in the trajectoryof criminal behavior for the MZ twinwhose illegal drug use starts first versusthe MZ twin whose illegal drug use startslater (or not at all). Alternative twin and family research de- signs can be used to narrow other expla-nations of the observed drugs-crimerelationship (e.g., studies of discordantsiblings, studies based on the transmis-sion disequilibrium test when specificpolymorphisms are under investigations).Cadoret and colleagues have offeredrecent illustrations of the power of twinstudies in which some twins have beenseparated at birth, but these \"naturalexperiments\" have become scarce in theUnited States and other parts of the worldwhere twins now generally are kept to-gether in their new adoptive families (e.g.,see Cadoret et al., 1986, 1995; Cadoret,Leve, and Devor, 1997). Tsuang et al.(2001) provide a recent useful overview ofpertinent findings from the Harvard TwinStudy.Longitudinal subjects-as-their-own-controls research designs also can help rule outalternative explanations in the sense thateach individual participant is carrying for-ward a within-individual set of propensitiesto become engaged in illegal drug use andother criminal offending. In these longitu-dinal designs, in an otherwise law-abidingindividual, if we were to observe that crim-inal offending occurs only in the imme-diate aftermath of a drug intoxicationexperience or only in the stages of with-drawal after drug dependence, we wouldhave additional evidence of a drugs-crimeassociation at the individual level. Theselongitudinal designs remain vulnerable toapossible counterclaim that there is an underlying predisposition that links earlierillegal drug use to later criminal offendingonly during the context of drug intoxica-tion or withdrawal states. That is, theobserved association between illegal drugintoxication or withdrawal and the latercriminal offending is a spurious artifact ofuncontrolled confounding: There is some-thing else in the background, a third vari-able that explains the observed sequence. Medical and public health research is host to a variety of examples of this typeof spurious confounding. One of them involves the connection between chicken-pox and shingles. For most people, chick-enpox occurs early in life and shinglesoccurs late in life. There sometimes is anexceptional case of shingles occurring withno prior history of chickenpox in childhood,but these exceptional cases might beunderstood as instances of \"clinically inap-parent\" infections (i.e., with mild or mini-mal symptoms in childhood, so mild as topass without notice). A longitudinal re-search design on this topic can lead to theimpression that chickenpox causes shin-gles, in the sense that shingles rarely ornever occurs unless chickenpox occursfirst. This observed longitudinal link be-tween chickenpox and shingles satisfies46SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 the requirement described above: Criminal behavior occurs only after a bout of illegaldrug use. The fly in the ointment in ourchickenpox-shingles example is that wenow know that chickenpox does not causeshingles. Rather, it is an underlying virusthat causes both of these clinical phenom-ena. Exposure to the chickenpox virus (her-pes zoster) is the cause of chickenpox inchildhood and is the cause of shingles inlater life when the virus emerges from anotherwise dormant or latent state of noactivity. The apparent linkage from earlierchickenpox to later shingles is due to anunderlying third variable, the herpes zosterinfection, which accounts for the appear-ance of both outcomes. The analogy to research on illegal drug use and later criminal offending should beclear. Even when longitudinal researchshows us examples of participants whobecome engaged in criminal behavior onlyin the context of drug intoxication or with-drawal states, we cannot be confident thatthe illegal drug use is the cause of theassociated criminal offending. Some un-known underlying cause may be account-ing for both outcomes. The third approach, involving randomized trials, offers a way to bring these unknownunderlying variables into check. This ap-proach already has been described in rela-tion to our research group's studies of analternative explanation for the drugs-crimerelationship. Namely, we advanced thehypothesis that a predisposing characteris-tic in the form of early aggression or rulebreaking is a potentially modifiable deter-minant of both later illegal drug use andcriminal behavior or other sorts. Thishypothesis does not reject the possibilitythat illegal drug use causes later criminalbehavior, but it introduces one alternativeexplanation for the observations associa-tion between illegal drug use and criminalbehavior (i.e., the earlier aggression or ten-dency to break rules and social norms). Asdescribed earlier, we sought to test this hypothesis by constructing an experimen-tal trial in which we disrupted the develop-ment of early aggression and rule breaking(e.g., Kellam and Anthony, 1998). We usedthe power of randomization to hold con-stant the profile of alternative explanationsthat might account for later illegal drug useand criminal behavior. In a current fol-lowup study of the youths who participat-ing in this trial, we will be testing whetherthe primary school intervention had a sus-tained impact on illegal drug use and crimi-nal behavior. If so, we might expect aweakened association between illegaldrug use and criminal behavior in the sub-group of youths exposed to the activebehavioral intervention arms of our study. A related opportunity to test the drugs- crime relationship and to use randomiza-tion to rule out alternative explanationsinvolves controlled trials of new therapeu-tic interventions directed toward illegaldrug use and drug dependence of adoles-cents. Observational studies now suggestthat entry into drug treatment reduces therate of criminal offending, but these stud-ies leave open possibilities for alternativeexplanations (e.g., selection biases in theassignment of subjects to treatment, im-balances in the other determinants ofcriminal offending). Randomization in thesetting of controlled trials of new thera-peutic interventions creates an opportuni-ty to constrain these selection biases andbring into balance the alternative sourcesof variation in criminal offending (e.g., seeManski et al., 2001). By adding followup measurements of posttreatment criminal behavior to currentand newly emerging randomized con-trolled trials of therapeutic interventions,NIJ and NIDA can help foster new evi-dence on the degree to which illegal druguse is a cause of criminal offending. Alter-native explanations for the observeddrugs-crime association and other deter-minants of the offending behavior can47TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY either be brought into balance by random- ization or held constant as measuredcovariates in statistical models of analysis.Some examples of past research alongthese lines are described under criterion/guideline 7. Criterion/guideline 5: Dose-response or gradient relationship Absence of a dose-response or gradient relationship does not rule out causal as-sociations; there are good examples ofthreshold relationships with no clear gradi-ent. Nonetheless, there are examples inwhich the probability or rate of criminalbehavior is observed to be lower withlower levels or frequencies of illegal druguse and is observed to be greater as lev-els or frequencies increase. In one recent and especially informative longitudinal cohort study, Brook et al.(2001) studied the developmental trajecto-ry of marijuana use from childhood intoadulthood and found that behavioral andattitudinal indicators of unconventionality(e.g., attitudes tolerant of norm violations)had a gradient relationship with later in-creases in marijuana involvement. Theresearch team also found that as levelsof unconventionality increased, so didmarijuana involvement. These gradientrelationships between unconventionalityand marijuana use help to substantiate apossible causal link between earlier un-conventionality and later developmentaltrajectories of marijuana involvement.However, as in the circumstance of re-search on the drugs-crime relationship,this research report leaves us with unan-swered questions of the following variety: a. What about the predisposition that links unconventionality to the earliestmarijuana use? Where does the un-conventionality come from, and is thispredisposition the same as the predispo-sition to smoke marijuana?b. What about the reverse causal pathway and the possibility that increasing mari-juana use might promote later increasesin unconventionality? c. As levels of marijuana use increase, are there later dose-response or gradient-like increases in unconventionality? In light of the population heterogeneity mentioned above, this dose-response cri-terion might be especially troublesome inresearch on the drugs-crime relationship.For example, consider the drug user whoseincreasing bouts of intoxication yield lesscriminal behavior than otherwise mightoccur and whose intoxication-associatedcarelessness leads to apprehension anddetoxification and outpatient treatmentprior to a bench appearance. The detoxifi-cation and treatment might be followed bya return to the baseline level of criminalbehavior (i.e., a higher level of criminalbehavior than was observed during theperiod of intoxication) and an impressionthat treatment was ineffectual withrespect to the frequency of criminalbehavior. Criterion/guideline 6: Strength of association Weak associations seem especially vulner- able to sources of spuriousness and bias.One benchmark standard for strength isthe association between tobacco smokingand lung cancer: The risk of dying fromlung cancer is estimated to be 10 timesor greater for persistent tobacco smokersthan for nonsmokers. Toward the otherend of the spectrum of magnitude is awidely appreciated but quite modeststrength of association between beingmale and illegal use of drugs: The risk ofbecoming an illegal drug user is an esti-mated 1.5 to 3.0 times greater for anAmerican male than for an Americanfemale (Anthony and Helzer, 1995).48SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Examining the range of study estimates on the drugs-crime relationship, there aresome studies with extremely large rela-tionships, but when a positive relationshipis observed, the strength of relationshiptends to be quite modest. This generallymodest relationship may imply that alter-native explanations (e.g., predispositions)are sufficient to account for the observedrelationship. Criterion/guideline 7: Cessation effects Cessation effects already have been men- tioned in the context of our discussion ofalternative explanations under criterion/guideline 4. There are many studies of co-occurring maturation processes that leadto fading of both illegal drug use and othercriminal behavior, especially since thework of Winick. The observational studiesof McGlothlin, Anglin, and Cali-fornia and the work of Nurco, Lerner, andcolleagues in Baltimore also shed light ondeclines in criminal behavior during peri-ods of abstinence or reduced illegal druguse. The literature includes numerousstudies of what has happened to crimeinvolvement after cessation of drug use,based on observational studies. As noted under criterion/guideline 4, some of the strongest evidence about cessationeffects can come from randomized experi-ments in which drug treatment or otherinterventions are used to disrupt illegaldrug use, with subsequent evaluation ofcrime as an outcome of treatment. Asnoted under criterion/guideline 6, for somesegments of the drug-using population,the cessation of drug use is followed byincreases in frequency of criminal behavior(i.e., once impairments associated withintoxication are reduced).Reprise: Does drug use cause crime? What do we not know? This review of a specific hypothesized causal relationship was intended to high-light some of what we know about thedrugs-crime relationship. Its main purposewas to provoke discussion and help in aprocess of identifying weaknesses andgaps in evidence that might be used toguide a future research agenda. Evaluated in relation to these conventional criteria or guidelines for judging the causalsignificance of observed associations, thereader may have a better appreciation forthe uncertainty conveyed in a recent sum-mary statement cited above: \"Researchhas not been able to validate a causal linkbetween drug use and criminal behavior\"(Harrison and Backenheimer, 1998). Theavailable evidence is ambiguous with re-spect to temporal relationships. Instead, we offer a series of discussion points about what we might not yet know. Is the evidence on a temporal relation- ship compelling? Illegal drug use pre- cedes formal criminal behavior in some ofthese studies, but what about the earlierantecedents of both drug use and crimein the form of rule breaking, misbehavior,and minor norm violations? One can imag-ine a co-occurrence process that beginswith expression of irritable temperamentor aggression in the preschool years, fol-lowed by rule breaking or norm violationsin the primary school years, and then laterco-occurrence of illegal drug use and delin-quent or criminal offending. Our own re-search group and others have added someevidence on the possibility that drug tak-ing that starts by age 11 might promotegrowth trajectories for later conduct prob-lems among both boys and girls. The pat-tern of co-occurrence of conduct problemsWhen a positive relationship is observed, the strength of relationship tends to be quite modest.49TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY and drug use is a centerpiece of Jessor's problem behavior theory, and there is rea-son to look to experiments that will helpus differentiate these problem behaviors(e.g., differential response of each formof problem behavior to different interven-tions, as suggested in Dishion's earlyAdolescent Transitions experiment). Plausibility? Our focus has been oriented toward the individual, but there is a per-spective on the drugs-crime relationshipthat is more ecological or contextual in orientation. For example, a social environ-ment characterized by illegal drug use ofindividuals might give rise to norm viola-tions and criminal offending of other sorts,and not necessarily in the form of offend-ing by the drug users but rather in theform of offending by others. The muggingof a heavily intoxicated drug user by agroup of nonusing passersby serves asone example of aggregate effects of illegaldrug use on crime that would not beapparent in individual-oriented studies butwould require multilevel studies of interre-lationships between individuals. Consistency? What about the exceptions to a general pattern of observations? Itseems likely that the drugs-crime associa-tion varies from time to time, place toplace, and subgroup to subgroup. Thestudy of variation in these patterns of asso-ciation will help to disclose the boundaryconditions and mechanisms that giverise to strong, weak, and possibly inverseassociations. Research across bordersand in settings such as the Amsterdamcannabis environment can help illuminatethese boundary conditions. Alternative explanations? Several lines of research have been started on the com-mon causes for both illegal drug use andother criminal behavior, some of themoriginating in family history studies andthe clever adoption paradigm adapted byCadoret and his colleagues, some with asharper focus on mechanisms of inheri- tance (e.g., assays of genetic polymor-phisms), and some with a focus onpersonality and early social environment.It is not clear that studies to date have provided adequate control over thesesources of co-variation. Nonetheless, thelongitudinal study of individuals over timehas provided evidence from subjects-as-their-own-controls designs, and the ran-domized trials of interventions providesome evidence that, despite commoncauses, an intervention directed toward illegal drug use can reduce frequency ofcriminal behavior. Even if there are com-mon causes (e.g., inherited traits), formany observers, the longitudinal evidencecoupled with experimental evidence issufficient to draw the inference that illegaldrug use causes criminal behavior. Rea-sonable people will disagree about thisinference from available observations, andthe points of disagreement will lead usto specific experiments or new studiesto gather evidence that will be morecompelling. Gradient? Is it possible that some of the inconsistency in observations about thedrugs-crime relationship can be traced to(a) selective attention either to the lowerend of drug involvement (e.g., among chil-dren, adolescents, or high school seniorsfollowed through the college years; seeSchulenberg et al., 1994) or to the higherend (e.g., among arrestees or clients indrug treatment programs); (b) possiblethresholds in the gradient relationship,with withrespect to the effective threshold; or (c) anuncertain metric for assessing the type orlevel of drug involvement? As described inthe prior section entitled \"Criterion/guide-line 2: Biological or other theoretical plausi-bility,\" we have noted some inconsistentpharmacological effects across dosage50SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 levels of the same drug and across differ- ent drugs. If we are to appropriately sortthe consistent and inconsistent findingsof field studies on the drugs-crime rela-tionships, it may be necessary to reach forgreater specificity with respect to dosagelevels or intensity of drug use and alsowith respect to the pharmacological differ-ences observed in laboratory experiments.It no longer is enough to sort drugs intothe non-scientific colloquial \"soft\" and\"hard\" categories, nor to lump all \"illegaldrug use\" as if there were no hetero-geneities of effect across the variousforms of internationally regulated drugs.The best field studies of the 21st centurywill abandon these relatively crude clas-sifications and will not carry forward anobsolete tradition from the earlier ground-breaking days of drugs-crime research. Strength of association? Due to uncer- tainties about reciprocal and dynamic inter-relationships between drugs and crime, itwould be advantageous to look closely atstudies with fine-grained temporal analysisof the drugs-crime relationship and to esti-mate strength of association prospective-ly. This should be done in a manner thatallows change in the level of criminal be-havior to be gauged in relation to changein the level of drug use and vice versa, orwith an expression of the relative risk ofcriminal acts with and without antecedentillegal drug use. Cessation? Our recent National Research Council committee expressed concernthat selection effects, transition biases,or other artifacts might lead to a spuriousinference that criminal behavior declinesor stops when illicit drug use is ended,either with or without intervention. Theevidence on this criterion might requirespecial scrutiny in light of concerns suchas these.Conclusion In the final section of this working paper,Iwould like to integrate the organizing conceptual framework presented in thesection on the rubrics with the ecologicalconcept of scale described previously.Here, there is an adaptation of the formalecological concept of scale that includesthe microcosm and an extension of theconcept that reaches to the macrocosm ofthe international regulatory environment. The integration of the five rubrics and the concept of scale is depicted in exhibit 9.The result is a two-dimensional grid withthe rubrics on one axis and scale on theother axis and showing the conceptualdomain where research on drugs and re-search on criminal offending intersect.Each rubric-scale intersection or subunit in the grid can be populated by past andcurrent examples of research on thedrugs-crime relationship. In some sub-units, density of past and current researchis quite high; work in these domains mayrequire strengthening, or perhaps theseinvestigators should be left alone to dotheir work. In other subunits, we havedone little or no past research activity;these subunits might warrant attention ina new agenda for drugs-crime research. Starting in the upper left-hand corner of this framework, we have the intersectionof quantity research with the microcosmrepresented by the genes we inherit fromour forebears. We may expect one day tohave an investigation that produces quan-titative estimates of the frequency ofhomozygotes and heterozygotes withrespect to genes that are implicated in thedrugs-crime relationship, just as we nowhave these estimates for the frequency ofalleles mapped to apolipoprotein E4 andother genes or polymorphisms implicat-ed in the risk of developing Alzheimer'sdisease.51TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Working our way to the far upper right- hand corner, we stop at the level ofNations. To the best of my knowledge,we have a limited set of quantitative esti-mates for rates of drug-taking behaviorsand criminal justice statistics at the levelof Nations; but definitive evidence on vari-ation across regions of the globe is lackingand represents a current gap in knowl-edge. To some extent, this gap can befilled by cross-national studies now under-way, such as the World Health Organiza-tion's (WHO's) recent World Mental Health2000 research initiative being led by RonKessler at Harvard and T. Bedirhan Ustunat WHO, with collaborators in more than20 countries around the globe (Kessler,1999); the European School Survey Pro-ject on Alcohol and Drugs ( www.ipdt.pt/investigacao/espad99/indice.htm ); and cross-national studies supported by NIDAin Latin America (e.g., Brook et al., 2001),including our own PACARDO Project(Anthony, 2000). In the middle range, between the micro- cosm of the gene and the macrocosm ofglobal regions, we have collections of esti-mates for various social and geopoliticalgroups. In aggregate, these estimates canhelp us to draw generalizations about therelative magnitude of problems associatedwith drug taking of one sort or another(e.g., marijuana use versus cocaine use)or with criminal behavior of one sort ofanother (e.g., aggravated assault versusshoplifting or vandalism).Exhibit 9. A conceptual framework for research on the drugs-crime relationship The mainrubricsScale from microcosm to macrocosm Genes & simple gene productsIndividual organismsSocial groupsNations & global regions 1. Quantity 2. Location 3. Causes 4. Mechanism 5. Prevention & controlAB CD E F G HEven within the rubric of quantity, there are many gaps. For example, our quantita-tive estimates often are based strictly onofficially recognized offending and do notencompass unrecognized offending. Withrespect to drug taking, there is a plethoraof evidence on the prevalence of drug useand drug dependence but not much evi-dence on the incidence or risk of becom-ing drug dependent. Here, also, we havebig gaps in the evidence that warrantsome attention as we design an agendafor future research. The intersections of the location, causes, and mechanisms rubrics with the scaledimension brings us closer to evidence onvariation from place to place, time to time,or in relation to personal characteristics. Afew investigators have started to integrategenetic variation in their studies on suchtopics as drugs and crime, and soon wemay have more definitive evidence on therelative frequency of different polymor-phisms or gene-encoded protein productsfor different subgroups of the populationor in different geopolitical zones. Wecan expect ecological analyses of thebetween-subgroup and between-zonerates, with new evidence on location. Similarly, working outward from the sim- plest gene products to more complexproducts of gene-environment interaction,the sex hormones research of separateresearch groups led by Logan and byAngold, Costello, and others should pro-vide us with more evidence on rates ofantisocial behavior, drug use, and offend-ing in relation to levels of testosterone andother hormones before and after drug use(Logan, 2001; Federman et al., 1997). Theinitial evidence is not expected to allowcausal inference, but the understanding oflocational variation will allow us to sharpenour causal theories and to integrate newbiological perspectives on the drugs-crimerelationship. 52SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 In a middle position in this framework, somewhat overlapping the different segments, the important line of researchbeing conducted by Higley, Suomi, andtheir colleagues in relation to gene-environment interactions merits attention.This research, already mentioned in oneof the preceding sections, touches onaggressive behavior, social conditions ofchild rearing, and drug use. Using a pri-mate model, this research group has beenable to extend the line of research oninfant-mother relations that Harlow initiat-ed. The group is engaged in experimentalmanipulation of the early conditions ofinfant rearing, crossed with genetic predis-positions that in the wild have been foundto be related to aggressive behavior andexcess mortality. The evidence from thisresearch serves as an important exampleof how the effects of an apparently nox-ious inherited predisposition might bemodulated by a change in child-rearingenvironments. Does this animal model ofgene-environment interaction also hold foraggressive children, with later implicationsfor their drug-taking behavior? Questionssuch as this one merit discussion in rela-tion to the proposed drugs-crime researchagenda, if only to choose not to pursuethese lines of research. Turning to the last row of the framework, Ioffer some speculations about gaps in research on prevention and control. At thelevel of scale that reaches from micro-cosm to the whole organism, I see a gapin research on underlying brain structuresthat subserve neuropsychological func-tioning of clear importance in the choicebehavior of drug users and offenders. Tothe extent that drug users and offendersare making choices about various ele-ments in their behavioral repertoires, wemay be able to understand variations inresponse to prevention and control inter-ventions as a function of neuropsycholo-gical performance (e.g., with respect todirection, control, and planning). Our A few investigators have started to integrate genetic variation in their studies on such topics as drugs and crime.53TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY comprehension of this variation can increase through a program of researchon fMRI brain imaging and neuropsycho-logical testing under experimentally con-trolled paradigms (e.g., aggression evokedthrough computerized point subtraction orother procedures). In time, we should beable to evaluate the degree to which re-sponse to these interventions depends onbrain structure and function as manifest inneuropsychological tests as well as in re-sponse to genetic predispositions of thetype now being characterized in Suomi'sprimate laboratory and elsewhere. Working our way to the bottom right-hand side of this matrix, we find the intersec-tions with social groups and contexts ofincreasingly larger scale, not only the peergroup and family of origin or procreation,but also the larger neighborhood, employ-ment context, the community at large, andacross national boundaries. As we plotexamples of intervention research in thistwo-dimensional framework, it is easier tofind examples of individual investigationswith narrow breadth of scale. For example,we can find an intervention focused on thecommunity but without elements of inter-vention directed toward specific individualsin the community. We can find many in-terventions directed toward individualarrestees but not toward the social groupsof which the arrestees are members. One of the challenges for those who seek to shape the future research agenda ondrugs and crime will be to encouragebroadband research that cuts across multi-ple levels of scale. This is not to say thatwe should eliminate narrow-band researchbecause it often is necessary to solve aresearch problem through focus, andfocus is one of the defining characteristicsof narrow-band research. Nonetheless, aswe look over some of the more excitingresearch projects now underway, we cansee that the excitement is coming fromthe investigators' attempts to encompassmore than one level of scale. These attempts deserve encouragement. Before closing, we must turn to the empty spaces created in the circle but not includ-ed as part of the two-dimensional grid.Within these spaces, we have importantdrugs-crime research that does not fallneatly into the two-dimensional conceptu-al framework. I am thinking of the recentethnographic studies of the gangs in-volved in drug sales (e.g., Levitt andVenkatesh, 1998), and some of the other recent innovative qualitative research ondrug trafficking (e.g., Natarajan, Clarke,and Belanger, 1996; Natarajan and Be-langer, 1998), which shed new light on thestructure and organization of the criminalorganizations that sustain drug supply andinfluence drug-related criminal offendingaround the world. There also are goodrecent examples of operations researchfocused on the organization and adminis-tration of criminal justice agencies and thedeployment of law enforcement, prosecu-tion, and judicial resources (e.g., seeMaltz, 1996). To the extent that theseinvestigations guide us toward useful evi-dence about prevention and control, andto the extent that they focus on individualsor small groups of individuals (e.g., in acity or State), they may be placed in thespace on the left-hand side of the figure,between the grid and the surrounding circle. To the extent that these control-oriented investigations are directed to-ward international drug trafficking (e.g.,see Montagne, 1990), they may be placedin the space on the right-hand side of thefigure. There are other research programs and initiatives that do not fall neatly within thetwo-dimensional grid presented in exhibit9. Methodological research constitutesone set of examples (e.g., Wish et al.,2000; Harrison, 1997, 2001; Fendrich,2001). Proposed new research on drugprices and a consumer product index for One of the challenges forfuture / 03 illegal drugs represents another set (e.g., see Manski et al., 2001). As we move toward a new drugs-crime research agenda for NIJ and NIDA at theintersection of public health and criminaljustice studies, it is important to remem-ber the two major themes mentioned inthe introduction to this paper: There is no single drugs-crime relation-ship. Rather, there are drugs-crime rela-tionships, most of which are complexrather than simple. There is no simple solution to the com-plex challenges faced when drugs-crimerelationships come into play. The two-dimensional grid encircled in exhibit 9 offers no simple solutions to thecomplex challenges faced when drugs-crime relationships come into play. Thatgrid is only a tool that may help us identifyimportant gaps in the research evidence,gaps that must be filled as we work to-ward a more complete understanding ofthe drugs-crime relationship and moreeffective action plans that apply newunderstanding in the service of publichealth and safety. In an important sense,the empty spaces encircling the two-dimensional grid also can be useful toolsas we try to identify and fill the gaps in evi-dence. These empty spaces can serve toremind us that no conceptual frameworkis all encompassing. We must \"think out-side the box\" in this regard. If we organizeour scientific resources simply to continueour current lines of research, we will notachieve lasting reductions in illegal druguse and drug-related crimes, and we willnever lay claim to great victories in theservice of public health and safety.

C. Anthony,Electronic Collaboratory for InvestigationsAbout Drugs, JHU School of North Broadway,Room 893, Baltimore, MD 21205; e-mailjanthony@jhu.edu.65Introduction The association between drugs and crime in the public mind is so strong that arecent psychology experiment showedthe word \"drug\" tightly to deride publicignorance of all things criminological, inthis case the public is hardly deluded.Consider the following facts: 1 Across 35 cities in 1998, between 40and 80 percent of male arrestees inthe Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring(ADAM) Program tested positive for atleast one drug at arrest (Arrestee DrugAbuse Monitoring Program, 1999). Nearly one-quarter (22 percent) ofFederal prison inmates and one-third(33 percent) of State prison inmates\u2014nearly 40 percent of State inmates con-victed of robbery, burglary, or motorvehicle theft\u2014reported being under theinfluence of drugs at the time of theiroffense (Bureau of Justice Statistics,1997a, 1997b). Among State and Federal prisoninmates, 27 percent of those servingsentences for robbery and 30-32 per-cent of those serving sentences for bur-glary said they committed their offenseto buy drugs (Bureau of Justice Statistics,1991a, 1991b). In the 70 percent of cases in which thevictim formed an opinion, 31 percentbelieved the offender was under the influence of drugs or alcohol (NationalCrime Victimization Survey, 2000). A recent estimate of the economiccosts of drug abuse reported that 60percent were associated with crime andcriminal justice (Harwood, Fountain, andLivermore, 1998). Considerable complexities and nuances underlie these associations. Althoughmany of these subtleties were anticipatedby astute observers in the 1970s (seeGandossy et al., 1980), the past decadehas seen a solid scholarly consensus formaround the following principles (seeFagan, 1990; Parker and Auerhahn, 1998;White and Gorman, 2000): 1. Many different data sources establish a raw correlation between drug useand other criminal offenses. But corre-lation does not equal causation: Inprinciple, drug use might cause (pro-mote, encourage) crime; criminalitymight cause (promote, encourage)drug use; and/or by some setof \"third variables\"\u2014environmental,situational, dispositional, and/or biolog-ical. In fact, all three pathways haveempirical support in at least some set-tings and populations. 2. These causal influences are probabilis- tic, not deterministic. Most drug usersare not otherwise criminally active,and the vast majority of drug-usingincidents neither cause nor accom-pany other forms of criminality.Research on Drugs-Crime Linkages: The Next Generation Robert MacCoun, Beau Kilmer, and Peter Reuter About the Authors Robert MacCoun is with the Goldman School of Public Policy and Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program at Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California at Berkeley.

These causal influences are contin- gent, not unconditional. There is littleevidence that drug use per se directlycauses people to become aggressivein some direct and unconditional man-ner or that criminality per se causessomeone to use drugs. The drugs-crime link varies across individuals,over time within an individual's devel-opment, across situations, and possi-bly over time periods (as a function ofthe dynamics of drug epidemics and,possibly, drug control policies). 4. That drug use can causally influence criminality does not necessarily impli-cate the psychopharmacological prop-erties of the drug. Intoxication, theneed or desire to raise money to buydrugs, and the nature of illicit marketsare distinct mechanisms by whichdrugs can cause crime. Thus, drugprohibition cannot be only a response to drug-related crime, but it may alsobe a causal antecedent to some drug- related crime. 5. Alcohol is a drug, and it stimulates or augments a great deal of criminalbehavior, almost certainly more thanthe street drugs combined. We expect that understanding the consid- erable heterogeneity of effects acrossusers, substances, factors\u2014will be the centralfocus of drugs-crime research during theremainder of this decade. This paperreviews the existing literature, focusingparticular attention on Goldstein's (1985)taxonomy, the temporal dynamics of drugmarkets, and the consequences of prohibi-tion. These highlight some of the ques-tions that should drive this research.Drugs-crime linkages: Expanding the Goldstein taxonomy Goldstein's framework Paul Goldstein's (1985) conceptual essay offered a tripartite classification of drugs-violence connections: Psychopharmacological: Violence due to the direct acute effects of a psy-choactive drug on the user. Economic-compulsive: Violence com- mitted instrumentally to generatemoney to purchase expensive drugs. Systemic: Violence associated with the marketing of illicit drugs, such as turfbattles, contract disputes, and so on. Goldstein and his colleagues (Brownstein et al., 1992; Goldstein et al., 1989; Goldstein,Brownstein, and Ryan, 1992) applied thisscheme empirically to homicides in NewYork State (1984) and New York City (1988). They found that drugs and alcoholwere important causes for a large share ofall homicides in both samples. For 1988,near the height of the crack epidemic,they classified 53 percent of 414 homi-cides as drug or alcohol related; there wasalso a substantial percentage whose drug-relatedness could not be determined. Ofthose homicides that could be determinedto be drug or alcohol related, 14 percentwere psychopharmacological (68 percentalcohol, 16 percent crack), 4 percent wereeconomic-compulsive, and 74 percentwere systemic (61 percent crack, 27 per-cent powder cocaine). By contrast, in1984, before the crack surge, only 42 per-cent of homicides were drug or alcoholrelated; 59 percent of those were psy-chopharmacological (79 percent alcohol),3percent were economic-compulsive, and 21 percent were systemic. The difference67TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY between the findings of the two years might reflect differences in geography tosome extent (New York State versus NewYork City), but it also reminds us that these numbers are not eternal verities;they result from complex and historicallydependent market dynamics. Subsequent applications The generalizability of Goldstein et al.'s(1989) original findings was limited bytheir location (New York) and timing (theheight of the crack explosion; see U.S.Sentencing Commission, 1995, 106). 2 Many studies have tried to determinewhether crimes were drug related, butfew have assessed whether the offend-er's drug need, drug use, or role in thedrug market was directly responsible forthe crime. Although most of the studiesthat used this framework were conductedby Goldstein and his colleagues in NewYork (Parker and Auerhahn, 1998), there are others worthy of attention, especiallygiven their unique approaches. Generalfindings include the following: 1. Non-NDRI (National Development and Research Institutes, Inc.) studies ofNew York City in the mid- to late1980s found that crack sellers aremore violent than other drug sellersand that their violence is not con-fined to the drug-selling context (U.S.Sentencing Commission, 1995, citingFagan and Chin, 1990). 2. Studies of juvenile delinquents in Miami in the mid- to late 1980s foundthat they were much more likely tocommit a drug-related economic-compulsive crime than a psychophar-macological or systemic crime(Inciardi, 1990). 3 3. The per capita drug-related homicide rate remained fairly stable in Chicagofrom 1973 to 1984 and fluctuatedfrom 1985 to 1995 (data are from theChicago Homicide Dataset; Block, Block, and Illinois Criminal JusticeInformation Authority, 1998). Despitethe fluctuations, the 1995 homiciderate was strikingly similar to the 1985rate for all drug-related motives exceptfor homicides that resulted from adrug transaction; the latter increasedtenfold from 1985 to 1995. 4. Results from Lattimore et al.'s (1997) homicide study of eight cities, whichincluded surveys of local officials andADAM/UCR (Uniform Crime Reports)analyses for 1985-94, suggest thatdrugs other than cocaine and crackwere not associated with homicidetrends \"in any discernible way.\" Theyalso found that the drug market struc-ture was less associated with violencethan was expected. The Lattimore et al. study questioned the role of crack and systemic crime becausethe crack markets were described as high-ly competitive in cities where the homi-cide rate was declining, increasing, orremaining the same (1997, p. 89). It is notclear, however, that the same conclusionscould be drawn if disaggregated homiciderates (by circumstance) were considered.(Additional discussion and methodologicaldescriptions of these studies are reportedin appendix A.) Limitations of existing research on the Goldstein framework The Goldstein tripartite framework has been a boon to drug research reviewers\u2014it is invaluable as an organizing scheme\u2014but still, we are struck by the relative rarityof actual empirical applications. Existingapplications overrepresent New York, andthey overrepresent the crack epidemic atits height relative to earlier and later peri-ods. In fairness, the taxonomy was notproposed until 1985, but it could be ap-plied retrospectively to earlier homicidecase files. In our view, such comparisonsMany studies have tried determinewhether REPORT / JULY 03 would be invaluable. There has been little consistency in the methods used toimplement the scheme (e.g., Goldstein'strained coders versus Inciardi's surveyapproach). Little has been learned fromthat methodological diversity because, toour knowledge, no two methods haveever been applied to the same sample ofcases for comparative purposes. Indeed, ifone imagines a three-dimensional matrixof major cities by time periods by meth-ods, almost every cell is empty and thereare almost no vectors with more than onecell occupied. This spotty record makes ithard to identify either temporal trends orthe influence of local variations on drugpopularity, drug market structures, or poli-cies and enforcement practices. Finally,the scheme has been applied mostly tohomicide and less often to other, moreprevalent violent crimes. 4 Parker and Auerhahn (1998) complain thatGoldstein's categories are not mutuallyexclusive. This critique presumes a classi-cal set-theoretic approach that, in our opin-ion, is neither feasible nor scientificallyuseful for drugs-violence research. Mu-tually exclusive categories are not neces-sary for scientific classification (Meehl,1995), and they are usually impossible toachieve using sparse and noisy archivaldata (Ragin, 2000). But we agree withParker and Auerhahn's (1998) contentionthat \"the Goldstein tripartite framework . . .is not treated as a set of testable proposi-tions but rather as a set of assumptionsabout the nature of drug- and alcohol-related violence.\" In our view, an understanding of the taxo- metric properties of drug-related violenceought to emerge inductively from morefine-grained coding of the underlying fea-tures of these events\u2014whether variousdrugs were found as evidence, the resultsof toxicology on the offender and the vic-tim, various features of witness reports,prior record information, and so on. Be-cause each property or attribute would becoded separately, there would be no effort to force events into a single classification.Psychometric analysis could be used totest the hypothesized latent structure. 5 Such analyses pose enormous logisticaldifficulties, but the payoffs for advancingour understanding of drug violence wouldsurely justify the effort. In the remainder of this section, we will examine other ways in which Goldstein'staxonomic scheme might be expandedand refined. Psychopharmacological violence The prevailing view about psychophar-macological (as opposed to economic-compulsive or systemic) violence is that itis rare and attributable mostly to alcoholrather than illicit drugs (Fagan, 1990;Parker and (1990,p. 243): lead to . . . onlylimited evidence that consumption ofalcohol, cocaine, heroin, or other sub-stances is a direct, pharmacologicallybased cause of crime. According to Parker and Auerhahn (1998, p. 306): Our review of the literature finds a great deal of evidence that the socialenvironment is a much more power-ful contributor to the outcome of violent behavior than are pharmaco-logical factors associated with any ofthe substances reviewed here. 6 The Goldstein et al. (1989) analysis pro-vides some support for these claims; only14 percent of the drug-related homicidesappeared to be psychopharmacological,and these largely involved alcohol eitheralone or in combination with other drugs.But one in seven is hardly a trivial fraction,The prevailing view about psychophar- macological (as opposed to economic- compulsive or systemic) violence is that it is rare and attributable mostly to alcohol rather than illicit drugs.69TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY and those results reflect the peak of the crack market wars, when systemic homi-cides were occurring in unprecedentednumbers, inflating the denominator. Moderators. Examining the literature cited in many recent review essays, it isdifficult to avoid the suspicion that someauthors hold neuropharmacological factorsto a stricter standard of proof than thesociological factors under study. If the psy-chopharmacological claim is that marijua-na, heroin, or cocaine ingestion directlypromotes violent behavior absent any situ-ational provocation or stressors, then thatclaim is probably false. But evidence forDrug xSituation and Drug xPsychology interaction effects hardly exonerates druguse as a causal factor. It may be that nodrug is sufficient to produce aggression inisolation from psychological and situationalmoderators. But it seems clear that somedrugs\u2014certainly alcohol\u2014can amplify Miller, and Pollock, 1996). Expectancy effects: personal and cultur-al beliefs about the effect of the drug onbehavior, and local norms about tolera-ble versus unacceptable conduct whenunder the influence (e.g., Critchlow,1986; Stacy, Widaman, and Marlatt,1990). Disinhibition (e.g., Parker and Auerhahn,1998; but see Fagan, 1990). Impaired cognitive functioning, includ-ing reduced executive functioning (self-control and decisionmaking ability;Fishbein, 2000; Giancola, 2000), reducedattention to situational cues (Steele and Josephs, 1990), and reduced self-attention (Ito, Miller, and Pollock, 1996). Social threats to self-identity or self-esteem (Baumeister, Smart, and Boden,1996) that honor\" (see Anderson,1994; Bourgois, 1996; Cohen et al.,1996). Moreover, the absence of evidence does not equal evidence of absence; the labora-tory literature on drugs and aggression issimply too spotty at present to permit anyfirm conclusions. Almost the entire experi-mental literature on moderators of thedrugs-aggression relationship has exam-ined alcohol rather than illicit drugs. Comorbidity: Drugs in association with mental illness or alcoholism. A second potential class of moderators of the drugs-aggression link involve comorbid condi-tions\u2014substance abuse in tandem withschizophrenia or other psychoses, person-ality disorders, or alcoholism. Numerousstudies have identified a high prevalenceof illicit substance abuse among individu-als diagnosed with psychiatric disorders(e.g., Compton et al., 2000; Kessler et al.,1996; Mueser et al., 2000). 7The causal nexus of these comorbid conditions isunclear. The MacArthur Violence RiskAssessment Study (Steadman et al.,1998), a prospective followup study ofclients admitted to acute psychiatric inpa-tient facilities, found that substance abuseincreased the probability of violent behav-ior, but this was true for both psychiatricpatients and matched community con-trols. Neither drug dependence nor psychi-atric illness predicted subsequent violentcrime in a 6-year followup of released jaildetainees firmconclusions.70SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Drug use and victimization8 Increased victimization provides another mechanism by which drugs can becomelinked with violence. Although this catego-ry can be subsumed under Goldstein'spsychopharmacological category, treatingit as a fourth category might have meritbecause the causal mechanisms differand it has been largely neglected by re-searchers. There are a number of reasonsto expect that drug users ought to be par-ticularly vulnerable to criminal victimiza-tion, especially when intoxicated. First,intoxicated people often appear (andsometimes are) more vulnerable thanother targets for such offenses as robbery,rape, or hate crimes. Second, intoxicatedpeople are often obnoxious, annoying,and/or offensive in their appearance, conduct, and speech. Third, intoxicationmakes people's conduct unpredictable andambiguous\u2014intoxication impairs the per-ception of signals, but it also impairs thetransmission of clear signals to others.Finally, in an active illicit drug market, drugsellers are sometimes both intoxicatedand flush with cash. Fagan (1990) notes that the vulnerability of drug users to victimization has been longrecognized. For example, Wolfgang (1958)studied \"victim-precipitated homicides\" byassessing the incidence of intoxicationamong (1990) reviewsevidence from animal studies showingthat \"substances that induce changes inan opponent's behavior might result inincreased aggression by a drug-freeattacker . . .\" (p. 251). Although Goldstein (1985) acknowledged that the victimization of drug users consti-tuted a distinct drugs-violence linkage, hedid not include it as a separate category inhis classification scheme. Since then, thevictimization of drug users has received lit-tle attention in the drugs and crime litera-ture. This is not surprising given howdifficult it is to assess the relationship. First, as Goldstein (1985) argues, it is diffi-cult to obtain this information because vic-tims do not want to talk to the police whileintoxicated and often do not rememberthe details of the offense; thus, it maygo unreported. Second, the victimizationsurveys that ask about substance use usu-ally include it as a predictor but do not askwhether it contributed to a specific event.Third, many of these surveys only askabout (or report) general drug use, notabout specific drugs or the circumstancesof their use. Finally, the label \"victim\" isoften problematic when the participantsare codisputants; indeed, the \"victim\"may have initiated the provocation. In ourview, these concerns are valid, but theydo not undermine the importance of vic-timization as a research topic. The ubiquity of alcohol has made it the subject of victimization work for 50 years,and there is general agreement about itsrole in victimizations, especially sexualassaults. The research on drugs is not asrobust, but there are some important find-ings that should be addressed in futureworks on drugs and crime. The followingsections provide insight about this rela-tionship by examining existing victimiza-tion studies of the general population,women, and hard drug users. The general population. The Nation's largest victimization survey, the NationalCriminal Victimization Survey (NCVS), doesnot ask about victim drug use, but it isused in conjunction with other data to pro-vide insight about drugs and crime. UsingNCVS, Markowitz's (2000) multivariateanalysis of almost 450,000 observationsfound that marijuana decriminalization (aproxy for lower marijuana prices) willresult in a higher incidence of robbery andassault while higher cocaine prices willdecrease these crimes. 9Neither measure was significantly related to rape or sexualassault. When victims' perceptions of71TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY offender drug and alcohol use during assaults were used as the dependent variable, the significance of marijuanadecriminalization and cocaine prices wasambiguous (significance depends onmodel specification). For perceived useduring robberies, neither was significant.Although Markowitz suggests the percep-tion variable is questionable because ofunderreporting, these findings raise ques-tions about the causal relationship andthe role of drug use by victims, especiallymarijuana. Based on an instrument similar to NCVS, Fisher et al.'s (1998) survey of 3,472 ran-domly selected college students foundthat regularly taking recreational drugs pre-dicted an increased likelihood of a violentvictimization but not of a theft victimiza-tion. For the general population, Cottler etal.'s (1992) survey of a probability sampleof 2,663 household residents found thatthose who had used cocaine or heroinmore than five times in their lives weremore than three times as likely to haveexperienced a physical attack than non-users. Those who used marijuana morethan five times (no use of other drugs) andthose who used pills or hallucinogensmore than five times were no more likelyto have experienced a physical attack thannonusers. This is one of the few studiesthat presents its results by drug and raisesquestions about the situations in whichhard drug users put themselves. Women. Much of the victimization research focuses on women becausemany of the studies are about sexualassault. Fisher, Cullen, and Turner (2000)randomly selected 4,446 college womento participate in their National CollegeWomen Victimization Study. That study did not find that marijuana use was a sig-nificant predictor of sexual victimizationand stalking. 10These findings are consis- tent with Markowitz's claim that the priceof cocaine and marijuana are not signifi-cant predictors of sexual victimization.Beyond using prices and self-reports, some researchers have drug-testedrape victims to assess their drug use.Hindmarch and Brinkmann (1999) foundthat 41 percent of the 1,033 participantstested negative for alcohol and otherdrugs, 37 percent tested positive for alco-hol, 19 percent tested positive for cannabi-noids, and 0.6 percent tested positive forflunitrazepam (Rohypnol); however, thelack of information about participant char-acteristics and site locations would pre-vent researchers from creating thenecessary control groups. Drug users. Tardiff et al. (1994) found that 31 percent of one sample of homi-cide victims tested positive for cocainemetabolites. This rate did not vary forfirearm deaths versus nonfirearm deaths.McElrath, Chitwood, and receiving methadoneand/or inpatient drug treatment about theirvictimization and drug use in the previous6 months. Those reporting heroin usewere significantly less likely to be victimsof violent and property crimes. McElrathet al. argue that heroin users sometimeshave \"running partners\" who may alsolook out for each other, thus decreasingvictimization. Crack cocaine users werefour times as likely to be victims of proper-ty crime than nonusers, leading theauthors to suggest, \"it is possible that thedrug-seeking behavior associated withcrack-cocaine places users in contact witha larger pool of motivated offenders.\" Drug-user-on-drug-user crime was also addressed in Inciardi's delinquency study(1990). Respondents were asked aboutnot only drug-related offenses they com-mitted but also drug-related victimizations;4.6 percent reported being victims of psychopharmacological-related crimes,39.9 percent reported being victims ofdrug robberies, and 9.0 percent reportedbeing victims of systemic violence.72SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Although every youth in the survey used at least one drug daily, it is not clearwhether the victimizations occurred whilethe victim was under the influence. Crime victim surveys and offender surveys require respondents to make attributionsabout the causes of offenders' behavior.Such causal attributions are susceptible tonumerous well-documented biases (e.g.,Nisbett and Ross, 1980), but to date therehas been little methodological work vali-dating these survey responses. Economic-compulsive violence Arrested and incarcerated offenders reportthat they committed their offenses toraise money to purchase drugs. Of course,this might be a convenient rationalizationor excuse for antisocial behavior. Shouldwe believe them? At least for heroin addiction, the answer is probably yes. Studies of heroin \"careers\"show that the frequency of criminal activi-ty tends to covary with periods of intenseuse (see Fagan, 1990, for review), andaddicts significantly reduce their criminalinvolvement during periods of methadonemaintenance (see review in Rettig andYarmolinsky, 1995). But in studies applying the Goldstein taxonomy (see above), economic-compulsive criminality has beenrelatively rare. White and Gorman (2000)argue, \"[B]ecause there is more money incrack distribution than in previous illegaldrug markets, drug dealing may have obvi-ated the need to commit property crimesand income-generating violent crimes\"(p. 189). Indeed, in our survey of drug sell-ers in Washington, D.C., in the late 1980s(Reuter, MacCoun, and Murphy, 1990),more than 40 percent reported keepingsome drugs for their own consumption\u201439 percent of crack sellers and 69 percentof heroin sellers. However, the claimabout the high returns for crack selling isprobably no longer correct. Bourgois(1996) reports that proceeds from cracksales by experienced users who could not maintain legitimate jobs were less thanminimum wage. 11 But the argument that drug selling hasreplaced other income-generating crimemight reflect limitations of recent work.First, as we have noted, most studiesapplying the Goldstein framework wereconducted at the peak of the crack epi-demic, when the sheer prevalence ofstreet drug sales was probably at an all-time high (see Saner, MacCoun, andReuter, 1995). Second, most studies havelargely examined crimes with violent out-comes rather than robberies or burglariesin which no homicide occurred. Oneexception is the Caulkins et al. (1997)study, which attributed a substantial fraction of robberies and burglaries to economic-compulsive crime, and a size-able fraction of those economic-compul-sive crimes to cocaine. The ADAM Program provides some oppor- tunities for studying these issues (e.g.,Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program,1999). The ADAM/DUF (Drug Use Fore-casting) instrument was modified in 1995to include a question asking whether thearrestee needed drugs or alcohol at thetime of the offense. 12Appendix B summa- rizes data for the period 1995 to 1999 forthis survey item. As one would expect,these attributions are more common forincome-generating offenses (14 percent)than for non-income-generating offenses(10 percent)\u2014a reliable but quite modestdifference. Our understanding and interpretation of economic-compulsive crime ought toevolve as the scientific understandingof drug dependence evolves. Recentdecades have seen great progress in theunderstanding of such phenomena as tolerance, withdrawal, reinforcement, anddrug craving (see Science, 1997). Leshner (1997, pp. 45-46) notes that many assumethe following:73TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY [T]he more dramatic the physical withdrawal symptoms, the more seri-ous or dangerous the drug must be.This thinking is outdated . . . many ofthe most addicting and produce severe physicalsymptoms upon withdrawal. . . .What does matter tremendously iswhether or not a drug causes whatwe now know to be the essence ofaddiction: compulsive drug seekingand use, even in the face of negativehealth and social consequences. There are also intriguing new findings from behavioral economics research on theprice elasticity of demand for cocaine andopiates\u2014the percentage decline in de-mand for a 1-percent increase in price. Theconventional wisdom is that addicts arerelatively insensitive to price, at least in theshort run, because they are enslaved totheir drug and must find ways to obtain itto avoid withdrawal symptoms. If addictswere relatively insensitive to price, onewould expect price increases to produceincreased economic-compulsive crime. Butrecent studies (reviewed in Caulkins andReuter, pricesensitivity, elasticities for cocaineranging from -0.7 to -2.0. A possibleexplanation for the high elasticity amongheavy users is that they spend most oftheir earnings on the drug and may re-spond to the increased difficulty of main-taining desired consumption levels (i.e.,avoiding withdrawal) by seeking treatment. Systemic violence The third of Goldstein's categories is sys-temic violence. This has been narrowlyinterpreted as referring to struggles forcompetitive advantage. We suggest herethat drug markets generate violence in avariety of ways and that market violencevaries systematically over time and place. A brief history of the markets. There was an epidemic of initiation into heroinuse in the 1970s; after that, heroin initia-tion rates remained low until the late1990s. The number of heroin addicts (afunction of the number of initiates and thelength of their addiction careers) remainedfairly stable at about 750,000 from 1981 to1997. 13During that period, most heroin purchases were made by an aging cohortof experienced users. Powder cocaine and crack had a similar dynamic, only with different parameters.Powder cocaine initiation rates were highfrom about 1975 to 1988; the number ofdependent users has been quite stablesince about 1988. The crack epidemiccame later, from about 1982 to 1990(depending on the city; see Blumstein andCork, 1996). Estimates of the number ofdependent users of either crack or powdercocaine range from 600,000 to 3,600,000(see Rhodes et al., 2000). Many retailers are now also frequent users (Arrestee Drug Abuse MonitoringProgram, 1999). Selling seems to beopportunistic for many users; suddenaccess to an unusually large source ofcash may lead a regular buyer to becomea seller for a day. Thus, at the low end ofthe market, it may be difficult to distin-guish systemic from psychopharmacologi-cal violence. Enforcement against these markets, as measured by years of jail time per ton ofdrugs, probably declined through the early1980s but then intensified from 1985onward. In 1990, the Colombian govern-ment aggressively attacked the principalexporters of cocaine from Colombia.There are a number of indications thatthis led to a temporary tightening of thecocaine market; otherwise, prices havedeclined throughout the period, while con-sumption has been declining modestlysince 1988.74SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Conceptual issues. The markets for illegal drugs operate without the usual protec-tions against fraud and violence offered bythe civil tort system. The state, instead ofattempting to facilitate transactions, aimsto disrupt them. Contracts cannot beenforced through written documents andthe legal system; agreements are madehurriedly, sometimes in ambiguous code,and orally. 14Territories cannot be allocated through bidding for desirable locationsbecause there is no enforceable owner-ship of property for these purposes. Yet the illegality itself is insufficient to gen- erate high levels of violence in the market.Prostitution, although frequently unsightlyand sometimes a nuisance, does not gen-erate much by way of additional violence.Bookmaking, notwithstanding the dramaof the film \"The Sting,\" was also a gener-ally peaceful affair; bookies were morelikely to die in bed than on the job. Evenfor some drugs, the markets generate lit-tle violence; marijuana in general does notspark much injury as the result of compe-titive or transactional disputes. 15 Some drug markets, however, are clearlyviolent; many participants are at risk ofbeing killed or seriously wounded by oth-ers in the same business, either as buyersor sellers, and there are unintended shoot-ings of innocent bystanders. The crackmarket is thought to be particularly proneto market-related violence. Why are these drug markets, particularly for crack, so violent? We suggest that fourfactors contribute: 1.The youth of participants. Rates for violent crime peak early, at about ages18-22. The young are particularly likelyto lack foresight and thus engage inviolence to settle disputes. The crackmarket was the first mass drug mar-ket in which most of the sellers wereyoung.2.The value of the drugs themselves. The cocaine that fills a plastic sand-wich bag is worth thousands of dol-lars. The return to sudden, situationalviolence could be very high. 3.The intensity of law enforcement. Transactions are conducted under considerable uncertainty as a conse-quence of increased law enforcement.Intensified enforcement increases theincentives for violence by raising theadverse consequences of identifyingsomeone as a potential informant. 4.The indirect consequence of drug use. Users are more violent and aggres-sive, and this encourages dealers toprefer selling out of doors or in highlyprotected settings. It also promotesunreliable behavior among user/dealers and thus more retaliation bytheir suppliers. It is probably the combination of these fac- tors, rather than any one of them, thataccounts for the extraordinary violenceassociated with crack markets in the late1980s. That violence seems to have fallensubstantially in the late 1990s, perhapsreflecting the aging of participants in crackmarkets (Golub and Johnson, 1997), al-though violence itself, as well as enforce-ment, may also have selected out themost violent participants; Taylor, Caulkins,and Reuter (2000) present a model inwhich violence declines with more intenseenforcement as a consequence of selec-tive incarceration. Competitive and internal violence. Attention has been given to violence gen-erated by competition between sellers.Less attention has been given to violencewithin selling organizations, although theolder literature on organized crime and ille-gal markets reported a great deal on this(e.g., Block, 1980).75TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Criminal organizations are hindered inter- nally by lack of access to the civil courts.Employment contracts cannot be enforcedexcept privately. Managerial succession iscomplicated by the specificity of reputa-tion within the organization; a promisingmidlevel manager cannot readily provideevidence of performance to anotherpotential employer so higher level man-agers get weaker market signals and maywithhold deserved promotions or meritincreases. This gives incentives to lowerlevel agents to use violence for upwardmobility. Symmetrical with successional violence is disciplinary violence. Managers have rea-son to fear subordinates who can provideevidence against them; the longer lastingthe relationship, the greater the potentialfor harm from informing. Thus, managersmay use violence as a tool to reduce risksof informing. They have more incentivefor doing so than do high-level dealers intransactions with low-level dealers be-cause the information about these actswill spread more rapidly and extensively. 16 There are numerous stories of this kindof violence in Colombian drug-dealingorganizations. Thus, the violence in atomistic markets has different sources than that in marketsserviced by larger selling organizations.Which generates greater violence from agiven set of participants cannot be deter-mined theoretically, but some of thedecline in market-related violence may reflect changes in organizational structure. Other market characteristics and vio- lence. Exhibit 1 presents a simple classifi- cation of markets according to whetherbuyers and sellers come from the neigh-borhood or elsewhere. We believe thatthis taxonomy, originally identified for pur-poses of analyzing vulnerability to enforce-ment (Reuter and MacCoun, 1992), mayalso be useful in the study of violence.Markets characterized by mostly residentdealers and customers are labeled local markets. Export markets are ones in which residents of the neighborhood selldrugs to nonresidents. Markets in whichmostly nonresident dealers sell to localresidents are characterized here as import markets. Finally, markets in which both sellers and customers are mostly nonresi-dents are labeled here as public markets because they tend to occur at such largepublic locations as parks, train or bus sta-tions, or schoolyards. Each class of market differs in the poten- tial for violence. Local markets, preciselybecause they involve buyers and sellerswho know each other, do not lend them-selves to territorial competition. At theother extreme are public markets, inwhich buyers and sellers cannot readilyfind each other except at specific loca-tions; the incentives for territoriality areconsequently greater. Exhibit 1. Types of illicit drug markets Customers Dealers Mostly residents Mostly outsiders Mostly residents Local market Export market Mostly outsiders Import market Public marketThe violence in atomistic marketshas 03 Transactional violence may also vary in these dimensions. Local markets discour-age cheating of buyers as a consequenceof the ongoing connections between buy-ers and sellers; a local customer is morelikely to spread information effectively toother potential customers than one whohas little connection to other buyers. It isnot clear whether much of the transac-tional violence comes from buyers, asopposed to associates and rival sellers. If this is correct, then the maturation of cocaine and heroin markets will tend toreduce market-related violence by reduc-ing the size of all but local markets. More-over, as a result of the dissemination ofbeepers and cell phones, an increasingshare of cocaine transactions may beoccurring in locations (apartments, restau-rants, offices) that are agreed on by thebuyer and seller for their mutual conven-ience. Johnson, Golub, and Dunlap (2000,p. 191, table 6.1) report that in New YorkCity in the 1990s, the \"seller style\" includ-ed phone and delivery services as well asfreelancers. Poor and socially isolatedcocaine users still frequently conducttransactions in exposed locations, chosenprecisely because they facilitate the com-ing together of buyers and sellers. Soprobably do many heroin addicts, giventheir generally impoverished state. Theability to choose locations on the basis ofspecific situational need not only reducesterritorially motivated violence but alsoreduces the vulnerability of buyers to robbery and other victimization becausefewer of them need to congregate at spe-cific locations, which thus become lessattractive to predators. The temporal dynamics of drug markets In the past several years, numerous authors have examined the emergenceand decline of crack markets as a key factor in the steep rise in American vio- lence from 1985 to 1990, and the evensteeper drop since 1993 (see Blumsteinand Wallman, 2000). In our view, the casefor crack's role in the crime rise is quitecompelling; its role in the post-1993decrease is more subtle and by no meansan open-and-shut case. Many discussions of the crime drop fail to distinguish between a decline in thecrack market and a decline in the linkagebetween crack and crime\u2014but a decline inthe crack-crime link is part of the crimedrop outcome to be explained. It is truethat DUF (and now ADAM) data showdeclines in positive cocaine tests amongarrestees in many cities (e.g., ArresteeDrug Abuse Monitoring Program, 1999).And the reduced violence attributable tocrack selling has made crack markets lessvisible. But nationwide, hardcore cocaineuse remained surprisingly stable duringthe 1990s (Rhodes et al., 2000). Indeed,from 1990 to 1998, there were risingcocaine mentions in emergency rooms(Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration, 2001) and risingcocaine seizures. Nevertheless, recentmulticity comparisons (Baumer et al.,1998; Lattimore et al., 1997) indicate reli-able positive correlations between variousindices of crack use and homicide andother offense rates. Various experts have suggested that the changing dynamics of drug markets maymatter as much or more as any decline intotal market activity (e.g., Ousey and Lee,2000). Below, we consider a few morecomplex accounts of the link betweencrack market dynamics and violence. NDRI'S conduct norm account. Johnson and his colleagues at NDRI (Lipton andJohnson, 1998) have produced a valuableinterdisciplinary, multimethod program ofresearch on street drug markets in NewYork, spanning several decades. TheyThe case for crack's role in the crime rise is quite compelling; its role in the post-1993 decrease is more subtle. 77TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY recently offered an account of the decline in drug-related violence based on thenotion of \"conduct norms\" (Johnson,Golub, and Dunlap, 2000), arguing thatNew York street drug markets havepassed through three phases. (They vacillate between \"period\" and \"cohort\"versions of the story.) The \"marijuana/blunts era\"started around 1990. Associated witheach era are distinct birth cohorts with dis-tinctive behavioral patterns. \"HeroinGen\"drug users (born 1945-54) were active indrug sales and property crime, but gunuse was relatively rare. \"CrackGen\" drugusers (born 1955-69) frequently participat-ed in robbery and used guns for protectionand reputation. Finally, \"BluntGen\" drugusers (born 1970-79) are less likely thanearly cohorts to engage in violence. Drawing on their rich ethnographic data- base, Johnson and colleagues (2000)argue that these behavior changes reflecttwo successive transformations of con-duct norms for appropriate behavior in thedrug-using community. For \"Subculture of Assault,\" . . those who attempt to sell crack inyour territory. Maintain your reputation asdangerous, tough, and 'crazy,' regardlessof the physical harm inflicted or suffered\"(p. 181). But for the BluntGen, Crackheads ares---! Addicts are the scum of the earth.Stay safe, stay alive. Don't mix cocaineor heroin with my marijuana. Shun andexclude heroin and crack users from peergroups\" (p. 185). This norm account is fascinating and quite plausible. From a policy perspective, itwould be tremendously useful to findaway to preserve and promote the BluntGen's more pacifist stance (thoughnot, of course, their consumption of blunts). Still, the evidence is causallyambiguous. Are these conduct normsactually causes of the decline in violence during the 1990s, are they descriptions of it, or are they consequences of it? There is little doubt that conduct norms exist and are important in shaping deviantbehavior. Cialdini, Kallgren, and Reno(1991) make a useful distinction betweeninjunctive norms (what others think I should do) and descriptive norms (what others are actually doing). There is ampleevidence that purely descriptive norms\u2014changes in the local prevalence of abehavior\u2014can have a self-reinforcingaction. But attitudes and norms areshaped by behavior as well as shaping it;research on cognitive dissonance theoryand self-perception theory suggest thatsuch conformity-based behavioral changeswill tend to produce corresponding (butretrospective) changes in relevant atti-tudes (see Eagly and Chaiken, 1993).Controlled social psychology experimentsshow that norm diffusion effects occurand that they can be strong, but theseexperiments also show that apparentnorm effects are sometimes spurious(e.g., Kerr et al., 1987). Clearly, research on drug-using norms can- not move to the laboratory\u2014although onecan imagine informative scenario-basedexperiments embedded in field inter-views. But it would be enormously usefulto make additional use of the NDRI data(and related data sources, such as theOffice of National Drug Control Policy'sPulse Check ), linking the timing of the ethnographic material more precisely tomonth-to-month quantitative archival dataon drug selling (or its proxies) and violentcrimes. Furthermore, archives of ethno-graphic data collected in different citiesduring the past decade might be reana-lyzed to search for cross-city norm differ-ences that might correlate with cross-citydifferences in violent crime. Ideally, one78SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 might develop methods for identifying \"leading indicators\" of emerging trends indrug using, Blumstein and Cork's drug-gun diffu- sion articles Blumstein and Cork,1996; Cork hypothesize acausal chain linking the late 1980s crackepidemic to rising violence nationwide.According to Blumstein, the 1980s growthin illicit drug markets, together with strin-gent enforcement crackdowns, led to therecruitment of juvenile drug sellers. Theintense market competition together withthe recruitment and rewarding of particu-larly aggressive youths created a need forsellers (as well as nonseller youths in mar-ket neighborhoods) to be armed. Thisincreased demand fueled an expansion inthe illicit gun market and a diffusion ofguns. The linkage between drug sellingand gun possession is well established(see Decker, Pennell, and Caldwell 1997;Sheley, 1994; Tardiff et al., 1994). 17Cork (1999) found support for the temporalsequence of the Blumstein account usinga sophisticated diffusion modeling analysisof time-series data from multiple cities. The Blumstein model is a compelling account of the rise of violent crime, butmore work is needed to establish itsexplanatory power as an account of thesubsequent decline in violence. The modelis not inconsistent with that decline\u2014adecline in the crack market should havereduced the need to be armed\u2014but futureresearch will have to assess whetherdeclines in the prevalence of drug selling(as opposed to changes in other featuresof the markets) have produced reductionsin the likelihood of gun possession andgun violence. The maturation of addicts and of illicit drug markets. Because of reduced initia- tion rates, it appears that the hardcorecocaine-using population consists mostly of an aging cohort who started using inthe late 1980s, in much the same waythat heroin addicts disproportionatelybelong to cohorts who initiated use in the1970s. If this is correct, drug-related crimi-nality should continue to decline, absentnew waves of initiation, as addicts \"matureout\" of violent crime or die from drug-related illnesses or natural causes. Many observers were struck by the vio- lence of 1980s crack markets relative toearlier heroin and marijuana markets.Many have speculated that such markets\"mature\" over time as (a) dealer territoriesare firmly established, (b) casual usersdrop out of the market, and (c) hardcoreusers establish reliable dealer connec-tions. All these factors suggest a shiftfrom open-air public markets toward moreclandestine arrangements that seem lessprone to violence. 18But at present, this is largely speculative; there is anecdotal andethnographic evidence for such changesbut little systematic longitudinal researchthat establishes a clear trajectory overtime. The consequences of prohibition and its enforcement Drug involvement as crime The convention in articles on drugs-crime linkages is to state that for the purposesof the essay, the fact that drug use (andsometimes drug selling) per se is a crimeis not relevant to the analysis. But the illicitstatus of street drugs is vitally importantto the analysis in several ways. First,drug prohibition is arguably necessary forGoldstein's category of systemic (market-related) violence (MacCoun and Reuter,2001). 19We simply do not observe routine violence among alcohol or tobacco ven-dors. Second, Goldstein's economic-compulsive violence, although not causedThe linkage between drug selling and gun possession is well established.79TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY by prohibition, is surely exacerbated by it because drug prohibition almost certainlyraises the price of heroin or cocaine farabove what would be their retail marketprices (MacCoun and Reuter, 2001).Finally, there are reasons to believe thatthe illicit status of drugs might have subtlecriminogenic effects through several dif-ferent mechanisms, including forbiddenfruit effects, labeling or stigmatizationeffects, and \"stigma swamping.\" 20Here we highlight two such mechanisms. Incapacitation and replacement effects. Several authors (e.g., Blumstein, 2000b;Freeman, 1996; Kleiman, 1997) have suggested that the incarceration of drugsellers is likely to produce a weaker inca-pacitation effect than would occur forother offense categories, such as propertyand sex offenses. Indeed, some havespeculated that a replacement process might even produce a net increase in theprevalence of drug selling. In a highly com-petitive illicit market, the incarceration of adrug seller creates lucrative drug-sellingopportunities (customers and sales territo-ry) for others. According to Blumstein(2000b): The pathological rapist's crimes almost certainly are not replaced onthe street, and so one can expect hisfull array of crimes to be incapacitat-ed. . . . A burglar's crimes may bereplaced if is serving a fence, whowould recruit a replacement; alterna-tively, if he is simply operating on hisown, the crimes are not likely to bereplaced. And the participant inorganized vice activity such as drugdealing would be likely to have histransactions replaced by whateverorganizational structure is serving themarket demand. That replacementcould be achieved by some combina-tion of recruiting new sellers or byincreasing the rate of activity of sell-ers already active in the market.Freeman (1996) offers a formal economic model that interprets this replacementeffect in terms of the elasticity of supplyof dealers with respect to drug marketwages. The supply of dealers shouldreflect this sensitivity to wages as well aschanges in earnings opportunities in thelicit market (i.e., shift in the supply curve)and the demand for drugs (i.e., shifts inthe demand curve). At present, there is surprisingly little evi- dence either for or against the replace-ment hypothesis. One indirect argumentfor its plausibility is that the explosivegrowth in the incarceration of drug sellersduring the past decade was not accompa-nied by increases in street cocaine prices,as one might expect if the supply of streetdealers was tightening (Blumstein, 2000b;see also DiNardo, 1993). Indeed, streetprices have dropped substantially (Rhodeset al., 2000). Another indirect argument isthe sheer prevalence of drug market par-ticipation in some communities during thelate 1980s, when drug sellers were beingincarcerated at record levels. For example,Saner et al. (1995) estimated that in Wash-ington, D.C., during 1985-91, nearly one-third of African-American male residentsfrom the 1964-67 birth cohorts werecharged with drug selling. Statistical analyses of archival data might test the replacement hypothesis by look-ing for evidence of increases in the initia-tion to drug selling as a function of thearrest and incarceration of dealers. Ethno-graphic studies might examine whetherrecruitment activities increase followingpolice crackdowns and whether existingstreet dealers increase their activity. Butisolating replacement effects will be tricky;note that general deterrence and replace-ment effects, if they exist, will offset eachother, which may make it hard to find any effect of sanctions on subsequent dealing. 80SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Can enforcement amplify violence? Several authors (Eck and McGuire, 2000;MacCoun and Reuter, 2001, chapter 6;Reuter, 1989; Riley, 1998) have arguedthat under certain conditions, aggressivedrug enforcement might actually increasedrug-related violence. Rasmussen, Benson,and their associates have examinedwhether more intense drug enforcementincreases violent crime; much of this workis summarized in Rasmussen and Benson(1994). The mechanisms involved arequite varied. For example, enforcementmight lead to more violence in competi-tion. Benson and colleagues (1992) foundthat the violent crime rate in a communityincreased with more drug arrests in aneighboring community. This, they argue,is a displacement effect; dealers movefrom the targeted community to theneighboring one and struggle over theestablishment of territories. Anothermechanism works through the limitedcapacity of the correctional system;increased prison space for drug offendersreduces the penalties for other crimes,including violent crimes, and thus in-duces higher victimization. Benson andRasmussen (1991) argue that, evenassuming that prison is effective onlythrough incapacitation and not deterrence,the observed rise in the resources devot-ed to drug enforcement in Florida in the1980s might have increased other crimeby 10 percent. Supply reduction versus violence reduction. An important dialogue with respect to drug users involves the pros-pects and tensions of integrating usereduction strategies with harm reductionstrategies (MacCoun, 1998; MacCoun andReuter, 2001). We see an analogous issuewith respect to the policing of drug mar-kets (MacCoun and Reuter, 1994). Policetactics designed to reduce the supply ofdrugs (and of drug suppliers) may or maynot be the most effective means of reducing the total social harm caused by street drug selling. Some tactics mightdirectly reduce drug-related violence. One example involves efforts to drive dealers indoors (see Kennedy's 1993analysis of Tampa's QUAD program). Ofcourse, crack houses are not without theirharms. In an ethnographic study of thecrack market in Detroit, Mieczkowski(1990, p. 90) concludes that \"tavern-stylecrack houses may encourage and makepossible hypersexuality among partici-pants and thus increase the STD and HIVrates. The use of barter as a supplementto a cash economy in the crack trade rep-resents further complications in creatingsocial policies in reaction to this behavior.\"Still, indoor markets are likely to be lessviolent. But the effects are multiple andhard to balance. On one hand, indoor mar-kets are less susceptible to police surveil-lance or sting operations. On the otherhand, driving dealers indoors might in-crease users' search costs (Moore, 1990)and thus reduce demand. Consumers inexport markets would bear a dispropor-tionate share of these search costs be-cause the locals often know the localdealers and could easily locate them. Thismight lead to new local markets in theareas from which the export consumersare coming and the associated neighbor-hood violence that Benson et al. (1992)examined. Further research on theseissues is needed. Heroin maintenance. If the drugs-crime link is mediated by the high price and con-ditions of sale of a drug, and if a relativelysmall number of frequent users are re-sponsible for much of the crime, then per-haps allowing access to that drug legallyfor those least able to quit might reduceassociated crime. There is increasing infor-mation and interest in exploring just thispossibility for heroin (see MacCoun andReuter, 2001). Police tactics designed to reduce the supply of drugs (and of drug suppliers) may or may not be the most effective means of reducing the total social harm caused by street drug selling.81TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY In January 1994, Swiss authorities opened a number of government-administeredheroin maintenance clinics. 21Registered addicts can inject heroin at a governmentclinic under the care of a nurse up to threetimes a day, 7 days a week. Patients haveto be over 18, have injected heroin for 2years, and have failed at least two treat-ment episodes. By the end of the initialresearch trials of this program, more than800 patients had received heroin on a regular basis without any leakage into theillicit market. No overdoses were reportedamong participants while they stayed inthe program. A large majority of partici-pants had maintained the regime of dailyattendance at the clinic; 69 percent werein treatment 18 months after admission.This was a high rate relative to thosefound in methadone programs. About halfof the \"dropouts\" switched some chose methadone andothers chose abstinence-based therapies.The crime rate among all patients droppedduring the course of treatment, use ofnonprescribed heroin dipped sharply, andunemployment fell from 44 to 20 percent. Critics, such as an independent review panel of the World Health Organization,reasonably asked whether the claimedsuccess was a result of the heroin or themany additional services provided to trialparticipants. And the evaluation relied pri-marily on the patients' own reports, withfew objective measures. Nevertheless,despite the methodological weaknesses,the results of the Swiss trials provide evi-dence of the feasibility and potential effec-tiveness of this approach. In late 1997, theSwiss government approved a large-scaleexpansion of the program. A similar pro-gram is under development in the Nether-lands and in Hamburg, Germany. The proposal to study heroin maintenance on a trial basis in the United States is politi-cally controversial and would be logisticallydifficult. Moreover, the normative andmoral issues are clearly complex (MacCounand Reuter, 2001, chapter 15). But we should not reflexively dismiss, withoutserious analysis, an intervention that couldin theory (and with some fragmentary evi-dence) help reduce the criminality of exist-ing heroin users and perhaps shrink theheroin street market, thereby creating newbarriers to heroin initiation. If nothing else,serious discussion of such a program, andperhaps even formal modeling of alterna-tive hypotheses about its likely effects,might significantly advance our thinkingabout drug market dynamics and the possi-bilities for effective intervention. Summing up: Directions for future research Here we summarize our suggestions for profitable future research, in the order inwhich we discussed them: Methodological attention to the meas-urement taxonomy ofdrugs-violence to the validationof self-reports of victim and offendercausal attributions for the role of drugsin criminal offenses. Greater attention to the role of drug usein criminal victimization. Retrospective historical analysis of long-term trends in drug use, drug arrests,and drug-related crime, including recod-ing of ethnographic databases, applica-tion of the Goldstein coding scheme tohomicide case files, age/period/cohortanalyses, and econometric time-seriesanalyses. Determination of the causal relation-ships underlying comorbid drug abuseand mental illness conditions. Extension and replication of the richexperimental literature on situationalmoderators of alcohol-related aggres-sion, as applied to other drugs.82SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Econometric analysis of the effects of drug price changes on drug-related crim-inality. Assessment of the effects of the avail-ability of licit work and licit wage levelson criminality. Additional multicity analyses (and cross-neighborhood analyses within cities)with an emphasis on understanding het-erogeneity in drugs-crime relationships:Spatial analyses, analyses of variation inthe demand for different drugs, gangversus nongang involvement, ethnic andother demographic groupings, indoorversus outdoor markets, import versusexport versus local versus public mar-kets, etc. Estimation of incapacitation versusreplacement effects resulting from theincarceration of drug sellers. Simulation modeling and eventualpilot tests of the efficacy of heroin maintenance. One other topic that was not even hinted at in our analysis and has been almosttotally neglected in the empirical researchliterature also should receive attention: thelikelihood of causal linkages between illicitdrug use and such white-collar crimes ascorruption, fraud, and embezzlement. 22 This is a long list of topics. That in itself isa reminder of how little has been done toimplement and build on Goldstein's in-sightful taxonomy. Advances will requirean acceptance of the fact that drugs maydiffer widely in the extent and form oftheir criminogenic effects. That substan-tially complicates an already difficult en-terprise but is likely to be the source ofconsiderable policy insight.Notes 1. Except where noted, these statistics were report- ed in Drug-Related Crime (Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2000). 2. In fact, Goldstein et al.'s (1989) findings might not fully represent New York City since they did not lookat the entire population or a random sample of homi-cides. Rather, they chose one zone in each of fourdifferent boroughs, with the goal of sampling pre-cincts that represented a cross-section of New YorkCity. 3. These findings challenge the recent generalization by White and Gorman (2000, p. 189) that \"the eco-nomic motivation explanation has not been support-ed among adolescents.\" 4. Our understanding is that the new NIBRS (National Incident-Based Reporting System) database perpetu-ates this. Officers only have to report the circum-stances of the offense (which includes drug dealing)for aggravated assaults/homicide (considered onecategory in the victim-level file). 5. Approaches might include confirmatory factor analysis, cluster analysis, Q-sort, or Ragin's (2000)fuzzy-set approach. We are less interested in defend-ing a particular method than in pointing out the sur-prising lack of attention to these measurement andconceptualization issues in the field. 6. Fagan (1990, p. 255) and White and Gorman (2000, p. 185) argue that, if anything, marijuana andopiates serve to suppress aggression. Actually,Bushman's (1990) meta-analysis found more aggres-sion among marijuana smokers than placebo controlsin laboratory experiments. But this effect is partlydue to the fact that the placebo controls showed significantly less aggression than nondrug controls,indicating that participants also believed marijuanawould induce passivity. 7. Note that other psychiatric disorders are less common among substance abusers than substanceabuse is among the mentally ill (Miller, 1993). 8. Beau Kilmer's work on this section was supported by NIDA grant R01DA12724. 9. The assumption that decriminalization (as opposed to legalization) is an indicator of lower price is ques-tionable. In theory, it might increase demand by re-ducing the nonmoney costs, which should increase83TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY price. However, evaluations of decriminalization in 11 U.S. States, South Australia, the Australian CapitalTerritory, and the Netherlands fail to show any ef- fects on demand (MacCoun and Reuter, 2001). 10. The authors report the statistically significant vari- ables, not the entire model. The entire model is listedin Fisher, Cullen, and Turner (forthcoming) and includesa variable for \"Frequency of smoking pot or hashish.\"Because the significant predictors for stalking are thesame in the published and unpublished pieces, weassume the same model was used. Because this islikely to be the model used to predict sexual victimiza-tion in the published piece, we report that marijuanause does not predict sexual victimization. 11. Even if true, high returns from crack selling do not lessen the criminogenic consequences of themarket; the issue is what share of revenues are gen-erated by legitimate earnings or welfare and othertransfer payments received by buyers. 12. The question yields four binary variables about whether the arrestee was in need of drugs/alcohol(NEEDNO), alcohol (NEEDALC), cocaine (NEED-COCR), and marijuana (NEEDMAR) during the crimeand one text variable (NEEDOTHR) where the coderis asked to specify if the arrestee mentioned anotherdrug. Curiously, the 1995 (part 2) and 1999 ADAMcodebooks do not report any binary variable for heroin\u2014widely believed to be the major source ofeconomic-compulsive crime. Of the 44,000 ADAMarrestees in 1999, we estimate (using the open-ended field responses) that about 1,100 reportedthey needed heroin, 1,800 needed alcohol, 2,150needed cocaine/crack, and 700 needed marijuana.Of those reporting that they needed heroin, about35 percent committed income-generating crimes. 13. ONDCP reports, based on Rhodes et al. (1995, 2000), that the prevalence of frequent use fell byone-third between 1988 and 1993 and then returnedto its 1988 level by 1998. It is difficult to identify sup-porting evidence for such a dramatic fluctuation inthe figures. 14. The bookmaking business has certainly generat- ed written records; but that is more central to thebusiness itself, which involves the extension of cred-it and usually numerous near-simultaneous transac-tions between any one buyer and seller. 15. In the District of Columbia in the mid- to late 1990s, it was reported that some street gangs werein violent disputes over the marijuana market (Pierre,1996; Lattimore et al., 1997).16. Smith and Varese (2001) model the use of coer- cive violence in markets for Mafia extortion; themodel can be applied to intraorganizational violenceas well. 17. Decker, Pennell, and Caldwell (1997) did not find that drug users (rather than sellers) were more likelyto be carrying a gun than other arrestees. 18. Alfred Blumstein appeared to endorse this account in his public comments at the 2000 AnnualMeeting of the American Society of Criminology. 19. Necessary, but not sufficient; see Zimring and Hawkins, 1997; Ousey and Lee, 2000. 20. The term \"stigma swamping\" was suggested to us by Jon Caulkins as an apt label for a phenomenonabout which many have speculated (e.g., Jacobsenand Hanneman, 1992; McGraw, 1985; Petersilia,1990)\u2014the notion that the stigma associated witharrest and even incarceration is reduced by the sheerprevalence of those sanctions. The term \"stigmaswamping\" is an informal control counterpart toKleiman's (1993) formal control version, \"enforce-ment swamping.\" 21. The earlier British experience with prescription heroin is more notorious but less informative; seeMacCoun and Reuter, 2001, chapter 12. 22. We thank Terence Dunworth for making this observation.

(juvenile) gang-related than portrayed in the media and may be \"kindler and gen-tler\" than other large cities. He also report-ed that the worst years for murders inMiami were during its cocaine wars in theearly 1980s. Inciardi found that \"thosemore proximal of the crack distributionmarket were more involved in violentcrime\" (p. 104). This study has at leasttwo advantages over Goldstein et al.(1989): Crimes other than homicide wereconsidered, and respondents were askedabout drug-related victimization. But thedrug associated with these crimes wasnot listed as it was in the Goldstein et al.study. Chicago One source that was developed to assesshomicide fluctuations and motivations isthe Chicago Homicide Dataset (CHD). De-tailed information on every homicide in therecords of the Chicago Police Departmentis available for 1965-95 (Block, Block, andIllinois Criminal Justice Information Au-thority, 1998). CHD does not include dataon specific drugs, but its motive classifica-tion fits nicely with the tripartite frame-work. The four types of drug-relatedmotives for homicide are selling or drugbusiness (this includes any homicides dur-ing or because of a transaction); 2an argu- ment over possession, use, quality, orcost of drugs; getting money for drugs oracquiring drugs for personal use; andother drug involvement (e.g., baby diesof malnutrition because the parents werehigh; offender was drug crazed). 3 The per capita drug-related homicide rateremained fairly stable from 1973 to 1984(around 0.4 homicides per 100,000 CookCounty residents), with \"arguments\" ataslightly higher rate from 1974 to 1977. Homicide rates related to all of the mo-tives fluctuated from 1984 to 1995, but itis interesting that the aggregate rate forevery motive except \"business/transac-tion\" was virtually the same for 1984-85 91TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Appendix A. Other applications of Goldstein'sframework New York Even excluding the works of Goldstein and his colleagues, much of the workusing the tripartite framework focuses onNew York during the mid- to late 1980s.The U.S. Sentencing Commission (1995)used Goldstein's framework to comparethe incidence of violence related to theuse of powder cocaine and crack. Usingexpert testimony and existing literature,and largely focusing on the studies donein New York, 1the Commission concluded that crack was a greater source of sys-temic violence than powder cocaine, thateconomic-compulsive violence was rela-tively rare among cocaine users, and that\"neither powder nor crack cocaine exciteor agitate users to commit criminal actsand that the stereotype of a drug-crazedaddict committing heinous crimes is nottrue for either form of cocaine\" (p. x). Miami Inciardi's (1990) survey of 611 seriousjuvenile delinquents in Miami and DadeCounty assessed offender self-reportsof drug-related systemic, economic-compulsive, and psychopharmacologicalcrime. In the 12 months prior to the inter-views, which occurred from 1985 to 1989,about 5 percent of the sample reportedbeing a psychopharmacological victim,59 percent reported having committedrobberies (\"the majority of which werecommitted to purchase drugs,\" p. 100),and 8 percent reported being the perpetra-tors of systemic crimes. Inciardi alsoadministered a supplementary crack sur-vey to 254 of these delinquents fromOctober 1986 to November 1987. Thissurvey and other data analyses by Inciardiled him to conclude that the Miami crackmarket was much less violent and less92SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 and 1995 (still close to 0.4). The advent of crack likely explains why homicide ratesrelated to all of the motives increasedfrom 1985 to 1989, but it is of specialinterest that the \"business/transaction\"motive skyrocketed during those years.Clearly, more might be learned by examin-ing the specific drugs associated with\"business/transaction\" homicides inChicago over this time period. Eight-city study To learn why city homicide rates did not change uniformly in the early 1990s,Lattimore and colleagues (1997) com-prehensively examined homicide ineight cities for 1985-94: Atlanta, Detroit,Indianapolis, Miami, New Orleans, Rich-mond, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Inaddition to comparing ADAM results withUCR data for these cities, Lattimore et al.interviewed key policymakers, law en-forcement and criminal justice officials,and community leaders in the cities.These interviews revealed that crack wasmost likely associated with communityviolence and homicide, while the marketviolence associated with marijuana was agrowing concern in Washington, D.C., andRichmond. Methamphetamines, LSD,PCP , and heroin were not associated withhomicide rates and were rarely mentionedby local authorities. It is important to notethat Lattimore et al. found that in manycases the perceptions about local drugtrends differed substantially from drugtrends as measured by DUF/ADAM. Lattimore and colleagues question the relationship between crack and marketviolence because the crack markets weredescribed as highly competitive in cities inwhich the homicide rate was declining,increasing, or remaining the same (1997,p. 89). But it is not clear that the sameconclusions could be drawn if disaggregat-ed homicide rates (by circumstance) wereconsidered. The authors not only looked athow competitive the market was, they also considered the stability of prices,transactions, and participants. Their argu-ment that links between drugs and homi-cide \"appear to fall mainly on the useside\" (p. 92) relies on their findings aboutparticipants: The general structure of participation in crack markets and the nature, dura-tion, and consequences of the \"crackhigh\" may account for the relation-ship between the cocaine prevalencerates among arrestees and homiciderates. Crack users reported the largenumber of \"buys,\" extensive net-works of potential suppliers, and lessreliance on a primary supplier, sug-gesting that transactions were likelyto occur in an opportunistic manner.The high from crack lasts as little as10 minutes; thus, when the highwears off, the crack user may still bein the market and motivated to buymore of the drug\u2014and to commit acrime to obtain the money to do so.(p. 141) This is essentially an argument about economic-compulsive violence, whichother crack-specific studies have dis-missed (see U.S. Sentencing Commission,1995). While this difference may be geo-graphic (the other studies were primarilydone in New York City), it may also be theartifact of a bivariate analysis of twodatasets (UCR and ADAM) that did notalways cover the same populations. National estimates Others used nationwide data to learn moreabout the drugs-crime nexus. Caulkins andcolleagues (1997) used the tripartite frame-work to assess the impact that mandatoryminimum sentences have on cocaine con-sumption and subsequent crime. Relyingon estimates from Goldstein and his col-leagues (Goldstein, Brownstein, and Ryan,93TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY 1992; Spunt et al. 1990; Spunt et al., 1995), the National Criminal VictimizationSurvey, inmate surveys, and murder datafor large urban counties, Caulkins et al.determined the number of systemic, economic-compulsive, and psychopharma-cological crimes that were drug related.Their next step was to determine howmuch of this crime was related to cocaine.Based on information from Rhodes et al.(1995), the ADAM Program, the Office ofNational Drug Control Policy (1995), andGoldstein (Goldstein et al., 1989; Goldstein,Brownstein, and Ryan, 1992; Spunt et al.1995), Caulkins et al. (1997) suggest thatcocaine accounts for about 75 percent ofdrug-related economic-compulsive crime,50 percent of illicit psychopharmacologicalhomicides, and 75 percent of systemichomicides. Notes 1. New York: Chin and Fagan, 1992; Fagan Chin, Klein et al., 1991. Detroit:Mieczkowski, 1990.) The Commission also cited anunpublished DEA report and a review article by Fagan(1990). The former found \"that seven crack-relatedhomicides were 'multi-dimensional,' with systemicbeing one of the dimensions,\" but it is not clearwhere these homicides occurred and what the otherdimensions were. 2. The codebook reads: \"Use code 1 when BUSI- NESS is the motive for the incident (e.g., both victimand offender involved in dealing, victim killed as abystander of a drug business hit, victim killed be-cause he interfered with the business, victim killedduring a drug transaction or because of a drug trans-action).\" 3. Cases where there was no positive evidence or no information are not included. Of the 23,817 homi-cides occurring between 1964 and 1995, 22,282either had no information about drug motive or werenot drug related. Unfortunately, the non-drug-relatedhomicides cannot be separated from the no-informationgroup.94SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Appendix B.

Source: 1995-99 data from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring ProgramAppendix B. Arrestees Needing Drugs and/or Alcohol at the Time of the Offense, 1995-99 (continued)The existence of the drugs-crime relationship The purpose of this section is to briefly dis- cuss what is known about the drugs-crimerelationship. This discussion will focus onthe historical policy context; the empiricalnature of the relationship overall; and spe-cific drugs, crimes, and populations. Which drugs and what crime? Before proceeding further, we wish toclarify what we mean by \"drugs\" and pro-vide a more complete picture of what isinvolved in \"crime\" related to drug use.These clarifications are made in the hopethat readers will recognize that the crimeaspect of the drugs-crime relationship ismultifaceted and that the current exclu-sion of alcohol from most discussions ofthe drugs-crime relationship may be detrimental. Substance inclusion decisions The term \"drugs\" as used throughout thispaper refers to currently illicit substancesin the United States based on Federaldrug schedules. Alcohol, prescriptiondrugs, and other substances are excluded.Although it is beyond the scope of the current project, it is important to at leastmention the alcohol-crime relationship.Greenfeld (1998) reminds us that an esti-mated 36 percent of convicted offenderswere drinking at the time they committedtheir crimes and that a high correlation hasbeen observed between public orderIntroduction The relationship between drug use andcriminal behavior has generated a substan-tial body of literature in peer-reviewedjournals, government publications, and thepublic press. The very extent of suchresearch\u2014as well as the breadth of policypositions based on or ignoring suchresearch\u2014argues for the importance of areview that can summarize theory, policy,and programmatic approaches to theissue. In this paper, we do not attempt toprovide a comprehensive review of theissues or literature. Instead, we seek toprovide a sufficient review of the mostpertinent knowledge about the drugs-crime relationship to stimulate further dis-cussion among researchers regarding themost important research questions thatstill need attention. This discussion holdsgreat promise for the development of newapproaches to the drugs-crime relation-ship. As Brownstein has argued, \"thosewho do the research are in the best posi-tion to interpret their findings and offeradvice based on their conclusions\" (1991,p. 132). This paper approaches the abovetask by focusing on the following issues:(a) documenting the existence of thedrugs-crime relationship, (b) addressingthe nature and complexity of that relation-ship, (c) summarizing philosophical andtheoretical contributions that may bestaddress the relationship, (d) reviewingboth State- and Federal-level policyapproaches to breaking the relationship,including integrated program approaches,and (e) proposing key areas for futureresearch.The Drugs-Crime Wars: Past, Present, and Future Directions in Theory, Policy,and Program Interventions Duane C.

Alcohol is also strongly related to violent crime (Coker etal., 2000; 1995). Ironically, this relation-ship often remains outside sentencingdecisions and monitoring proceduresbecause alcohol is legal and therefore notsubject to the same arrest, seizure, andprosecution laws as are illicit drugs. Drugtreatment interventions, however, ofteninclude both alcohol and other drugs.Comprehensive efforts to address crimeand substance use should include alcoholtreatment in programmatic considerations. The history of drug policy and the definition of crime Crimes associated with drug use range from violent (such as murder and aggra-vated assault) to acquisitive (burglary, for-gery, fraud, and deception) to specificdrug-law violations. In addition, crimessuch as bribery and corruption are relatedto drug use as a result of drug policy prohi-bitions. Traditionally, discussions of thedrugs-crime relationship have focused pri-marily on violent crime; however, it isimportant to recognize the complexity ofcriminal acts associated with drug use.When considering the drugs-crime rela-tionship, this paper recommends thatresearchers and policymakers include bothviolent and nonviolent crimes as well asdrug law violations and corruption associ-ated with drug policy to grasp more fullythe resulting harms and societal costs (forexample, see French and Martin, 1996). Efforts to address the drugs-crime rela- tionship must incorporate a realization ofhow the development of policy and lawhas contributed to the relationship itself.Policy approaches to drug use in theUnited States have historically rangedbetween legal markets in the 19th centuryto decriminalization, harm reduction, med-icalization, and strict prohibition (as thedominant policy) in the 20th. Over time,policy has moved to various points along this continuum, and it often resides at dif-ferent points at the same time in differentlocations and for different substances.Each time policy shifts, the act of drug usetakes on a slightly different character inrelation to crime. Thus, it is important topresent a brief history of drug policy in theUnited States, together with current possi-ble positions in the drug policy discussion,as each position has a unique implicationfor fighting drug-related crime. An understanding of American drug policy begins with three early American culturaltraditions that still strongly affect drug poli-cy discussions: (a) libertarianism, (b) theemergence of a relatively open legal market resulting from the libertarian per-spective, and (c) Puritan moralism. Liber-tarianism argues that government musthave an extremely compelling motive forinterfering in the personal lives of citizens.Such interference legitimately occurs onlyif a citizen's behavior is a significant, actualrisk to others (Mill, 1979). Consistent withthis libertarian tradition, early America hadan open-market orientation that empha-sized limited government interference inthe production and distribution of desiredgoods and services. 1Nineteenth-century national drug policy was consistent withboth libertarianism and the open market.While the Federal Government regulatedthe importation of such drugs as opiumand cocaine, few regulations governed thedistribution of these and other drugsthrough what came to be called the patentmedicine industry (Belenko, 2000; Inciardi,2001; Musto, 1999). Patent medicineswere extensively advertised and, throughthem, the use of drugs such as opium andcocaine became integrated into routineAmerican cultural behavior patterns(Musto, 1999). Conflicting with both libertarianism and the market-driven approach is the Puritanmoralist perspective: Individual behaviorswith the potential to harm the community99TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY are seen as a community problem within the legitimate purview of communityaction (Cherrington, 1920; Schmidt, 1995).Puritan and other religious and moral tradi-tions present in American history oftenviewed behavior such as substance use asundermining the moral fabric of society,potentially causing the withdrawal ofGod's blessing from America. The Puritanmoralist perspective dominated the early1900s, an era of societal reform and in-creasing prohibition (and thus increasingpenalties for drug use). One of the firstsuccesses of the social reform movementin the early 20th century was the passageof the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,which required the patent medicine indus-try to list product ingredients. The subse-quent passage of the Harrison Act of 1914and the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 madeillegal the manufacture, sale, and posses-sion of a variety of drugs, including opiatesand cocaine, as well as the nonmedicaluse of marijuana. A strongly prohibitionistapproach continued through the 1950swith the Boggs Act of 1951 and the Nar-cotic Control Act of 1956, when mandato-ry minimum sentences for Federal drugtrafficking law violations were strength-ened and arrests without a warrant fordrug charges were enabled. The 1960s and 1970s represented a major cultural shift in the United States. For avariety of reasons, American society expe-rienced a \"drug revolution\" during thisera. There appeared to be an increase inthe proportion of individuals using drugsand in the variety of drugs used. The evi-dence for this increase is seen in the number of drug-related arrests and theincrease in drug use in the general popu-lation (Musto, 1999). During this era,drug policy initially shifted to a strongertreatment- and less punishment-orientedstance. In 1966, the Narcotic AddictRehabilitation Act allowed the establish-ment of the civil commitment systeminstead of prosecution for Federal offend-ers and encouraged State and local governments to develop their own treat- ment programs. In 1970, the Comprehen-sive Drug Abuse Prevention and ControlAct consolidated and replaced the patch-work of previous Federal drug laws. TheAct created the drug schedules in currentuse today and initiated the so-called \"waron drugs\"; it also moved some posses-sion or casual transfer offenses to misde-meanors instead of felonies. This era maybe considered a time when drug use wasprimarily considered a medical/mentalhealth problem to be addressed by treat-ment, with lessened emphasis on criminalpenalties for possession and use. With an apparent increase in drug use, as evidenced by an increase in drug overdosecases and drug treatment admissions, amore prohibitionist movement againswept the Nation. New York's RockefellerDrug Laws were passed in 1973, estab-lishing mandatory prison sentences of upto 20 years for the sale of any amount ofheroin or cocaine. The Anti-Drug AbuseActs of 1986 and 1988 continued to em-phasize law enforcement (although the1988 Act gave more attention to treat-ment and prevention). In yet another poli-cy shift, treatment (including diversion intotreatment from the criminal justice sys-tem) and prevention received increasingattention in the 1990s. Further, someStates developed policies that effectivelydecriminalized marijuana possession(removing jail/prison penalties) and initiat-ed policies, such as needle exchange pro-grams, that would reduce the dangers ofinjecting drugs. Although scholars often focus on the rela- tively rapid development of national drugpolicy, it is important to remember thatmany States passed legislation prohibitingpatent medicine and/or alcohol sales, aswell as marijuana use, a decade or morebefore similar legislation was passed byCongress (Belenko, 2000). Because ofhow the United States is organized, Statesoften have or exercise considerable 100SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 discretion regarding alcohol and drug poli- cies (Musto, 1999). Essentially, the history of drug policy (and debates about where drug policy shouldmove in the future) can be broken downinto five main approaches: prohibition, riskreduction, medicalization, legalization/regulation, and decriminalization (for anindepth discussion, see McBride et al.,1999; see also Goode, 1997). Prohibitionemphasizes severe penalties for use, dis-tribution, and production. Risk reductionuses a public health approach to reducethe risks and harms associated with illicitdrug use and emphasizes education onrisks, safer use practices, prevention, andtreatment. Medicalization calls for physi-cian treatment of drug addicts, viewingsubstance abuse primarily as a medicalissue. Legalization/regulation supportsincreased access to drugs through govern-mental regulation of these substances,with possible distribution of specific sub-stances through governmentally controlleddistribution channels. Decriminalizationcalls for a complete end to the use ofcriminal law to address individual druguse. This may imply a relatively open-market approach to drug availability anduse, but that need not be the case. Although there has been significant debate over which policy approach or approachesmight best address the drugs-crime cycle,more research is needed that examinesscientifically the effects of policy positionson both drug use and crime. For the mostpart, current Federal drug law takes a pro-hibitionist stance that includes a strongdeterrence approach to reducing the sup-ply of drugs and high penalties for druglaw violations. As a result, a significantportion of the drugs-crime relationship issimply an artifact of law and policy itself:\"most directly, it is a crime to use, pos-sess, manufacture or distribute drugs clas-sified as having the potential for abuse\"(Craddock, Collins, and Timrots, 1994).The statistical relationship between drug use and criminalbehavior The general conclusion of almost three decades of research on the relationshipbetween drug use and crime has beenthat there is a clearly significant statisticalrelationship between the two phenomena(Austin and Lettieri, 1976; Dorsey andZawitz, Gandossy et al., 1980;McBride and McCoy, 1993). Research indi-cates extensive drug use among arrestedpopulations, a high level of criminal be-havior among drug users, and a fairly highcorrelation between drug use and delin-quency/crime in the general population.Research also indicates significant differ-ences in the relationship based on drugtype and type of crime. Importantly, allthese differences are further complicatedby ethnic and gender issues. The drugs-crime relationship within various populationgroups Drug use among arrested/incarcerated populations and crime among drugusers. From the early 1970s onward, bio- logical and self-report data have indicateda relatively high rate of drug use amongarrested and incarcerated populations(Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Arrestee Drug Abuse Moni-toring Program (ADAM) collected datafrom more than 40,000 adults in morethan 30 sites and more than 400 juvenilesin 9 sites throughout the United States(ADAM, 2000). In almost all cities wherethe ADAM project operates, about two-thirds of both adult male and femalefelony arrestees had an illegal drug in theirbodies at the time of arrest (with higherrates among females). Even among juve-niles, the majority of arrestees were foundto have an illegal drug in their urine (withThe history of drug policy can be broken down into five main approaches: prohibition, risk reduction, medicalization, legalization/ regulation, and decriminalization.101TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY higher rates among males). The data also suggest that, although current drug userates among adult arrestees are higherthan those reported in the more isolatedreports of the 1970s (Austin and Lettieri,1976), these rates have remained steadyfor the past 5 years (the same patterns arefound among juvenile arrestees). An argu-ment can be made that with about two-thirds of arrestees already using illegaldrugs in the 72 hours prior to their arrest,there is not much room for an increase. A recent report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) suggests that drug usealso is extensive among inmates in localjails (Wilson, 2000). This document reportsthat the majority of inmates in State pris-ons and local jails used drugs in the monthprior to the offense that put them in prison/jail. Interestingly, this same report alsonotes that about 10 percent of jail inmatestest positive for drugs while in jail. The extent of crime among drug users also has been documented. From the1960s through the 1990s, surveys of drug-using populations both in and out of treat-ment have consistently shown that thelarge majority of users have extensive his-tories of criminal behavior and time servedin prison (Defleur, Ball, and Snarr, 1969;Inciardi, Horowitz, and Pottieger, 1993).This pattern applies to juveniles as well:Between 40 and 57 percent of adoles-cents treated for substance disorders alsohave committed delinquent acts (Winters,1998). Drug use and crime levels among the general population. A tradition of studies shows a correlation between drug use anddelinquency in general youth populations(Elliott and Huizinga, 1984; Elliott, Huizinga,and 1989; Harrison and Gfroerer,1992). Analysis from the National YouthSurvey has provided data often used toexamine this relationship. These datareport a direct correlation between seriousdrug use and delinquency (Johnson et al.,1991). Youths who used \"hard\" drugs (about 5 percent of the sample) accountedfor 40 percent of all delinquencies and 60percent of index crimes. The impact of drug type on the drugs-crime relationship The first National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-sponsored Crime and Drugs Report (Austin and Lettieri, 1976) noted that acomplex relationship exists between typeof drug use and type of crime. This rela-tionship is further complicated if multipledrug use exists. The 1999 ADAM reportshows that a fairly large proportion ofarrestees tested positive for more thanone drug (up to 30 percent), and thatreported criminal behavior tended toinclude a wide variety of offenses. TheADAM data show that while cocaine wasthe most likely drug found among adultarrestees in large cities (and there is litera-ture suggesting a significant relationshipbetween cocaine and violence), for manyurban ADAM sites, violent offenders weremore likely to test positive for marijuanathan cocaine. In addition, property offend-ers were more likely to test positive forcocaine than marijuana in most sites(ADAM, 2000). The impact of crime type on the drugs-crime relationship Drug law violations. A significant propor- tion of drug user arrests involve violationsof drug laws only. As noted previously, theUnited States experienced wide drug poli-cy shifts in the 20th century. Each shifthas uniquely affected crimes related todrug use and distribution. In a study of611 juvenile cocaine users by Inciardi andcolleagues in the early 1990s, analysesshowed that participants had committedmore than 400,000 criminal acts in the12 months prior to being interviewed. Ofthese, 60 percent were for drug law viola-tions, mostly sales of small amounts102SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 (Inciardi, Horowitz, and Pottieger, 1993). At the Federal level, a total of 581,000drug arrests in 1980 nearly tripled to arecord high of 1,584,000 in 1997. By 1997,79 percent of drug arrests were for pos-session and 21 percent were for sales.Forty-four percent of drug arrests overallwere for marijuana offenses (UniformCrime Reports, 1998). Drug defendantscomprised 42 percent of felony convic-tions (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999).A recent BJS Special Report (Wilson,2000) also substantiates the extensivepercentage of drug-related crimes thatresult from violation of drug laws, suggest-ing that about a quarter of jail inmateshave a current charge or conviction fordrug law violations. Critics have arguedthat since such arrests likely include manylow-level users and dealers, criminal jus-tice processing and the stiff sentencesthat often are handed down because ofmandatory minimums may be inappropri-ate to the offense level (McBride et al.,2001). The violence connection. Changes in drug policy are usually driven by concernsfor public safety and the perception of adirect relationship between drugs and vio-lence (Brownstein, 1996, 2000). For exam-ple, the drug policy reform movement ofthe early 1900s (changing from legal markets to strict prohibition) was accom-panied by horror stories focused on exag-gerated claims of criminal behavior as aconsequence of drug use. In this litera-ture, there was a particular emphasis onhorrific violent crime (including rape), withminority group members often portrayedas the drug users engaged in the violentbehavior. Musto (1999; see also Belenko,2000; Hickman, 2000) documents the public concern of the time (perhaps obses-sion) with Chinese opiate use, African-American cocaine use, and the use ofmarijuana by Mexicans. The creation ofthe Narcotics Bureau led to a type ofmedia distribution industry focused on violence associated with drug use, \"docu- menting\" the criminal consequences ofsuch activity (see Anslinger and Tompkins,1953; Inciardi, 2001). Among the bestknown of these efforts were the films\"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (purport-ing to depict the effects of heroin use/injection) and Madness\" (show-ing the supposed behavioral conse-quences of mari juana use). Although such media portrayals exaggerated the possible links between drugs and crime, someresearch has connected drug use with vio-lence. Grogger and Willis (2000) concludethat without the introduction of crackcocaine into urban America, 1991 crimerates would have been about 10 percentlower. These researchers also examinedthe impact of crack on specific types ofviolent crime and reported that the biggestimpact was on aggravated assault. In 1985, Goldstein provided the perspec- tive that has been most commonly usedto examine the relationship between druguse and violence. Essentially, he arguedfor a tripartite scheme, where \"psycho-pharmacological violence\" could resultdirectly or indirectly from the biochemicalbehavioral consequences drug use;\"economic-compulsive violence\" couldrelate to behavior/crimes engaged in toobtain money for drugs; and \"systemicviolence\" could emerge in the context ofdrug distribution, control of markets, theprocess of obtaining drugs, and/or thesocial ecology of drug distribution/useareas. 2Some researchers have concluded that there is minimal evidence psychopharmacological impact ofdrugs on violence (Resignato, 2000); how-ever, Pihl and Peterson (1995) reviewed awide range of studies on the issue. Theyconcluded that alcohol and drugs can bepsychopharmacologically related to violentacts through the release of dopamine,which reduces inhibitory anxiety about theconsequences of aggressive behavior andincreases the rewards associated with Changes in drug policy are usually driven by concerns for public safety and the perception of a direct relationship between drugs and violence.103TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY violence. In addition, they argue that the psychopharmacological effects of drugsinterfere with the user's cognitive process-ing of the consequences of potentially vio-lent situations. It should be noted thatthese authors believe that the evidencefor psychopharmacological effects of alco-hol use on violence are much higher thanfor other drugs. However, some indications point to the environment as being a more powerfulexplanation of the drugs-violence relation-ship than the psychopharmacological properties of drugs (Brownstein, 2000;Fishbein, 1998; Parker and Auerhahn,1998). In terms of economic compulsiveand systemic violence, Collins (1990) aswell as Fagan and Chin (1990) argue thatcrack selling is the main contributor to thedrugs-violence relationship. Specifically,their research found that violence (mostlyrobbery) emerged from the need to obtainmoney to purchase drugs (predominatelycrack). Fagan and Chin suggest that thedrugs-violence relationship also emergesas a part of the subculture of violence. In a 1994 study, Roth argued that drug users commit more property crime thanviolent crime. A recent publication by DeLi, Priu, and MacKenzie (2000) examinedthe relationship between drug use andproperty and violent crime in a populationof probationers in Virginia. Results indicat-ed that drug usehad a positive association with property crime, whereas drug dealing had an association with both violent andproperty crime (though the relationshipwas stronger for property crime). Theanalysis also showed an interactive effectbetween drug use, drug dealing, and vio-lent and property crime. Among juveniles,Linnever and Shoemaker (1995) found thatarrests for both possession and selling ofdrugs were related to the rate of propertycrime arrests. However, juvenile robberyarrest rates were related to only drugsales arrests (not possession). A NationalInstitute of Justice (NIJ) Research in Brief supports this research, stating \"illegaldrugs and violence are linked primarilythrough drug marketing\" (Roth, 1994, p. 1). The impact of ethnicity and gender Much of the research that has been con- ducted on drugs and crime has not had asufficient focus on gender and ethnic vari-ance. This limitation has significant reper-cussions on applying findings to otherpopulation groups. As Paniagua (1998)notes, the multicultural nature of currentsociety must incorporate a recognition ofthe complex nature of ethnicity and gen-der. Specifically, individuals who share asimilar ethnicity or gender will not all bethe same (i.e., recognition of language,acculturation, and socioeconomic differ-ences); however, it is important to recog-nize cultural commonalities that maysignificantly affect both the extent andnature of the drugs-crime relationshipacross individuals. Research that hasfocused on ethnicity and gender indicatesthat these variables may significantlyaffect various aspects of the drugs-crimerelationship, including: Source of drugs and/or works (Tayloret al., 1994). Predictors of violence (Ellickson andMcGuigan, 2000). Types of violence experienced and reac- tions to such violence (Brownstein et al.,1994; Mazza andDennerstein, 1996). Stress-coping and Wills,1998). of drugs (Brady andRandall, 1999). Epidemiology of substance-use disor-ders (Brady and Randall, 1999).104SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Psychiatric comorbidity (Brady and Randall, 1999). Social stigma issues (Brady and Randall,1999). Medical consequences of drug use,including heredity issues and course ofillness (Brady and Randall, 1999). Assessment and treatment issues,including possible prevention settings(Brady and Randall, 1999; Metsch et al.,1999; Paniagua, 1998). Differences in initiation of drug use(Doherty et al., 2000). Summary: What we know of the past The intended purpose of this section has been twofold. The first goal has been toreview the history of American drug policy(as well as possible drug policy positions)within the framework of the relationshipamong policy, drug use, and crime. Thesecond purpose has been to summarizethe statistical documentation of the drugs-crime relationship. Hopefully, this reviewhas served to remind readers of the fol-lowing issues: 1. American drug policy originated in the antithetical cultural traditions of rela-tively open-market/libertarian valuesand Puritan moralist social reform.These traditions still affect currentdebates about the drugs-crime rela-tionship, as well as the various policypositions between these two end-points on the policy continuum. 2. States have a history of experimenting with drug policies in advance of, andsometimes in opposition to, Federalaction on the same issues. 3. Public safety concerns have been the underlying rationale for the development of drug policy at all lev- els of government. 4. Hyperbole, demagoguery, demoniza- tion, and perhaps even naivete havehistorically characterized the drugs-crime debate (and may still). However,there is a clear statistical relationshipbetween drug use and crime. Themajority of drug users have extensivehistories of involvement with crimesand the criminal justice system; mostarrestees are current drug users; andthere is a correlation between druguse and delinquency/crime in generalpopulations. A large proportion of thiscriminal activity is a result of drug lawviolations. 5. Although there is some evidence that drug costs may be related to propertycrimes and robberies, and that distri-bution and subcultural elements sur-rounding drug use may be related toviolence, there is debate about theevidence for a strong and continuousconnection between drug use and vio-lence. This relationship is also compli-cated by the type of drug use, thecategory of crime, and ethnicity andgender. The nature and complexity of the drugs-crime relationship As White and Gorman (2000) note, three main explanatory models exist for grap-pling with the drugs-crime relationship: Drug use causes or leads to crime. Crime causes or leads to drug use. The relationship is purely coincidental oris based in a common etiology. Based on their evaluations of the research supporting and/or refuting each of thethree main models above, they conclude105TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY that \"one single model cannot account for the drug-crime relationship. Rather, thedrug-using, crime-committing populationis heterogeneous, and there are multiplepaths that lead to drug use and crime\"(White and Gorman, 2000, p. 151). Tenyears earlier, Collins (1990) also rejectedsimple explanatory models for the com-plex relationship. The debates over boththe direction of a drugs-crime relationshipas well as the etiological variables thatmay be involved in the common occur-rence of both drugs and crime have signifi-cant implications for attempts to intervenein the drugs-crime cycle. The direction of the relationship: Searching for a cause At the popular and sometimes at the gov- ernmental level, the drugs-crime relation-ship is often clearly causal: Drug usecauses crime. Models such as Goldstein'stripartite scheme (1985) have been usedto illustrate this approach, specifying psychopharmacological, economic-compulsive, and systemic causes of vio-lence. As noted previously, argumentsthat focus on the psychopharmacological properties of various drugs cite research that indicates that stimulants may increaseaggressiveness and paranoia and thatmany drugs have a strong disinhibitingeffect that could seriously interfere withjudgment (Pihl and Peterson, 1995).Economic arguments posit that the cost of drugs, coupled with high unemploymentamong drug users, results in the commis-sion of property crimes to support druguse (16 percent of jail inmates committedtheir current offense to get money fordrugs; BJS, 1999). Those who argue for asystemic approach maintain that drug usesimply has a subcultural relationship with criminal behavior: Because it is illegal,drug use involves the user in criminal sub-cultures that often lead to future deviance(Fagan and Chin, 1990).On the other hand, some researchers argue that a level of general delinquencyoften precedes drug use (Elliott, Huizinga,and Menard, 1989). The subcultural expla-nation is used Involvement incriminal activity and/or subcultures pro-vides \"the context, the reference group,and the definitions of a situation that areconducive to subsequent involvementwith drugs\" (White and Gorman, 2000,p. 174; see also White, 1990). Individualswith deviant lifestyles and/or personalitiesmay also use substances for the purposesof self-medication (Khantzian, 1985; Whiteand Gorman, 2000) or to provide a \"rea-son\" for deviant acts (Collins, 1993; Whiteand Gorman, 2000). Although Aposporiand associates (1995) concluded that therelationship between early delinquencyand subsequent drug use was relativelyweak, Bui, Ellickson, and Bell (2000) foundwhat they called a modest relationshipbetween delinquency in grade 10 andgreater drug use in grade 12. Importantly,they found no significant differences byethnicity for this relationship. Hser, Anglin,and Powers (1993) found that addicts whoceased narcotic use were less likely toengage in criminal behavior over a 24-yearfollowup period. Although there is some evidence of direc- tionality in the drugs-crime relationship,researchers who have attempted to ad-dress this issue generally have concludedthat the relationship is extremely complexand defies attempts to sort out directional-ity. Work by Nurco and colleagues on crim-inal careers initially found that increases innarcotic drug use were often followed byincreases in criminal activity; conversely,periods with no drug use were associatedwith less criminal activity of all types(these results applied for white, African-American and Hispanic narcotics addicts;Nurco, Cisin, and Balter, Balter foundthat narcotic drug users had very early106SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 involvement in what these researchers call \"precocious criminal activity.\" This activitypattern occurred prior to the onset ofaddiction, and therefor e simply could not be attributed to addiction it self. A recent article by Maxwell and Maxwell (2000)provides another example of the confus-ing directionality, suggesting that drug usehas a very complex relationship with typesof deviant behavior for women. Their find-ings suggest that frequent use of crack,combined with early onset of crack use, isrelated to prostitution. Drug selling, how-ever, was found to relate to decreasedprostitution as it provided another opportu-nity for income to purchase drugs. On abroader level, Curtis (1999) found thatdrug use rates did not decrease in eitherthe general or at-risk populations duringthe 1990s; however, there was a wide-spread decrease in urban crime during thesame time period. He argues that marketand cultural forces were behind the ob-served changes in substance use patternsand consequences: street drug dealersexerted higher control on both the druguse of those who worked for them as wellas the violence often associated withstreet drug dealing. A common origin One of the traditions of research on thedrugs-crime relationship has emphasizedthat drug use and crime may not have adirect causal relationship (White andGorman, 2000), but may emerge in thesame contextual milieu and have thesame antecedent variables such as poorsocial support systems, difficulty inschool, and membership in been suggest-ed to include such issues as neighborhoodcontext (McBride and McCoy, 1982), thedevelopment of street identity for survival (Collison, 1996), social isolation that pre-vents access to the social and economicsystems of society (Harrell and Peterson,1992; Stephens, 1991), and lack of what isnow referred to as human and social capi-tal (described later in this chapter). Demboand his colleagues have studied the drugs-crime relationship among high-risk youthsentering the juvenile justice system through-outthe last decade. In an important 1994 article, Dembo and colleagues found thatboth delinquency and drug use emergewithin the context of family problems andpeer deviant behavior. These researchersfound that for both males and females, aswell as African-Americans and whites,family alcohol and drug use, emotionalproblems, arrest history, and peer deviantbehavior were related to continuing druguse. Based on these models, any simpleattempt to only deter drug use throughsevere punishment or treatment will notresult in less crime or substance use, assuch approaches do not address the com-plex cause of both behaviors (Harrell andPeterson, 1992). Summary Research on understanding the nature ofthe drugs-crime relationship illustrates thatno simple causal model can explain thephenomena. Rather, the statistical relation-ship between the two activities may be aresult of their common etiological origin.As the purpose of this paper is to presenta background for discussion of possibleresearch agendas to expand and reformresearch on the drugs-crime relationship,it is important to ground such a system-wide effort in theoretical frameworksthat allow for the complex nature of therelationship. Such frameworks can bethen used to help shape possible futureresearch.Any simple attempt to only deter drug use through severe punishment or treatment will not result in less crime or substance use, as such approaches do not address the complex cause of both behaviors. 107TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Philosophical and theoretical contributionsto addressing the drugs-crime relationship This section will provide a theoretical framework for reviewing current program-matic approaches to breaking the drugs-crime cycle. The theoretical approachesto be presented include both overarchingbehavioral theories and philosophies spe-cific to justice system programming. Overarching theoretical approaches While recognizing the existence of a wide range of theories on human behavior, thispaper uses ecosystems theory as an over-all framework for examining the drugs-crime relationship. Within this framework,the concept of social capital has emergedrecently as a promising approach to break-ing the drugs-crime cycle. Ecosystems theory. Human behavior, including participation in drug use or crimi-nal activities, takes place within the broad-er social environment: circumstances,social norms, cultural conditions, and inter-actions with others (Kirst-Ashman, 2000).Ecosystems theory acts as an organizingframework (as opposed to a definitive the-ory of behavior or development) that callsfor an active awareness that the interac-tion of biology; interpersonal relationships;culture; and legal, economic, organization-al, and political forces affects an individ-ual's behavior (Beckett and Johnson,1995; Kirst-Ashman, 2000). It should benoted that the relative influences of eachforce are likely to change throughout thelifecourse of each person. Essentially,ecosystems theory helps provide the per-spective needed to understand thebreadth of systems (micro, mezzo, andmacro) involved in any discussion ofhuman behavior, as well as specific theo-ries that might be useful in addressingbehavior. The theory calls attention to inherent personal characteristics thataffect individual behavior, including com-petence, self-esteem, and self-direction(Germain and Gitterman, 1995). Definitive theories of behavior that have been used to explain crime and deviancehave varied. Since the 1960s, the follow-ing theories have been predominant:anomie, social disorganization, differentialassociation, social control, and conflict (Liska, Krohn, andMessner, 1989). Recently, however, atten-tion has been directed to new approacheswith the hope that theoretical and re-search advances will better support pre-vention and treatment: \"integrated theory,general theory, lifecourse forthe future\" (Bartollas, 2000, p. 564). Wewill focus specifically on social capitalsince it is a relatively new theory withthe potential to explain many complexrelationships. Social capital. The social sciences have always had an interest in the relationshipamong community organization, socialinteraction, and individual behavior. Today,the concept of social capital increasingly isused to understand the extent of commu-nity interaction and its effects. Social capi-tal was originally defined by Coleman(1988) as the quality and depth of relation-ships between people in a family andcommunity. Putnam (1993) developed theconcept to include \"the networks, normsand trust that facilitate coordination andcooperation for mutual benefit\" (p. 2). TheWorld Bank Group (2002) modified the definition to include \"the institutions, rela-tionships, and norms that shape the quali-ty and quantity of a society's interactions\"(p. 1). Finally, Rose (2000) emphasized theutility of social capital by defining it as \"thestock of networks [relationships betweenindividuals] that are used to producegoods and services in society\" (p. 1422).Increasing evidence shows that social 108SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 capital and the social cohesion and norma- tive environment enabling its developmentare critical for community and individualquality of life. The productive utility of in-formal face-to-face associations and for-mal organizational networks has beennoted, for example, in the areas of eco-nomic development (World Bank Group,2000), political participation (Putnam,2000; Putnam and 2000), healthpromotion Veenstra, 2000), and general qualityof life at the individual and community levels (Billings, 2000; Caspi et al., 1998;Lerner, 2000; Parcel and Menaghan, 1993;Popay, 2000). Recent studies based on social control and social bonding theories have devel-oped highly innovative solutions to crimeprevention, linking the levels of collectiveefficacy (Sampson and Raudenbush, and Sampson and Laub, 1990) to crimerates in a given neighborhood. Despite the extent of recent studies apply- ing the concept of social capital, very littleresearch has been conducted to measurethe relationship between social capital anddrug use. The only related (and very limit-ed) evidence points to the role of socialcapital in preventing youth behavior prob-lems (Parcel and Menaghan, 1993). Put-nam (2000) found that this was especiallytrue for those at higher risk for parentalabuse. As effective intervention programsare developed, it is essential to differenti-ate between the various forms of socialcapital (informal friendship and family re- lationships versus formal institutionalarrangements) and the quantity versusquality of the social networks involved. The concept of social capital can be applied to breaking the drugs-crime rela-tionship in several ways. First, high levelsof social capital in communities may playarole in preventing drug use and other deviant behavior through the presence ofstronger formal and informal social bondsand networks. The presence of anti-drug-use norms within more informal structures(such as family networks, communities offaith, and neighborhoods) may contributeto lower drug use rates. Conversely, lowerlevels of community social capital may beassociated with greater access to drugsand more lenient social norms and low-ered social controls regarding the use ofdrugs or association with drug users.Second, drug users who have recentlyentered the criminal justice system mayfind that the presence of high levels ofsocial capital in a community result in astronger network of diversion options.This could be due, in part, to formal andinformal network interest in restorativejustice (described later in this chapter) versus punishment approaches to crimeintervention. Third, once a drug offenderis incarcerated, high levels of social capitalwithin the offender's home communitymight better preserve networks of supportfor reintegration upon the offender's re-lease. Offenders might more easily obtainjobs, receive support for continued sobri-ety, and receive reinforcement for sociallyappropriate behaviors. Finally, communi-ties with high levels of social capital mighthave strong formal (vertical) social net-works in the form of coalitions or collabo-ratives working to reduce substance use.Such agency connections may help focusthe community on policy developmentrelated to drug prevention and treatmentsystems in homes, schools, and busi-nesses. Such strong, integrated social Increasing evidence shows that social capital and the social cohesion and normative environment enabling its development are critical for community and individual quality of life.109TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY networks may offer a larger range of serv- ices and may develop more formal hori-zontal relationships with other serviceproviders, thereby improving the coordi-nated delivery of services and care tothose with drug or alcohol problems. One example of the impact that social- capital-based concepts are currently hav-ing on the drugs-crime relationship in theUnited States is the recent establishmentof the Office of Faith-Based and Commu-nity Initiatives in the White House. Thisaction has focused the Nation's attentionon the role of faith-based institutions inthe provision of drug treatment, aftercare,and other services. Such interventionsmay be particularly important in poor andminority communities with large numbersof high-risk individuals, where there arefew (if any) traditional drug treatment pro-grams. However, these same communi-ties are often served by churches andother faith-based organizations that caredeeply about the members of their com-munity and are well established in serv-ice provision. While concerns aboutchurch-state separation, attempts atproselytization, and teachings of bigotryand prejudice have prompted some to de-mand a clear ban on the use of publicfunds to support faith-based institutions,others have begun to carefully examinethe potential of these organizations toimprove the lives of their clients. At pres-ent, there has not been sufficient researchto determine the effectiveness of treat-ment in faith-based settings. Criminal justice philosophies An examination of recent approaches tointervention in the drugs-crime cycle re-quires a brief review of major criminal jus-tice philosophies and recent conceptualdevelopments. Philosophies with thegreatest promise for success acknowl-edge the complex relationship betweendrugs and crime. In addition, they attemptto incorporate factors that best support the inherent personal characteristics thataffect individual behavior and they addressthe broader context of the social environ-ment. These concepts have significantimplications for how programmatic inter-ventions may occur within the criminal jus-tice system. Retributive justice. The traditional crimi- nal justice perspective of retributive justicegenerally sees drug abuse as a willfulchoice made by an offender capable ofchoosing between right and wrong andacting on that choice. The approachemphasizes deterrence through strictpenalties, including increasing arrests,developing tougher sentencing laws, andbuilding new prisons to hold and punishoffenders (McBride et al., 2001). Imple-mentation of this perspective does tem-porarily reduce the number of criminals onthe streets as well as interrupt an offend-er's drug use. However, drug-using offend-ers do not appear to alter their behavior inthe face of punishment alone (Goldkamp,1994). Thus, it is highly likely that offend-ers will recidivate, and the cycle of druguse and crime will continue (Hora, Schma,and Rosenthal, 1999). Therapeutic jurisprudence and restora- tive justice. Therapeutic jurisprudence has been defined as \"the use of social sci-ence to study the extent to which a legalrule or practice promotes the psychologi-cal and physical well-being of the people itaffects\" (Slobogin, 1995, p. 196). Withinthis framework, key players from the jus-tice system (including judges, prosecu-tors, and defense attorneys) move fromadversarial roles to problem solvers as partof a collaborative team while still perform-ing their traditional roles of guardians ofcommunity protection, administrators ofthe law, and protectors of due process(Spangenberg and Beeman, 1998). Thera-peutic jurisprudence specifically addressesthe needs and problems of drug offendersfrom a medical, therapeutic perspective.110SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Drug addiction is viewed as a problem with deeply rooted biological, psychologi-cal, and social influences, and substanceabusers are seen as having a conditionthat requires treatment. From this per-spective, the criminal justice systemoffers the best opportunity some offenderswill ever have to confront and overcome their drug use and its consequences. Pro-grammatic approaches that often employtherapeutic justice principles include drugcourts, restorative conferencing, cross-systems case management, coerced andvoluntary drug treatment programs, dayreporting centers, and intensive monitor-ing approaches. Each of these approacheswill be reviewed in greater detail later inthis paper. Within the past decade, a justice philoso- phy associated with the principles under-lying therapeutic jurisprudence has emerged:restorative justice. Used primarily for non-violent adult and juvenile offenders, therestorative justice approach (also termedrestorative conferencing) attempts to bal-ance the needs of victims, the community,and offenders. Unlike retributive justice,which is concerned primarily with punish-ing the offender, restorative justice seeksto repair the damage inflicted by thecrime. This approach makes the criminalprocess less formal by involving the victimand community members in the planningand implementation of the sentencing.Rather than asking what should be doneto punish the offender, restorative justiceasks the following questions (Zehr, 1990): What is the nature of the harm resultingfrom the crime? What needs to be done to repair theharm? Who is responsible for the repair? Restorative justice has been implemented in a number of programmatic methods,including victim-offender mediation, community reparative boards, family group conferencing, and circle sentencing (seeBazemore and Umbreit, 2001). The sharedfeatures of these approaches include: Promoting citizen and community own-ership of the criminal justice system. Providing an opportunity for the victimand other community members to con-front the offender about his or herbehavior. Providing opportunities for the offenderto learn about the impact of the crimeand to take responsibility and be heldaccountable for the offense. Creating meaningful consequencesdeveloped by the victim, the communi-ty, and sometimes by the offender andhis or her support system. Although concerns and implementation issues exist regarding restorative justice(such as some resistance by the victims'rights movement, the need for collabora-tive relations with the community at large,and potential clashes with current sen-tencing and corrections law), the philo-sophical approach shows promise as afuture direction in addressing drugs andcrime (Smith, 2001). Summary Human behavior is an extremely complexphenomenon, and theories imply that pro-grams that acknowledge the multiple sys-tems and factors that affect behavior willhave the greatest chance for realisticallyassisting in behavior change\u2014in thiscase, reducing both drug use and crime.Although programmatic interventionsfocusing on punishment and deterrencealone can temporarily reduce drug andcrime rates, long-term solutions seem tofavor interventions based on principlessimilar to those of therapeutic jurispru-dence as well as restorative justice.111TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY State- and Federal-level policy approaches to breaking the drugs-crimerelationship As noted previously, American drug policy is undergoing continual modification. Thus,the observed relationship between crimelevels associated with drug use and drugpolicy is constantly changing. There arecurrently a broad array of drug policymovements that may directly affect thedrugs-crime relationship. The most wide-spread and potentially influential of thesepolicy changes include marijuana medical-ization and/or decriminalization, lesseningof the powder and crack cocaine sentenc-ing disparity, current activity surroundingclub drugs, revisiting the concept ofmandatory minimum sentencing, treat-ment versus prison, and model State druglaws. Each of these movements will bebriefly described below, with a focus onhow the proposed policy changes mayaffect the drugs-crime relationship. Marijuana medicalization Movement toward the ongoing since the1970s (see Belenko, 2000; Goode, 1997).The two actions that preceded the move-ment were the National Commission onMarihuana and Drug Abuse report in 1972that called for reduced penalties for pos-session, and the unpublished 1975 trial ofUnited States v. Randal, which allowed the use of a medical necessity defensefor marijuana possession when a glauco-ma patient was arrested for growing hisown plants (Belenko, 2000). By the endof 1982, 31 States and the District ofColumbia had enacted medical marijuanaprovisions (Markoff, 1997). However,in 1986, the Food and Drug Administra-tion approved the use of the brand-name drug Marinol (dronabinol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC) to preventthe nausea and vomiting often occurringwith cancer treatments and to increase appetite in patients with AIDS. ManyState medical marijuana laws were allow-ed to expire or were repealed followingMarinol's approval (Dogwill, 1998). Current efforts at marijuana medicalization began in the mid-1990s as a result ofmedia pressure and general dissatisfactionwith Marinol and other antiemetic drugs(Dogwill, 1998). As of the end of the 2000legislative year, 28 States had statutesproviding for the medicinal use of marijua-na (Pacula et al., 2001). The type of lawsenacted by States varies, and States mayhave more than one law type. The listbelow shows the number of States withcurrently operating laws and a briefdescription of the laws and related pro-tections (Pacula et al., 2001): 1. Therapeutic research programs (TRPs): 14 (only 6 of which are cur-rently operational). TRPs are adminis-tered by State health departments orpharmacy boards and must be approv-ed by the Food and Drug Administra-tion and adhere to specific Federalregulations. Protection is providedonly to approved and participatingpatients, physicians, and pharmacies,and for specified ailments not respond-ing to other available treatments. 2. Physician prescription laws: 13. These laws are of three types: One allowsphysicians to discuss the medical ben-efits of marijuana with patients; thesecond allows physicians to prescribemarijuana for medical purposes; andthe third provides an affirmativedefense for physician discussion orprescription of marijuana. These lawsprotect physicians only, not patients. 3. Medical necessity laws: 10. These actions provide a defense from pros-ecution to patients and/or caregiversfor possessing marijuana for medicalpurposes if obtained via physician 112SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 recommendation, certification, or authorization. 4. Rescheduling laws: 3. These laws re- schedule marijuana to categories thatrecognize an acceptable use for mari-juana and/or claim a lower potential forabuse. Of the four types of laws noted above, only TRPs are federally sanctioned. Al-though the other three types of laws havebeen or are being challenged in court, nofirm ruling has been given that wouldclearly identify the final outcome of med-ical marijuana initiatives. Although the out-come of the medical marijuana debate isunknown, the policies in question haveseveral ramifications for the drugs-crimerelationship (Pacula et al., 2001). Theseinclude potential decreases in marijuana-related arrests due to a supportable de-fense for medical use, significant changesin black-market marijuana prices betweenStates with varying medicalization ability or willingness toprosecute recreational marijuana users,changes in possession penalties, and dif-ferences in use rates for both adults andadolescents. Marijuana decriminalization The decriminalization of marijuana posses-sion in law or in enforcement policy hasbeen evolving for many years. In theearly 1970s, the National Commission onMarihuana and Drug Abuse called for thedecriminalization of simple marijuana pos-session. This would mean the removal ofall criminal penalties; possession would beneither a felony nor a misdemeanor. Inpractice, the application of such a simpledefinition is complex. Although 11 Statesindicate that they have decriminalized mar-ijuana, an examination of those statutesindicates that, operationally, decriminaliza-tion means the removal of incarcerationfor first or second marijuana possessionoffenses but may include fines and/orjail/prison penalties for subsequent pos- session offenses. MacCoun and Reuter(1997) have suggested that a better termmight be depenalization. While the exactdefinition of decriminalization is debated,complex, and inconsistently applied, a re-view of State statutes shows significantvariation regarding possible penalties forsimple marijuana possession ranging fromno monetary penalties and no incarcera-tion to fines in the five figures and multipleyears in prison (ImpacTeen Illicit DrugTeam, 2002). In addition, anecdotal reports suggest that some local police depart-ments simply do not enforce existing marijuana possession laws. All of this sug-gests that States (and communities) showsignificant variance in marijuana policy,and the impact of this variance should beexamined to determine the possible rami-fications for arrests, black-market prices,use rates, and associated harms. Lessening of the powder and crack cocaine sentencing disparity There has been considerable public and research focus on the current sentencingdifferences between the possession orsale of powder versus crack cocaine.Sentencing disparities emerged in the1980s in the context of large increases incrack cocaine use, together with the con-clusion that crack cocaine caused signifi-cantly more harm than powder cocaine tothe individual and the community throughincreased violence (McBride et al., 2001).Congress eventually enacted legislationmandating 5-year prison terms for the possession or sale of 5 grams of crackcocaine. This same legislation mandatedthe same penalty (5 years) for the posses-sion of 500grams of powder cocaine (Sentencing Project, 1998). Thus, theFederal Government defined the mandato-ry minimum sentencing disparity of crackto powder cocaine at 100:1. The ramifica-tions of this policy became apparent fairly113TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY early in its application: There were signifi- cant increases in the prison population, inthe number of drug users in prison, andspecifically in the number of African-Americans in prison (Beck and Mumola,1999; Mumola, 1999). Currently, 86 per-cent of all Federal crack cocaine defen-dants are African-American (SentencingProject, 1998). In 1995, the U.S. SentencingCommission recommended theelimination of the sentencing disparity between crackand powder forms of cocaine, arguing thatthe policy had not accomplished its goal ofreducing crack use but had resulted in sig-nificant unintended consequences. Therecommendation was not acted upon. In1997, the same group recommended mov-ing to a 5:1 sentencing ratio, the Clintonadministration recommended a 10:1 ratio,and an additional bill was introduced in theSenate specifying a 20:1 ratio. No actionwas ever taken, however, and the initialsentencing disparity remains at the originalFederal level of 100:1. It is important tonote that at the State level, sentencing dis-parity is not universally mandated (but maybe specified in State sentencing guide-lines). Some States, such as Michigan,have begun to modify the disparity in theirlaws (Sentencing Project, 1998). The growing club drug reaction The general term \"club drugs\" refers to a\"number of illicit drugs, primarily synthet-ic, that are most commonly encounteredat nightclubs and 'raves'\" (Drug Enforce-ment Administration Intelligence Division,2000, p. 1). Examples of drugs in-clude Ecstasy, Ketamine, Rohypnol, andGHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate). Both userates and emergency men-tions for these substances (especiallyEcstasy) have recently increased. Johns-ton, O'Malley, and Bachman (2001) reportthat use of Ecstasy in the past 12 monthsamong 12th graders increased from 6 per-cent in 1999 to 8 percent in 2000. Accord-ing to the Drug Abuse Warning Network(DAWN), there were only 25 emergencydepartment mentions of Ecstasy in 1994. In 1999, the number had risen to 2,850(DAWN, 2000). Results of these increaseshave been felt in both research and policy.Research focus on the psychopharmaco-logical effects of Ecstasy is growing (forexample, see Boot, McGregor, and Hall,2000), as are attempts to provide validinformation about the effects and dangersof its use (Larkin, 2000). At the Federalpolicy level, the Ecstasy Anti-ProliferationAct was enacted in October 2000. The Actdirects the U.S. Sentencing Commissionto increase penalties for Ecstasy traffick-ing as part of an increased deterrenceapproach to use. State laws also arechanging, with substantial numbers ofStates moving to schedule Ecstasy and/orto increase penalties for sales (ImpacTeenIllicit Drug Team, 2002). Reconsidering mandatory minimum sentencing Mandatory minimum sentencing plays a significant role in the drugs-crime relation-ship and has been a major component ofthe war on drugs. Initially, it was thoughtthat high mandatory penalties for drug lawviolations (such as serving at least 85 per-cent of an assigned sentence) would havea deterrent effect on drug use, relatedcriminal behavior, and associated costs(see McBride et al., 2001). However, theprimary results of mandatory minimumsentencing likely have been to increasedramatically the number of drug-relatedarrests and the proportion of prisonerswho are drug users (Harlow, 1998; Mumola,1999). Mandatory minimums for drugcharges may play a significant role in theshifting of power from judges to prosecu-tors, prison overcrowding, and a break-down in truth-in-sentencing laws becauseof early release due to prison overcrowd-ing. In reality, prison overcrowding oftenmakes mandatory minimum sentencinglaws all but impossible to enforce (seeMcBride et al., 2001).114SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Those who question the appropriateness of mandatory minimum sentences havebeen supported by studies suggesting thatthis approach to addressing the drugs-crime relationship is not effective and ismore costly than treatment (for example,see Caulkins et al., 1998). Significant activi-ty at the State and Federal level is focusingon mandatory minimum sentencing revi-sion. Along with seeking to reduce thecrack/powder sentencing discrepancy, theU.S. Sentencing Commission has beenactively supporting efforts to reevaluatemandatory minimum sentencing (Sen-tencing Project, 1998). New York (the Statethat played a major role in the introductionof mandatory minimum sentencing fordrug offenders via the Rockefeller DrugLaws) is seriously considering significantmodification of its policies. The proposedNew York modifications focus on an expan-sion of treatment services, a reduction inthe range of mandatory minimum sen-tences, and an expansion of judicial discre-tion (Sengupta, 2001). If and when thesechanges take place (at the national leveland/or in specific States), it will be impor-tant to examine their impact on the drugs-crime relationship. Treatment versus prison Coerced treatment (also referred to as compulsory, mandated, or involuntarytreatment) is a heavily debated issue.Some oppose the practice on philosophi-cal or constitutional grounds, while manytreatment clinicians maintain that treat-ment can be successful only if a personis truly motivated to change. Other re-searchers (Anglin and Maugh, 1992;Salmon and Salmon, 1983) and policymak-ers have argued that few chronic addictswill voluntarily agree to enter and remainin treatment without external coercion.In a review of research examining the relationship between various levels oflegal pressure and treatment outcomes,Farabee, Prendergast, and Anglin (1998) determined that findings generally sup-ported the use of coercive measures toincrease the likelihood that an offenderwill enter and remain in treatment. Speci-fically, they concluded that compulsorysubstance abuse treatment is \"an effec-tive source of treatment referral, as wellas a means for enhancing retention andcompliance\" (p. 7). Since researchers gen-erally agree that length of time in treat-ment is strongly related to treatmentsuccess, coercing offenders into treat-ment and then applying graduated sanc-tions to motivate continued participation isa potentially successful strategy. It cancertainly be stated that coerced treatmentplays a major role in treatment referrals.Recent studies indicate that the criminaljustice system is responsible for 40 to 50percent of community-based treatmentprogram referrals (Farabee, Prendergast,and Anglin, by substance, with marijuana andmethamphetamine referrals occurring sig-nificantly more often than referrals forother substances (Drug Abuse WarningNetwork, 2000). However, Taxman (2000) argues that merely mandating an offender to treat-ment does little to increase motivationor success. Simpson and colleagues(Simpson et al., 1997; Simpson, Joe, andBrown, 1997) have found that failure toaddress motivation and readiness for treat-ment reduces treatment effectiveness. Inaddition, Farabee et al. (1999) maintainthat the application of mandated treatmentvaries widely, ranging from simple referralto treatment to strict graduated sanctionswith heavy monitoring and clear penaltiesfor failure. More research is needed todetermine which offender types may ex-perience the greatest benefits of coercedtreatment, and with which levels of treat-ment structures and settings (e.g. residen-tial versus intensive outpatient with heavymonitoring).115TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Reports on the promise of coerced treatment have prompted some Statelegislatures to adopt various forms of corrections-initiated drug treatment fornonviolent drug-using offenders. The fol-lowing is a review of these State initia-tives, as well as a Federal measure undercurrent consideration. California. State voters recently passed the Substance Abuse and Crime Preven-tion Act of 2000, which targets $128 mil-lion per year to help counties develop thecapacity to provide drug treatment, literacytraining, family counseling, and vocationaltraining services for an expected 36,000new treatment clients per year ( San Francisco Examiner, 2000). Arizona. The Arizona Drug Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act of 1996requires mandatory treatment and pro-hibits incarceration of first- and second-time drug offenders. A 1998 ArizonaSupreme Court report concluded that theState saved $2.5 million in its first year bysending users into treatment rather thanprison (Arizona Supreme Court, 1999).Although critics claim it is too early toargue for program effectiveness due toselection bias and lack of long-term recidi-vism rates, the study found that 77 per-cent of offenders tested drug free at theend of their outpatient treatment pro-grams. In addition, probationers whoreceived treatment were twice as likely tobe employed (90 versus 41 percent), tofinish community service requirements(85 versus 40 percent), and to completeprobation successfully (85 versus 22 per-cent) when compared with those who didnot complete treatment. New York. Governor Pataki recently unveiled a plan to reform the State'sRockefeller Drug Laws by cutting mini-mum sentences from 15 to 8 1/3 years forsome offenses, giving judges increaseddiscretion in sentencing, and giving prose-cutors the power to divert repeat drugoffenders into 18-month residential treat- ment programs in lieu of prison time(Gallagher, 2001). These plans resulted pri-marily from the recommendations of anindependent commission charged to studythe impact of drug cases on New YorkState courts. The principal recommenda-tion of this commission was to \"launch asystematic, statewide approach to thedelivery of 'coerced' drug treatment tononviolent addicts in every jurisdiction\"(New York State Commission on Drugsand the Courts, 2000, p. 7). Massachusetts. The Department of Public Health's Bureau of SubstanceAbuse Services recently reported that integrating such services across the Stateresulted in significant improvements in anumber of categories, including reductionsin crime involvement, psychological prob-lems, and use of health services, as wellas improvements in employment levelsand abstinence rates (Massachusetts De-partment of Public Health, 2000). Based inpart on these successes, ballot initiativeProposition P was introduced in the 2000general election to divert drug forfeituremoney from police and district attorneysto treatment centers. The measure failed,possibly due to claims that the initiativewas a cover for efforts to decriminalizedangerous drugs ( Boston Globe, 2000). National. The U.S. Senate is currently considering the recently introduced DrugAbuse Education, Prevention, and Treat-ment Act of 2001 (S. 304, 2001). Themeasure would, among other things,authorize new funding grants to States forthe purpose of providing drug treatmentservices to inmates and residential treat-ment facilities. Model State drug laws In 1992, the President's Commission onModel State Drug Laws was charged withthe task of creating a compilation of modelState laws that would effectively address116SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 drug and alcohol use (President's Com- mission on Model State Drug Laws,1993). After a series of public hearings,drug treatment program site visits, andmeetings with various individuals, agen-cies and groups, a total of 44 model lawsand policies were developed. In its report,the Commission noted that [T]he legislative remedies offered within do not rely exclusively on pun-ishment and deterrence to \"solve\"drug problems. Instead, the goal ofthis report is to establish a compre-hensive continuum of responses andservices, encompassing prevention,education, detection, treatment,rehabilitation, and law enforcementto allow individuals and communitiesto fully address alcohol and otherdrug problems. Tough sanctions areused to punish those individuals whorefuse to abide by the law. Moreimportantly, the recommended sanc-tions are designed to be construc-tive, attempting to leverage alcoholand other drug abusers into treat-ment, rehabilitation, and ultimately,recovery. (pp. 1-2) The five main policy areas are as follows (see appendix A for a listing of specificmodel laws and policies within theseareas): economic remedies, communitymobilization, crimes code enforcement,treatment, and drug-free families/schools/workplaces (President's Commission onModel State Drug Laws, 1993). Following the compilation of the model laws and policies, The National Alliance forModel State Drug Laws (Alliance) wasorganized as a nonprofit group that wouldserve as an ongoing resource for Statesconsidering implementation of legislationbased on the model laws. The Alliancehas held several conferences across theUnited States to work with elected andappointed officials, substance abuse pro-fessionals, and other community leadersand members (National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws, 2001). Several Stateshave passed legislation using the modellaws as a framework for laws specificallytailored to their needs, including Arizona,Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisi-ana, Mississippi, New Jersey, NorthCarolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah (NationalAlliance for Model State Drug Laws,2001). However, no known evaluations ofthe impact of these laws currently exist.Additional efforts by the Alliance to assistwith drug policy revision include providingnational and Federal agencies with assis-tance on State and local laws and policies. Summary Trends in State- and Federal-level policies aimed at the drugs-crime relationship can(and indeed do) move in different direc-tions for different substances. Althoughthere has been considerable movement tomodify marijuana laws at the State level,no comparable action has been seen atthe Federal level. The movement towardreducing the sentencing disparity betweencrack and powder cocaine (as well as re-duce overall penalties) is co-occurring withState and Federal trends to increase thescheduling and penalties for club drugssuch as Ecstasy. A further concern raisedby this section is that although researchmay indicate the legitimacy and wisdomof revising current policy (such as movingto coerced treatment instead of incarcera-tion), there is often significant resistanceto such actions based on the fear of fur-ther escalations of the drugs-crime con-nection or negative voter reaction. Thenature of public policy is complex and re-ciprocal: The public elects policymakerswho support the majority view. This tendsto make legislators cautious about sup-porting changes in drug policy. Therefore,the development of possible public policythat might contradict traditional viewpointscan be highly problematic (Tonry, 1996).However, the breadth and scope of poten-tial legislative actions is impressive. With The President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws' five main policy areas are economic remedies, community mobilization, crimes code enforcement, treatment, and drug-free families/schools/ workplaces.117TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY an increasing number of States developing innovative laws based on examples suchas the Model State Drug Laws, there isneed for researchers to examine the pos-sible effects of such policy changes. This paper has reviewed a wide variety of data describing the drugs-crime relation-ship and its complex nature, conceptualframeworks that may help interpret therelationship, and the implications of policyfor the relationship. An important part ofsociety's reaction to the relationship hasbeen to develop programs to intervenewith or break the drugs-crime cycle. Al-though such intervention attempts haveoccurred for more than a century, theyhave become increasingly sophisticated aspolicy makers and clinicians have come tofurther understand and apply researchfindings and relevant conceptual models.The next section of this paper examinesmany of the intervention programs thathave been used and assesses key pro-gram elements that have shown somesuccess at intervening in the drugs-crimerelationship. Integrated programmatic approaches to breaking thedrugs-crime cycle In developing programmatic interventions designed to break the drugs-crime cycleamong offenders, it is essential to ensurethat neither community safety nor offend-er accountability be compromised in anyway, particularly for violent and chronicoffenders. However, as noted previously,drug-related crimes exist along a continu-um of severity ranging from index crimes\u2014such as murder and armed robbery\u2014tomore minor offenses such as nonviolentdrug possession. Interventions such asdrug treatment should be provided along acontinuum as well. Drug-involved offend-ers who commit serious crimes mightreceive drug treatment services a sig- nificantly restrictive prison-based thera-peutic community. Nonviolent drug-usingoffenders might receive andongoing supervision from a drug court andparticipate in minimally restrictive victim-offender mediation, along with mandatedattendance in intensive outpatient drugtreatment services. Many jurisdictions struggle to integrate substance abuse treatment into their crim-inal justice systems, which often viewsuch efforts as adjunct services ratherthan primary, integrated components.Taxman (2000) notes six threats that im- pede the implementation of treatmentservices: Lack of clear crime control goals fortreatment services. Lack of clear assessment and eligibilityrequirements. Insufficient treatment duration to effectbehavioral change. Lack of supervision and sanctions/rewards to reinforce treatment goals. Lack of objective drug testing to monitortreatment progress. Insufficient case management services. Many researchers and practitioners have argued that to address these threats, acomprehensive and integrated approachshould be used to maximize treatmentsuccess and minimize future harm tothe community (Anglin and et al., 1999; Martin et al., 1999;Taxman, 1998). Taxman (2000) argues for a systems approach in which \"correctionaland treatment agencies build a deliverysystem that cuts across and integrates thesystems, reduces duplication in efforts tocreate and recreate processes for unique118SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 programs, and emphasizes empirically driven programmatic components\" (pp.5-6). The following review will discuss interven- tions designed to break the drugs-crimecycle among offenders using an integratedapproach that can be applied throughoutthe range of sentencing alternatives. 3This approach, which integrates restorative justice with an ecosystems framework,includes the following components: and comprehensive assessment;judicial processing, including the use ofdrug courts; supervision and monitor-ing, including graduated sanctions cross-systems collaboration; the drug treatmentservice continuum; and aftercare. Comprehensive assessment and treatment planning Appropriate client selection, assessment, and placement have been identified ascritical components of the treatment con-tinuum (Simpson and Curry, 1997-98;Taxman, 1998; Farabee et al., 1999). Sub- stance abuse problems are usually en-meshed within a wide variety of otherissues. Thus, comprehensive assessmentis necessary to successfully address alco-hol and other drug problems. Assessment. Assessment usually occurs at the point of intake into the criminal jus-tice system (often at either centralizedintake centers or police stations). Intakerecommendations can heavily affect judi-cial decisions; it is imperative that intakepersonnel be thoroughly trained in the useof comprehensive assessment tools. Suchtraining should include incorporation ofculture and ethnicity issues in comprehen-sive evaluations, as well as dealing withthe complexities of clients with multiplediagnoses. A poorly conducted assess-ment, using techniques and measurementinstruments that do not consider theoffender's entire life situation in a holisticmanner, are destined to produce faulty and inadequate recommendations anddecisions. Careful assessment mecha-nisms not only will help identify thoseservices that are most needed by offend-ers, but also will prevent system duplica-tion leading to inefficient and poorlycoordinated service delivery. By properlyassessing and coordinating services atintake, the justice system can more effec-tively work towards preventing increasinglevels of future recidivism and drug use. Offender evaluation generally occurs in two phases: initial screening, followed bymore comprehensive assessment. Theprimary purpose of initial screening is todetermine if the need for a more compre-hensive assessment exists. Thus, it isinappropriate to use screening instru-ments to formulate a diagnosis or decidetreatment needs. Screening instrumentsalso filter out individuals with medical, psychological, or legal problems thatneed to be addressed prior to placement.Common screening instruments includethe CAGE Questionnaire, the MichiganAlcoholism Screening Test, and theOffender Profile Index (for more detaileddescriptions of these tools, see Inciardi,1994). If the screening instrument indicates an alcohol or other drug problem, a morecomprehensive assessment is needed. Atminimum, a comprehensive assessmentshould include: An indepth examination of the severityand nature of the alcohol and other drugabuse identified by the screeningprocess. A more thorough assessment of addi-tional problems flagged during screeningand further inquiry into problems thatmay not have been identified up to thatpoint. A strong effort to use multiple methodsand sources.Common screening instruments include the CAGE Questionnaire, the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, and the Offender Profile Index.119TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Components of a comprehensive assess- ment instrument include: History and current patterns of alcoholand other drug use. Past and current involvement in thecriminal justice system, including anyhistory of violent behavior and manifes-tations of antisocial personality and psy-chopathology. Family and social support systems. Medical history and current health sta-tus, including HIV/AIDS screening. Mental health history and current status,including screening for any history ofabuse, anxiety, or depression. Educational and vocational history andneeds. Two commonly used assessment instru- ments are the Addiction Severity Index(ASI) and the Wisconsin Uniform Sub-stance Abuse Screening Battery (adaptedfrom the well-known Minnesota MultiphasicPersonality Inventory). The Wisconsininstrument is composed of four separatesub-instruments: the Alcohol DependenceScale, the Offender Drug Use History, theClient Management Classification inter-view, and the Megargee Offender Typ-ology. Important supplemental tests tothese comprehensive assessment instru-ments include the AIDS Initial Assess-ment Jail/Prison Supplement and variousbiological tests to determine recent drugor alcohol use, including urinalysis, breath-alyzer tests, blood tests, hair analysis, andsweat tests (for more detailed descrip-tions of all of these tools, see Inciardi,1994). Comorbidity issues. Researchers report high rates of depression in street drug-using populations (McBride et al., 2000).Additionally, a wide variety of data suggestthat there is a high rate of comorbidityamong incarcerated drug-using popula- tions. Since the early 1970s, researchershave called attention to the special needsof jail inmates with mental illness (Gibbens,1979; Gold, 1973; Verma, 1979). Althoughindepth studies on the prevalence of mental illness in prisons are very limited,researchers estimate that around 7 to 9percent of jail inmates are mentally ill(BJS, 1999, as cited in Lurigio and Swartz,2000, p. 67). Rates of mental illnessamong those who are alcohol or drugdependent are believed to be much high-er. Peters and colleagues (1992) foundthat, of jail inmates who were receivingsubstance abuse treatment, more thanhalf self-reported a history of depression,45 percent reported serious anxiety or tension, and 19 percent had a history ofsuicidal thoughts. Among juveniles, theNorthwestern Juvenile Project has esti-mated that two-thirds of juvenile de-tainees have one or more alcohol, drug, ormental disorders (Teplin, 2001). Becausedepression is also a consistent predictorof therapeutic noncompliance, it is impor-tant to make sure that an alcohol or otherdrug-diagnosed arrestee is properly as-sessed and treated for depression or othermental disorders (Markou, Kosten, andKoob, 1998). The conditions and care received by the detained mentally ill have been found tobe grossly inadequate (Alemagno, 2001;Birmingham et al., 2000; Lurigio andLewis, 1987). Outcome studies suggestthat to serve this population better, themost effective approach includes ade-quately training jail and prison personnelto meet emergency situations, performbasic assessments, and make appropriatereferrals to community-based mentalhealth services where safety concernscan be adequately monitored. Such anapproach would have the added benefit ofalso avoiding community-based serviceduplication Landsberg, and Paravati,1989; Lurigio, 2000).120SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Treatment planning. The treatment plan should be based on the client's needs,problems, strengths, and resources asidentified in the assessment process, andit should seek to use assessment informa-tion to match the client with the besttreatment modality and of risk(Inciardi, Taxman, in the planning processto improve buy-in and treatment compli-ance, they cannot dictate treatment goals.Treatment planning goals and objectives should be specific, measurable, and attain-able. They should also be flexible enoughto adapt to emerging client needs as theymove through the criminal justice andtreatment systems. Goals must conformto the limitations imposed by the court,parole or probation department, or othercriminal justice agency that has jurisdictionover the client. Good treatment plans alsoare designed to address issues related totreatment attrition, noncompliance, andinadequate progress (Inciardi, 1994). At the conclusion of intake and assess- ment, intake officers generally have theoption of dismissing the case with no fur-ther action, placing the offender in a diver-sion program, or referral to further justicesystem processing. Judicial processing If a decision is made to formally refer anoffender to court for further processing,judges will generally use the assessmentand arrest report as well as other facts todetermine disposition and, if necessary,sentencing. In most jurisdictions, fact-finding and adjudication take place in conventional court systems. However, inan attempt to play a more active role inbreaking the linkage between substanceuse and crime, the judicial system devel-oped the drug court. Specifically, a drug court takes responsibili- ty for less serious drug-using offenders,and often uses an intensive supervision and treatment program based on graduat-ed sanctions (described below). Drugcourts are partnerships between justicesystem personnel (prosecutors, defenseattorneys, and judges); treatment special-ists; and other social service personnel(National Association of Drug Court Pro-fessionals, 2000). Drug courts allowjudges to take a more active role than wasprovided by such previous options as man-dated lengthy sentences and to partnerwith community resources and agencies.Judges draw on a variety of professionalsin assessing needs and recommendingservices. They are then actively involvedin the decisionmaking process regardingwhat services are to be received. Judgesalso monitor compliance and apply sanc-tions when a lack of compliance is evi-dent. Some of the most unique andessential principles of drug courts includeimmediate and upfront intervention; coor-dinated, comprehensive supervision;access to a wide variety of treatment serv-ices including long-term treatment andaftercare; and graduated sanctions andincentive programs (Tauber, 1994; Professionals, 2000; Peyton andGossweiler, 2001). Evaluations of drug courts have been mixed. Concern has been expressed overevaluation research methodology, widevariations in populations served, and lackof consistent standards for assessmentand referral (Inciardi, McBride, and Rivers,1996; U.S. General Accounting Office,1997). More recent reviews by Belenko(1998) and Covington (2001) have conclud-ed that drug courts have not been subject-ed to consistent or methodologicallystrong evaluations that define terms clear-ly (from program elements to definitionsof success), examine the long-term impact121TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY of drug courts using appropriate compari- son groups, or identify what program ele-ments contribute to successful outcomes.Peyton and Gossweiler (2001) suggest theneed for more comprehensive policies andprotocols consistently applied in all drugcourts. This would contribute significantlyto methodologically strong evaluations. With the above concerns noted, evidence still points to a positive impact for drugcourts: high treatment retention, increasedsobriety, and reductions in recidivism havebeen noted in many drug court locations;in addition, savings in jail costs can besubstantial (Drug Strategies, 1997;Cooper, 1997; Harrell, Cavanagh, andRoman, 2000). A evaluation of amidwestern drug court by Spohn and col-leagues (2001), which used a comparisongroup design and controlled for a varietyof social and behavioral characteristics,concluded that drug court participants hadsignificantly lower rates of recidivism thanthose who received standard court pro-cessing. To be successful, drug courtsrequire a long-term outlook, significant initial resource allocation, and availabletreatment slots (Platt, 2001). Additionalresearch is needed to address the signifi-cant issues critics have raised regardingthe scientific support for drug court enthusiasm. Supervision and monitoring As stated in the introduction to this sec-tion, interventions for drug-using offend-ers must ensure community safety as wellas offender accountability. Programmaticapproaches designed to help accomplishsafety and accountability goals includesupervision via a system of graduatedsanctions, use of drug monitoring andtesting to substantiate accountability,and system oversight and coordinationthrough cross-systems case management.Graduated sanctions. Judicial processing within systems such as drug courts oftenrelies on graduated sanctions for supervi-sion purposes. This approach helps ensureoffender rights and deters noncompliance.Graduated sanctions are based on the the-oretical foundation of procedural justice,which posits that compliance is enhancedby procedures that are perceived as fair(Taxman, Soule, and Gelb, 1999). Lack ofcompliance is a significant problem acrossthe justice system. Studies indicate thatas many as 61 percent of probationers failto comply with release conditions (Langanand Cunniff, 1992), and that 30 to 80 per-cent of new prison intakes each year areprobation and parole violators (Burke,1997; Rhine, 1993). Some critics haveexpressed concerns that graduated sanc-tions are a form of \"net widening,\" inwhich probationers are given technical vio-lations for positive urinalysis tests. Suchpositive tests have become the equivalentof crimes, although they are described bythe drug treatment system as relapses. Taxman, Soule, and Gelb (1999) state that the efficacy of graduated sanctions resultsfrom the use of structured, incrementalresponses to noncompliant behavior andfrom an emphasis on swift response tononcompliant acts through a series of spe-cific sanctions that vary based on such factors as the nature and number of viola-tions. The concept of graduated sanctionsapplies to the following: The type of initial treatment intervention(outpatient, residential, or types of col-laborative services). The service delivery sentencing context(from community diversion to incarcera-tion with coerced drug treatment in aState training school). Overall intervention/treatment programoutcome goals. Progress within the program (McBrideet al., 1999).122SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Taxman, Soule, and Gelb (1999) state that to be effective, graduated sanctions mustinclude three specific elements: Inform offenders about infractionalbehavior and the potential conse-quences for such behavior. Ensure that all members of the graduat-ed sanctions judicial team adhere to theagreed-on sanctions model. Strive to uphold offender dignity. Use of a behavioral contract informing the offender of the graduated sanctions menushould be developed at intake or at thetime of court-ordered probation. Such asanctions proportionality,and (Taxman, Soule, andGelb, 1999), and it should provide forequivalent responses that allow for tailor-ing sanctions to specific cases. Research specifically evaluating graduated sanctions approaches is very limited. How-ever, the use of this approach is quitecommon within drug courts. In addition,initial studies indicate that offenders in apretrial intervention program that usedgraduated sanctions had lower rearrestrates for both short- and long-term (1-year)followup (Harrell, 1998). In addition, thecost-benefits of graduated sanctions indi-cate promise (Greenwood and Turner,1993; Rivers and Trotti, 1995). Drug monitoring and testing. In recent years, drug testing programs have be-come increasingly widespread in criminaljustice settings (Jacobs, DuPont, andGold, 2000). In 1998, 71 percent of jailsreported having a policy to test inmatesfor drug use; however, only 8 percentimposed mandatory treatment in responseto positive test results. Instead, the mostcommon responses to positive testinginvolved punitive sanctions ranging fromloss of privileges to adding time to thesentence (Wilson, 2000), a practice thatcritics regard as net widening. Regular drug testing is often part of an overallstrategy in which both treatment and crim-inal justice systems use graduated sanc-tions to monitor compliance. Advocates ofsuch strategies recommend that testingmust be conducted frequently and ran-domly. Researchers (Marlowe, 2001;Taxman, Soule, and Gelb, 1999) have rec- ommended several compliance-gainingstrategies, including clarification of nega-tive and positive behaviors as well asswift, certain, and progressive responses.It is important to use a team approach inwhich treatment providers and criminaljustice personnel share information aboutprogress or relapse issues. It is also im-portant to ensure that offenders are testedas long as they are under criminal justicesystem supervision. A wide variety of testing methods exists for illicit drugs, with variation in reliabilityand validity among testing procedures.The most widely practiced technique isurinalysis. Urinalysis offers a number ofadvantages compared with other testingmethods, including ease in obtaining asample, ability for sample retest, and lowcost (Jacobs, DuPont, and Gold, 2000).However, subjects can easily tamper withsamples, and testing only reflects druguse within the last few days. The windowof detection is also small for blood sam-pling, although results are highly reliable.In contrast, hair analysis allows for detec-tion of long-term use (within the last 90days), but provides unreliable data forstudying variables other than simple drugpresence. The least invasive testing tech-niques include sweat patch, saliva testing,and nail testing, but the wider utility ofthese approaches remains to be studied.Although a combination of modalities islikely to offer the most accurate results,privacy and feasibility issues usually deter-mine which methods are used in practice(Jacobs, DuPont, and Gold, 2000). Com-prehensive outcome studies are neededto evaluate the linkages between drug Although a combination of modalities is likely to offer the most accurate results, privacy and feasibility issues usually determine which methods are used in practice.123TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY testing and expected (negative) conse- quences for positive results. Cross-systems case management, including TASC. Case management pro- vides one way for criminal justice systemsto coordinate the comprehensive needsof offenders. Case management hasemerged as a strategy to connect clientsto needed resources throughout the serv-ice continuum, at intake, during treatment,and after treatment. Case managementresults in more rapid service access (Bo-kos et al., 1992), higher levels of goalattainment (Godley et al., 1994; Rapp,1997), longer lengths of stay in treatment(Rapp et al., 1998), reductions in drug use(Rapp, 1997), improved employment func-tioning (Siegal et al., 1996) and improvedconnection to needed resources over time(Dennis, when compared with stan-dard treatment services. Research sug-gests that case management may beeffective as an adjunct to substance abusetreatment for two reasons: Retention intreatment is generally associated with bet-ter outcomes, and one of case manage-ment's primary goals is to keep the clientengaged in the treatment process (Koldenet al., 1997; Siegal et al., 1995, 1996,1997); and treatment is more likely to suc-ceed when a client's non-substance-abuseproblems are also being addressed (e.g.financial problems, family problems, etc.;see Siegal, 1998). Case managers (CMs), who are often mental health or social workers, supportand reinforce treatment goals throughoutthe treatment continuum by providing thefollowing three functions: assessment(Babor et 1991); treatment planningand goal setting, linking, monitoring andadvocating (Ballew and Mink, 1996), in-cluding navigating the often-confusingsocial service system (Spear and Skala,1995); and assisting in offender reintegra-tion with home or other placement, socialservices, and the workforce. In addition, CMs may intervene in crisis situations orassist offenders with relapse preventionstrategies such as developing non-drug-related leisure activities. Intensive casemanagement services are most criticalduring the vulnerable 2-month period fol-lowing discharge from primary treatment.They provide continuity of care whilesimultaneously working to move the clienttoward independence. Although a CM can help an offender navi- gate through the interconnected array oftreatment services, it is also clear thatsuch services must be provided in thecontext of the justice system. Drug courts,probation offices, and other criminal jus-tice system components must work withCMs to coordinate an offender's move-ment through the justice system via theuse of graduated sanctions. The graduatedsanctions process allows the judge or pro-bation officer to maintain an appropriatebalance between community protectionand offender rehabilitation. However,judges generally have neither the time northe training to ensure that offenders re-ceive a continuum of services. Accordingto a recent NIJ examination of case management within the criminal justicesystem (Healey, 1999), optimum casemanagement models currently combinetwo broad approaches: strengths-basedcase management\u2014focusing on a client'sself-identified strengths and talents whendeveloping a service plan, and assuming aclient's ability to use these strengths tomove toward \"socially acceptable choic-es\" (Clark, 1997; Enos and Southern,1996; Rapp et al., 1998; Siegal et al.,1997); and assertive case management\u2014requiring active involvement of the CM inseeking out and delivering services toclients as opposed to passive service pro-vision (Healey, 1999; Inciardi, McBride,and Rivers, 1996). Within the criminal jus-tice setting, CMs combine support andpositive regard for a client's strengths withclear disapproval of the behaviors that led124SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 the client to become involved with the justice system. Healey (1999) notes that criminal justice case management often involves a con-scious blurring of roles between CMs,mental health providers, substance abusecounselors, domestic violence programcounselors, and other social serviceproviders. Taxman and Sherman (1998)have suggested that much of the role con-fusion can be reduced through a systemicapproach to case management, includingagreed-on role clarifications and resourceallocation. Significant cross-training isoften necessary to allow such blurring totake place without confusion of appropri-ate role responsibility or misunderstand-ings regarding philosophical differences(Healey, 1999). Effective use of assessment data within acase management framework requires acomplex information system that can ensure the availability of relevant informa-tion to those involved in service provision(Taxman and Sherman, 1998). If servicesare to be integrated effectively, it is crucialthat intake, assessment, and progressinformation be shared and not be need-lessly duplicated. Such information canplay a major role in increased service deliv-ery efficiency and improve the outcome ofprovided services (for further discussion ofthis area, see Mahoney et al., 1998). Perhaps the best example of a program- matic approach incorporating cross-systemscase management is TASC: TreatmentAlternatives for Safe Communities (alsoknown as Treatment Alternatives to StreetCrime, or Tr eatment Accountability for Safer Communities). TASC is recognizedas an offender management model(Anglin, Longshore, and Turner, 1999) thatlinks criminal justice system legal sanc-tions with drug treatment program thera-peutic interventions (Sigmon et al., 1999;see also Inciardi and McBride, 1991).The TASC approach consists of 4 distinctprocesses and 10 critical elements (Bureau of Justice Assistance, 1995). Thefour processes are: Identification of appropriate drug-involved offenders. Assessment of treatment needs. Referral to appropriate services andplacement. Continuous case management at allpoints along the criminal justice process-ing continuum (Anglin, Longshore, andTurner, 1999). The 10 critical elements involve: Broad-based support within both the criminal justice and treatment systemswith formal communication systems. Independence as a unit with designatedadministrator. Appropriate staff training on TASC poli-cies and procedures. An established data collection system. Explicit and agreed-on eligibility criteria. Documented assessment/referralscreening procedures. Documented policies and procedures fordrug testing. Offender monitoring procedures, includ-ing reporting procedures (Bureau ofJustice Assistance, 1995). The usual position of a TASC program is that of a neutral party. Most program sitesdo not provide treatment services of theirown, nor are they an official member ofthe criminal justice system. Thus, the programs can be perceived as using non-biased referral judgments and case man-agement decisions. Programs can be perceived as using nonbiased referral judgments and case management decisions.125TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Evaluations of TASC programs have been mixed, based on whether the evaluation isexamining operational/procedural issues oroutcome issues. Operational/proceduralevaluation results (see Anglin, Longshore,and Turner, 1999) have been consistentlypositive, citing strong screening and iden-tification of drug-using offenders (Toborget al., 1976); effective linkages with thecriminal justice system; increased ethnicdiversity in treatment; and increased treatment participation (Collins et al.,1982); improvements in treatment reten-tion (Hubbard et al., 1989; Inciardi andMcBride, 1991), and considerable cost-benefit ratios when compared with anyform of incarceration (System Sciences,1979). Outcome evaluations have beenmixed. Studies focusing on recidivismgenerally show that TASC clients eitherhave higher recidivism rates or signifi-cant recidivism comparedwith control groups (Anglin, Longshore,and Turner, Owens et 1997).However, as monitoringlevels, on recidivism may simplyindicate \"net widening\"; those who arewatched more are caught more. This mayindicate a possibility of higher public safetyin TASC communities, rather than programfailure. Anglin, Longshore, and Turner's(1999) review of five TASC programs cho-sen to reflect similar programmatic andpopulation characteristics (including adher-ence to the 10 critical elements) indicatedfavorable outcomes for service delivery,drug-use days, drug crimes, and sexualactivity while high on drugs. However,these results were either modest or wereconfined to high-risk offenders. Anglin,Longshore, and Turner conclude that moreproblematic offenders may receive thehighest benefit from program participation.Covington (2001) reminds program ad-ministrators and researchers that TASCprograms have generally not received con-sistent methodologically strong long-termoutcome evaluations. Future researchshould focus on these issues.Cross-systems collaboration By definition, the drugs-crime relationshipcrosses currently accepted jurisdictionalresponsibilities and requires system part-nerships. The promising componentsdescribed so far in this paper demand thesuccessful integration of a wide variety ofservices and jurisdictions, including crimi-nal justice, drug treatment, social services,and public health. Effective use of immedi-ate and comprehensive assessment, drugcourts, communication necessary for suc-cessful use of graduated sanctions, cross-systems case management in the form ofagencies such as TASC, and post-criminal-justice transition services to reintegratedrug users back into the community\u2014allof these approaches are based on an inte-grated care system. Yet, as Sigmon et al.(1999) note, the adjudication process ishistorically an adversarial system, and cre-ating successful partnerships that involvea variety of individual agencies is often difficult. To build the infrastructure required to sup- port cross-systems interactions, collabora-tive efforts are becoming widespread.Eisenburg and Fabelo (1996) argue thatfailure to develop an integrated infrastruc-ture not only negatively affects the out-comes of individual programs, but alsohastens treatment decay. Such infrastruc-tures have a variety of names but oneessential goal: to have representativesfrom key agencies and services jointogether to identify the problems theircommunity is seeking to target, developeffective goals and strategies to addressthose problems, and then oversee theimplementation of those goals and strate-gies (Sigmon et al., 1999). The types ofproblems such collaborative efforts ad-dress should not be narrowly construed.Sigmon and colleagues (1999) refer toadjudication partnerships as an \"umbrellaconcept under which many interagencyefforts can be classified\" (p. 2).126SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 While collaborative formation usually results from grassroots efforts of localleaders (Sigmon et al., 1999), the recentemergence of State- and county-levelmanaged-care models often requireprovider subcontracts and collaboration(McBride et al., 1999). Key agency mem-bers for collaboratives addressing drugsand crime would include justice systemagencies (offices of the prosecution, thedefense, and the court), as well as othergroups such as law enforcement, welfare,State and local corrections, managedbehavioral health care, community treat-ment, the health department, and Stateand local managed-care initiatives (Mull,1998; Sigmon et al., 1999). Such a mem-bership list would allow two essentialtypes of individuals: \"1) those who under-stand and have an interest in the broadand specific problems of community wel-fare, justice, alcohol and other drug abuse,and health and social services, and 2)community leaders who can ensure thatproductive change occurs\" (McPhail andWiest, 1995, p. 28). Although each collaborative will be uniquely tailored to the community it serves, re-views of collaborative efforts have identi-fied several critical elements for success(Sigmon et al., 1999, pp. 2-4; see alsoBureau of Justice Assistance, 1995; Mc-Bride et al., 1999). These include leadershipdesignation, membership integration, goalsetting, development of a team approach,emphasis on a long-term view, researchand evaluation, efforts to develop broad-based community support, and sustainablefunding (see appendix B for a more thor-ough discussion of these elements). Continuum of drug treatment services Many policymakers, particularly legislators, oppose funding for drug treatment in cor-rectional facilities, believing that the publicwants offenders punished rather than coddled (Lipton, 1998). However, research involving numerous large-scale studiesconsistently demonstrates that treatmenthas beneficial outcomes. These federallyfunded and independently evaluated stud-ies\u2014including the Drug Abuse TreatmentOutcome Study (DATOS), the NationalTreatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES), the Treatment Outcome Prospec-tive Study (TOPS), and the Drug AbuseReporting Program (DARP)\u2014have all con-firmed drug abuse treatment efficacythrough 1-year followup. These findingsremained valid when controlling for typeof service received (residential long-term,outpatient drug-free, or outpatient metha-done maintenance) as well as drug andclient type (U.S. General AccountingOffice, 1998). However, the NationalResearch Council (2001) has questionedthe strength of these studies' conclusions,arguing that because the studies lackedrandomized assignment, researchers\"could not provide rigorous evidenceon the relative effectiveness or efficacyof particular drug-by-treatment combina-tions, or estimate the absolute effect size,cost-effectiveness, or benefit-cost ratio oftreatment\" (p. 230). Cost savings for treatment relative to incarceration, interdiction, and health careexpenditures have been estimated by tworecent studies. The first, the CaliforniaDrug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment(CALDATA), examined the effectiveness,costs, and benefits of providing alcoholand drug treatment in California (Gersteinet al., 1997). Economic savings to theCalifornia taxpayer both during and aftertreatment were estimated to be worth$10,000 per client, yielding a 1:7 cost-benefit ratio (the greatest share of thebenefits was found in crime reductions,with smaller savings in health care andwelfare costs). The study also reported a68-percent reduction in drug selling and a60-percent reduction in arrests resultingfrom drug treatment. In the second study,127TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY RAND researchers developed an econom- ic model to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of four cocaine-controlprograms: three \"supply control\" treating heavyusers (Rydell and Everingham, 1994).Results indicated for every dollarspent on drug treatment, $7 would haveto be spent on incarceration and $25 oninterdiction to achieve the same degree ofreduction in cocaine use (cost savingswould vary depending on factors such astreatment setting, length of time in treat-ment, and degree of treatment structure).Further, they argued that even when onlylooking at modest in-treatment effects(assuming 0-percent post-treatment effec-tiveness through abstinence), cost savingsfor treatment exceeded those that wouldbe achieved through incarceration andinterdiction. This study was later updatedto distinguish among a variety of types ofdomestic enforcement and used a moreoptimistic assumption concerning howresponsive consumption is to enforcement-induced price increases. Caulkins and hiscolleagues (Caulkins et al., 1997) conclud-ed that treatment is more cost-effective than either enforcement approach [con-ventional or federal] at reducing bothcocaine consumption and cocainespending. Treatment is solidly but notexceptionally more cost-effectivethan the federal-level enforcementprograms at reducing consumption;it has a 1.6:1 edge over conventionalenforcement and close to a 3:1 ad-vantage over mandatory minimums.(p. 51) They also found treatment to be \"enor- mously more cost-effective (on the orderof 70 times more cost-effective) at reduc-ing spending on cocaine\" (p. 51) thanenforcement strategies that shrink con-sumption primarily by driving up prices.In a critique of the original 1994 RAND model, the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy (ONDCP)-funded National ResearchCouncil reviewers argued that RAND'sconclusions were \"based on problematicestimates of treatment effectivenessdrawn from uncontrolled observationalstudies\" (National Research Council,2001, p. 225), and that the assumptionsand economic modeling procedures usedby RAND researchers were flawed inother ways and therefore not useful forpolicymaking (Manski, Pepper, andThomas, 1999). Caulkins, Chiesa, andEveringham (2000) offered extensiveresponse to the latter set of criticisms,showing that modifying the model to in-corporate the reviewers' suggestedchanges did not in fact materially alterthe conclusions. As for the concern thatRAND's characterization of treatment wasoverly optimistic, the evidence is ambigu-ous. Indeed, some have criticized theirmodel for being overly pessimistic (Caul-kins, Chiesa, and Everingham, 2000).Clearly, future research in this area isneeded to clarify and tighten assumptions,improve methodologies, and incorporatemore carefully controlled data from drugtreatment outcome studies (for more com-prehensive information on the economicsof drug treatment services, see Cart-wright, 2001). Inmate participation in treatment. Al- though billions of dollars are spent eachyear to support drug abuse treatment, thelarge majority of offenders do not receivedrug treatment services of any kind.ONDCP spent approximately 20 percentof its $18.4 billion budget on drug treat-ment in fiscal year 2000 (ONDCP , 2000).More than half of such Federal fundingwas allocated to support State blockgrants. In addition to these amounts,State, county, and local governments (aswell as private funding sources) con-tributed significant funds to drug treat-ment efforts (U.S. General Accounting Although billions of dollars arespent each yearto support drugabuse any kind.128SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Office, 1998). However, it is unclear what proportion of the total available funds havebeen targeted toward treatment of drug-using offenders. Regarding offender treat-ment services, 83 percent of State and 73percent of Federal prisoners reported pastdrug use in 1997, with 57 percent of Stateand 45 percent of Federal prisoners re-porting use in the month prior to theiroffense (Mumola, 1999). However, report-ed participation in drug treatment inFederal and State prisons is minimal inmost cases. The 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities(Mumola, 1999) reported decreases in thepercentage of both State and Federal in-mates undergoing drug treatment. It isimportant to note that these trends are dif-ficult to interpret without knowing moreabout the increases in actual drug treat-ment capacity within State and Federalsystems relative to inmate populationincreases. Local jails have fared about the same as Federal and State facilities. According toBJS's 1998 Annual Survey of Jails (Wilson, 2000), 66 percent of jail inmates wereactively involved with drugs prior to theircurrent incarceration, and 74 percent re-ported past drug involvement. Almostthree-quarters of local jails (90 percent inlarger jurisdictions) state that they providesubstance abuse treatment or programsfor their inmates. However, 64 percent ofthat total are self-help programs; only 12percent of jail jurisdictions (mostly largejurisdictions) provided detoxification, coun-seling, and education in addition to self-help programs. There is a substantialdifference between what jails say theyprovide and what inmates report. The per-centage of inmates who actually reportedthat they participated in substance abusetreatment or programs since their admis-sion to jail was estimated at 10 percent(19 percent for those who had used drugsat the time of the offense). Despite theselow rates of participation in treatment, abroad range of studies continues to showthat drug treatment for offenders is effective. Effectiveness of drug treatment for offenders . Drug treatment for offenders is being taken seriously by even thestrongest advocates of incarceration fordrug possession and use. Flooded courtdockets, overcrowded prisons, and highrecidivism rates of drug-using offendershave convinced even those most skepticalof treatment that it is impossible to incar-cerate all the illegal drug users in theNation. Scientific research on the brain isoffering clues into the nature of drugdependence, leading most to agree withthe conclusions of NIDA: \"Prolonged useof these drugs eventually changes thebrain in fundamental and long-lastingways, explaining why people cannot justquit on their own, why treatment is essen-tial\" (Leshner, 2001). This view has alsobeen adopted by ONDCP , which statesthat \"chronic, hardcore drug use is a and anyone suffering from a diseaseneeds treatment\" (ONDCP , 2001, p. 1).Recognizing both the public safety bene-fits from breaking the cycle of drug useand crime as well as the potential safetyrisks of allowing drug-addicted criminalson the streets (Taxman, 2000), ONDCP'sNational Drug Control Strategy advocatesa two-pronged approach to the problem:punish criminals for their behaviors whilemandating sanctions-based drug treat-ment. However, questions remain as towhich treatment programs are effective,and for which drug users. Three major cautions must be noted when reviewing the mostly quasi-experimentaldrug treatment outcome studies. First,many studies rely on client self-reports,which are least valid for higher penaltydrugs, recent use, and those involved withthe criminal justice system (for further lim-itations on the validity of self-report druguse, see Hser, 1997). A second and relat-ed problem is selection bias. Both theselection of those who elect to enter 129TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY treatment (and are thus perhaps viewed as being more motivated to remain intreatment) and program terminations mayleave only those participants who aremost ready and capable of succeedingwhen released into the community. Such\"weeding out\" of participants who maybe more likely to fail than succeed couldlead researchers to incorrectly concludegreater treatment effects than would beseen through more careful attention totreatment design with randomized assign-ment to treatment groups (U.S. GeneralAccounting Office, 1998; Pelissier et al.,2000). Third, making a generalizationbased on the issues just noted, a recentNational Research Council report (2001)notes that very few randomized controlledresearch studies have been conductedon drug treatment outcomes, therebycasting some doubt on the cause of someoutcomes. Despite these challenges, however, some researchers are paying more attention toimproving the scientific rigor of these eval-uations to achieve the greatest accuracypossible. The National Research Councilreport summarized five recent treatmentevaluation studies that were, in the com-mittee's view, \"the methodological stateof the art in drug treatment research\"(2001, p. 227). The studies, none of whichincluded drug-using offenders, were notedfor their random treatment assignment,treatment fidelity, measurement reliabilityand validity, and continuous rather thandichotomous outcome measurements.The committee also discussed in somedetail the ways in which drug treatmentoutcome studies could be strengthenedthrough improved methodological and sta-tistical rigor. In a separate review (in thesame volume) of drug treatment in thecriminal justice system, Covington (2001)suggested guidelines for evaluating crimi-nal justice system-based drug treatment.These guidelines included controlling forself-selection bias; controlling for stake inconformity such as employment or mar- riage (i.e., if an individual is employed, heor she has a greater incentive to adhere totreatment in order to not get fired; or, ifmarried, an individual may have a greaterincentive to do well to prevent a spousefrom leaving); use of credible outcomemeasures; identifying appropriate followupperiods; linking retention to outcomes;and identifying treatment componentsthat promote recovery. Treatment settings. Overall, the size and consistency of treatment effects acrossmany reasonably good studies tend tolend credibility to consistent claims oftreatment effectiveness. The followingsection reviews a sample of recent out-come evaluations for offenders in a varietyof treatment settings, moving from morerestrictive to less restrictive settings. Out-come measures that are typically used togauge drug treatment effectiveness insuch studies include reduced frequencyor amount of drug used; relapse time orlength of abstinence period; crime, arrest,and conviction rates; and maintenance ofparole or probation status. Prison-based therapeutic communities. Therapeutic communities (TCs) are gener-ally intensive, long-term, self-help-based,highly structured residential treatment programs for chronic, hardcore drugusers. Although still rooted in a self-helpapproach, prison-based TCs are more likely than community-based TCs to haveprofessionally trained staff, with inmatesbeing given a reasonable level of powerand rewards without too much programcontrol (Wexler, 1995; see also ONDCP ,1996). Three TC approaches will be re-viewed below. Wexler and colleagues have reported on the effectiveness of the Stay 'N Out TCprogram used by the Department ofCorrections in New York State (Wexler,Falkin, and Lipton, 1990; Wexler et al.,1992). TC inmates were compared with Overall, size and effectsacross manyreasonably goodstudies 03 inmates assigned to milieu therapy, coun- seling, or a no-treatment group (composedof those who volunteered for TC treat-ment but were placed on a waiting list).Comparing male post-treatment arrestrates, the groups receiving counseling andno treatment were equally likely to bearrested (40 and 41 percent, respectively),while those receiving milieu therapy hadan arrest rate of 35 percent, and thosereceiving TC group treatment had anarrest rate of 27 percent. One significantflaw in this finding is the researchers' fail-ure to account for other background vari-ables, causing some to question thestrength of the treatment effect (Pelissieret al., 2000). However, time-in-treatmenteffects were also noted that showed astrong positive relationship between thenumber of months in the TC programand the percentage of inmates who weresuccessfully discharged from parole.Specifically, the percentage of male TCinmates who had successful parole dis-charges grew from 49 percent for those intreatment for less than 3 months to 58percent for those in treatment for 3 to 6months. Positive rates further increased to62 percent when inmates participated in aTC from 6 to 9 months and to 77 percentfor those in a TC from 9 to 12 months.Those who eventually failed on parolewere still able to stay drug and crime freefor significantly longer periods than thecomparison groups. Field (1985, 1989) conducted two evalua- tions of the Cornerstone Program, a TC foralcohol- and drug-dependent inmates inOregon's correctional system that alsorequired at least 6 months of followuptreatment in the community. Participantshad to be granted minimum security sta-tus by the prison superintendent. Treat-ment clients had, on average, about 12prior arrests, 6 prior convictions, and 6years of adult incarceration. In the first 3-year followup study (1985), programgraduates were found to have had a 29-percent reincarceration rate compared with 74 percent for program dropouts.Similarly, although 54 percent of programgraduates were not convicted of anycrime (including minor offenses), only 25percent of the comparison group and 15percent of program dropouts were notconvicted of a crime. Again, these findingsshould be viewed with some cautiongiven that participants who remained intreatment were acknowledged to havebeen more highly motivated to succeedthan program dropouts. It is also impossi-ble to separate out the effects of the 6months of community followup treatment(Pelissier et al., 2000). The second study(Field, 1989) found that approximately 75percent of program completers were notreincarcerated, compared with 37 percentin the comparison group. In contrast, only15 percent of participants who droppedout of treatment after less than 2 monthsin the program were not reincarceratedduring the 3-year followup. A major concern of this and similar studies is the high dropout rates from voluntarydrug treatment programs. For example,Field (1992) highlighted that, of 220 volun-teer inmates who had been admitted toCornerstone over a 2-year period, 65 with-drew after spending 1 to 2 days in the program, 58 withdrew after spendingbetween 2 to 6 months in the program,43 withdrew after spending at least 6months in the program, and 43 graduated.Simpson and colleagues (1997) have esti-mated that, on average, only 50 percent ofall addicts who voluntarily enter treatmentactually complete the recommended treat-ment course. High dropout rates tend toconfuse conclusions about treatment out-comes because those who remain intreatment could be arguably more motivat-ed to remain drug and crime free thanthose who drop out. As has been notedearlier, however, offenders who are givengraduated sanctions as a form of coercedtreatment generally stay in treatment131TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY longer, complete treatment programs, and report less drug use while in treatmentprograms than those in voluntary treat-ment (Simpson et al., 1997; Hubbard etal., 1989). The Key-Crest program is a corrections- based, three-stage treatment model pro-gram that operates within Delaware'scorrectional system. The first stage, theKey, is modeled on the Stay 'N Out pro-gram and includes a 12-month intensiveresidential TC that is based in the institu-tion but segregated from the rest of theinmates. The second stage, the CrestOutreach Center, is a transitional TC inwhich inmates work during the day andreturn to a community-based, more tradi-tional TC environment during their non-working hours. In the third or aftercarestage, clients have completed work re-lease and are now on parole or othersupervision. Intervention at this stage usu-ally involves group or individual counselingas well as the opportunity to return to thework-release TC for booster sessions.While earlier studies thisTC treatment continuum, many of the pos-itive improvements between the secondand third stage clients appeared to disap-pear in 3-year followup studies (Martinet al., 1999). However, when less conser-vative analytical models were applied (thenew analysis examined Crest dropouts,Crest completers, and Crest completerswith aftercare), significant findingsemerged. When compared with the com-parison group, Crest dropouts were morethan three times as likely to be drug free(as measured by initial self-reports andsubsequent urinalysis); Crest completerswere more than five times as likely to bedrug free; and Crest completers with after-care were seven times more likely to bedrug free. Rearrests on a new chargeshowed a similar pattern, with Crest drop-outs having the same rate of rearrests asthe comparison group. However, those who completed Crest did much better,and those who completed Crest plusaftercare were the least likely to have anew arrest. Specifically, less than one-thirdof clients with aftercare had a new arrest,compared with more than two-thirds ofthe comparison group (Martin et al., 1999). Long-term residential treatment. Prison- based long-term residential treatment isgenerally considered to last between 6 to12 months. Participants often live togetherin units separated from the regular inmatepopulation. These units are specificallydesigned to focus on drug treatment. Thedegree of structure can vary, but generallya professional drug treatment staff coordi-nates all programs and services. Com-pared with TCs, prison-based residentialtreatment is generally more likely toinclude professional therapeutic interven-tions using standard treatment approach-es. For example, the Bureau of Prisonsincludes programming on criminal life-style confrontation, cognitive and interper-sonal skill building, and relapse prevention(Pelissier et al., 2000). Inmate-led self-helpapproaches are not present in such facili-ties. The following discussion will presentan evaluation of long-term residential treat-ment, as well as one specific evaluationproject. From 1990 to 1993, the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the Drug AbuseTreatment Outcome Study (DATOS), which included 96 programs in 11 cities.Positive outcomes were reported in multi-ple treatment modalities, including long-term residential treatment (Simpson et al.,1997). DATOS found that individuals inlong-term residential treatment reducedweekly or more frequent use of cocainefrom 66 percent in the year prior to treat-ment to 22 percent in the year followingtreatment (see exhibit 1). This same groupreported a 26-percent drop (from 41 per-cent down to 16 percent) in predatory ille-gal activity during that same time period Prison-based and Brown, 1997). Similar- ly dramatic reductions in self-reportedcocaine use were also found for short-term residential treatment. Using one of the most methodologically rigorous research designs to date, theFederal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) recentlyconducted a 3-year, 20-site evaluation ofits residential drug treatment programs(Pelissier et al., 2000). During the three-phase Treating Inmates' Addiction toDrugs (TRIAD) Drug Treatment EvaluationProject, more than 1,000 inmates first voluntarily participated in a 9- or 12-monthresidential treatment program. Treatmentgroup results were compared with a truecomparison group as well as a controlgroup, neither of whom received any drugtreatment services. A second phase re-quired inmates to continue drug abusebooster sessions (including relapse pre-vention and review of treatment tech-niques) for 1 year following their return tothe general community. During the finalphase, inmates were required to partici- pate in community transitional services inwhich they received individual, group,and/or family counseling from community-based drug treatment providers. Three-year followup findings indicated that menand women who were motivated tochange were more likely to enter andcomplete treatment. Findings on bothrecidivism and post-treatment drug usewere significant for men but not forwomen. 4Specifically, men who entered and completed in-prison residential treat-ment were 16 percent less likely to recidi-vate when compared with untreatedinmates at 3-year postrelease followup.In addition, participants who entered andcompleted treatment were 15 percentless likely to use drugs than untreatedinmates within 3 years after release.These findings are particularly significantbecause the selection process actuallyattracted riskier offenders into the treat-ment programs. In addition, this studycarefully addressed the issue of selectionbias by comparing results using two differ-ent bias correction methods. Day reporting centers. As noted previous- ly, many offenders are serving time be-cause of nonviolent drug convictions.Todeal with prison overcrowding and the prohibitive costs associated with incarceration-based treatment programs,some correctional facilities have devel-oped day reporting centers (DRCs). DRCsare a form of intermediate sanction inwhich offenders attend highly structured,nonresidential programs where a varietyof services and supervision are provided.First introduced in the United States in1986, DRCs can be operated by a widerange of public, government, and privateagencies, such as residential communitycorrections centers, work release pro-grams, jails, TASCs, and treatment pro-grams (Parent, 1990; McBride andVanderWaal, 1997). Services such as drug treatment and education, GED courses,English as a Second Language and life Exhibit 1.

The concepthas been adapted in a number of ways,including: Providing enhanced treatment andsupervision to probationers or sen-tenced offenders not on probation. Monitoring inmates on early releasefrom jail or prison. Monitoring arrested persons prior totrial. As a halfway-out step for inmates whohave shown progress in community-based corrections or work release centers. As a halfway-in step for offenders whohave violated their probation or parole(Curtin, 1990, as cited in Diggs andPieper, 1994). These programs are probably most appro- priate for nonviolent offenders whose be-haviors have not been improved throughprobation and/or who need greater struc-ture and treatment services than could beprovided in a less restrictive setting. Whileattending the center, participants are oftenrequired to submit to random drug testingand participate in counseling, education,and vocational placement assistance.Graduated sanctions are applied when par-ticipants are found to have violated theterms of their sentence. Relatively few studies have been conduct- ed to assess predictors of program com-pletion or termination in DRCs. Studieswhich have been conducted are difficultto compare due to the wide variability ofsettings, services, eligibility criteria, moni- toring procedures, levels of supervision,and termination policies (Diggs and Pieper,1994). While some studies have showninitial evidence of cost savings (Craddock,2000) and lower rearrest rates (Diggs andPieper, 1994; McBride and VanderWaal,1997), evidence of program effectivenesswas not as great in programs that lasted12 months or longer 5(Marciniak, 1999). Marciniak (2000) found high rates of pro-gram termination for drug andrearrests. Several authors (Blomberg since many offenderswho would otherwise be sentenced toprobation are placed in DRCs where theyare watched more closely and are there-fore more likely to be rearrested. Giventhe relatively recent emergence of thisform of intermediate sanctioning, futurestudies should focus on success indica-tors such as program completion, druguse, rearrests, and cost-effectiveness, par-ticularly in longer term programs. Programsuccess indicators should be based oncomparisons with offenders who wouldhave been incarcerated as opposed tothose traditionally found in probation toavoid a net-widening bias (Diggs andPieper, 1994). Outpatient and intensive outpatient treat- ment. Taxman (1998) notes that the loca- tion of drug treatment does not alwaysrelate to the intensity of services providedto the client. Instead, the number of serv-ice hours is often a better indicator. Assuch, community-based outpatient andintensive outpatient treatment servicesare often used as a transition from TCsand other more intensive corrections-based services. Such services are par-ticularly important to drug courts, whoprimarily use treatment alternatives withinthe community. The setting is generallyless important than the quality and quanti-ty of services provided to clients, although134SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 the organization providing the services must be supportive of delivering interven-tions to correctional populations (Pogrebin,1978). The DATOS study introduced in theprevious section (regarding long-term resi-dential treatment) also included positiveoutcomes for outpatient drug-free treat-ment: self-reported cocaine use droppedfrom 42 percent before treatment to 18percent at 1-year followup (see exhibit 1). Treatment intervention approaches. The previous section reviewed outcomestudies on a variety of drug treatment set-tings, based on a range of restrictiveness.Each of these settings often includes suchintervention approaches as life-skills train-ing, group and individual counseling, re-lapse prevention training, and educationaland vocational skills training. In addition, avariety of theoretical models influence thecontent and approach to such interven-tions. It is beyond the scope of this paperto review these approaches and theories.As mentioned earlier, however, NIDA hasconducted a number of large-scale evaluations inter-ventions (e.g. DARP , TOPS, DATOS), andreaders are referred to those studies toreview intervention effectiveness. In addi-tion, NIDA is currently conducting con-trolled, multisite tests of emergingscience-based drug abuse treatmentssuch as the use of buprenorphine/nalox-one treatments for detoxifying opiate-dependent patients and incorporatingmotivational enhancement therapy intostandard treatments (Mathias, 2001).Motivational enhancements offer absti-nent clients a chance to win small prizessuch as candy bars, Walkmans, or gift certificates to local restaurants by testingnegative for various illicit drugs. As thenumber of abstinent weeks increases,so do the number and value of the incen-tives. It is anticipated that such evalua-tions will provide preliminary evidence ofeffectiveness and efficacy so that knowl-edge about treatment effectiveness canbe improved.Based on a comprehensive review of clini- cal and health services research on drugabuse, ONDCP (1996) made the followingrecommendations regarding critical ele-ments for successful treatment in any set-ting (e.g. prison based, residential, oroutpatient): Complete and ongoing assessment ofthe client. A comprehensive range of services,including pharmacological treatment (ifnecessary), counseling (either individualor group, in either structured or unstruc-tured settings), and HIV-risk reductioneducation. A continuum of treatment interventions. Case management and monitoring toengage clients in services of appropriateintensity. Provision and integration of continuingsocial supports. NIDA came to many similar conclusions in their research-based guide, Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment (NIDA, 1999). This guide also reviews scientifical-ly based approaches to drug treatmentand makes recommendations. A full listingof the NIDA recommendations is found inappendix C. In addition to the recommendations and principles listed by ONDCP and NIDA, it isimportant to recognize the importance ofmatching the drug-using offender withthe appropriate treatment. This simpleconcept is, at times, especially difficult toemploy in jurisdictions that may lack ade-quate resources to provide a full continu-um of services. Essentially, treatmentmatching recognizes that no single treat-ment is universally applicable. Levels ofrestriction and supervision, treatmentmodalities, and psychopharmacologicaltreatment options (such as methadone)must be assessed on a case-by-case It is important to recognize the importance of matching the drug-using offender with the appropriate treatment.135TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY basis. The ramifications of this issue include the need for training system per-sonnel on treatment continuum issues,realistic expectations by both treatmentand criminal justice systems regarding thepotential impacts of available services, andthe potential need to educate the commu-nity on what can be expected from avail-able resources. Gender differences in treatment. Pelissier and her colleagues (2000) com-pleted a comprehensive review of litera-ture on gender differences amongsubstance abusers (for supporting litera-ture documentation of this summary para-graph, see Pelissier et al., 2000). Althoughmuch of the current increase in the num-ber of incarcerated women is linked tosubstance abuse (Kassebaum, 1999),few studies have examined on nonoffending sub-stance abusers have different social, psychological, andeconomic circumstances; different initia-tion and drug use patterns; and differentcriminal histories than men. Most discus-sions of treatment approaches for womeninclude a strong focus on ancillary servicessuch as health care, child care, and femaletreatment staff. Therapeutic recommen-dations include a focus on relationshipissues, support, skill building, and identifi-cation of strengths as opposed to the con-frontation strategies that are common formen (for a summary of treatment effec-tiveness studies for men and women, seeLandry, 1997). Despite these differences,however, few treatment programs focusheavily on women's issues, particularly incorrectional facilities. Not surprisingly, fewstudies have looked at outcomes of treat-ment programs designed specifically forwomen (Landry, 1997), in part due to therelatively small numbers of female drugtreatment participants (Moras, 1998).Aftercare Aftercare (or continuing care) is definedas \"a set of supportive and therapeuticactivities designed to prevent relapse andmaintain behavioral changes achieved inprevious treatment stages\" (Fortney et al.,1998, as cited in Inciardi et al., 2001). Theaftercare phase of the treatment continu-um is often neglected for drug-usingoffenders. As noted previously, most drug-using offenders have high relapse ratesand therefore require extended periods oftreatment exposure and ongoing supportto achieve and maintain sobriety. In addi-tion, most treatment graduates are illequipped to integrate back into their oldneighborhoods (Berman and Anderson,1999). For these reasons, providing after-care as a followup to more restrictivetreatment may improve treatment effec-tiveness. Cross-systems case manage-ment and collaboration are critical at thisphase in the treatment process to main-tain an integrated continuum of care forclients as they transition back into thecommunity. Martin et al. (1999) recommend that treat- ment interventions at this stage includecontinued monitoring by previously in-volved treatment counselors (such as TCcounselors). Interventions at this stagecould include regular outpatient counsel-ing, support groups such as AlcoholicsAnonymous, group therapy, and familytherapy sessions. In addition, Tauber(1994) calls for educational opportunities,job training and placement, and health andhousing assistance. Several studies (Lash, 1998; McKay et al., 1998; Rychtarik et al., 1992) with noncor-rectional populations have suggested thatimproved treatment outcomes can resultfrom aftercare (most of these studies arecorrelational in nature). In such settings, itis possible that selection bias is present,136SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 since motivated clients may make better use of aftercare services (Inciardi et al.,2001). However, recent studies with corrections-based treatment followed byaftercare have also shown preliminary indi-cations of success (DeLeon et al., 2000;Wexler et al., 1999). Offenders in the California-based Amity Right Projectreceived voluntary completers after 12,24, and 36 months. Although recidivismrates increased for all groups as timeincreased, those who completed both thetreatment and aftercare phases had thelowest rearrest rates. Inciardi and col-leagues (2001; conducted a similar aftercare studywith Key-Crest participants. Voluntaryclients were randomly assigned and pur-posively sampled across four groups: a no-treatment comparison group, treat-ment dropouts, treatment graduates, andtreatment graduates with aftercare. Re-searchers conducted followup interviewsat 18 and 42 months and collected infor-mation on drug use (interview and urinescreen) and rearrest rates (interview compared with official prison records).Eighteen-month followups indicated thattreatment dropouts and graduates weretwice as likely than the comparison groupto be drug free, and treatment graduateswith aftercare were three times more like-ly to be drug free. Preliminary data fromthe 42-month followup were even moreimpressive. Although only 25 percent ofthe comparison group were arrest free,more than half of the graduates with after-care remained arrest free. Similarly, 25percent of comparison cases remaineddrug free, compared with 36 percent ofthe treatment-with-aftercare group. Suchstudies could be further strengthenedwith larger sample sizes, evaluating suit-ability of clients for treatment, more carefulcontrol of self-selection bias, and careful analysis of other intervening variables. Summary Current research suggests that successfulprogrammatic efforts to intervene in thedrugs-crime relationship are based on acontinuum of integrated services stretch-ing from assessment through aftercare.Although research has evaluated the various components that might be mostbeneficial for inclusion in a successfully in-tegrated system, we know of no studiesthat have attempted to measure the suc-cess or lack of impact of such integratedapproaches. Suggestions for future research In any field of scientific inquiry, one of the easiest things to do is to call for moreresearch. Not surprisingly, that is exactlythe most appropriate thing to do withregard to the drugs-crime relationship.New conceptual and mathematical modelshave emerged recently in the social sci-ences that will allow a fresh perspectiveon many of the questions that have beenaddressed in the past and provide a newbaseline for the 21st century. Human cul-tures change, some fairly rapidly, and evena brief review of the past 25 years in theUnited States with regard to drugs andcrime would indicate that ours has changeddramatically. In the area of the drugs-crimerelationship, one illustration of this changeis the apparent reduction in the violenceassociated with cocaine/crack distribution.Such changes require fresh examinationsof previously collected data and more rig-orous evaluations of current programs andpolicies. Although there are certainly manyareas of potential further inquiry, the fol-lowing areas are suggested:137TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Using secondary data analyses to provide a new empirical baseline for understanding thedrugs-crime relationship The Federal Government, other agencies, and universities have collected enormousamounts of data that are directly relevantto many key drugs-crime questions. Thesedata include the National Household Sur-vey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), the Monitor-ing the Future (MTF) study, the ArresteeDrug Abuse Monitoring Program, andthe Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS).These data could be used to provide anew baseline of knowledge about certainstatistical elements of the drugs-crimerelationship across the lifespan and inmany different segments of the popula-tion. In addition, these data could be usedto demythologize many policy and popularconclusions about the drugs-crime rela-tionship. For example, data from some ofthese systems call into question somebeliefs about the cocaine-violence connec-tion as well as suggest that the criminaljustice system may primarily direct mari-juana users to the treatment system tothe exclusion of other drug users. Further studying the nature and complexity of the drugs-crimerelationship using the latestinterdisciplinary conceptualand analytical models Many of the interventions that have been applied to breaking the drugs-crime cyclehave involved a fairly narrow focus ondrug treatment and have not sufficientlyrecognized the complex origins of bothbehaviors. Further, there is increasing evidence of a need to include multilevelvariables in order to understand howcrime and drugs are connected. This wasnot possible previously due to the statisti-cal precision needed. In addition, the 2000Census and geocoding provide an oppor-tunity to add another data dimension todrugs-crime analyses. For example, if wecould obtain parallel geocoding data for the ADAM dataset, the number of ques-tions that could be addressed about thedrugs-crime relationship would expandgeometrically. We need to integrateadvances in analytical models with ad-vances in neurobiology, personality, familysystems, and peer influence studies aswell as include broader contextual vari-ables (including ecosystems theory, socialcapital, economic opportunity, drug pricesand market variables, drug laws/policy,and geographical data). Consider using computer simu- lation modeling to examinekey research questions Some of the etiological ideas that re- searchers are examining may be applica-ble to computer modeling in the future.For example, it might be useful, in a simu-lated model, to manipulate reductions insupply, increases in price, changes in policy (such as treatment on demand and/or marijuana decriminalization/medicaliza-tion) to examine how such issues wouldaffect drug use, crime, and their interrela-tionship. Although the data entered in asimulation would be based on the typesof research previously noted, and the pit-falls and complexities of undertaking thisapproach have not been thought out, itmay be time for the drugs-crime field tobegin considering the use of computersimulation technology to address the criti-cal issues facing many communities. Evaluating State changes in drug policy to examine differentattempts to address the drugs-crime relationship at a macrobut yet subnational level Throughout this document, it has been noted that while there has been relativelylittle modification of drug law and policiesat the national level, there has been con-siderable legislative action in many States138SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 and communities. Model State drug laws have been proposed. Many States aremoving towards allowing medical marijua-na, and many States have decriminalizedmarijuana possession (or at least removedincarceration penalties for the first marijua-na possession conviction). Other Statesare changing club-drug laws to increasescheduling and penalties. In addition,there are significant differences betweenStates (and communities) regarding treat-ment availability and budgets. For manyyears, there have been calls for interna-tional research comparing the impact ofdifferent national drug policies. However,given significant differences betweennational cultures, these comparisons aredifficult. Variance in State law and policyprovides a more readily available opportu-nity to examine variance between entities(the 50 States) with differing laws and poli-cies. These changes suggest a number ofpossible research areas. For example,comparing differences in marijuana use(or drug use in general), perceptions ofrisk, and peer disapproval in States thathave medical marijuana and/or marijuanadecriminalization with States with high-deterrence prohibition policies could pro-vide an excellent foundation for evaluatingchanging drugs-crime policies. Evaluating attempted inter- ventions in the drugs-crimecycle for net widening As noted, the increasing availability of drug courts and other mandatory treat-ment programs may encourage law enforcement to intervene earlier and moreformally in the lives of individual drugusers. This change in strategy and tacticscould begin a formal criminal justice label-ing process that may exacerbate, ratherthan ameliorate, the relationship betweendrug use and crime. It may also result inchanging definitions of law violation andincrease the number of those arrestedand incarcerated due to new placementcriteria and options. It is critical that we evaluate such changes early so that les-sons learned from them may be usedstrategically to change later interventions. Considering the need to establish research field stationsin high-risk communities One idea that has been discussed episo- dically in the drug field for the past twodecades involves the use of a researchfield station approach. Although therehave been some attempts to undertakesuch an endeavor, these efforts generallyhave been limited in time and/or place.Existing data (combined with geocoding)could be used to identify communitieswith high rates of drug use and crime.Theoretically based multivariate researchprojects could then be conducted in thesetargeted communities from a qualitative,on-the-ground perspective. Such anapproach might permit researchers tounderstand some of the changes in violence associated with crack distribu-tion that seem to have occurred inrecent years. Examining the relationship between particular enforcementstrategies and drug markets Recent modifications to the ADAM study (including asking subjects about access todrugs and conditions that they perceive asaffecting access) provide the possibility ofempirically modeling the effects of specif-ic enforcement strategies on specific drugmarkets (cocaine, crack, and heroin) anddrug prices. In particular, researchers maybe able to evaluate a particular enforce-ment strategy's impact on drug marketlocation (moving it indoors or to moreurban settings), the number of dealers typ-ically used, the amount of time searchingfor drugs, or the price of that drug (fromSTRIDE [System to Retrieve Informationfrom Drug Evidence] or other sources) and139TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY more. This could provide researchers with very important information about how drugmarkets operate in local areas in responseto enforcement strategies. Comprehensively evaluating current programs designedto intervene in the drugs-crime cycle Many programs exist that attempt to in- tervene in the drugs-crime cycle from thejuvenile to adult level. Although there havebeen significant attempts to evaluatethese programs, most of these effortshave been descriptive or have used fairlysimple analytical designs (often quasi-experimental). What is needed are large-scale, carefully controlled studies thatfocus on long-term program outcomesusing multiple indicators of success andthat identify program elements related tooutcomes. These evaluations should focuson what the literature might call best-caseprogram models that generally involvecomprehensive assessment, needed serv-ice provision based on that assessment,case management, graduated sanctions,and aftercare. Most outcome studiesexamine such factors as rearrest rates ordrug relapses. Additional successful out-come measures might include such non-crime-related outcomes as payment ofchild support, family formation and stabili-ty, employment stability, and residentialstability. In addition, it is important toexamine how these programs vary in theirimpact by gender, ethnicity, and age aswell as provision context (prison to com-munity). Finally, it is crucial to examineprogram costs relative to the cost of incar-ceration and the cost of no intervention.Although specific recommendations forfurther research were included at the endof each program intervention section inthis chapter, the following research ques-tions are of high priority: Which drug testing methods offer thebest combination of accuracy, privacy,and feasibility? How does drug moni- toring alone compare with more com-prehensive systems and treatmentinterventions in terms of outcomessuch as drug use and recidivism? What assessment protocols can mostaccurately be used to place offenders inthe safest, least restrictive, and mosteffective treatment settings? What level and intensity of drug treat-ment services are most appropriate forwhich offender types and settings? What forms and mixtures of thereviewed programmatic interventions(e.g. graduated sanctions, supervision/monitoring, various drug treatment services and settings, aftercare, etc.)predict program completion or termina-tion (or other specific outcomes) withwhich populations and under which conditions? Using interdisciplinary teams to conduct research on thedrugs-crime relationship A review of the literature shows that indi- viduals from a variety of disciplines haveexamined the drugs-crime relationship.Each discipline has approached the rela-tionship from its particular perspective,and each discipline likely has an importantand unique perspective on understandingthe relationship. Some of the critical re-views of conceptualization, methodology,and conclusions in drugs-crime researchare often based on particular disciplinaryperspectives. To broaden the perspectivesof these disciplines, the types of researchissues/questions that have been proposedrequire the efforts of an interdisciplinaryteam. If there is to be clear definition,development, and operationalization oftreatment program elements, treatmentproviders must provide input. Researcherstrained in experimental or quasi-experimentaldesign are crucial in developing and carry-ing out the needed scientific designs.140SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Social scientists (survey researchers, geographers, and ethnographers) areneeded if issues of gender, ethnicity, andother sociocultural and spatial characteris-tics are to be included in the design anddata interpretation. Given today's strongsocial concern relative to cost-benefit out-comes, it is crucial to include economistson research teams. Drugs-crime researchhas clearly reached the stage where inter-disciplinary research teams are required. Establishing interagency cooperation in funding research An examination of the various governmen- tal reports and our conversations with col-leagues about this project suggest thatmany different agencies focus on andissue reports about the drugs-crime rela-tionship. It appears that the authors ofmany of these reports are not aware ofthe excellent research funded by otheragencies. Given the limited resources inany given funding agency and the differentresearch traditions in various agencies,integrated research will require significantinteragency cooperation. Such cooperationcould make sufficient resources availableto address the types of complex researchneeded in drugs-crime analysis. Notes 1. For economists, the term \"open market\" has a very precise meaning. In this paper, however, we usethe term in a general sense to indicate low levels ofgovernment regulation. 2. The companion papers to this work discuss the psychopharmacological and economic componentsof the drugs-crime relationship. 3. The focus will be primarily on adult intervention strategies since other recent reports have completeda comprehensive literature review and offered pro-gram guidelines focusing specifically on juveniles(McBride et al., 1999). 4. Although Pelissier and her colleagues did not find a significant treatment effect on postrelease druguse and crime for women, further analyses indicatedno significant differences between the coefficient for men and women. This lack of significance forwomen is likely a reflection of the smaller samplesize for this population (Pelissier, 2001; personalcommunication). 5. The issue of length of time in treatment as indica- tive of stronger gains in treatment was raised previ-ously in this paper. This issue is debated in the field.Marciniak (1999) argues that longer may be betteronly up through 9 to 12 months; treatment deteriora-tion may then begin. Other researchers argue thatthis outcome needs more study.

Critical elements for collaborativesuccess As noted in the main body of this paper, reviews of collaborative efforts have iden-tified several critical elements for suc-cess. 1These elements are specified and discussed below. Leadership There is a need for one or more key agen-cies to start the collaborative process,preferably bringing experienced leadershipand/or supervision to the table. This bodymust be willing to take the responsibilityto identify problems and help other mem-bers to envision solutions, maintain thesupport and involvement of other mem-bers, and work toward helping build anatmosphere of equality. Because in manycommunities the relationship between thetreatment and criminal justice systems isoften strained, there is a need to recog-nize differing primary responsibilities.Within the context of the courts, the jus-tice system has the primary role in moni-toring offenders along the graduatedsanctions continuum; treatment systemshave the primary role in providing appropri-ate and effective treatment services.Some evidence indicates that the opti-mum structure might place in the positionof managing partner a \"neutral\" groupthat does not provide direct services (suchas TASC) to ensure unbiased serviceorganization referrals, case management,and collaborative organization. No matterwho holds the leadership role, this individual/agency/group must seek consciously toactively involve all stakeholders from thebeginning of design and implementationof the proposed program(s) or initiative(s).Membership As noted previously, membership shouldbe broad based, representing key agen-cies in the justice, law enforcement, andtreatment systems, and a broad range ofother community agencies. Goals Collaboratives should design specific goalsthat are clear, useful in the minds of partic-ipants, and achievable within specifiedtimeframes, including both short- and long-term goals, and with specified priorities.Successful collaborative groups havereported the existence of a strategic plan,including specific goals, an outline of pro-grams related to achieving those goals,evaluation methods, and regular publicprogress updates. A description of goaland program review and change was relat-ed to successful formation and structure. 2 Performance measures can be especiallyuseful for evaluation and thus the possibili-ty of obtaining continued funding. Team approach Collaborative efforts should seek a team approach for both decision planning andmaking. Leader agencies and/or organiza-tions should seek to maintain civility atmeetings and encourage flexibility. Decisionmaking should strive to use consensus-building methods. Effortstoward developing a team approach canbe assisted by making sure that each col-laborative member has a clearly definedrole and responsibilities; this can be aidedby early cross-training for collaborativemembers in the activities and responsibili-ties of the systems involved.160SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 Long-term view Members should recognize the complexity of collaborative goals and strategies, thatneither substance abuse nor crime has asingle solution. Realistic timelines for allefforts should be set. Research and evaluation Communities considering collaborativework should use available information onbest practices from the literature to guidecollaborative and program development. Inaddition, methods should be developed tosystematically collect objective data formonitoring and evaluating collaborativeprojects. Broad support The need to gain the support of the com-munity at large is essential for sustainabili-ty; active efforts to seek community inputcan gain support, and regular communica-tion about the goals and accomplishmentsof the partnership can help maintain thatsupport.Funding Long-term funding sources are crucial forthe viability of any coalition. External fund-ing sources may assist in providing incen-tives for development of successfulpartnerships 3such as through block grants or private foundations; in addition, com-munities may have the possibility of pool-ing funds from various agencies. However,efforts should be made to gain line-itemlegislative support for sustainability. Notes 1. Sigmon, J., Nugent, M., Goerdt, J., and Wallace, S.

Principles of drug addiction treatment* NIDA (1999) developed a list of scientifi- cally based recommendations for drugtreatment applicable for use across theentire system of service delivery. Theseprinciples are listed below: 1. No single treatment is appropriate for all individuals. 2. Treatment needs to be readily avail- able. 3. Effective treatment attends to multi- ple needs of the individual, not just hisor her drug use. 4. An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually andmodified as necessary to ensure thatthe plan meets the person's changingneeds. 5. Remaining in treatment for an ade- quate period of time is critical fortreatment effectiveness. 6. Counseling (individual and/or group) and other behavioral therapies are crit-ical components of effective treat-ment for addiction. 7. Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, espe-cially when combined with counselingand other behavioral therapies.8. Addicted or drug-abusing individuals with coexisting mental disordersshould have both disorders treated inan integrated way. 9. Medical detoxification is only the first stage of addiction treatment and byitself does little to change long-termdrug use. 10. Treatment does not need to be volun- tary to be effective. 11. Possible drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously. 12. Treatment programs should provide assessment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis Band C, tuberculosis, and other infec-tious diseases; and counseling to helppatients modify or change behaviorsthat place themselves or others at riskof infection. 13. Recovery from drug addiction can be along-term process and frequently re- quires multiple episodes of treatment.

She emphasized the need for a focused research agenda in which researchers tar-get specific questions and the most effec-tive methods. Researchers who work forFederal agencies need to know howscarce public funds will be spent to makethe most significant contributions in thisarea. All Federal, State, and local policy-makers and practitioners need to knowwhich policies and programs will be effec-tive in producing healthier and safer com-munities. Dr. Hillsman pointed out that NIJand NIDA have played essential and com-plementary roles in creating a solid scien-tific foundation for informed policies andpractices, and that with the help of forumparticipants, the two agencies will take upthe challenge posed by NRC. That chal-lenge is clearly echoed by policymakersand practitioners throughout the country,who are turning to the research communi-ty to contribute sound and relevant knowl-edge to the Nation's deliberations aboutdrugs and crime. Dr. Brownstein commented that the early and mid-1980s and through the early1990s had seen a great deal of interest indrugs and crime research. Then, in themid- and late 1990s, research seemed tohave focused on particular applied or prac-tical areas. He suggested there is a needfor more theoretical research and assimila-tion of the knowledge accumulated duringthe 20th century. He noted that the meth-ods and technology to make this possibleare now available.Opening remarks were made by Sally T. Hillsman, deputy director of the NationalInstitute of Justice (NIJ), and by forumorganizers Henry H. Brownstein and LyndaErinoff. 1Dr. Brownstein is director of the Drugs and Crime Research Division of NIJ.Dr. Erinoff is health science administratorat the Epidemiology Research Branch ofthe National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA). Roger Conner, director of Searchfor Common Ground in America, servedas facilitator of the forum discussions. Dr. Hillsman explained the origins of the collaboration between NIJ and NIDA. Inthe Omnibus Crime Control Act, as amend-ed in 1976, Congress asked the two agen-cies to explore the relationship betweendrug abuse and crime. That year NIJ andNIDA formed an interdisciplinary studyteam to review state-of-the-art knowledgeabout drugs and crime and to recommenda research agenda. NIJ published theagenda\u2014essentially a literature review\u2014in 1980, and the resulting research signifi-cantly advanced knowledge of the drugs-crime relationship. However, a great dealremains to be done. Dr. Hillsman notedthat in a 2001 report, 2the National Re- search Council (NRC) recommended thatNIJ and NIDA collaboratively undertakeresearch to meet the challenge of inform-ing public policy in the area of drug use. Dr. Hillsman noted the amount of research being done on drugs and crime makes thefield increasingly relevant to policy andpractice. She reflected that 25 years afterthe establishment of the initial NIJ andNIDA collaboration, the two agencies arewelcoming researchers to this forum andare anticipating that the forum will stimu-late another extraordinary era of interestand productivity in the field. Although a 163Appendix A: Summary of Proceedingsmatrix. The five rubrics were discussed in relation to the ecological concept of scale,which defines the level at which a subjectis studied from the microcosmic to themacrocosmic; that is, from genes at oneend to policies regulating nations or globalrelationships at the other. Scale is placedacross the horizontal axis. Each location onthe matrix where rubrics and scale inter-sect represents an area of past or currentresearch. Some units are filled, indicatingpast or current research; others are empty,indicating that little research has beendone. Evidence that crosses several cellsis termed broadband research; that is, research that cuts across domains and lev-els of scale. Discussion: Most helpful ideas Scale: A concept or a method? Dr. Anthony was asked to elaborate on theconcept of scale and how he interpretedit as applying to the biological and socialaspects of his work. Dr. Anthony responded with an example from the field of ecology. For ecologists,scale is the way one thinks about geocod- ing,in which trends are followed in a cen- sus tract or a metropolitan area. Using atechnique called two-dimensional andthree-dimensional wavelet analysis, theecologist allows the data to evoke thescale. When studying migratory birds,for example, ecologists infer the scalefrom the migration pattern of the birds.Ecologists tend to work upward and out-ward from the smaller level or scale ofthe organism toward the larger level orscale of the forest or the continent. InDr. Anthony's own approach, he workedinward, in the direction of methods micro-scopic in scale. This is in the spirit of theecological concept of scale, but is a twiston that concept, which has been used instudies of delinquency in relation to suchneighborhood characteristics as socialcohesion.Dr. Erinoff noted that Dr. Brownstein de- signed the framework for the forum andobtained the funding for it. He made cer-tain that the public health perspective wasincluded and took a hard look at previousresearch, including the tripartite model, which he and Dr. Paul Goldstein had de-veloped. Dr. Erinoff expressed hope thatall forum participants would emulateDr. Brownstein in critically reviewing cur-rent research. She noted that when NIDAstaff had to choose someone to write theforum paper that presented the publichealth perspective, they asked Dr. James Anthony to do so and to look \"outside the box.\" She appealed to the attendees todo the same: to move outside their ownframeworks. \"At the Intersection of Public Health and CriminalJustice Research on Drugsand Crime\" James C. Anthony with Valerie Forman The recent focus of Dr. Anthony's research has been on influences that takea user from initial use of a drug towarddrug dependence and on factors thataccount for that transition. In discussingsome of the directions in which the fieldof drugs and crime research should beheaded, he noted possible genetic vul-nerabilities to drug abuse, how those vul-nerabilities might influence drugs-crimerelationships, and cognitive science appli-cations of current interest to NIDA. Dr. Anthony noted his work in developing a conceptual framework for identifyingfuture research in this area. The frame-work consists of a matrix that presentsthe rubrics, or the main questions asked, in epidemiology or public health research:quantity, location, causes, mechanism,and prevention and control. These rubricsare placed along the vertical axis of the 164SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03Dr. Anthony responded that in the immedi- ate future, genetic polymorphisms3would be examined one at a time for effects ondrug dependence, but it will probably be 5to 10 years before researchers understandthe covariation of specific polymorphismsin a way that will allow them to measureshared diathesis 4with respect to drug dependence. He expects researchers tofind that different genes regulate respons-es to different drugs. He cited as an exam-ple the finding that genes regulating theliver's metabolism of alcohol do not appearto have much of an effect on cocainemetabolism. One issue to be addressed in this context is whether polymorphisms sort peopleinto different latent classes of vulnerabilityrather than arraying them on an underlyingdimension of genetic vulnerability. Dr.Anthony expressed hope that new inter-ventions in areas like obesity, where thearray of known genes and polymorphismsis much broader than those for drug de-pendence, will open up the possibility ofstudying gene-environment interactions ina way that can guide NIDA's researchagenda on genetics and drug dependence. A forum participant suggested that the dis- tribution of drug use in society is wideenough that genes could in fact play amajor role in drug use. However, lookingat acquisitive crimes, violent crimes, and,in particular, the intersection of drug useand crime and the types of people mostlikely to be involved in both, we do notsee those activities distributed throughoutsociety in a way that suggests such a role.It was further suggested that NIDA shouldnot place a lot of emphasis on geneticresearch. Rather, social science researchshould be emphasized because that iswhere researchers are more likely to findanswers. Costs versus benefits of genetic neu- ropharmacology research. The intersec- tion of the genetic neuropharmacologyWhen asked whether scale should be viewed as a methodology, Dr. Anthonyresponded that it should be viewed as aconcept. Although scale is not strictlymethodological, it can guide researcherstoward methodologies. He applied it in thecontext of drugs and crime to provideguidance on how NIDA and NIJ can worktogether to foster the next generation ofresearch. NIJ, Dr. Anthony suggested, should not establish the kind of biobehavioral labora-tories required for research on the genet-ics of the relationships between drug useand crime. Rather, it may be wiser to rein-force NIDA's investment in those areas,with the two agencies coming to someagreement. He recommended the sameapproach for directing, controlling, andplanning research on the pharmacologicaleffects of drugs on aggression and on thecognitive functions. Arrangements shouldbe made for research where substantialinvestment has already been made inbiobehavioral laboratory domains. Withrespect to national and global policies,however, NIDA's research agenda has notbeen strong. NIJ can fill this gap. NIDAhas supported organizations and opera-tions research on drug dependence forcorrectional officers, police, and postre-lease juvenile justice programs. In thisarea, the agendas of the two agenciesoverlap, and it is an area in which theyboth should be working. Genetics of drug dependence. Dr. Anthony was asked how much progresshas been made in identifying genes orconstellations of genes that might predictdependence. He was also asked whetherhe thinks researchers will discover anoverall genetics of dependence, as op-posed to highly specific genetic links thatpredict dependence on particular drugs,each involving different genes or sets ofgenes and their protein products. 165TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYand social behavioral components of drug use was seen as a key element of Dr.Anthony's paper. A key issue is whetherand how funding for this research can beimproved. Researchers who seek fundingfrom NIJ or NIDA to conduct sophisticatedurine specimen tests, such as those usinggas chromatography/mass spectroscopy(GC/MS), know the cost is about $56 perdrug tested per GC/MS test. They alsoknow the cost of genetic testing is muchhigher, at about $500 per specimen. Giventhe huge price differential, the cost-benefitbalance becomes an important considera-tion, making it difficult to decide whetherto conduct a social science survey in com-bination with biological data collection andgenetic testing. Dr. Anthony was asked tocomment on the implications of theseissues for funding. He responded by encouraging the partici- pants to think about this problem the waythey would think about the evolution ofcomputing speed and costs. Researchersnow are able to use multilevel modelsin their research due to the always-increasinginexpensive computing speed availabletoday. Because change is occurring at asimilar rate in assays for genes, advancesmade by microarray technologists willcause the prices of these tests to fall. Thetime this change will take is part of thereason Dr. Anthony projected it will be 5 to10 years before researchers are able tounderstand covariation between polymor-phisms in the areas of drug dependenceand complex behavior such as criminaloffending. Ten years might even be anoptimistic projection of the amount of timeneeded because, ultimately, researcherswant to identify the environments thatmodify the expression of the genes. Thiscalls for both observational studies andexperiments. For example, it took approxi-mately 10 to 15 years between identifica-tion of apolipoprotein-4 for Alzheimer'sdisease and recent work on interventions.Types of crime to be addressed. One participant commented on Dr. Anthony'sstatement that criminal behavior and druguse both affect a person's social standing.The questioner inferred from Dr. Anthony'sstatement that the effect is negative andsuggested that there are probably situa-tions in which it is positive. Furthermore,an implicit assumption made at the forumis that in discussions about the drugs-crime relationship, researchers are dealingwith one kind of crime. However, that rela-tionship (if there is one) may exist in a cor-relate sense, involving economic crime,financial crime, cybercrime, and othertypes of crime. The consequences of thatrelationship, which researchers in theircurrent analyses imply exists, cannot beproven. The question posed was whetherthe forum was focusing on a particulartype of crime, such as street crime. If so,it should have been specified, because itwould influence the kind of research agen-da that participants would want to shape. Drs. Brownstein and Erinoff responded that, for the purposes of the forum, theywere not defining crime in any narrowsense. They wanted forum participants tothink more broadly and include the effectsof alcohol in the discussion. Forum partici-pants were urged to keep in mind that thebasis in biological science for a relation-ship between alcohol and aggression isthe strongest for any drug. Further comment by participants focused on the millions of episodes of drug usethat are not associated with crime. How, itwas asked, could these be reconciled withthe framework suggested by Dr. Anthony?The discussion also addressed whetherdrug-related violence is instrumental; thatis, whether it serves a purpose that pro-motes the perpetrator's interests. Tran-scripts of interviews with drug sellers,which a participant had reviewed beforethe forum began, contained descriptionsof violent activities that indicated the 166SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03indicate a growth area only among senior citizens. This growth trajectory, whichbegins at age 60, is not what would nor-mally be found. Another observed trajecto-ry involves young men who were wellbehaved between ages 18 and 25 whobegin to misbehave when they arebetween 30 and 40 years old. The ques-tioner asked whether those trajectories areoutcomes produced by attempts to inter-vene and if so, what this says about growthtrajectories. Dr. Anthony responded that the sense in which he discussed growth trajectorieswas not related to the trends the ques-tioner described. Rather, it was in the con-text of the ecodevelopmental trajectorymodel. Conceptually, this model cutsacross the levels of scale. The characteris-tics of an individual, over time and overdevelopment, are modulated by the socialcharacteristics of the peer group, the fami-ly, or society. Thus, there is reciprocityover time between the predispositions ofan individual and the environment. Anexample is the growth of illegal income,or the proportion of annual income earnedthrough criminal behavior, by the youngmen the questioner cited. One might ask,given one set of regulatory conditions,what those growth trajectories wouldlook like under another set of regulatoryconditions. Dr. Anthony commented further that the paper presented by Dr. McBride notedthat State-by-State variations in drug regu-lations give researchers opportunities forstudy. He had also discussed with Dr.MacCoun the contrasts between growthtrajectories for marijuana involvement byyoung people in Amsterdam in contrast toyoung people in a comparable city in theUnited States. The more ready availabilityof cannabis might have an increasedimpact on the growth curve if the youngpeople smoke more. With respect tothe cannabis itself, the trajectory might violence is instrumental. Most of the actions described in these transcripts,which were not taken from a random sam-ple of drug dealers, did not appear to bethe result of impaired functioning or intoxi- cation. Rather, they were quite deliberate, instrumental acts. One participant notedthat in discussing crime, the forum wasaddressing property crime or violent crimeand not including other acts that societyalso defines as crime, such as the use ofthe drug. Impact of IRBs on social science re- search. The impact of institutional review boards (IRBs) on some lines of researchrecommended at the forum were dis-cussed in the context of potential to stiflesocial research, especially research onjuveniles. A participant suggested thatresearchers would know less about drugsand crime than they do now if currenthuman-subject standards had been ineffect in the past. Understanding the roots of misbehav- ior.Dr. Anthony was asked about inte- grating the micro and macro levels ofresearch, specifically their effects on fund-ing, policies, and research on biologicalinfluences on drugs and crime. He responded by characterizing misbehav- ior as a phenomenon rooted in the originsof the human species, family heritage, andsocial structure. The more researchersunderstand about these factors, the morethey can use that understanding to shapepolicies and perhaps foster a more civi-lized society. Growth trajectories and the ecodevelop- mental trajectory model. The section of Dr. Anthony's paper that dealt with tempo-ral relationships and growth trajectoriesraised the question of the degree to whichinterventions affect growth trajectories.Changes observed lately in drug markets,and in the crack markets in particular, 167TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYdecline if the young people segregate into heavier or lighter users, in contrast toyoung people subject to the current regu-latory scheme in the United States. Thesedevelopments would guide researcherstoward some crossnational research tolook developmentally, over time, at theyoung people's dispositions. Those dispo-sitions might be to maintain a flat trajecto-ry in drug use, to shift from one drug toanother, or to display a declining trajectoryin drug use. Turning to the question of which interven- tion would make a difference, Dr. Anthonycommented that he had started off hopingto conduct policy analyses in this area buthad decided that the observational datawere not good enough for that kind ofwork. He questioned whether the time isright for social experiments that wouldallow researchers to contrast one regula-tory condition with another. In addition,econometricians have convinced him thatthere may be problems even with random-ized experiments, so researchers may notever be able to collect definitive evidencein this area. Whether a researcher's stum-bling on something might always be bet-ter than what can be designed in advanceis a problem of constructivism. Discussion: Problematic ideas Mortality and morbidity due to drug-use-related injuries and diseases. A question was raised about the usual focusof public health research on interventionsto reduce mortality and morbidity. Dr.Anthony's paper focused on crime as anoutcome, but other forms of mortality andmorbidity are also associated with the rela-tionship between drugs and crime. One isinjury resulting from the violence inherentin the drugs-crime nexus, and one can gobeyond that to infectious diseases associ-ated with use of drugs. It is possible toview the correctional system, where agreat many drug users are incarcerated,as an opportune site for public health interventions. About 15 to 35 percent ofall infectious disease cases, from HIVinfection to tuberculosis, passed through acorrectional institution in the past year. Dr.Anthony was asked whether these issuesshould be part of the public health focuson the drugs-crime nexus. He responded in the affirmative, stating that NIDA has an active research portfolioin interventions in criminal justice environ-ments and is likely to increase its invest-ments in that area. He suggested that thiswould be another area in which NIJ andNIDA could coordinate. Dr. Anthony commented on a point not included in his paper that relates to thepharmacological model for the tripartiteapproach. He thought that in the next 5 to10 years researchers will see some inter-esting findings from longitudinal studiesof cocaine-exposed children. These stud-ies will demonstrate, he thinks, that it isnot the children's drug use that leads totheir aggressive behavior, executive dys-functions, or subsequent criminal behav-ior. Rather, they will demonstrate that itis cocaine use by their parents or thelifestyle associated with cocaine use bytheir parents. This will be an interestingnew line of research and a new way ofthinking about that part of the tripartitemodel. Evidence linking drug use to aggres- sion. Dr. Anthony was asked about the nature of the experimental evidence link-ing the use of certain drugs to aggressionand whether that evidence is as strong asthe evidence linking aggression to alcoholuse. He responded that when studied under experimental paradigms, the use of drugslike methamphetamine, cocaine, and theamphetamines results in aggression undercertain conditions. If one looks outside thelaboratory and examines comorbidities, 168SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03perjure themselves, or otherwise break the law to obtain convictions. Time-lagged effects and crime. A sec- ond neglected issue is time-laggedeffects. In applying the tripartite frame-work, researchers usually think in terms ofcrimes that occur relatively soon after thedrug activity. However, people may alsouse drugs, become addicted, drop out ofthe labor market, and end up homeless.They may stop using drugs, but 2 yearslater they are picking pockets to buy foodbecause they cannot find a job. It need notbe the case that economic-compulsivecrime means only stealing to obtain drugswithin the next few minutes. There also are children who suffer be- cause of abuse or neglect at the hands ofaddicted parents. Researchers should con-sider not only the \"cocaine babies\" whowere exposed in utero, but also childrenwho were abused as 2-year-olds and com-mit crimes 20 years later. This issue hasbeen neglected because of the focus onthe activities of users and sellers proxi-mate to the drug activity. Researchersshould take a broader and more holisticview of the types of crime they should bethinking about in drug-related crime re-search. A suggestion was made to strikethe word crime, because the parent whois inattentive to a child, for example, maynot cross the line into criminality. \"Research on Drugs-Crime Linkages: The NextGeneration\" Robert MacCoun, Beau Peter Reuter Dr. MacCoun acknowledged the impor- tance of the need to define crime morebroadly and to include the study of corrup-tion in future research. He and his coau-thors had focused on street crime andone of the strongest co-occurrences is drug dependence and alcohol depend-ence. Cocaine dependence can be treat-ed, for example, but if the subjectscontinue to drink heavily, they will still beinvolved in alcohol-associated criminalbehavior. This is a complex problem in thesocietal environment, but that complexityshould not blind researchers to the clearexperimental evidence linking certaindrugs, especially the psychostimulantsand drugs like phencyclidine (PCP), toaggression revealed in laboratory studies. Among the complexities of this issue is that the drugs have different effects at dif-ferent doses. That is to be expected anddoes not contradict the causal inferencebased on effects that might be observedat specific doses. When violence is ob-served in people who are using PCP , it isgenerally seen in those who have ingest-ed very large doses. A similar phenome-non is observed in methamphetamineusers who have been on runs that lasted aweekend or longer. The resulting paranoia,suspiciousness, and other effects end inviolence. Dr. Anthony responded to a comment that violent drug users have typically alsoused alcohol by citing instances in soci-eties where alcohol is not widely usedand instances in which methamphetamineusers who are not drinkers are arrestedfor aggressive behavior. Although the co-occurrence of methamphetamine andalcohol use is a palpable association,there are exceptions. Drug-related corruption. A comment was made about important topics thatappear to have been neglected in researchconducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Onesuch topic is drug-related corruption. It isacrime and it is related to drugs, but re- searchers do not write much about it.Examples cited included instances inwhich officials are involved in bribery, 169TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYproposed some consensus principles on causal directions that they thought wouldbe widely accepted in the drugs and crimeresearch community. He also acknowl-edged that the research reviewed repre-sented enormous bodies of work. Discussion: Most helpful ideas Victimization and the tripartite frame- work. Dr. MacCoun offered a clarification of the victimization issue as it relates tothe tripartite framework. Victimization wasinitially included in the framework as asubcategory within the category of psy-chopharmacology. But the concept of vic-tims is difficult to establish in the realworld. In one study, for example, partici-pants in 40 percent of the violent eventswere classified as codisputants. Theresearchers could not determine who wasa victim and who was a perpetrator. The four-cell scheme for classifying drug markets. Reintroduction of the four- cell design for describing drug marketswas considered a strength of the paper. Inthat design, markets are classified accord-ing to whether buyers and sellers live in oroutside the area where drugs are sold.Although there has not been a great dealof research on the operationalization ofmarkets and the consequences of eachtype of market, the approach was re-garded as a useful policy paradigm. Ifresearchers can work with local lawenforcement agencies to identify the distribution of those types of markets andtheir locations, they will be one step closerto helping the agencies implement poli-cies appropriate for the markets in particu-lar communities. Drug supply. Two comments were of- fered about drug supply. One addressedoutdoor versus indoor markets. The sug-gestion was that if markets moved in-doors, the ability of law enforcementagencies to drive down the supply of drugswould increase because the agenciescould use such technologies as wiretaps. The other comment was that incapacita-tion is largely a function of supply. That is,eliminating dealers may reduce drug avail-ability, although new dealers may taketheir place. The Federal antidrug effortdoes not make a large dent in the supply.One operation conducted in the 1980sthat targeted a jungle laboratory seizedseveral tons of cocaine but had no impacton the cocaine supply because the dealershad five or six other laboratories. Clarifying legalization. Dr. MacCoun responded to a favorable comment abouthis raising the issue of legalization by clari-fying his use of the term. It is very diffi-cult, he said, to discuss alternatives to thecurrent system because the debate tendsto focus on two models that are at polarextremes: a free market in drugs andsome version of prohibition. A range ofpossibilities exists between these ends ofthe spectrum, and in examining Europeanmodels, researchers are looking at coun-tries that have legal prohibitions yet aresignatories to international agreements ondrugs. The word legalization must be usedcautiously because it implies commercial-ization. The Swiss model, for example, isan incremental model and is heavily regu-lated, thereby costly to apply. Rather than studying the issue of drugs, crime, and their connections, more timecould be spent on the connections amongdrugs, crime, and policy and the effect oftheir interaction. There are opportunitiesinternationally to examine innovations inpolicy, which by no means constitutelegalization in the sense of commercializa-tion but are nevertheless more substantialthan the policy variations typically observ-ed in the United States. If one accepts thepremise that drugs, crime, and policy allinteract, researchers could learn frominstances in which policy varies. Theycould, for example, conduct empirical datacollection on experiments conducted inother countries in an effort to understanddrugs-crime-policy links. 170SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03Discussion: Problematic ideas Flawed methodology. A general question about methodology was prompted by Dr.MacCoun's statement that the Swissexperiment is flawed methodologically. Dr.McBride had made a similar point in hispaper, noting that research on interven-tions contains methodological problems,but that the treatments work neverthe-less. The question for Dr. MacCoun waswhat policymakers should make of thisdiscussion. Dr. MacCoun addressed his skepticism about interventions, specifically about theSwiss experiment with heroin mainte-nance. He noted that the Swiss resultswere ambiguous because they lacked truerandom assignment and because heroinmaintenance was confounded with provi-sion of other forms of treatment. How-ever, the Swiss experiments demonstratethat heroin maintenance is logistically fea-sible and provide at least tentative evi-dence for its benefits. A forum participant asked whether the Swiss heroin maintenance experimentserves as a lever for getting addicts intotreatment and, if so, how the Swiss meas-ure treatment outcomes. For example, issuccess measured strictly in terms ofabstinence, or is rehabilitation a positiveoutcome? Dr. MacCoun responded that asa researcher he criticizes the confoundingof heroin maintenance with other inter-ventions in the Swiss study. However, onhumanitarian grounds, he might celebratethat weakness because it implies that theheroin maintenance program encouragedSwiss addicts to seek other needed treatments. Failed interventions. The results of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS)study suggest that researchers have notdone a good job documenting which inter-ventions work, but they can scientificallydocument those that do not work. In theDr. MacCoun offered an example of an opportunity of this kind that has not beenaddressed. In the 1970s, Italy depenalized(that is, removed the penalties for but didnot legalize) personal possession of alldrugs that are prohibited in the UnitedStates. Italy maintained depenalizationuntil 1990, repenalized that year, thendepenalized again in 1993. Researcherscould conduct archival research to exam-ine the effects of these policy changes. A participant offered two examples of other kinds of opportunities for internation-al research. One opportunity exists be-cause of the externalities of U.S. drugpolicy in relation to drug use by youngpeople outside the United States (in LatinAmerica, for example). The United Stateshas a global impact, because of what itdoes domestically. This has been neglect-ed in research that focuses on the UnitedStates. The second example is societieswhere the use of intoxicating substancesis common and the link to criminal behav-ior is absent. This presents another oppor-tunity for international research. Althoughpolicy variations are more diverse outsidethe United States, other countries lack thedata infrastructure we have here, whichcomplicates research efforts. Researchers are on the brink of being able to capitalize on research on the temporalsequencing of policy interventions. Theanalytic framework for drug policy pits thevarious components of policy against eachother in a battle for resources. Conflictsabout implementation can be found atthe Federal, State, and local levels. Butresearchers can develop first-order mod-els and simulations to anticipate epi-demics and collateral problems that maybe associated with epidemics, preventepidemics, address epidemics early on ina cycle, and address them later on in acycle. This would allow consideration ofmore dynamic policy/resource allocation. 171TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYlast quarter of the 20th century, one of the most important interventions has been tolock up drug offenders and \"throw awaythe key.\" Research projects that use thiskind of intervention as a control almostalways indicate better results for treat-ment. Foreign interdiction is another failedintervention, as price and purity data indi-cate. Data are also available on 25 otherinterventions that do not prevent youthsfrom starting drug use or other deviantbehaviors. A key element in a researchagenda may be to develop a list of inter-ventions that are popular politically but donot work. Successful interventions? At times in recent history, source-country interdictionhas been reported as effective. Examplesare the Turkish opium ban and the so-called French Connection. There have alsobeen spikes in prices to which the marketadapted immediately. These observationsgave rise to the question of whether dataindicate reductions or increases in crimecorrelating with the price fluctuations.Impulse-response analyses of theseevents, exemplified by an NAS review,indicate that little is known about the sug-gested correlations. Lack of direct measures of deterrence. Measurement of the effects of deterrenceon retail operations is also lacking. Re-searchers primarily use price fluctuationsas their core index, and that measure isweak. There is no probabilistic sample andresearchers rely on Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) data, which aredesigned for a different purpose. This callsinto question the usefulness of studyingprice fluctuations as they relate to crime indrug markets. Are drug epidemics cyclical? The dynamics of the drug scene and the con-stantly changing nature of drug marketsraise the fundamental question of whetherdrug epidemics are cyclical. The timecourse over which researchers have stud- ied this phenomenon is 1.5 cycles, whichis not long enough to attempt a fit withany cyclical model. If drug epidemics arecyclical, researchers should examine whathas occurred before the next cycle. Event dynamics of the tripartite frame- work. The tripartite framework could be applied to research on why a drug userbecomes violent in one circumstance butnot in another and under what conditionsviolence does or does not ensue duringepisodes of drug use. One study bor-rowed methods from symbolic interaction-ism and game theory to examine drugtransactions. Researchers have tried tounderstand the sequence of potential tomotivation and motivation to action. Inother words, they tried to observe a cas-cading effect in which drugs may take theuser from a stable state to an arousedstate and then to an aggressive state. This particular study of drug transactions revealed that drugs have strong psychoac-tive effects. The researchers examinedthe mediating mechanisms through sub-jects' own narratives, in which they dis-closed how they would change theirbehavior in a confrontation. When theywere under the influence of drugs, theysaid, the stakes would rise: They wouldbecome more boastful, their languagewould change, and they would misreadperceptions of danger or the cues fromanother person. This research demon-strates that thinking about event dynamicsas a framework in which causal factorsunfold over time is a promising method forexamining this issue. Limitations of the tripartite framework. Researchers need to be aware of prob-lems in applying the tripartite frameworkas a measurement tool. Although thisframework is still important, it was de-signed to explain connections betweendrugs and violent crime. In examining 172SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03relationships between drugs and nonvio- lent crime, we need to transcend theframework and also use it to understandparticular events. With respect to the lat-ter, multidimensional has been the mostimportant category of analysis becausethings rarely fit neatly into any of the others. Researchers who apply the tripartite framework also need to go beyond NewYork City to locations throughout the coun- try to identify a reliable source of data onthe drugs-homicide link. The ArresteeDrug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) instru-ment contains a drug market section thataddresses the characteristics of marketsover time, by location, and by comparingindoor with outdoor. Another potentialdata source is a NIDA-funded internationalstudy of the psychoactive and sociobe-havioral effects of marijuana use in Amster-dam, San Francisco, and Melbourne. Decriminalization and the link between drug use and crime. What is the link between drug use and nondrug crime?Because drug possession is itself a crime,various types of decriminalization (whichare not necessarily the same as freeaccess) will be needed to sever the linkbetween drug use and crime. This pointis important from a research perspectivebecause the illegality of drugs is a con-stant in all research conducted in theUnited States. Various models addressthe implications of illegality, such as corruption and market-oriented violence.Opportunities for comparative researchshould be sought in countries that havedecriminalization policies, countries wheresome drugs are part of the culture andused freely, and in historical work on peri-ods when drugs were legal in the UnitedStates. Other research opportunitiesinclude the study of legal drugs, such asalcohol, to see how society manages theeffects of these widely used substances.Researchers' impact on State-level policies. Researchers' results can influ- ence policymakers and State budgets.Delaware, for example, actively tried tointroduce drug treatment into its prisonsystem in the late 1990s. Delaware'sattempts were closely associated withdrug courts, which are based on the prem-ise that offenders who have extensivecriminal histories and signs of addictionwill commit less crime if their addictioncan be halted. By making treatment partof corrections, the State has changed thedefinition of crime. An example of the way the definition of crime can change involves urinalysis con-ducted among offenders on probation totest for drug use. A positive test countsas a technical violation for which proba-tioners may be returned to jail. With theintroduction of the therapeutic approachinto prisons, Delaware's Department ofCorrections and judges have become sen-sitive to the implications of positive uri-nalysis results. Although classified asrelapses, positive urinalysis results havebecome the equivalent of crimes. In thisway, research has affected policy as thecorrections system introduced treatmentand changed the way crime is defined. Corruption in models of drug distribu- tion. A comment was made about cor- ruption in connection with models ofdistribution. It is essential, in the view ofthe participant who made the comment,that these models address street-levelethnographic research that found somepolice on the street to be involved in thedrug trade to the extent of having a dra-matic impact on how the trade operates.Police corruption plays a dramatic role inthe drug trade on both the micro and sys-temic levels. One reason is that public pol-icy sometimes permits seized assets todevolve to police departments on thebasis of their own enforcement activities.A related issue is the way in which police 173TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY174SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03 affect or do not affect particular drug mar- kets depending on how they choose toenforce the law. Reports and feedback from the roundtable discussions Methods, measurements,and datasets There is a need for integrated data collec- tion and better measures. Suggestedareas for further research include identify-ing particular local areas for saturationtesting of multiple measurement methodsand determining how current measuresoverlap. In the National Household Surveyon Drug Abuse (NHSDA), data are gath-ered from the general population, butother data collections, such as Monitoringthe Future and ADAM, are more narrowlytargeted. We do not fully understand howthe methods used in these surveys over-lap. The ADAM program has attempted toinclude questions in the survey instrumentthat enable analysts to link ADAM data todata in other surveys. The validity of self-reports of both crime and drug measures is a significant issuefor research. Such issues as subjects'recall and telescoping are addressed inparts of larger studies, but funding en-ables the testing of the validity of self-reports in only a few studies. The wordingof questions, the order in which they areasked, and the effects of the urinalysisitself (in the ADAM program) are possibleareas of investigation. Experiments involv-ing random assignment of survey ques-tions offer an opportunity for study asdoes altering the sequence of urinalysisand survey administration. Interviews withstudy subjects might produce differentresults depending on whether the urinespecimen is taken before or after the interview.How DEA data on such elements as price, purity, quality, and signature informationcan be folded into programs like ADAM isa key issue. Apparently signature analysiscan be conducted as easily on urine speci-mens as on actual samples of drugs. If so,it would enable additional information tobe integrated with the ADAM data. Ethnicity and race Family and genetic issues as well as raceand ethnicity are important for futurestudy. The Human Genome Project mayprovide data relevant to studying drugsand crime. Researchers must do a betterjob of articulating the importance of thesefactors. The public should not be led tobelieve, for example, that there are singlegenes related to poverty or violence. Theneed for more attention to diversity withinand among ethnic and racial groups wasrecognized as a priority. Acknowledgingthat caution must be used in analyzingthe concept of race in scientific research,participants recommended the study ofethnic variation, learned behavior, and culture. The addition of discussions of cul-ture to the three forum papers was alsorecommended. We can expect diversity in drug use among different groups, such as HispanicAmericans and blacks. An example ofdiversity within groups is the drug use patterns of Mexican Americans in theHispanic American population. Diversityraises complex issues that involve conceptualization in measuring environ-mental circumstances, conditions, andprocesses. These issues affect researchon ethnicity and on gene-environmentinteractions. The research communitymust address the sensitivity of the combi-nation of the issues of genes and race,possibly through formation of a NIDA-NIJworking group.175TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURY Several specific issues or phenomena involving ethnicity and drugs offer oppor-tunities for study. An example is theNational Development and ResearchInstitutes study of the \"blunt generation,\"which revealed that black youths in NewYork City are shifting from crack to mari- juana and tobacco. This research can beused as a model to study whether thesame transition is occurring outside NewYork City. Researchers should be mindful of the fac- tor of religion because, like ethnicity, it hasdifferent levels of importance for differentethnic groups and a bearing on criminalbehavior as well as drug use. Another areafor study is the differential effects ofmethamphetamine on different ethniccommunities. There are few examples inwhich blacks are represented amongeither methamphetamine users or casual-ties of its use. However, research hasrevealed users and casualties amongmembers of other ethnic groups, partic-ularly Pacific Islanders. Two research design issues were raised in the roundtable discussion. One had to dowith the false belief that there is variationby ethnic group in the extent to whichinformation from self-reports differs frombioassay results. Recent research mightbe developing evidence that will contradictsome of these false beliefs. The otherinvolved IRBs, protection of human sub-jects, and the differences in the confiden-tiality certificates issued by NIJ and theU.S. Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS). Discussions between NIJand HHS about checks and balances in theIRB processes would allow researchers tolearn more about pressing social problemsthat do not necessarily fit the HHS bio-medical research model. Policy issues Researchers need to examine policiesother than those specifically directed atdrugs, such as economic, social, and health policies. NIJ and NIDA could con-sider commissioning a series of multidisci-plinary review papers that focus on thepotential impact of policies on outcomes.The policy community would be the targetaudience. Currently, no mechanisms areavailable to examine policies at the Fed-eral, State, and local levels. We needadatabase that would enable researchers to examine variations in policy amongjurisdictions. Another important and related area for research is the development of modelsthat transcend econometric models inexamining the impacts of policies on out-comes. Researchers have not developedmodels that examine the impact of publicpolicies on behavioral outcomes and therelationship between drugs and crime.Input from practitioners about the impactsof policies on their constituents mayadvance this line of investigation. Drug markets How do researchers define and measuredrug markets? Among the issues consid-ered in the roundtable discussion werethe usefulness of such measurementsand the benefits to law enforcement agen-cies from this kind of research. The dis-cussion covered how researchers mightmeasure the harmful effects of drug mar-kets and how to detect changes in thoseharmful outcomes over time. For example,how would researchers compare theeffects of crack markets that proliferated10 years ago with the effects of the bluntgeneration today? Nonharmful outcomesand the need to examine how they changeover time were also considered. Socialcontrol mechanisms operating in markets,the question of whether market stability isdesirable, and health issues associatedwith market stability were also suggestedas topics for research.behavior starts reverting to baseline when rewards stop. The impact of welfare restructuring on the drugs-violence nexus is also a topic forfuture research. Some inmates werereceiving Medicaid benefits, which theywere using to pay for drug treatment.Since they no longer receive Medicaid,corrections-based treatment plays a largerrole. Outcomes other than refraining fromdrug use, such as payment of child sup-port, family formation, employment stabili-ty, and residential stability, may also beuseful as indicators that a former prisonerhas addressed problems associated withdrug use. In assessing the effectiveness of treat- ment programs, the fundamental problemfor researchers is obtaining the kind ofpost-treatment and postrelease data theyneed. A study under way in Florida isexamining this issue in a nonprison treat-ment setting where researchers haveaccess to measures of criminality andother data. However, these measures maynot enable the researchers to effectivelydifferentiate between the treatment pro-grams in which the subjects were en-rolled, which include most programs inFlorida. The reporter for the roundtable responded to a followup question about the possibili-ty of requiring treatment providers to trackdata. He noted that the mandate for theFlorida study came from the State legisla-ture, which requires evidence that moneyspent on treatment produces a result thatis more economically valuable to the Statethan the current expenditures. However,treatment providers cannot respond veryeffectively to the legislators' mandatebecause they do not have the resourcesto track all the data. The facilitator told forum participants to imagine a situation in which they are ap-proached by a philanthropist who claimedTreatment in the criminal justice system The treatment roundtable focused on two measurement issues and two potentialinterventions. The first measurementissue was dropouts. When drug usersundergoing treatment drop out of the pro-gram, this affects any evaluation underway because the numbers change. Otherdisciplines have dealt with the problem byusing econometric and other statisticaltechniques. The participants thoughtsome of these tools should be broughtinto the drug treatment literature. They also recommended comparing the effectiveness of different types of treat-ments used in the criminal justice system,an undertaking for which there is currentlyno common measure. The AddictionSeverity Index (ASI) was discussed, butusing the ASI poses problems because ofthe \"past 30-day\" questions it includes.Opportunities provided by new technolo-gies for detecting drug use, such as hairtesting and sweat patches, were also considered. Contingency management is an interven- tion examined in the Greenwood study,which revealed that paying students to fin-ish high school is cost-effective. If thisapproach is applied to encourage treatedprisoners to receive more treatment or torefrain from using drugs once they leaveprison, it may offer opportunities forresearch. The problem of treating drug-using offend- ers after release from prison is anotherintervention issue that could benefit fromresearch. In addition to using contingencymanagement, some States hire case man-agers to encourage prisoners to continuereceiving treatment. Texas, among otherStates, makes such additional treatmentacondition of parole. Research indicates that contingency management has notworked well in the long run because 176SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03that he could raise large sums of money if researchers could develop agreed-uponmeasures of outcomes that were valuableand whose cost was lower than the costof producing the results. The participantswere challenged to find out if they coulddo so with the interventions they had tested. In response to the challenge, one partici- pant noted that in some studies of thevaluing of drug abuse treatment out-comes, people who are not drug users areasked how much it is worth to them tolive in a drug-free and crime-free commu-nity. It is not possible to put a monetaryvalue on such issues. Other studies exam-ine outcomes like abstinence or a rangeof outcomes involving improvements inhealth, social functioning, and criminalbehavior. To provide guidance on improv-ing drug abuse treatment at the programlevel, NIDA has tried to shift the focus ofthe research to what the program does,what is unique about it, how it is organizedand managed, and what is unique aboutthe treatment delivery system. Anotherresponder stated that if the philanthropistcould find a way to support graduatesfrom drug treatment programs who liveeither in prison or in the community andare otherwise unemployable, guaranteethem jobs, and assure them of an incomeof about $20,000 per year, there wouldbe much better results than those that researchers are seeing now. In a followup scenario, the philanthropist is prepared to supply the money for whatev-er it takes to produce a graduate of a treat-ment program who was formerly a druguser and in prison and to assure him orher an income of $20,000 per year. Thequestion for researchers is what is thevalue to society of 50 of 100 people leav-ing prison, acquiring job skills, and earning$20,000 per year 2 years after release? Ifresearchers could specify for the philan-thropist the value to society, backing it upwith a defensible number, and tell him what it would cost to net 50 successesfrom the 100 released offenders, hewould raise the money for those 50 peo-ple. He would have to know and be ableto tell his donors, however, the numericalvalue of those 50 successes. One participant who responded comment- ed that for almost any intervention, re-searchers could produce a calculationindicating that the resultant number is bet-ter than doing nothing, although thereprobably is no drug control intervention forwhose effectiveness researchers couldprovide definitive proof 20 years hence.This approach, however, is not a construc-tive way to make practical managerialdecisions and is not the way that busi-nesses, for example, think about suchmatters. Another responder pointed outthat a similar question is not asked aboutdialysis treatment for end-stage renal dis-ease or liver transplants for people withcirrhosis, although they might persist inbehaviors that promote their diseases.Thus, researchers are imposing a standardon drug treatment that they do not imposeon other medical treatments. \"The Drugs-Crime Wars: Past, Present, and FutureDirections in Theory, Policy,and Program Interventions\" Duane C. McBride, Curtis J. VanderWaal, and Yvonne M. Terry-McElrath Current drug policies have not always been in effect and may not always be inplace, and some policy changes havebeen dramatic. Dr. McBride discussed thehistorical context in which drugs-crimerelationships should be examined. In the19th century, drug policies in the UnitedStates varied enormously. Distribution wasrelatively open: Imports were regulatedbut domestically there was some access 177TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYand even commercialization. Drugs, nee- dles, and syringes were available throughthe Sears-Roebuck catalogue. In reactionto this openness, many States began toheavily regulate drugs. Officials fromsome States complained that other Statesopenly sold drugs that they themselveswere trying to regulate. The labeling ofdrug content was instituted and Statesmade many changes in their laws and policies. Discussion: What ideas from the paper are most helpful? Cause and effect in the drugs-crime relationship. The section of the paper dealing with the cause- effect relationshipof drugs and crime suggested an interest-ing line of inquiry. The forum discussionshad looked primarily at the relationship interms of drug use preceding crime. Fromthat perspective, interventions were as-sessed on the basis of the effects theymight have on drug-related crime thatimmediately follows drug use. There wasno consideration of the early antecedentsof drug use and criminal behavior. Study findings on the antecedents of drug use and criminal behavior reviewed in Dr.McBride's paper, as well as research con-ducted by Dr. Anthony on aggression infirst-grade students, were cited as exam-ples of areas where further research isneeded. Evaluation of classroom interven-tions revealed that addressing conductand aggression problems reduced the riskof future drug use, which suggests thatdeviant behavior may precede drug use. History of drug policy. Participants identi- fied the attention given to the history ofdrug policy as a strength of Dr. McBride'spaper. The conflict between the puritanand libertarian traditions, which he cited,is played out in current drug policy discussions.Collaboration among agencies. As States develop comprehensive systemsto address drug problems in their criminaljustice systems, collaboration amongagencies becomes more crucial to policyformulation. For example, in the CaliforniaDepartment of Corrections' treatment sys-tem, which currently has 7,000 beds, thetreatment providers and the correctionsunit that operates the system have beenmeeting regularly for years. Parole officialsbegan attending the meetings only in thepast 6 months, however. Parole is anessential policy element because the pro-gram includes an aftercare component. Using graduated rewards and clients' strengths in drug treatment. Sug- gestions were made that graduatedrewards, as well as the graduated sanc-tions mentioned in the paper, should bestudied for their use in drug treatment programs. Further, more attention shouldbe paid to the clients' strengths in additionto their needs, problems, and resources.Dr. McBride agreed that inclusion of astrengths-based case management sys-tem is crucial to treatment. Comorbidity issues. The comorbidity issues covered in Dr. McBride's paperwere considered relevant to the forum dis-cussions of policy and of treatment in thecorrectional system. As a result of highrates of comorbidity and of deinstitutional-ization in the mental health field, someprisons are the major mental health serv-ice providers in large urban counties. Thissituation influences the effectiveness oftreatment in correctional settings, and isasituation in which some medical care providers feel more like law enforcementpersonnel. Ballot initiatives and research. Ballot measures such as California's Proposition36 address drug policy, and are frequentlysupported by advocacy organizations thatare also interested in research. Social sci-entists should try to gain currency with 178SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03these organizations and open an avenue through which the research communitycan examine these policy experiments andtheir outcomes. Researchers previouslyhave not made strong connections tothose who propose public policy reformsfrom the perspective of the political right,and the same may now be true for thepolitical left. Health versus criminal justice research funding. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is funding a study of Proposi-tion 36 that may become a model forreporting that could affect public policy.The Robert Wood Johnson Foundationfocuses on health issues, and its sponsor-ship of this project indicates that the criminal justice research community isunderfunded because a health fundingorganization is implementing portions ofthe criminal justice research agenda. Building collaborations between NIDA and NIJ to study drug enforcement would bean important part of a future researchagenda. Such collaboration could addressmajor policy issues, such as variationsamong States in the intensity of drug en-forcement and how strongly they enforcedrug prohibitions. Researchers could also evaluate the effects of different kinds of enforcement,but would need to identify appropriate outcome measures to do so. State-levelmeasures are being developed for NHSDA,but would be inadequate for these purpos-es because they focus on the prevalenceof addiction. The ADAM sample frame isnot suitable for this type of project, whichwould address how enforcement affectsdrug use. The relationship between drugsand crime, in and of itself, is not as usefulas is research that will inform drug policy.NIJ is primarily a policy research agencythat should be addressing such policy- driven issues as alternative enforcementstrategies. Publishing policy research. Studies of Proposition 36, changes in the Rockefellerdrug laws, or the Swiss heroin experimentdo not have perfect control groups andrandom assignment of subjects becausethey examine real-world situations. Thismay limit researchers' ability to publish inthe better journals. In addition to providingfunding, NIJ and NIDA could increase thedemand for policy research by fosteringpublication outlets. To obtain funding, grant applicants are re- quired to address scientific design issues.Poor designs submitted to the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) may not beacceptable to epidemiologists, but theNew England Journal of Medicine has published comparative studies of theimpact of handgun regulations on homi-cide and suicide rates in Vancouver andSeattle. Dr. McBride cited these studies,which compared different populations, asexamples of flawed designs that wouldnot have received NIH funding but werenonetheless published in a quality journal. Funding for secondary data analysis. Dr. McBride's paper was praised for its list ofsuggestions for future research, particular-ly because of the proposal that secondarydata analysis could provide a new empiri-cal baseline for study of the drugs-crimerelationship. Securing funding for theanalysis of NHS data, to assess the extentof drug use or the gateway model hasbeen difficult. The only sources of fundingfor analysis of ADAM data have beensmall grants from NIJ or organizations likethe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.Funding agencies spend large sums ofmoney supporting new data collection andrelatively small amounts supporting sec-ondary analysis. 179TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYDiscussion: Problematic ideas Policy implementation and evaluation. Without effective enforcement and imple-mentation, it does not matter which poli-cies have been adopted. With respect totobacco, there was a great deal of policy-making at the State level, but until therewas enforcement, the policies did notmake a difference. Dr. McBride's papersuggests that policies directed at clubdrugs (for example, changes in metham-phetamine penalty structures) offer impor-tant research opportunities. Researchershave an opportunity to evaluate theeffects of these laws and policies fromboth the criminal justice and the publichealth perspective. Dr. McBride noted in his paper that model laws developed by the National Alliancefor Model State Drug Laws have not beenexamined for their effectiveness. This indi-cates a need for studies of implementa-tion and enforcement. One participantsuggested that the forum should be opento the possibility that not implementingcurrent laws might be advantageous insome situations. References in the paper to the moral ten- sions surrounding drug policies illustratehow values affect assessment of thosepolicies. An example of those tensions isthe different standards of evidence usedin assessing new pharmaceutical productsand in evaluating controversial new drugpolicies, such as those based on relaxedenforcement. There is also a reciprocalrelationship between drug policy and druguse, because the public, to whom lawsand policies are directed, includes the vot-ers who elect the legislators who in turnmake the policy. Policy research must takeinto account that the consumers of policy,or the public, also influence policy. Historical roots of current policies. In Dr. McBride's paper, the juxtaposition oflibertarianism on one side and puritanmorality on the other resulted in a lack of historical background needed for under-standing the current situation. Missing ele-ments include the harm that drugs cause,status battles among people who wanttheir moral beliefs adopted as official poli-cy, and the agendas of interest groups. In citing an example of the effects of interest-group issues, one participant suggested that if asset forfeiture lawschanged so that seized assets were spenton drug treatment rather than enforce-ment, the statistical portrait of drug usemight change. A better understanding ofthe historical roots of current policiesshould be included in the research com-munity's policy research agenda. Also suggested for inclusion in Dr. McBride'spaper were more material about the racialdimensions of Prohibition, its 19th-centuryroots, and its current manifestations; and areference to Tonry's Sentencing Matters in the paper's discussion of mandatory mini-mum sentencing. Continuum-of-care treatment models. Studies of drug addiction as a chronic dis-order have implications for treatment mod-els, such as continuum-of-care programs.Current research has established the needfor continuum of care, and future researchcould systematically address the elementsof a continuum-of-care model rather thanconsidering adaptation of current models. In order to provide good continuum of care, medical and social services need tobe linked. This would involve coordinationamong social service agencies, publichealth agencies, and corrections or othercriminal justice agencies. Issues concern-ing the reintegration of treated drug usersinto the community should also be ad-dressed in future continuum-of-careresearch. Computer simulations. Dr. McBride sug- gested that researchers start thinkingabout computer simulations. A participant 180SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03interpreted this to mean creating broad models with many parameters, whichwould produce many research questionsthat could be used to generate useful poli-cy analyses. The drugs-crime researchfield would benefit from a macro effort inmultiple places, with multiple perspec-tives, which would examine policy con-cerns with research backing. Modelingwould stimulate further work in all areasof drugs-crime research. A comprehensive surveillance system. In his paper, Dr. McBride did not addressthe need for a comprehensive surveillancesystem that would enable researchers todetect when peaks in drug-related vio-lence begin. Such a system would allowresearchers to study the peaks as theyform and also understand why they form.A big peak of violence occurred in theUnited States in the late 1970s and early1980s, and another occurred in the late1980s and early 1990s. Between thosepeaks was a valley, and a very deepchasm began in the 1990s. Many explanations have been offered for the peaks, such as changes in drug mar-kets, incarceration rates, community polic-ing, and enforcement of quality-of-lifeoffenses. Ethnographic field stations inhigh-risk communities, enhanced data col-lection by police, and a study of medicalexaminer data were proposed as researchtopics in this area. These enhancementsshould be incorporated into a routine sur-veillance system that would facilitatestudy of the next peak in violence. Such asystem would allow analysis of qualitativeobservations in conjunction with overdoseand arrest data. Use of mild drugs is normative for ado- lescents. Developmental factors that affect drug use and its relationship withcrime had been alluded to in previousforum discussions, but had not been atopic of discussion. Developmental litera-ture on use of mild drugs (alcohol andmarijuana, for example) indicates that this behavior is normative for adolescents.These drug-using adolescents do not com-mit many crimes other than using the ille-gal substance. If the drug use continuesas they grow older and they also move onto using harder substances, problems withother kinds of crime are then observed. The role of the family in shaping be- havior. Another topic not adequately ad- dressed was the critical role of the familyin shaping behavior. In developmental psy-chology, interventions are family-based,rather than broad-based population inter-ventions. (An example of the latter iskeeping offenders in treatment.) The im-portance of interactive relationships withinthe family was illustrated by research onchildren who have attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD). When childrenwith ADHD are medicated, the behavior ofthe parents changes, even if that of thechildren does not. Changes in heritability. Quantitative- genetics research projects, such as twin-sibling studies, have revealed thatchanges in heritability occur over timeand with respect to gender. Thus, if re-searchers identify a gene associated withsubstance use, the association may nothold for all age groups or populations. Inaddition, the concept of a single genedetermining complex behaviors like sub-stance use is unsound. Missing data estimation. Many re- searchers are working with techniquesfor estimating missing data. These tech-niques may produce results more repre-sentative of reality than those produced byother methods. Biostatisticians use miss-ing data techniques to model longitudinaldata, such as tracking youth drug use andtransitions through different stages ofdrug use. For example, researchers do notassume that dropping out of a study is arandom phenomenon. They try to accountfor it by modeling the dropout process. 181TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYMany standard statistical methods are built on the assumption that missing dataare random, thus young people who dropout would be no different from those whostay in the study. However, in studies ofdrug use, dropouts often may be incarcer-ated, in low-income families, or moving. What do and don't we know about the relationshipbetween drugs and crime?Reaching for consensus The facilitator led a consensus-building exercise in which statements by forumparticipants about the drugs-crime relation-ship were accepted, amended, or reject-ed. Decisions were made according to aniterative process; only ideas on whichthere was unanimous agreement wereapproved. The statements concernedeither what is known or what is not knownabout the relationships between drugsand crime. Consensus statements on what we know about drugs-crime relationships The complexity of drugs-crime relation- ships is widely accepted and means thatthe research tools we have been using tostudy that relationship cannot get us verymuch further in the next decade. The complexity of the drugs-crime relationshipwas accepted as fact. Forum participantsarrived at a consensus on the need fornew tools, which would include both para-digms and methods, if future research isto elucidate the relationship. The beliefthat 10 more years of the same type ofresearch currently being conducted wouldnot advance the understanding of thedrugs-crime relationship was disputedbecause some progress has been made. We know that we need to know more about the effects of child abuse andspousal abuse on drug use and drugs- crime interrelationships. The original state- ment was amended to eliminate a clauseon intergenerational effects of abuse oncrime and drug use because these effectshave not been sufficiently characterized. We know that trends in drug use do not parallel rates of incarceration. The number of people in the United States who areincarcerated has tripled since 1983. Therewas no consensus on whether most ofthe increase was due to enforcement ofdrug laws. The statement was amendedto reflect the consensus that we do notknow whether the increases in incarcera-tion have resulted in decreases in druguse in particular or crime in general. We know that drug use is neither a neces- sary nor a sufficient cause of nondrugcriminal behavior. The statement was accepted without amendment. We know that we need longitudinal data to sort out the relationships betweendrugs and a host of other causal factors.The participants could not arrive at a con-sensus on a statement that cause-and-effect questions can be addressed only byusing longitudinal data. It was modified toread that longitudinal studies are importantin making cause-and-effect statements.This modification was not accepted, how-ever, and consensus was achieved only onthe need for using longitudinal data to elu-cidate relationships between drugs andmany causal variables. We know that illegal drug choices tend to vary with social position. This proposition began as a statement that illegal drug pref-erences tend to vary with social position.A participant objected, saying that what isavailable in different markets may deter-mine what options are available to be pre-ferred. The statement was accepted after\"preferences\" was changed to \"choices\"and the meaning of the phrase \"socialposition\" was clarified. Social position may 182SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03be affected by, but is not synonymous with, either social class or ethnicity. We know that we urgently need local as well as national data (on drug use pat-terns) to augment the utility of those datafor practitioners. A participant proposed that data on drug-use patterns must belocal to be useful because ethnographicand ADAM data show differences by site.For example, methamphetamine use isnot a problem in most U.S. communities,but it is the major drug problem in Hawaiiand southern California. The audience fordata may affect their usefulness; thus, forexample, national data may be useful toFederal policymakers. Crossnational datamay also be useful in addressing someissues. Modifications of the consensus statement to the effect that drug-use data need to belocal to describe local markets, to be use-ful to practitioners generally, or to be use-ful to local practitioners were all rejected.Local data were deemed useful in detect-ing emerging trends in drug-use patterns.The idea that trends in national data, suchas the decline in drug use identified by theMonitoring the Future Study during the1980s, were not useful was seen as im-plausible. The statement was amended toreflect a need to augment national datawith local data to maximize policy andpractice utility. The statement was amend-ed as shown above and accepted by thegroup. We know that given arrest for a drug offense, an African-American is more likelythan a white American to be prosecuted;and given conviction, an African-Americanis more likely to be incarcerated and for alonger time than a white American. Theseofficial results do not accurately reflect theracial differences in involvement with illicitdrugs. There was general agreement that this is known to the research communitybut not to society generally. There is aneed to disseminate the informationamong policymakers and the forum publi- cation will be a means for doing so. We know that a person's drug taking makes him or her more likely to be eithera victim or perpetrator of a crime that otherwise would not be committed. The statement was accepted without amendment. We know that incarceration of drug sellers is in large measure offset throughreplacement by other sellers. As originally proposed, the statement read that incar-ceration of drug sellers leads to recruit-ment of replacements for those sellers.There was no consensus on whether thereplacement phenomenon is known tooccur or not. One suggestion was to mod-ify the statement to read that a conse-quence of incarceration of drug sellers isrecruitment of replacements. This state-ment was considered too weak becausethere could be many consequences.Another proposal was to modify the state-ment to read that the incarceration of drugsellers is in large measure offset by therecruitment of additional sellers. The word\"recruitment,\" which implied that superiorsellers were seeking replacements, waseliminated in favor of \"replacement,\" andthe amended statement was accepted. We know that the interdiction efforts that have been conducted over the past 20years have not achieved their goal of sub-stantially reducing street-level access todrugs. As originally proposed, the state- ment read that interdiction has had mini-mal effects on the availability of drugs atthe street level. Researchers do not havea sense of the flow of drugs from sourcecountries through transit and arrival zonesto markets. Since there is little empiricalevidence of how much drug traffic is actu-ally interdicted and how interdiction hasaffected market availability, the statementwas amended as shown above andaccepted. 183TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYConsensus statements on what we do not know about drugs-crime relationships Long-term, intergenerational studies are needed to generate and test causalhypotheses about drugs-crime relation-ships. A generation of grandparents as well as parents has been heavily involvedwith illegal substances and these peoplenow have children or grandchildren. Thus,there are intergenerational subjects whocould be studied, but such studies wouldnot necessarily establish cause and effect.A suggestion was made that intergenera-tional data are needed to evaluate cause-and-effect statements and that they couldbe used to generate causal hypotheses.The proposed statement was amendedaccordingly and moved to the do-not-knowcategory. We do not know whether genes interact with the environment to make peoplemore or less prone to illegal drug use oraddiction. In the proposed statement, \"We do not know how genes interact withthe environment to make people more orless prone to illegal drug use or addic-tion,\" use of the word \"how\" implied thatthere is in fact a relationship betweengenes and drug use. The statement wastherefore amended and accepted asshown above. We do not know the extent to which the decline in rates of violence in the 1990swas related to changes in the crackcocaine market. In the proposed state- ment, \"We do not know the extent towhich the decline in rates of violence inthe 1990s was related to maturation of thecrack cocaine market,\" there was a risk oftautology in conveying the notion that amarket is mature if it is no longer violent.The statement, amended to replace \"maturation\" with \"changes,\" wasaccepted as quoted above.We do not know about community in- volvement with and orientation towarddrugs, or how and why those change.\"Community orientation\" means what thecommunity thinks of the issue: For exam-ple, whether the community cooperateswith or opposes the police. The communi-ty is divided into subgroups and subsys-tems that do not interact well. However,New York City today enjoys a collectiveconsensus reflecting dislike and intoler-ance of heroin injection, crack sales, andcrack use. This consensus was absent adecade ago. Inner-city youths in particularroutinely register disgust at intravenousdrug use and drug selling. We do not know the effect of street en- forcement on drug market violence. The proposed statement, \"We do not knowwhether some forms of street enforce-ment actually increase drug market vio-lence,\" was accepted as amended to readas shown here. The phrase \"some formsof\" was removed. We do not know how best to match treat- ment approaches to the individual needsof offenders. As originally proposed, the statement read that researchers do notknow how to determine which type ofdrug treatment is appropriate for whichtype of drug-abusing offenders. It impliedthat there is always an appropriate treat-ment. The person who proposed thestatement responded that most studiesdo show a length-of-time-in-treatmenteffect, regardless of type of treatment.Another objection cited the many drug-dependent and alcohol-dependent personswho mature out of their addiction withoutformal treatment: Researchers do notknow why this happens. Many peoplearrested as dealers falsely claim that theyare users and are offered treatment. Inthese cases there clearly is no appropriatetreatment. The statement was amendedto propose matches of treatment servicesor approaches to the individual patient andwas accepted. 184SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03In the aggregate, we do not know if in- creases in incarceration have resulted indecreases in illegal drug use by the per-sons incarcerated. The initial statement, \"We do not know if increases in incarcera-tion have resulted in decreases in illegaldrug use or crime,\" was considered toobroad. It appeared to mean that there isno class of persons researchers can de-scribe for whom incarceration results in adecrease in subsequent criminal behavioror illegal drug use. Specific deterrenteffects reported in the literature wouldcontradict such a statement. If the state-ment were more specific, referring onlyto particular deterrence effects for druguse, it could be true. The statement alsoappeared to be an assault on U.S. policy,which is to \"lock them up and throw awaythe key.\" A proposed modification narrowed the statement to make it read that researchersdo not know if increases in incarcerationhave resulted in decreases in illegal druguse by those incarcerated. It was intendedto include postrelease drug use by peopleincarcerated and then released withouttreatment. There was general agreementthat outcomes for individual drug userscannot be predicted, but in the aggregate,postrelease recidivism and relapse ratesreturn drug use to roughly the levels it hadbeen before incarceration. The statement,as clarified and amended, was acceptedas reflecting the group's consensus. We do not know enough about the co- occurrence of alcohol and other drugs inthe drugs-crime relationship. There is a great deal of statistical evidence for thiskind of co-occurrence, but a lack of under-standing of its effects on criminal behavior. We do not have accurate price or sellers' income data for illegal drug sales. The statement was accepted without amendment.We do not know how the different policies implemented in various jurisdictions haveproduced different outcomes. Policies vary nationally and by State, and research-ers need to know how those variationsproduce different impacts. We do not know what etiologically differ- entiates drug-using offenders from otheroffenders. The statement was accepted as representing the group's consensus. Statements for which consensus was not achieved A statement to the effect that enforce- ment alone will not reduce drug use orrelated crime was rejected as uninterest-ing because few people claim that onlyenforcement is effective and treatmentdoes not matter. The statement also failedto consider how much effort and re-sources would be applied to the problem.Given enough resources, law enforcementagencies could reduce drug-related crime. The group rejected an assertion that crack sales/illegal transactions are among themost common offenses in the UnitedStates, although the assertion was sup-ported by calculations indicating that theyswamp other kinds of felony offenses. Aparticipant pointed out that each sale pro-duces at least one incident of drug use, soby definition there are at least as manycases of crack use as there are of sales.Another participant cited research in whichcrack metabolites were detected in ADAMsamples. The data show that roughly 90percent of the cocaine-positive urine specimens were positive for crack. Ifresearchers could estimate the aggregatenumber of crimes, especially felonies,then the crack sales would probablyswamp even thefts, and robberies wouldbe negligible relative to the number ofcrack sales. Marijuana sales would notswamp crack sales because many crackusers engage in 5 to 10 transactions eachday. Other participants disputed these 185TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYcontentions, citing work indicating that the entire universe of cocaine-related transac-tions would not account for the supposedlarge number of crimes. Statements asserting that cause and effect can be determined only by usinglongitudinal studies, that current beliefsabout the effects of drug policies aremainly expressions of ideological prefer-ences rather than scientific evidence, andthat development of low-toxicity substi-tutes for marijuana and alcohol are pre-cluded by the Schedule I requirements inFederal law were also stricken. Discussion of areas for future research Discussion: What research inthis area do you think is mostimportant? The following topics are areas of research that the forum participants considered themost important objectives for future study. Long-range cost-benefit analyses. Long- range cost-benefit analyses of policies ondrugs and crime are needed. Such workwould address various interventions, in-cluding those that have already beenattempted (such as incarceration). In-clusion of policy simulation studies wassuggested because they could be used tosimultaneously produce cost-benefit analy-ses as well as many other insights. Secondary analyses of ethnographic data. Secondary analyses of ethnographic databases from different cities should beconducted to examine data collected dur-ing the peak years of the crack markets.These studies should include comparisonsamong drug markets in different neighbor-hoods or cities as well as prospectivestudies describing the criminal justice andpublic health impacts of illicit drugs on sell-ing and using communities.Effective, ineffective, and promising policies. Researchers should conduct studies that document policies that work,that do not work, and that show promise.Long-term incarceration was identified asthe most significant policy among thosethat researchers believe do not work. A multicity, multimethod surveillance system. Prospective approaches that combine ethnographic observations witharrest, drug pricing, and health data couldbe employed by using field stations inhigh-risk communities. An ongoing multi-city, multimethod surveillance systemshould be set up. It would focus on drugsand crime by using police data, medicalexaminer data, and public health data(such as those documenting overdoses,deaths, homicides, and HIV and other sex-ually transmitted diseases). A suggestionthat the crime data be limited to homi-cides (because the researcher can identifythe endings of cases) was rejected be-cause researchers would want to trackchanges in drug-use patterns in variousplaces, including those where few homi-cides occur. Ethical implications of genetics re- search. The ethical implications of policies based on genetics research in the areasof alcohol, drugs, and crime should beinvestigated. Scientists have not beenresponsible about addressing the ethicalimplications of their research; they shouldbe proactive about the issues raised bygenetics research. An agenda or processfor bringing experts together to produceaconsensus on ethical issues was recommended. An example of such proposed research is identifying links between genetic suscepti-bility to drugs or alcohol abuse and variousoutcomes in the criminal justice system.Researchers need to think in advanceabout what the policy implications mightbe, and the ethical implications of thosedevelopments should be discussed. 186SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03Drugs, mental illness, and crime. More work should be done on the relationshipsamong drugs, mental illness, and crimeas well as the appropriate interventions.Cognitive dysfunctions were also suggest-ed for study, making this a proposal toconduct research on mental illnesses, cog-nitive dysfunctions, and drugs (in combina-tion) and their relationships with crime. The structure of drug marketing in eth- nic communities. Comparative research on the structure of drug marketing and itsimplications in different ethnic communi-ties should be conducted at multiple sites.One of the implications to be studied isthe extent to which drug marketing resultsin penetration of sales into the ethniccommunities. Operational research to improve treatment-outcome studies. Opera- tional research should be conducted tobring more rigor to therapeutic-justice,treatment-outcome studies. Estimatesindicate that up to half of hardcore drugusers are nominally in the criminal justicesystem, either as parolees, as probation-ers, or in pretrial release status. This sit-uation has significant implications fornational policy and budget. However, therelevant research literature is inadequatebecause the programs vary significantly incharacteristics and eligibility requirements;many studies measured recidivism ratherthan relapses, limiting their utility; andsome studies are based on nonrandom-ized comparison groups, which results indata interpretation problems. Randomized studies employing no- treatment arms are freighted with ethi-cal, legal, and analytic problems that mustbe addressed within the context of theCode of Federal Regulations (CFR). UnderCFR, with its minimal risk requirement, itmight not be practical or feasible to con-duct these experiments because interna-tional review boards (IRBs) will interpretmini-mal risk stringently with respect to no-treatment arms. However, there may creative, equitable approaches to thesekinds of studies, such as conductingresearch in locations where scarcity oftreatment slots and randomization mayprovide a fair way to allocate treatment.Random assignment to further treatmentfor previously treated subjects was sug-gested as an ethical approach to con-trolled studies of the effects of length oftime in treatment. Alcohol and marijuana: Complements or substitutes? Meta-analyses that assess whether alcohol and marijuana arecomplements or substitutes would beuseful for modeling policy alternatives. Drug \"consumer price index.\" Metho- dological research on a so-called con-sumer price index for illegal drugs wassuggested as an important research proj-ect. The proposed index would cover retailand wholesale prices and would comple-ment the DEA's System to RetrieveInformation from Drug Evidence (STRIDE)database. Reorganization of current datacollection or expansion of STRIDE throughrandom drug purchases may contribute toproduction of an index. Survey policymakers. A survey of Federal, State, and local policymakers toassess their research needs was pro-posed. The survey would focus on ques-tions that need to be answered in order tomake better policy decisions. The surveycould also help build bridges between thepolicy and research communities. Relationships between distributors and consumers. Research on changes in the relationships between drug distributorsand consumers was proposed. The atti-tudes and orientations of distributorswould be investigated with an emphasison how distribution affects consumption. Event dynamics in drug markets. The event dynamics in drug markets should be 187TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYstudied with an emphasis on the role of peer groups and associations. Peer asso-ciations may vary in different ethnic com-munities and thus affect drug-sellingbehaviors. The influence of ethnic commu-nities may or may not affect sales in thosecommunities and could be instrumentalfor marketing in other communities orcities. The market research could focus on ana- lyzing when drugs cause delinquents toengage in crime, rather than analyzing theactual buying and selling events. Thisapproach would emphasize the drugs-crime relationship rather than the buyer-seller relationship. Drug-selling peergroups observed at different times havebeen observed first encouraging, thensubsequently discouraging their members'violent activities. This indicates that peerrelationships affect the types and frequen-cy of crime. Extending the focus of the proposed research beyond cocaine to, for example,the marijuana market, was suggested.Marijuana use has been an epidemic for30 years in the United States but little isknown about how it is sold. Effects of felony disenfranchisement on minority communities. The political and social ramifications of felony disenfran-chisement laws, which are driven by largenumbers of drug-related felony convic-tions, should be examined for their effectson minority communities. Effects of genes and the environment on drugs-crime relationships. Studies of interactions between drug-using and -selling environments and the psychophar-macological and genetic aspects of druguse should be placed on the researchagenda. As genetics research becomesmore important in the drugs-crime field,researchers may start touting \"druggenes\" without conducting research onhow people with different susceptibilities function in different environments. Drugs have certain physiological effects and there probably are certain genetic pro-clivities affecting susceptibility to thoseeffects. However, the consequences ofthose proclivities differ according to inter-actions with the environments in whichthe drugs are used. The effects on crimeand other behaviors may vary in differentcommunities and subcultures within thelarger society. There may be stigmatizationand other consequences that result frominteractions between people's geneticmakeup and the environments in whichthey live, but people with similar druggenes may respond differently in differentenvironments. Not all drug users need treatment. Allocation of limited resources should bebased on research that examines whichdrug users truly need treatment ratherthan those whose behavior should beaddressed through law enforcement.Researchers should study methods toidentify users who require treatment as away to avoid the negative social conse-quences of drug use. Drug hackers. Researchers need to inves- tigate a growing group of sophisticateddrug users and the more specialized sub-stances available for their consumption.The cocaine problem may diminish sub-stantially as more pharmacologically savvydrug users become more numerous.Amphetamine and use hasbecome commonplace; researchers mayhave to consult pharmaceutical manufac-turers and experts in pharmacology toaddress this phenomenon. A large segment of mainstream America is involved in using illicit drugs in new ways.Researchers need to change their para-digm of who drug users are and how theybehave. A participant volunteered theterm \"drug hackers\" to describe new, 188SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03pharmacologically savvy drug users. They are similar to computer hackers in thatthey use drugs in unintended ways, com-bining many different substances to mixeffects. Polypharmacy. Research on polypharma- cy, with emphasis on the interactions oflicit and illicit drugs, should be included inthe research agenda. Studies of interac-tions between illicit drugs and alcohol areparticularly important. The dark side of drug enforcement. Research should be conducted on thenegative aspects of drug enforcement.This includes studies of the flow of assetforfeiture funds across enforcement agen-cies and the degree to which that flowaffects enforcement policies. Enforcement-induced demand shifts. Researchers should examine the shift indemand from one drug to another as lawenforcement focuses on particular drugs,and the degree to which that shift is help-ful or detrimental. In other words, theyshould examine whether demand is shift-ing to drugs that are less or more seriousin their marketing or crime potential. Consequences other than crime. The research community should study conse-quences of drug use other than crime,such as mental health effects. The healtheffects of cocaine and methamphetaminehave already been examined. Early deviant behavior and drug use. Researchers need to study how parentmonitoring, family cohesion, and familystructure affect early deviant behavior andhow that might in turn affect affiliationwith drug-using peers and drug use. Ex-amination of the onset of criminal behaviorfollowing the onset of drug use in mono-zygotic twins 5would illuminate the links between drug use and crime. If there is acausal relationship, researchers shouldsee crime starting earlier in the twin whostarts drug use earlier.Middle-class addicts. The criminal activi- ties of middle-class addicts, and the socialand legal consequences of those activi-ties, should be studied and compared tothe criminal activities of low-income add-icts. This research would elucidate andderacialize the issues related to the con-sequences of drug use and crime. The differences between middle-income andlow-income addicts in use-to-addiction lev-els and crime-commitment levels (for bothundetected and detected crime) are notknown. Ethical issues and genetics research. In the forum on genetics research, partici-pants expressed apprehension about ethi-cal issues raised by genetics research andthe need for further study of those issues.Stigmatization and labeling of drug usersare major concerns. However, the abilityto give patients a small dose of a prescrip-tion drug, measure a protein encoded by agene whose expression is a secondaryresponse to the drug, and use that meas-urement to predict whether the individualis likely to become dependent on thedrug, would aid a physician working in atherapeutic context. Researchers shouldnot oppose taking advantage of thesekinds of benefits of the Human GenomeProject. Ethical considerations are animportant part of good research andshould not be considered an impediment,but they also should not be the only consideration. Effect of economic development on the drugs-crime nexus. A study of the effect of changes in the economy on drug use,drug trafficking, and the drugs-crime nex-us would be useful. An example is theeconomic boom of the 1990s as an expla-nation for the decline of crime and vio-lence during that period. The developmental role of the family in shaping behavior. There is a need for more research with a developmentalfocus that assesses the influence of family 189TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYlife on drug use and the drugs-crime rela- tionship. One approach to understandingthe role of the family in shaping behaviorinvolves genetic influences on parenting.Some genetically influenced characteris-tics of children, such as their tempera-ment, affect how their parents treat them.Thus, examination of genetic influencesand family life are critical because theseinteractions are frequently dyadic. Continuum-of-care treatment models. Treatment researchers think that the length of time drug users remain in treatment isthe best predictor of treatment success asdefined by recidivism or drug use. Manypeople drop out of treatment at some pointin the process. Researchers should meas-ure the impacts of continuum-of-care mod-els on treatment effectiveness. Racially disproportionate impacts of drug policies. The participants discussed whether the research community shouldaddress variations in the effects of drugpolicies on different racial and ethnicgroups in American society. The incarcera-tion rate is racially disproportionate, butwhether the process leading to that im-pact involved race-influenced decision-making remains controversial and difficultto investigate. Race is often a covariate inanalyses of ADAM data but it is not a pow-erful covariate in explaining dependentvariables. Like gender, it frequently wash-es out when multiple-level controls areused. Comparisons of data from incarceration or other criminal justice processes with drug-use data reveal gross racial disproportion-ality. However, it is by involvement inmarketing, rather than in drug use, thatpeople become involved with the criminaljustice system. Research that includescontrols for participation in drug-marketactivity would be useful in identifying thesize of the disparity in racial impact, where it occurs, and what factors contribute to it.Income level, for example, is a strongcovariate with race, and the way offendersare treated in the criminal justice systemvaries by income level. Researchers mustseparate a variety of race correlates fromrace itself as factors in racial discriminationin order to determine how much racial dis-parity is not due to racism and how muchis a residual that is directly attributable toracism. There are also difficulties in classifying people by race. For some research ques-tions, what may be more important is howpeople are viewed by the police. For ex-ample, is their skin color dark enough tobe viewed as black, regardless of howthey self-identify culturally. Underreporting by racial and ethnic groups. The disproportionate underreport- ing of drug use by members of some eth-nic groups and how this affects researchfindings are important topics for futureresearch. Treatments whose effects differ by race or sex. Researchers need to know more about how the effect of treatment differsby race. They do not know if there arespecific ways to administer treatmentsthat are more effective depending on raceor gender. Recent Federal Bureau ofPrisons studies indicate that treatmentsthat are effective for men are not workingfor women. Intergenerational discontinuities in drug taking. Research on intergenera- tional discontinuities in drug-taking wouldbe useful and would relate to such issuesas the blunt generation phenomenon.Researchers are observing similarities inthe degree to which new generationsbuck trends or defy expectations. 190SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03Discussion: What research in this area is urgently needed? Forum participants were asked to describe areas of research that they think are mosturgently in need of study. Ethical issues in drugs and crime re- search. Theoretical studies of ethical issues are needed to address the impactof IRBs on drugs-crime research. Re-searchers must do some rigorous thinkingabout sound ethical models rather thanslavishly borrowing from the clinical trialmodel used in medical research. That clini-cal model emphasizes autonomy and in-formed consent in ways that may notbe realistic in drugs-crime research. Theresearch community could convene a consensus-seeking meeting of social andmedical scientists to discuss how existingIRB criteria should be modified for socialscience research. More empirical research is needed to sup- plement the work of professional ethicists,whose background in philosophy may notreflect the values of ordinary people, in-cluding drug users, and the way in whichthe latter regard the ethical and moral im-plications of research conducted with orfor them. Survey research could be con-ducted with the subjects and beneficiariesof drugs-crime research to increase re-searchers' understanding of the ethicalperspectives of various stakeholders. Social scientists should be included on Federal panels that produce regulationsgoverning research. Although these pan-els consist of physicians and laboratoryresearchers, the regulations they formu-late are applied inappropriately to socialscience. New statistical methodologies. Advances in statistical methodologyshould be used more widely in drugs-crime research. They could be applied tosuch issues as whether researchersshould conceptualize behavior problems as latent dimensions. This would involvearraying people along a continuum of prob-lem behavior or as manifestations of dif-ferent classes, such as drug users whodo or do not commit violent or propertycrimes. The statistical tools needed to clarify uses of dimensions, classes, cate-gories, and continua are evolving rapidly,and are interrelated with the missingdata issue and selection bias problems.Approaches used by quantitative sociolo-gists and psychologists are already be-coming mainstream biostatistical methods. Scientific justification for mandatory minimum sentences. Research on scien- tific justification for mandatory minimumsentences was suggested, with particularemphasis on studying different mandatoryminimums by type of substance. Manda-tory minimums have a direct bearing onthe racial disproportionality of drug policyimpacts. There is an urgent need for re-search on the marginal cost-effectivenessof mandatory minimums and whetherthere are sociological justifications forthem. This research would involve factorssuch as the way markets are structured. Discussion: What research in this area would be recommended tothe best and brightest graduatestudents? Participants were asked to think about areas of research that would offer direc-tion to researchers just starting theircareers. Interventions for high-risk youths. Almost no research has been conductedon interventions for high-risk youths whohave been arrested. Most treatment out-come studies focus on adult offenderswho are already deeply involved in drugsand crime. A large body of evidenceassembled over the past 20 years indi-cates a progression in drug use amongarrested youths. At age 12, only a few 191TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYarrestees test drug-positive. At a slightly older age, drug tests might detect marijua-na, and cocaine or heroin often are detect-ed in older youths. Thus, there is a needfor research on interventions for youngerarrestees during their initial contacts withthe criminal justice system. Develop-mental psychology literature on antisocialbehavior, although not specific to druguse, may be a source of information aboutprevention strategies for intervention withearly starters. Linking policy interests with estab- lished disciplines. The difficulty in recruit- ing graduate students who are interestedin policy research may be ameliorated bylinking policy interests to the traditionalconcerns of existing academic disciplines,such as economics, psychology, and soci-ology. For example, research that affectspolicy might involve the study of labormarkets and address such topics as therelationship between licit and illicit wages. Policies that affect youth behavior. Students could study policies that affectyoung people's behavior, including theirinvolvement in the macro-educational jobmarket and labor opportunities available tothem. One area of research to pursue isthe possibility that economically, the jobmarket may be better in the illegal than inthe legal domain. Students could studypolicies ranging from economics to educa-tion as well as drug-education prevention.Various aspects of the research could be assigned to members of interdisciplinaryteams. Interdisciplinary or comparative re- search. Graduate study is typically individ- ualistic, which is not consistent with theway research is conducted after gradua-tion. Students should seek interdisci-plinary work or the opportunity forcomparative studies and not be overlyconcerned about the topic. They couldwork on these projects and still establishexpertise in a specialized field by publish- ing some lead author or sole author arti-cles in the journals of a particular discipline. The criminal addict paradigm. Empirical studies of nonuse crimes committed bydrug users would follow up on researchthat suggests the major crime committedby addicts is selling drugs. Researchersfound that people who did not have acriminal history before becoming addicteddid not adopt criminal behaviors other thandrug selling after becoming addicted. Theproposed studies may reveal that theamount of crime committed by drug ad-dicts, other than drug use and drug selling,is dramatically lower than conventionalwisdom would indicate. Hypothetically,the results would fit a bell curve, with afew people at one end who commit manycrimes, a few at the other end who com-mit a small number, and most subjects inthe middle only selling drugs. Researchersneed to define this paradigm because ofits policy implications. The role of cognitive dysfunctions in drugs-crime relationships. The effects of cognitive dysfunctions (whether they pre-cede or are induced by drug use) on drugusers' decisions related to crime and theirresponses to interventions could be stud-ied. Responses to interventions such asincarceration or treatment, for example,may be a function of cognitive deficits thateither precede or follow drug use. Rational choice models of drug use. Students should consult economists andothers who study consumer choice behav-ior for assistance in developing researchthat examines drug use as a choice amongvarious behaviors. Studies could addressthe degree to which a young person's de-cision to use, or not use, drugs is basedon benefits to be obtained immediately orin the future. Analyze ADAM data. In the new ADAM survey, large amounts of data have been 192SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03collected on drug treatment and crime; this information also is connected to cen-sus tract information. This valuable datacollection presents an opportunity for stu-dents to conduct data analysis without collecting data. Secondary data analysis. The best use of graduate students' time might be sec-ondary data analysis using ethnographicor quantitative data. With mentoring andanalytical experience, students couldbecome accustomed to working with dataand could gain experience with data col-lection after graduation. The effects of moderating factors on accepted theories. When theories be- come established or findings are mixed,students should focus on the moderatingeffects or interaction effects. They shouldstudy conditions under which theoriesoffer better or worse explanations forresearch findings. Moderating factors maycause existing theories to work in somesettings but not in others. Theory integration within or across dis- ciplinary boundaries. Students should consider integrating theories within oracross disciplinary boundaries by examin-ing how their own theories fit with thoseof other drugs-crime researchers or theo-ries formulated in other disciplines. Methodological integration in drugs- crime research. Methodological integra- tion, which employs techniques fromother disciplines such as epidemiology orgeographical information systems, may beuseful in drugs-crime research. Family and social networks in minority neighborhoods. The research community needs new models of what constitutes ahealthy family. Development of such mod-els could focus on family and social net-work protective factors for reducing crimeand drug use in high-risk neighborhoods.For example, 35 percent of black house-holds are headed by women, but theprevalence of lifetime drug use is lower among black Americans than among whiteAmericans. The models and methodsresearchers use to study family structureare not useful for explaining drug useand crime in black or Hispanic-Americancommunities. Club drugs and crime. Almost everything researchers know about drugs and crimeis based on past epidemics of cocaine,heroin, and marijuana use. Little is knownabout the relationship of club drug use toother kinds of drug use and crime. Thispotential epidemic involves mainly white,educated, 18- to 25-year-old users. Club drugs and the Internet. People nor- mally start using drugs in the context oftheir peer group. The Internet may influ-ence use of club drugs. Inhalants. Inhalants/huffing is another cat- egory of drug use that should be studiedby young researchers. Marijuana markets. Research on marijua- na markets was suggested as a separateresearch topic. Policy implications of research findings. Having investigators discuss the policyimplications of their findings and address-ing the implications of scaling up success-ful interventions were suggested asresearch topics. History of drug policy. Study of the histo- ry of drug use and its relationship to crimewas suggested as a way to provide per-spective on the origins of current drugpolicies and acceptance of the fact thatpolicies can change over time. Comparative international research. Graduate students should develop fluencyin one or more foreign languages, quanti-tative and methodological skills, andexpertise in comparative research in orderto conduct dissertation research in a for-eign country. Examination of entire drug 193TOWARD A DRUGS AND CRIME RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE 21 STCENTURYenforcement regimes will require compar- ative international research and developingthe capacity to conduct this kind of re-search will be advantageous. Comparative research across drug types. Comparative research across drug types was encouraged. Focusing on thenexus of drugs, crime, and violence, thework would examine which aspects ofdrugs and their markets give rise to differ-ent levels of pharmacological and market-related crime. The ethnographic literaturewill be important in this kind of research. Onset, popularity, and termination of markets for illicit drugs. Students could study various criminal career paradigmsand use them to analyze the creation,duration, and termination of drug markets.This would include a study of the preva-lence of drugs that suddenly appear onthe market and would produce a historyof a particular drug market. It would alsoextend the study to a number of marketsto determine the factors that contribute toonset, popularity, and termination of mar-kets for new illicit drugs. The noncriminal drug user. A suggestion was made that students conduct researchon noncriminal drug users. Interdisciplinary work involving genet- ics.Interdisciplinary research encom- passing fields such as genetics wassuggested. The methods of other disci-plines could be applied in novel ways inthe drugs-crime field. The effects of interdiction programs. Exhaustive analysis of interdiction pro-grams and their effects may result in sav-ings on interdiction expenditures. Extradisciplinary knowledge. Graduate students should acquire some knowledgeoutside their discipline in fields such aspharmacology.Prostitution and drugs. The study of prostitution as a criminal activity related todrugs was suggested as a research topic. Future trends. Students should look beyond the issues that researchers havebeen studying for the past 20 years andtry to assess future trends in the drugs-crime nexus. The flexibility and mobility of drug mar- kets. A study of drug markets could focus on their flexibility and mobility. High-functioning drug users. Studies of drug users who live routine lives and arenot involved in crimes other than takingillicit drugs would be an interesting re-search topic. Models and simulations. Researchers should have graduate students createmodels and conduct simulations of theeffects of alternative drug policies oncrime. The work would be methodological-ly challenging because students wouldhave to understand statistics, economet-rics, and simulation software and conducta literature review for each base estimateto determine whether it is high or low. Closing remarks Dr. Brownstein commented on the needto involve more researchers who aremembers of minority groups in future dis-cussions of drugs-crime interrelationships.Practitioners and policymakers also couldbe more involved in the process; theforum would be the first of many discus-sions about these issues. Dr. Erinoff thanked Roger Conner for act- ing as forum facilitator and reminded par-ticipants that they may submit additionalcomments on drugs and crime through ane-mail listserv. She and Dr. Brownstein willmoderate the submissions. 194SPECIAL REPORT / JULY 03Notes 1. The summary was prepared by CSR, Inc. 2. Manski, F ., John V. Pepper, and Carol V.

The Institute provides objective, independent, evidence-based knowledge and tools to enhancethe administration of justice and public safety. NIJ's principal authorities are derived from theOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3721-3723). The NIJ Director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Director estab- lishes the Institute's objectives, guided by the priorities of the Office of Justice Programs, theU.S. Department of Justice, and the needs of the field. The Institute actively solicits the views ofcriminal justice and other professionals and researchers to inform its search for the knowledgeand tools to guide policy and practice. Strategic Goals NIJ has seven strategic goals grouped into three categories: Creating relevant knowledge and tools 1. Partner with State and local practitioners and policymakers to identify social science research and technology needs. 2. Create scientific, relevant, and reliable knowledge\u2014with a particular emphasis on terrorism, violent crime, drugs and crime, cost-effectiveness, and community-based efforts\u2014to enhancethe administration of justice and public safety. 3. Develop affordable and effective tools and technologies to enhance the administration of justice and public safety. Dissemination 4. Disseminate relevant knowledge and information to practitioners and policymakers in an understandable, timely, and concise manner. 5. Act as an honest broker to identify the information, tools, and technologies that respond to the needs of stakeholders. Agency management 6. Practice fairness and openness in the research and development process. 7. Ensure professionalism, excellence, accountability, cost-effectiveness, and integrity in the management and conduct of NIJ activities and programs. Program Areas In addressing these strategic challenges, the Institute is involved in the following programareas: crime control and prevention, including policing; drugs and crime; justice systems andoffender behavior, including corrections; violence and victimization; communications and infor-mation technologies; critical incident investigative and forensic sciences, officer protection; education and training technologies; test-ing and standards; technology assistance to law enforcement and corrections agencies; fieldtesting of promising programs; and international crime control. In addition to sponsoring research and development and technology assistance, NIJ evaluates programs, policies, and technologies. NIJ communicates its research and evaluation findingsthrough conferences and print and electronic media.To find out more about the National Institute of Justice, please visit: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nijor contact:National Criminal Justice Reference "}
