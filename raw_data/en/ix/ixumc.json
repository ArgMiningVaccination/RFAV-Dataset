When investigating the acceptance of preventive measures in epidemic outbreaks across Europe by using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) , this selection of attributes and attribute levels is an important first step . This deliverable is a short report on how we selected attributes and attributes levels for the DCE. Also , we will give an overview of the attributes and attribute levels that we will use in the DCE. Methods To identify relevant attributes and attribute levels , for both th e general population and the health care worker s choice to adhere to preventive policies or not , we conducted 1) a literature search, 2) a focus group study and 3) expert interviews. 1. Literature search We used an Endnote database (w hich was the result of an extensive systematic literature search performed by WP 4) consisting of a body of literature about risk perception and acceptance of preventive measures during the H1N1 pandemic. We performed an additional strategic search in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane an d Psych Info (see Appendix for search terms) to identify studies on t he acceptance of preventive measures in the case of other communicable diseases . We orga nised the attribute and attribute level s we found , using two theoretic models of preventive beha viour, i.e. the Health Belief Model [1] and the Protection Motivation Theory [2]. 2 2. Focus group study First, based on the literature search and based on the theoretic models [1,2] we created a topic list to structure the focus groups . Second, using a pilot focus group, we tested th is topic list. Third, we conducted seven focus group interviews with the general population from the Netherlands; targeting urban populations (2 groups); targeting populations of more rural areas (2 groups), and targeting ethnic minorities in the Netherlands (3 groups). Additionally, we conducted two focus group interviews with health care professionals from the Netherlands (i.e., one focus group interview with nurses and one focus group with medical students). To take differences between countries from different European key -clusters into account, we conducted two focus group interviews with Spanish citizens during their temporary stay in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we conducted two focus groups in Poland and two focus groups in Sweden. Hence, our WP considered all four European key -clusters. At the beginning of each focus group session, the moderator introduced a hypothetical scenario of a new epidemic outbreak, which was the basis of the discussion: 'I magine, a new communica ble disease emerged abroad. People already died of the disease there. People got sick in <insert your country> as well, but no one died yet'. It was stated that this outbreak was purely fictive. The group was then asked questions about the perceived threat : information they would like to have about this new disease, where they would get this information from, how they would like to get informed, if they would be afraid to get sick and if they would look for preventive measures. After this the group was aske d questions about barriers and triggers to get vaccinated. Finally, different fictitious scenarios, based on the H1N1 outbreak, were discussed . Some additional questions, such as: 'What would you do if all your friends are getting vaccinated?' and 'Do you want your children to get vaccinated as well?' were asked. If new relevant themes arose during a FG discussion , these were added to the topic list . To evaluate the most important reasons to get vaccinated or not in the case of a new worldwide outbreak of a communicable disease, participants filled in an assignment twice during the focus groups discussion . They were asked just before the break and at the end of the discussion: 'If the disease will break out, what are the five most important reasons to get vaccinated or not'? 3. Expert interviews We interviewed both Dutch and international experts (n=9) in different relevant fiel ds (e.g. infectious diseases, vaccination, preventive behaviour and implementation of preventive measures). We used a semi -structured interview guide based on the results of our literature search. 4. Selection of attributes and attributes levels When selecting attributes for a DCE , one need to take into account that only a limited number of attributes can be used in a DCE design to preve nt of making the DCE too complex for the respondents. When a DCE is to o complex, the precision and reliability of the results will decrease. On the contrary, one needs to try to include 3 all relevant attributes to avoid that respondents make significant inference s on omitted attributes. Each attribute should be described as clearly as possible in the DCE questionnaire , which can especially be challenging if attributes present probabilities . Previous research has shown that some respondents may have difficult ies with interpreting pro babilities [3]. We aimed at selecting realistic attribute levels, i.e. relevant to policy as well as plausible and understandable for the participants. Additionally we used a sufficient wide range of levels to cover all realisti c attribute levels as well as levels that may be plausible in the near future . Furthermore, for each continuous at tribute we selected three levels to be able to test for non-linear relationships. We defined both quantitative and qualitative attribute level s. Although we focu sed on all possible preventive measures in the literature study, focus group discussion s and expert interviews , the DCE will be focus ed on vaccination programmes only due to practical reasons . To conduct a DCE on anti -viral prophylaxis (or e.g. hygiene measures) , one needs to adapt the attributes and attribute levels according to anti -viral prophylaxis programmes (or e.g. hygiene measures) . Results The results of the focus group study and expert interviews suggest that although preferences for certain attribute levels differ across respondents of different countries, similar attributes are important when they need to make a decision about adherence to preventive measures . These attributes are: 1) susceptibility to the disease, 2) severity of the disease, 3) effectiveness of the vaccine, 4) safety of the vaccine, 5) advice about the vaccine from doctors, family and friends, the government and public health institutions, and international organizations (e.g. WHO) , 6 ) messages about the vaccine in media, and 7) out -of-pocket costs. In other words, these attributes were marked as m ost important in previous research and were discussed most frequently in the focus groups of each country as well as in the expert interviews . As a result, we are able to conduct the same DCE across all countries and compare the results across countries directly . Since the countries of interest (Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and Spain) have different currencies and diff erent purchasing power, we adapt ed the monetar y attribute levels according to the most recent OECD price levels [4]. Finally, w e made a list of selected attributes and attribute levels and discussed these with all members of the E - com@eu project at the Munster meeting in January 2013 , and reach ed consensus. Conclusion The seven attrib utes and attributes levels that we will use in the DCE are: 4 Attributes Attribute levels Disease specific attributes Susceptibility to the disease (described as the percentage of people that will get sick (that w ill develop symptoms)) 5%, 10% 20% Severity of the disease (described as the percentage of sick people that will develop severe symptoms, including death) 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% Vaccine specific attributes Effectiveness of vaccine (described as the per centage of people that will be protected by the vaccine) Safety of the vaccine (described as the long term severe side effects) Advice about the vaccine Messages about the vaccine in the media 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% - Unknown, however, due to previous experience with the same sort vaccination, this new vaccine is supposed to be safe - Unknown, no previous experience with this vaccine - Your doctor recommends - Your doctor advised again st - Your family and/or friends recommend - Your family and/or friends advise against - The national government recommends - International organizations recommend - Newspapers, television and radio are positive - Newspapers, television and radio are negative - Blogs, T witter and social network sites are positive - Blogs, Twitter and social network sites are negative 5 Price of the vaccine Netherlands Spain Poland Sweden - 0 euro - 50 euro - 100 euro - 0 euro - 45 euro - 90 euro - 0 Polish Zloty - 120 Polish Zloty - 240 Polish Zloty - 0 Swedish Krona - 500 Swedish Krona - 1000 Swedish Krona References [1] Janz, N.K. and M.H.
