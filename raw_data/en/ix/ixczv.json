The principal symptoms are: fatigue, fever, cough, loss of appetite, and failure of vital systems early [4]. The prepare of vaccines was the last thing made by scientific community to treat people committed with this virus [5]. Initially the use of masks, social distance, avoid to stay in agglomeration places were that is needed to not gave this ill. It was not sufficient, and the development of vaccines with virus attenuation or with chemical compounds effective against virus was necessary [6]. The advantage of use of vaccines is to fight the virus in the human body in moment of infection diminishing the symptoms and consequences [7-11]. The pathophysiology of coro-navirus was characterized to have an interaction between hyperin- flammation, defective lymphocyte function, endothelial dysfunction, thromboembolic complications and fibrotic process in the lung [4]. In all the word a variety of potential immunotherapy strategies were developed as: [21-24]; signaling inhibitors [25,26]. This work pretends evaluate all the efforts made by scientists and health professionals to fight this disease, showing what we could find in literature written in the last years to give the necessary information about the ways to treat this disease with immunology knowledge, and promote the use of vaccines as one of the arms to combat this disease. Methods It was conducted in November 21th, 2022, a search in PubMed, PEDro and Clinical Trials using the words: \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19\" and Immunology or Immunotherapy and treatment and vaccine, to find articles of free full text, with associated data, with sys- tematic review, in the last one year, done in humans, published in ME-DILINE, and written in English. It was found 13 articles in PubMed and 3 works in Clinical Trials, in PEDro no works were found. Only 5 articles were about COVID-19 in PubMed and the 3 works founded in Clinical Trials not versed about it. Is presented a study about those 5 works in the results with a systematic review of what they showed. Results In the table 1 were characterized the 5 articles about COVID-19 founded in our research discriminating the objectives and principal's results of the authors showed in their works. Discussion The disease provoke by COVID-19 virus is complex and include respiratory manifestations with viral replication that it was following by systemic effects, indicating that the virus infections is seems to generate a dysregulated immune response. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 can identify triggers for the development of the disease, mediators, and pathways of different effects (Figure 1), which can be battered by immunotherapy. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 has an interaction between hyperinflammation, defective lymphocyte function, endothelial dysfunction, thromboembolic complications and fibrotic process in the lung [4]. These procedures are not only complex, but also vastly variable between affected role, probably Santos-Filho SD, J Clin Immunol Immunother Research Article Sebastiao David Santos-Filho* Biophysics and Physiotherapist, Doctor of Health Sciences, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, UFRN, Brazil New Scientific Knowledge About Coronavirus Immunology and Immunotherapy: Systematic Review Abstract The knowledge about the immunology of virus diseases grown up in all the world after the coronavirus spread out. The use of immuno - therapy to fight against this disease that affect the immune system is present now in all world. The coronavirus reached to make a new era in human population and provokes new health behaviour on all humanity to use masks and to make distance each other, avoiding the contamination with the virus. This work pretends evaluate all the efforts made by scientists and health professionals to fight this disease, showing what we could find in literature written in the last years to give the necessary information about the ways used to treat this disease with immunology knowledge, and promote the use of vaccines as one of the arms to combat this disease. Keywords: Corona Systematic Review. J Clin Immunol ISSN: 2378-8844, Open Access Journal DOI: 10.24966/CIIT-8844/1000073 9 Issue 1 100073Author Objectives Results and conclusions Notarte et al., [7]The paper focused on the possible effects of age, sex, se - rostatus, and comorbidities on humoral response of different populations post-mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccina - tion.A total of 32 studies were identified and reviewed, and the percent differences of means of reported antibody levels were calculated for comparison. Findings revealed that older individuals, male sex, seronegative, and those with more comorbidities mounted less hu - moral immune response. Several recommendations were proposed regarding the current vaccination practices. Including giving addi - tional doses of vaccination for immunocompromised and elderly populations. Another recommendation is conducting clinical trials in giving a combined scheme of mRNA vaccines, protein vaccines, and vector-based vaccines. Pillay et al., [8]The review focuses on studies collecting data during the early phases of the pandemic and prior to the emergence of variants of concern and widespread vaccinationIt was founded small-to-moderate associations between female sex and higher non-recovery, fatigue, and dyspnea (moderate certainty). Severe or critical acute-phase Covid-19 severity (versus not) has probably (moderate certainty) a large association with increased cognitive impairment, a small-to-moderate association with more non-recovery, and a little-to-no association with dyspnea. There may be (low certainty) large associations between hospitalization and increased non-recovery, increased dyspnea, and reduced return to work. Other outcomes had low certainty of small-to-moderate or little-tono association or very low certainty. Several potential pre - ventive interventions were examined, but effects are very uncertain. Guidelines in relation to surveillance, screening, and other services such as access to sickness and disability benefits, might need to fo - cus on females and those with previously severe Covid-19 illness. Continuous assessment of emerging evidence, especially on whether different variants and vaccination impact outcomes, will be import - ant Prasad et al., [9]It evaluated evidence from 23 studies including 117,552 COVID-19 vaccinated pregnant people, almost exclusively with mRNA vaccines.It was showed that the effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 days after second dose was 89\u00b75%. The risk of stillbirth was significantly low - er in the vaccinated cohort by 15%. There was no evidence of a higher risk of adverse outcomes including miscarriage, earli - er gestation at birth, placental abruption, pulmonary embolism, postpartum haemorrhage, maternal death, intensive care unit admission, lower birthweight Z-score, or neonatal intensive care unit admission. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in preg - nancy appears to be safe and is associated with a reduction in stillbirth. Shao et al., [10]It systematically searched for studies that evaluated VE against VOCs in the real world setting and collected indi - vidual data.It was identified 113 studies meeting the eligibility criteria. We found full vaccination provided strong protection against each clinical outcome with summary VE ranging from 86.8% to 96.0% Alpha, moderate protection against infection caused by Beta, Gam - ma and Delta with summary VE ranging from 70.9% to 72.8%, strong protection against severe disease caused by Delta with sum - mary VE ranging from 84.9% to 90.3%, limited protection with summary VE of 23.5% (95% CI, 17.0-29.5) against infection and moderate protection with summary VE ranging from 56.5% to 82.4% against severe diseases caused by Omicron. Booster vacci - nation can provide a substantial improvement in protection against Delta and Omicron, but not as much as the Delta. The metaregres - sion analysis showed that the VE against the Omicron wanned over time, and the VE against hospitalization declined relatively slowly, compared to against infection. Those findings supported the need for public health measures, increasing booster vaccination cov - erage in response to current and new infectious waves driven by variants and developing broadly protective vaccines to confront vi - rus evolution. Wardhani et al., [11]This study was made to assess the association between TPE and the reduction of mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients.It was included a total of four papers assessing the association between TPE and the risk of mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients. The findings suggested that critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with TPE had lower risk of mortality compared to those without TPE treatment. Our study has identified the potential benefits of TPE in reducing the risk of mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients.

These securi- ties a graded immunotherapy method in clinical trials for COVID-19. The response of the immune system is modulated by targeting modu- lators that are trigged by the virus and which gave directions of effec- tor mechanisms (figure 1). These can be non-specific and wide, such as corticosteroids, or inhibiting one specific cytokine. The observation that benefits of the steroid's effects are significant in ill patients could be describe by the pleiotropic effects of steroids that mark different components of COVID-19 present in the disease. Perhaps this clarify why so many patients benefit, it also makes it stimulating to define who needs to be treated with corticosteroids when continuing towards the disease (Figure 2). Another explain is the possible over-use of corticosteroids, that need guidance of immunotherapy. There are a variety of current potential immunotherapy strategies developed for COVID-19, the use of convalescent plasma and in- travenous immunoglobulin [12,13], monoclonal antibodies [14-17], beyond other procedures like use of cytokines and interferons [18-20], cellular therapy [21-24], and signaling inhibitors [25,26]. Ac- tually, the use of vaccines made with attenuated virus have its efficacy in the sustain of an immunity against this ill. The use of specific proto- cols to population immunization is required to win this battle. Various authors developed the theme of use immunization schemes to prepare the population to fight against this disease, that have a lot of symptoms and consequences. Notarte and his collaborators [7] presented several recommendations regarding the current vaccination practices, giving additional doses for immunocompromised and elderly populations. And more, conducting clinical trials in giving a combined scheme of mRNA vaccines, protein vaccines and vector-based vaccines. Pil-lary and collaborators [8] examined several potential interventions which effects seems very uncertain. They suggested that guidelines will be made in relation to surveillance, screening, and other services such as access to sickness and disability benefits, focused on females and those with previously severe COVID-19 illness. [9] showed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnancy appears to be safe and is associated with a reduction in stillbirth. Shao and his co-workers [10] founded that there is a need for public health measures, increasing booster vaccination coverage in response to current and new infec - tions waves driven by variants and developing approximately protec-tive vaccines to confront virus development. Wardhani and co-work-ers [11] identified in their study the potential benefits of therapeutic plasma exchange in reducing the risk of mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients. These evidences were confirmed by other works recently published [4,13,19,25]. There is evidence to understand the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 which will lay the foundation for the development of new therapies. However, specific and non-specific immunotherapies are widely performed to treat patients with severe COVID-19, without any definitive evidence to suggest the effective - ness of these treatments. We continue using the vaccines as the one way to barrier the advance of the coronavirus. Conclusion By a long time in the future the humanity will be subject the action of coronavirus between us, but the use of vaccines, with their prop- erties to combat the virus inside the human body, are a secure way to stop the advance of this disease.
