INTRODUCTION Metabolic disorders can appear to be a frustratingly complex group of disorders to master. Many individual disorders have clinical presentations that initiallyseem very similar to one anot her. In addition, classi cation systems can be difcult to apply because of the multitude and variety of metabolic pathways involved. This review serves as an update of previously published information (1)(2)(3) and attempts to impose a basic classi cation framework and diagnostic approach that can be applied by the general pediatrician or primary pediatricclinician in the initial triage and identi cation of metabolic diseases.AUTHOR DISCLOSURE Dr Rice has disclosed that he is a site principal investigator for BioMarin Pharmaceutical and that he is a collaborator on and receives support fromFDA grant R01 FD003711-01A1.

Vol. 37 No. 1 JANUARY 2016 3 by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from The classi cation groups disorders into those caused by defects in the metabolism of energy sources (lipids, proteins, or carbohydrate) and those caused by dysfunction in pathways within cellular organelles (mitochondria, peroxisome, lyso- some). Metabolic disorders caused by defects in protein metabolism include the amino acidopathies, organic acid- emias, and urea cycle disorders. Disorders of lipid metab- olism encompass defects in fatty acid b-oxidation and the carnitine shuttle. Carbohydrate disorders include galacto-semia and glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) among others.Lysosomal storage disorders are due to an inability to digest or recycle large complex macromolecules and may presentwith variable features, dependi ng on the enzymatic block, that may include \"coarse \"facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and developmental regression. Energy source problems include defects in protein, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism (Table). Many of these disor- ders can be detected in modern newborn screening (NBS) programs. In fact, with the addition of tandem mass spec- trometry (which includes acylcarnitine pro le and amino acid TABLE.

Because many of these condi-tions are treatable, their early detection and diagnosis can be lifesaving. Of note, no test has perfect sensitivity, and although NBS has excellent detection rates for many condi- tions, individuals can be missed. Further, milder presenta- tions of classically severe metabolic disorders can present later in life. Therefore, the clinician must continue to include these disorders in the differential diagnosis of a sick child, despite advances in NBS. Many of the conditions related to defects in energy sources can be detected by several simple laboratory tests. BASIC LABORATORY EVALUATIONS 1. Electrolyte panel, including bicarbonate. This simple test, which is available in all hospitals and many out-patient settings, allows for the evaluation of acid-base status to determine the anion gap. Metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap is seen in the organic acid- emias such as propionic acidemia. 2. Blood glucose. All children with changes in mental status and acute illness should have blood glucosemeasured. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia (HKHG) is the primary metabolic derangement in disorders of fatty acid oxidation. 3. Ammonia. Elevated ammonia concentrations can cause acute encephalopathy. In some cases, elevated plasma ammonia may be the only clue to the presence of a metabolic disorder. Hyperammonemia requires emer- gent intervention because a lack of treatment can result in permanent brain injury and death. Metabolically,hyperammonemia is seen primarily with urea cycle disorders and organic acidemias. In the absence of suspicion that prompts testing, hyperammonemia can be easy to miss because ammonia testing is not part of routine chemistry panels, often there is no acidosis, and there may be no clues other than clinical status (eg, lethargy, obtundation, and coma). Ammonia values may be spuriously elevated due to venous compression from tourniquet use or improper specimen handling. It isimportant to obtain a free- flowing sample when possible. Also, the specimen should be placed on ice at the bedsideand immediately transported to the laboratory. Elevated values should be rapidly con rmed by a repeat specimen. Hyperammonemia is a medical emergency that requiresthe laboratory to test the sample immediately upon receipt. Whenever a result is not available within 1 hour, the accuracy of the result should be questioned becausethis could indicate that the sample sat before analysis, which could lead to spuriously elevated values. 4. Urine ketones. Ketosis/ketonuria is a prominent feature of some metabolic disorders, such as organic acidemias.Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOD) hyperinsu- linism cause hypoketotic hypoglycemia. 5. Lactate. Elevated lactate is most commonly a marker of hypoxia and poor tissue perfusion. However, mito- chondrial disorders are often associated with elevated blood or cerebrospinal fluid lactate in an elevated ratio to pyruvate ( >20). SPECIFIC BIOCHEMICAL LABORATORY EVALUATIONS 1. Plasma amino acids (PAA). Speci c elevations or char- acteristic patterns in amino acids are seen in amino acidopathies such as phenylketonuria (PKU), tyrosinemia, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and several of the urea cycle disorders (eg, citrullinemia, argininosuccinic aciduria). Also, some organic acidemias are characterized by elevations in the amino acid glycine. 2. Urine organic acids (UOA): Organic acidemias can be diagnosed by characteristic patterns of elevated organicacid metabolites in the urine, but this test can also be used to support the diagnosis of other types of disorders, such as FAOD and amino acidopathies. The UOA test is most sensitive when performed while the patient is in a catabolic state, such as fasting or illness. 3. Plasma acylcarnitine (PAC) pro le: This pro le can be helpful in the diagnosis of FAOD, and characteristic patterns are seen for most organic acidemias. The PAC proles carbon chains linked (esteri ed) with acylcarnitines ed in this assay and can indicate speci c conditions. For example, elevations in medium-chainacylcarnitines (C6-C10) are indicative of medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) whereas 3- or 5-carbon acylcarnitines (C3 or C5acylcarnitines) are seen in some organic acidemias. The PAC pro le has allowed for detection of most FAOD and organic acidemias on a single plasma sample or blood spot, which has revolutionized metabolic disease diag- nosis and newborn screening. 4. Carnitine analysis: This test evaluates the concentrations of free and total carnitine and carnitine esters (un- fractionated acylcarnitines) in the plasma or urine. Mark- edly low plasma free carnitine values can be seen in primary carnitine de ciency, a treatable disorder of carnitine uptake. Elevated carnitine esters (acylcarnitines) can Vol. 37 No. 1 JANUARY 2016 5 by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from occur in any metabolic disorder that in accu- mulation acidemias, FOADs, and ketosis). Plasma carnitine values are usually more helpful than urine values. 5. Newborn screening: Many disorders of intermediate metabolism are detected by tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitine pro le and amino acid analysis) on new- born dried blood spots, including most FAOD, someurea cycle disorders (citrullinemia and argininosuccinic aciduria), and c analyte detection of galactosemia andbiotinidase de ciencies. As with any screening test, false- negative results can occur, and some disorders, such as ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) de ciency, are not currently part of the screen. Therefore, clinicians shouldstill consider the possibility of metabolic disorders, even in the context of a negative NBS result. Some states have begun screening for lysosomal disor- ders, including Pompe disease, and there is ongoing dis- cussion about adding other lysosomal conditions in the future. The National Newborn Screening & Global ResourceCenter website (http://genes-r-us.uthscsa.edu) provides a complete list of conditions screened in each state, and the Screening, Technology and Research in Genetics (STAR-G) Project (http://www.newbornscreening.info) offers detailed clinician and parental handouts on each condition. PROTEIN METABOLISM DISORDERS These disorders include amino acidopathies, organic acid- emias, and urea cycle disorders. When most amino acids are metabolized, the initial step is deamination, which removesthe amine group and leaves ammonia and an organic acid. If an enzymatic block occurs in this initial step, that particular amino acid accumulates in the blood and urine. PKU is one example of such a block in which phenylalanine accumu- lates. If the block is in metabolism of the residual organic acid, the offending organic acid accumulates and an organic acidemia ensues. Finally, if the block is in the urea cycle, ammonia cannot be metabolized to urea and excreted, result- ing in hyperammonemia. Laboratory diagnosis of these con-ditions relies primarily on three tests: plasma ammonia (NH4), PAA, analysis, and UOA analysis. Urine amino acids (UAA) analysis is sometimes useful as an ancillary test. Amino Acidopathies Amino acidopathies are autosomal recessive genetic condi-tions resulting from an enzymatic block that prevents metabolism of speci c amino acids (Figure), which leadsto their accumulation in the blood and urine. This is a heterogeneous group of disorders because the variousamino acids have very different toxic and pathogenic effects on varying tissues. All can be diagnosed with the combina- tion of PAA and UOA analysis. Phenylketonuria. ciency phenyl- hydroxylase (PAH), the tyrosine. Tetrahy- in this reaction. Population-based NBS for PKU is performed in all states in the United States via tandem mass spectrometry, which shows elevated concentrations of phe and low tyrosine. Subsequent diagnostic testing revels elevated phe on PAAanalysis and elevated phenylketones on UOA. When PKU is untreated, phe and phenylketones silently accumulate, caus- ing permanent brain injury. Untreated infants develop microcephaly, global developmental delay, and eczematous rash. Early detection and treatment are very effective in preventing intellectual disability, but adults who stop the diet are still at risk for mood and cognitive disorders, including diminished executive function. (4) Therefore, lifelong treatment is advocated. Phe is a powerful teratogen;fetal exposure to increased concentrations in utero may result in \"maternal PKU syndrome, \"which consists of dysmorphic facial characteristics, microcephaly, intrauter-ine growth restriction, and congenital heart disease. Exposed children may have inte llectual disability or learn- ing disabilities. Therefore, women who have PKU shouldattempt to have their phe conce ntrations well-controlled before pregnancy and must maintain strict control of suchconcentrations throughout the duration of pregnancy. This can be dif cult to achieve if the pregnancy is unexpected or the prospective mother has been off the PKU diet. Accord- ingly, preconception counseling is imperative. Treatment of PKU requires strict lifelong restriction of phe via dietary protein restriction and supplementation with phe-free protein-containing medical foods/beverages to prevent protein de ciency. Blood phe concentrations must be monitored regularly and dietary protein intakeadjusted accordingly. BH4 supplementation is a relatively new therapy that has variable ef cacy; it helps to lower plasma phe concentrations in some patients but usually does not replace the low-phe diet. A small number of patients who have abnormal NBS results indicating elevated phe have a more severe disorder that is due to a defect in BH4 metabolism rather than PAH deciency. Phe is only mildly elevated in these patients, but they develop dystonia due to central dopamine de ciency. Treatment consists of dopamine and biopterin supplemen- tation as well as more complex therapeutic strategies. 6 Pediatrics in Review by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Maple Syrup Urine Disease. MSUD is due to a de ciency in the enzyme branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the second step the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) isoleucine, valine, and leucine. The condition affects all ethnic groups but is most common among the Old Order Mennonites. In the United States, all states screen for MSUD by tandem mass spectrometry. Diagnostic testing shows elevated leucine, leucine, on PAA analysis andcharacteristic acids on UOA analysis. The severe form of MSUD often presents within the rst postnatal week. The neonate frequently has diminished arousal andfeeds poorly; if treatment is not initiated quickly, hyperto- nicity, coma, and death occur within hours. High leucine concentrations cause these effects. Patients with MSUD may have little evidence of meta- bolic acidosis or ketosis during an acute episode. Cerumen and urine may smell like maple syrup, but only when leucine is markedly elevated. Therefore, this nding should not be relied on for screening. Affected patients develop acute episodes of metabolic decompensation associated with high leucine intake or catabolic stressors (febrile illness, prolonged fasting) throughout life. Affected patients are well between episodes, but when leucine concentrations rise, they develop headache, confusion, hallucinations, leth- argy, and vomiting, which progress to coma and deathwithout treatment. Acute metabolic decompensation isrelated to the neurotoxic effects leucinemia; interestingly, valine and isoleucine are not neurotoxic. Management during an episode of decompensation includes: stopping all leucine intake, administering high- dextrose content (5) BCAA-free parenteral nutrition can beordered from specialty pharmacies and allows for the delivery of protein without leucine. Patients with MSUD should never receive hypotonic fluids because cerebral edema in these patients can be fatal. Rapid reductions in serum osmolalitymust be strictly avoided, and serum sodium concentrations should be maintained in the high-normal range. In some cases, hypertonic saline and mannitol are indicated to prevent hyponatremia and resultant cerebral edema. Dialysis has been employed as an emergency rescue therapy, but proper and aggressive metabolic therapy can obviate the need for dialysis. Management of hyperleucinemia is complex and requires admission to the pediatric intensive care unit and the involve-ment of a metabolic expert familiar with the acute manage- ment of MSUD. Chronic management involves strict dietary restriction of leucine. Early identi cation via NBS before the initial episode and tight lifelong metabolic control result ingood outcomes, although unexpected late and devastatingFigure.

Liver transplantation has been an effective option for some patients and can help toprevent recurrent metabolic decompensations. (6) A milder, intermittent form of MSUD exists in which patients have recurrent episodes of altered mental status due to hyperleucinemia associated with illness or excessive protein intake. Between episodes they are well and may have normal PAA analysis results. Homocystinuria. Classic homocystinuria is caused by a deciency in cystathionine b-synthetase. Laboratory testing shows marked elevations of homocystine in the blood andurine and methionine elevations on NBS and PAA. The condition is not associated with acute metabolic decompen-sation but may result in intellectual disability, tall stature, osteoporosis, recurrent thrombosis, and ectopia lentis (lens dislocation). Homocystinuria may be considered in the differential diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. A minority of patients responds to pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and a trial of high-dose vitamin B6 should be given if this is a possibility. Management includes betaine, which helps to decrease plasma homocystine concentrations, and aspirin to prevent stroke. Dietary methionine restriction and B vitamin sup-plements are also used. Tyrosinemia. Hepatorenal tyrosinemia (also known as tyrosinemia type 1) is due to a defect in the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase (FAH). This de ciency results in accu- mulation blood tyrosine and urine succinylacetone, elevationof which is pathognomonic for the condition. NBS involves the detection of succinylacetone by tandem mass spectrom- etry. Blood tyrosine may also be elevated on NBS dried blood spots, but this test lacks sensitivity and speci city for the condition because infants may have elevated tyrosine con-centrations related to hepatic immaturity or other milderforms of tyrosinemia. In addition, normal tyrosine values can be seen in infants who have hepatorenal tyrosinemia in the newborn period. Plasma methionine is often more dramatically elevated than tyrosine, and elevations in both are likely due to secondary liver disease rather than the specic enzyme de ciency. Con rmation of the condition relies on UOA with a speci c request for succinylacetone and PAA for elevated tyrosine and methionine. DNA testing of the FAH gene can be helpful in con rmation. When untreated, hepatorena l tyrosinemia typically results in liver failure during infancy or early childhood.Renal tubular acidosis and recurrent episodes of neuro- pathic pain can also occur. Nitisinone, along with dietary tyrosine restriction, is an effective treatment and may obvi- ate the need for liver transplantation. Hyperglycinemia. Another amino acidopathy is nonketo- tic hyperglycinemia, a typically lethal de ciency in glycinecleavage that results in elevated cerebrospinal fluid glycine leading to neonatal seizures, hiccups, and apnea. Organic Acidemias Organic acids are the deaminated remains of amino acids.Defects in their degradation result in their massive accu- mulation in the blood and urine, leading to metabolic acidosis. Affected infants develop poor feeding, tachypnea, vomiting, and lethargy in the rst few days after birth. NBS is helpful in identifying some neonates before the initialepisode, but others may present in crisis before NBS results become available. NBS by tandem An organic acidemia is clinically suggested by metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. Con rma- tion of disease is based on UOA analysis, which reveals acharacteristic pattern of abnormal organic acids, and acyl- carnitine pro le and carnitine analysis are helpful. All of the common organic acidemias are inherited in an autosomalrecessive pattern. Treatment during an episode includes stopping all pro- tein intake, administering high-dose carnitine supplements,and promoting an in normal saline), lipid emulsions, and in some cases, insulin. Intravenous bicar-bonate to correct the acidosis is often necessary. Some defects are partially or completely amenable to cofactor therapy with vitamins (eg, biotin for biotinidase de ciency and vitamin B12 for some forms of methylmalonic acid-emia). The profoundly ill child with an organic acidemia may require hemodialysis, which can be lifesaving, correct profound metabolic acidosis or hyperam- monemia. Long-term treatment requires restriction of theoffending amino acids via protein restriction and supple- mentation with metabolic formulas. Carnitine and cofactor supplementation are also given. Some minor illness can be managed at home with use of a sick day protocol, which often includes monitoring of urine ketones, decreased dietary protein intake, increased dietary calorie intake, and a local emergency department triage plan. Propionic Acidemia. Propionic acidemia is caused by a defect in the enzyme propionyl CoA carboxylase, whichleads and NBS show an elevated C3 acylcarnitine, and PAA analysis may show elevated glycine. Classically, patients present in the newborn period with overwhelming metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap. The newborn may have prominent ketosis, which is an otherwise rare feature in the rst 8 Pediatrics in Review by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from postnatal weeks. Ammonia concentrations may be markedly elevated, but the presence of profound metabolic acidosismakes this condition easy to distinguish from urea cycle disorders. Low blood pH can lead to multiorgan dysfunc- tion, including cardiac and respiratory failure. Pancytopenia and pancreatitis can occur during an episode. Brain injury, including stroke, often accompanies severe metabolic de- compensations, which can lead to permanent intellectual disability or movement disorders. Recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and decompensation can occur with illness, fasting, or excessive protein intake. Elevated urine ketones are an early sign of metabolic crisis. Liver trans- plantation may decrease the frequency of recurrent metaboliccrisis. Late-onset cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysrhythmia Acidemia. Classically, methylmalonic acid- emia in the enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase, which is the step immediately followingpropionyl CoA carboxylase in threonine. Methylmalonic acide- mias can due to several defects in cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolism, some of which also cause elevations inhomocysteine. In the classic form, this condition presents in the newborn period similarly to propionic acidemia, with acidosis, ketosis, and hyperammonemia. UOA acid methylcitrate; acylcarnitines and NBS show elevated C3 acylcarnitine. Plasma alanine and glycine values are often elevated on PAA testing, and a speci c, widely available test is plasma MMA, which shows marked elevations. Metabolic crisis can cause str oke, resultant intellectual disability, and movement disorder. Many patients have recur-rent episodes of metabolic acidosis due to illness, catabolicstress, or excessive protein intake throughout life. Late-onset complications include renal disease, which often necessitates transplantation in adolescence or adulthood. Milder variants of methylmalonic acidemia also exist, some of which may present in adulthood. Speci cs of management depend on the enzyme defect. They generally include dietary restriction of the offend-ing amino acids; administrati on of vitamin B12 with speci c form, dosing, and route of admini stration; and administration of carnitine. Organ transplantation can be very effective, as inmany other inborn errors of metabolism. In this case, liver or combined liver and kidney transplantation is undertaken. Glutaric Acidemia. Glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA1) is due to a defect in enzyme glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase, which is involved in the metabolism of the amino acids tryptophan and lysine. The condition is more common in Amish individuals but can occur in any ethnic group. GA1 is asevere \"cerebral \"organic acidemia, metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and hyper-ammonemia may not be present during an acute episode. Unfortunately, there is no easily obtainable marker of met- abolic decompensation in this condition; initiation of met- abolic care is based on results of the child 'sp h y s i c a l examination and history. Patients have been known todevelop permanent basal ganglia injury and resulting move- ment disorder following a fever associated with a mild ill- ness. Therefore, the aggressive use of dextrose-containing fluids is indicated for any febrile illness. GA1 is a target of NBS, which shows elevated plasma C5 dicarboxylic (C5DC) acylcarnitine in most affected individuals.Diagnostic testing may elevated urine glutaric and 3-OH glutaric acid on UOA analysis, and C5DC acylcarnitine may be elevated on plasma or urine a cylcarnitine analysis. Some affected patients, known as \"low excretors, \"have normal blood and urine metabolite testing results, which can make diagnosis challenging. DNA testing of the GCDH gene can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis in these patients. Clinically, affected children often exhibit macrocephaly but are well until a catabolic crisis occurs. A febrile illness can be neurologically devastating, resulting in dystonia and movement disorders. Neuroimaging may reveal basal gan- glia injury in the survivors of a crisis. Subdural hematomas can occur and have been mistaken for child abuse. Chronic management consists of carnitine supplemen- tation and dietary lysine and tryptophan restriction, but perhaps most important is avoidance of catabolism during routine illnesses by administration of glucose-containing fluids. Aggressive sick day management with dextrose-containing fluids can prevent the neurologic sequelae. The prognosis is excellent for children who avoid brain injury until age 6 years because GA1 is unlikely to result in permanent brain injury after this age. (8)(9) Other Organic Acidemias. Other organic acidemias screened for on NBS and diagnosable UOA analysis include isovaleric acidemia and biotinidase de ciency. Urea Cycle Disorders Hyperammonemia. The urea cycle disposes of toxic ammo- nia from the deamination of amino acids by converting it tonontoxic urea for renal excretion. If the urea cycle is dys- functional, ammonia accumulates in the blood, leading to altered mental status, lethargy, vomiting, cerebral edema,and ultimately coma and death. Hyperammonemic enceph- alopathy can be rapidly fatal and is a medical emergency. Unlike the organic acidemias, severe metabolic acidosis is not is a prominent nding; some ill patients have mild Vol. 37 No. 1 JANUARY 2016 9 by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from acidosis related to dehydration and shock. Prolonged fast- ing and moderate illness with poor oral intake or fever canprovoke a hyperammonemic crisis due to catabolism and increased proteolysis. Similarly, excessive protein intake results in increased production of ammonia and resultant encephalopathy. Severe forms may present in the rst hours after birth. Recurrent unrecognized episodes canlead to global developmental delay, spasticity, and intellec- tual disability. Milder forms may present later in life with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and recurrent vom- iting or protein aversion. Any child with unexplained acute encephalopathy, recurrent episodes of lethargy and vomit- ing, or failure to thrive with protein aversion should haveammonia measured. This might be the only marker of the disease. Evaluation for hyperammonemia includes liver function tests, electrolytes, U OA analysis (for orotic acid), and PAA analysis. Hyperammonemia can also result fromvalproic acid administration or liver dysfunction, so pa- tients should be evaluated for these conditions as well. Treatment of hyperammonemic encephalopathy must be implemented immediately and includes cessation of protein intake and reduction of catabolic stress. Intravenous 10%dextrose in normal saline and an intravenous lipid emulsion infusion should be started to provide protein-free energy. Central venous access should be established for the delivery of arginine hydrochloride with sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate once hyperammonemia is con rmed. This treatment should always be supervised by a metabolicdisease specialist. Care should be taken to avoid hypona- tremia, which can increase the risk of developing cerebral edema. Infants whose initial presentation is severe hyper- ammonemia may require hemodialysis, and the time spent in coma correlates with outcome, so preparation for dialysisshould begin immediately upon diagnosis in infants. Long- term treatment includes dietary protein restriction, arginine or citrulline supplementation (depending on the de - ciency), sodium or glycerol phenylbutyrate, and sick daymanagement with an emergency department protocol. Liver transplantation reduces episodes of recurrent hyperammonemia. (10) Ornithine Transcarbamylase De ciency. OTC de ciency results in recurrent episodes of hyperammonemia associ-ated with catabolic stress (illness, fasting, labor and delivery) or excessive protein intake. This condition is not universally screened for in newborns; a negative NBS result in most states does not rule out this condition. Testing during a catabolic episode reveals elevated plasma ammonia, and PAA analysis often shows elevated glutamine (a storage form of ammonia) with decreased citrulline and arginine. UOA analysis in affected males documents elevated oroticacid, although this test result may be negative in well- compensated males and many female heterozygotes. Whenordering UOA for patients in whom OTC de ciency is suspected, clinicians should specify that orotic acid identi-cation is desired. DNA testing of the OTC gene con rms the diagnosis. Even though this is an X-linked condition,females can be affected, with a range from severe disease to asymptomatic. Some female heterozygotes and mildly affected males choose to avoid high-protein foods, likely due to the accumulation of toxic ammonia, which may result in failure to thrive during childhood. Female heterozygotes may also present with hyperammonemia during the imme- diate postpartum period when the protein turnover frominvolution of the uterus and the catabolic stress of delivery is high. Long-term treatment typically includes citrulline supple- mentation, dietary protein restriction, and oral sodium or glycerol phenylbutyrate. Liver transplant is effective in pre- venting recurrent episodes of hyperammonemia. (8) Other Urea Cycle Disorders. Other urea cycle disorders include citrullinemia, argininosuccinic aciduria, and car- bamyl phosphate synthetase 1 de ciencies, all of which are autosomal recessive and present with recurrent episodes of hyperammonemia. CPS 1 is not associated with elevated urine orotic acid. All United States states perform NBS for citrullinemia and argininosuccinic aciduria. LIPID METABOLISM DISORDERS Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders FAOD are caused by defects in the b-oxidation of fatty acids or derangement of carnitine metabolism. The key clinical feature of these disorders is a propensity to HKHG withprolonged fasting. During fasting, blood glucose from a recent meal is used, followed by breakdown of hepatic glycogen stores to maintain normal blood glucose concen- trations. As glycogen becomes depleted, gluconeogenesis (GNG) is initiated to maintain normal blood glucose con- centrations. GNG receives the energy for glucose biosyn- thesis from oxidation of fatty acids. Patients with FAOD cannot fully metabolize fatty acids and, therefore, cannot release their stored energy. Further, production of free acetylCoA required for manufacture of ketone bodies is dimin- ished, which leads to HKHG. If FAOD are undiagnosed, the rst hypoglycemic episode may occur in infancy or early childhood when the child has a prolonged fast in the context of an intercurrent illness. The presenting sign may be sudden death or severe HKHG, resulting in brain injury and seizure. The brain is particu- larly sensitive to HKHG because it relies on ketone body 10 Pediatrics in Review by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from utilization for energy during times of hypoglycemia. NBS has allowed for diagnosis before the initial episode in mostcases, thereby prompting treatment and parental education, with the goal of preventing brain injury and disability. The treatment of FAOD includes parental education to avoid prolonged fasting, particularly during an illness, and the use of intravenous dextrose-containing fluids to prevent hypoglycemia if the child cannot feed well due to illness orinjury. An emergency department protocol outlining the condition and treatment should be given to all families of affected children. Supplemental carnitine may be pre- scribed. Long-chain FAOD (LCFAOD) are with fatty acids and acetyl CoA, whichcan be used to provide energy for GNG and ketone body formation. Prolonged fasting during an intercurrent illness triggers hypoglycemic episodes. During an illness with poor oral intake, a child 's liver glycogen is depleted. When a prolonged fast is superimposed on this state, GNG cannot maintain adequate blood glucose concentrations due to defective b-oxidation of fatty acids. Children develop nor- mally, but an unprevented initial episode of HKHG mayresult in sudden death or permanent brain injury. The clinical presentation of MCAD de ciency is related to the effects of HKHG and includes altered mental status,lethargy, and ultimately seizure and death. MCAD de ciency is the most common of the FAOD and is typically found on NBS by blood spot acylcarnitine anal- ysis, a diagnosis that occurs before the onset of the rst episode. However, some infants present on the second or third postnatal day, which is too early for NBS to be helpful. NBS and con rmatory diagnostic PAC pro le shows hexanoylglycine and suberylglycine. Parental education about avoiding fasting during inter- current illness is the most important intervention. Many children receive carnitine supplementation. Patients are given emergency department protocols that explain the condition and treatment. If children avoid HKHG episodesduring the rst several years after birth, normal develop- ment is expected and the prognosis is excellent. Long-chain Fatty Acid result in rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, liver dysfunction, andrecurrent HKHG, even with appropriate treatment. LCHADmay also result in retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Both conditions are screened for in NBS, but the sensitivity ofthis screening test is not 100%. Therefore, clinicians should remain vigilant for these disorders in children who have suggestive clinical histories, even if NBS results are normal. Diagnosis is by PAC pro le, which shows elevated unsatu- rated long-chain acylcarnitines biochemical abnormalities in these disorders (par-ticularly VLCAD) can be minimal or nonexistent when a child is well, DNA testing or enzymology is often required to con rm the diagnosis. Treatment involves dietary fat restriction and supplemen- tation with medium-chain triglyceride oil to provide themuscle with a usable source of energy from fat. To prevent HKHG, patients must avoid fasting during intercurrent illnesses, similar to MCAD de ciency. Thus, parental edu- cation is vital. If a patient is unable to take suf cient energy by mouth, intravenous administration of dextrose-containing fluids should be initiated. Carnitine supplementation is c ontroversial. Regular cardiac evaluations are indicated and creatine kinase (CK) should be followed during illness.Competitive and isometric sports must be restricted for many patients due to recurrent exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. Primary Carnitine De ciency. Primary carnitine de - ciency is a rare autosomal disorder caused by a defect in the OCTN2 carnitine transporter, which leads to systemic depletion of carnitine due to both diminished intestinal absorption and renal reabso rption. The condition is screened for on NBS, and the diagnosis is based on thending of markedly low blood free carnitine concentrations with elevated urine carnitine excretion. DNA testing can be used to con rm the diagnosis. Untreated patients develop cardiomyopathy and recurrent episodes of HKHG. Reye-like encephalopathy can o ccur. Treatment with high- dose carnitine supplementation appears to preventcardiomyopathy. Other Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders. Other FAOD that are screened for by NBS and can be diagnosed on PAC analysis include carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and mul- tiple acyl-CoA acid-emia type 2) de ciencies. CARBOHYDRATE DISORDERS Classic galactosemia is due to a de ciency in the enzyme uridyltransferase (GALT), which leadsto accumulation galactose The initiation of lactose (glu cose and galactose)-based Vol. 37 No. 1 JANUARY 2016 11 by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from feedings in the newborn who has galactosemia leads rapidly to metabolic decompensation, with liver dysfunction, jaun-dice, and coagulopathy. Escherichia coli sepsis and cataracts can occur. Because initial symptoms may begin in the rst few postnatal days, treatment must begin without delay. Late-diagnosed infants who survive the initial episode of metabolic decomposition often develop intellectual disabil- ity. Due to NBS, the natural course of classic galactosemia is rarely observed today, but even with early detection, appro- priate treatment, and excellent control, many still develop tremor, speci c learning disabilities, and speech/language decits. Even with early and optimal treatment, most af- fected females develop ovarian failure, often requiringestrogen replacement in adolescence. All states currently screen for galactosemia on NBS. Conrmation is via GALT enzyme ac tivity and blood galactose- 1-phosphate values. DNA testing can be helpful to look formilder mutations, which are associated with an excellent prognosis, such as the Duarte variant. Chronic management is based on lifelong dietary restric- tion of galactose. Such restriction should be initiated imme- diately upon receipt of abnormal NBS results becausetreatment delays result in clinical morbidity. Affected school-age children should be screened for speech and learning disabilities. GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISORDERS Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) result from the inability to degrade stored glycogen in the liver and muscle. Hepatic (GSD 1) forms primarily cause fasting hypoglycemia, whereas muscular (GSD V) forms result in recurrent rhabdomyolysis. GSD type 1a (also known as von Gierke disease) is due to deciency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which results in massive hepatomegaly, growth failure, and recur- rent episodes of ketotic hypoglycemia, often presenting in infancy. Patients have elevated lactic and uric acids and triglycerides. Frequent doses of cornstarch or continuous gastrostomy feedings are required to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia. Late complications include malignant trans- formation of hepatic adenomas, hypertension, and renal insuf ciency. GSD type 1b is additionally associated with neutropenia, frequent infections, and in flammatory bowel disease. Treatment can be very successful but requirescareful follow-up. GSD type V (also known as McArdle disease) results from a defect in the enzyme myophosphorylase. Onset is usually in adolescence and is characterized by exercise- induced muscle pain, fatigue, and rhabdomyolysis. Myo- globinuria and resultant renal injury can occur. Muscle painand fatigue develop within a few minutes of starting to exercise, followed by a \"second wind \"phenomenon in which the patient brie fly feels better. Patients have markedly elevated CK concentrations following exercise. Diagnosis isoften by muscle biopsy, which demonstrates de cient myo- phosphorylase activity on enzymatic analysis and glycogenaccumulation within the myocytes. DNA analysis of the PYGM gene may be the best method for diagnosis and obviates the need for biopsy. Avoidance of strenuous aero-bic and isometric exercise is recommended. However, the patient should also avoid deconditioning by participating in light aerobic activity as tolerated. Among the several other important carbohydrate disor- ders are other GSDs; hereditary fructose intolerance, acondition that results in vomiting and liver dysfunction following ingestion of sucrose or fructose (children often avoid sweets and classically have an absence of dental caries); and glycogen synthase de ciency (GSD 0), a con- dition that results from the inability to form hepatic glyco-gen and leads to recurrent ketotic hypoglycemia without hepatomegaly. LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS The lysosome is a cellular organelle digests largecomplex macromolecules for recycling or degradation. Lyso- somal storage disorders are progressive conditions related to the accumulation of these large macromolecules (muco- polysaccharides, sphingolipi ds, oligosaccharides) within vulnerable tissues. The lysosome can be thought of as abag of individual enzymes, each dedicated to degradation of a particular macromolecule. When a lysosomal enzyme is decient, the macromolecule that it normally digests accu- mulates within the cell, leading to space occupation and cellular dysfunction. Many of these disorders are character- ized by progressive involvement of the liver, spleen, brain, or bones related to accumulation of the undigested materials in these tissues. Clinical features are speci c to the particular disorder but may include hepatosplenomegaly, bony defor-mity, developmental regression, sensory loss (hearing and vison), and coarse facial characteristics. Most of these con- ditions have an autosomal recessive inheritance, exceptFabry disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter disease), which are X-linked. Because the conditions can have signi cant phenotypic overlap, urine metabolite screening tests can be helpful in the initial evaluation.Speci cally, urine glycosaminoglycan (GAG) analysis for mucopolysaccharidoses and urine oligosaccharides are use-ful screening tests for lysosomal disorders. Ultimately, the laboratory diagnosis involves demonstration of enzymatic 12 Pediatrics in Review by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from deciency in lymphocytes or broblasts and, more recently, DNA testing. from accumu- lation of polysaccharide-based macromolecules (GAGs) in tissues. Classically, children appear normal at birth and develop progressive symptomology over subsequent years. Coarsened facial features, bony deformity, developmental regression, and visceromegaly are typical. Diagnosis is initially by urinary GAG analysis and con rmed by enzyme analysis or DNA. Skeletal radiographs may show the char-acteristic dysostosis multiplex appearance. Several of the disorders now have treatments available, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (MPS I, II, IV, VI), and hema-topoietic stem cell transplantation may be therapeutic for some of the disorders that have central nervous system involvement and are not currently amenable to treatment with ERT. MPS I (Hurler syndrome) involves progressive coarsen- ing of facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, corneal cloud- ing, bony deformity, and developmental regression. Without treatment, the condition is fatal. Due to the ef cacy of ERT and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), some have argued for inclusion of this condition on the expanded NBS. MPS II (Hunter syndrome) is similar to MPS I but without corneal clouding. MPS I and II both have milder forms without developmental regression that are amenable to ERT, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier. How- ever, ERT is sometimes used in the severe forms with brain involvement to temporize progression and potentially improve the quality of life. MPS III (San lippo syndrome) is primarily a neurodegenerative condition that results inslow developmental regression, with death often in the second decade of life. The visceral and bony manifestationsare less prominent than in other MPS disorders. Children often present with behavioral and attention issues before the onset of motor and cognitive regression. MPS IV differs from the other conditions, with characteristic and often severe bony involvement and short stature. Finally, MPS VI is very similar to MPS I but never has developmental regression. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a de ciency in the enzyme b-hexosaminidase A. The enzymatic accu- mulation of the sphingolipid GM2 ganglioside in vulnerable tissues. Diagnosis is by DNA analysis of the HEXA gene or enzyme assay of b-hexosaminidase A in leukocytes. Tay-Sachs disease is more common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, but it can be seen in any ethnic group. Symptoms usually begin in early infancy with weakness and an exaggerated startle re flex. Myoclonic jerks and develop- mental regression also occur early in the course of disease. Afunduscopic examination reveals cherry red spots on themaculae of most infants. The disorder progresses quickly,with vision loss, progressive macrocephaly, seizures, spas- ticity, and unresponsiveness to the environment. Viscero- megaly does not occur. There is no effective treatment and Tay-Sachs disease is usually fatal by age 4 years. Carrier screening programs have reduced the incidence among Ashkenazi Jews. Fabry disease is due to a-galactosidase de ciency. In males, the condition presents in late childhood or early adolescence with episodes of acroparesthesias (painful hands and feet) or recurrent abdominal pain. Female het- erozygotes may also present with abdominal pain in ado-lescence or early adulthood. Untreated patients develop proteinuria and resultant renal insuf ciency, often requir- ing dialysis and ultimately renal transplantation. Femalesmay develop renal insuf ciency on average about 10 years later than males, although some females have few symp-toms and may not develop kidney disease. Other associated features include reduced sweating, angiokeratomas of the skin, early arthrosclerosis and stroke, and cardiac hyper- trophy. Diagnosis can be made by demonstration of low a- galactosidase enzyme activity in males. DNA testing can also be helpful, particularly in females in whom enzyme testing is not useful because they may show near-normal enzyme activity. ERT is available for treatment. Gaucher disease type 1 is due to lysosomal b-glucocer - ebrosidase de ciency. The condition results in massive accumulation of glucocerebroside in the liver, spleen, andbone marrow. Gaucher is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Features include anemia and thrombocytopenia due to marrow obliteration and splenic sequestration, hepatosple nomegaly, and bone pain. The brain is not affected, altho ugh Parkinsonism has been recently shown to be associated with Gaucher disease.(11) ERTand substrate inhibitors are available for treatment. Neuropathic variants (types 2 and 3) also exist. Type 2 is associated with early onset, rapid, and severe neurodegen- eration in childhood, and type 3 is associated with ocular and neuromotor dysfunction, often with severe visceral signs of Gaucher disease in childhood. Krabbe disease is due to de ciency in the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. The condition results in infan-tile neurodegeneration. Infants present in the rst few post- natal months with increasing muscle tone and profoundirritability. Recurrent fevers without source can been seen. The infant develops seizures, vision loss, and developmen- tal regression, with death often occurring before 12 months of age. Diagnosis is by enzyme assay or DNA analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid protein is often markedly Vol. 37 No. 1 JANUARY 2016 13 by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from elevated. HSCT has been used in Krabbe disease with mixed results. Milder, late-onset forms of Krabbe diseasealso exist. Pompe disease (GSD II) is due to a de ciency in the enzyme acid a-glucosidase (GAA) that results in accumu- lation of glycogen in lysosome of muscle cells. Classi-cally, this condition pres ents in early infancy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, shortened P-R interval onelectrocardiography, and skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness. CK values are elevated. Heart failure, respiratory insuf ciency, and death occur without treatment. ERT is available and is most ef cacious if started before cardiac function deteriorates. Therefore, Pompe disease is beingadded to NBS. Milder forms of the condition may present with muscle weakness and elevated CK values later in childhood or adulthood. Diagnosis is by demonstration of GAA enzyme de ciency on blood spot or broblasts or by DNA analysis. PEROXISOMAL DISORDERS The peroxisome is a cellular organelle with disparate tions, including of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Defects in peroxisomal function or assembly can result in several severe neurodegenerative disorders. These conditions are not included in NBS and may present with severe infantile hypotonia, skeletal dysplasia, sensory decits (hearing and vision loss), hepatomegaly, or neuro- logic regression in childhood. Zellweger syndrome resultsfrom near or complete absence of peroxisomes. Affected infants present with dysmorphic facial characteristics, sei- zures, liver disease, characteristic bone involvement, pro- found hypotonia, and hearing and vision de cits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows a leukodystrophy (abnormal myelination). The condition is usually fatal in infancy. Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked condition that results from a de ciency in peroxisomal oxidation of VLCFAs. It presents with developmental regression, whitematter disease, new-onset spasticity, and adrenal failure typically in school-age boys, although there is a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Onset occurs after a period ofnormal growth and development. Initial screening for both of these conditions is by plasma VLCFA analysis. HSCT may halt progression in some patients (12). MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS Mitochondrial disorders are complex multisystemic con- ditions that result from mutations in the mitochondrialgenome or nuclear genes required for mitochondrial func- tion (13). Point mutations in the mitochondrial genome aretransmitted via maternal inheritance, deletions or dupli- cations in the mitochondrial genome are usually sporadic, and mutations in nuclear genes required for mitochon- drial function are inherited in a mendelian pattern, usually autosomal recessive. The mitochondria have several important functions but most important is the production of cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate via the respiratory chain. Genetic alterations that diminish the mitochondria 's ability to produce energy result in dys- function in tissues with the highest energy demands.Therefore, mitochondrial disorders preferentially affectthe brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles, and the eye. Muscle biopsy may show ragged red bers on light micros- copy. Strategies for diagnosing mitochondrial diseasesvary and are beyond the scope of this review, but they include next-generation DNA sequencing of multigene panels for nuclear gene mutations, of the mito- chondrial genome, and speci c assays of muscle respiratory chain activity. Because plasma lactate is neither a sensi-tive nor speci c marker of mitochondrial disease, the decision to evaluate a patient for mitochondrial disease should rely on the clinical phenotype. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acid, and strokelike episodes) is one common mitochondrial disorder that is usually due to a maternally inherited muta- tion in the mitochondrial tRNA for leucine. Symptoms often present in adolescence with diabetes mellitus, recurrent strokelike episodes, migraine headaches, and hearing loss. Kearns-Sayre syndrome usually results from sporadic (non- inherited) partial deletions of the mitochondrial genome. Common features cardiac and progressive exter- nal ophthalmoplegia. chain disorders are usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are related to mutations in nuclear genes important for assembly, maintenance, or production of the respiratory chain (but may also be maternally inherited due to mito- chondrial point mutations). These conditions usually pre- sent in infancy with hypotonia, muscle weakness, global developmental delays, lactic acidosis, and seizures. Neuro-imaging may show basal ganglia lesions consistent with Leigh syndrome. CONCLUSION Metabolic disorders can be dif cult to understand due to their rarity and the multiplicity of conditions. Applyingcontext to this group of conditions can aid in the initial 14 Pediatrics in Review by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from evaluation. Disorders of energy sources can largely be screened for by a few simple tests. Amino acidopathiescan be evaluated via PAA and UOA analysis; organic acidemias electrolytes, urine ketones, UOA analysis, and PAC pro le; urea cycle disorders via UOA and PAA analysis and ammonia; and FAOD via UOA, PAC pro le, urine ketones, blood glucose, and plasma carnitine. In addition, NBS allows for the early recognition of many, but not all of these disorders. Therefore, clinicians should consider these conditions in the differential diagnosis, even for a child who has a negative NBS result. The lysosomal disorders are more dif cult to diagnosis via routine screening tests, but the clinical features (eg, vis- ceromegaly, developmental regression, coarse facial fea- tures) should alert the clinician to the possibility.

You are working in the pediatric emergency department when parents bring in their 12-day-old male infant. They assert he has not been waking to feed over the past 24 hours. He normally breastfeeds every 3 hours for 20 minutes and now he sleeps almost continuously. They state he has had a cough and runny nose for the past few days with atemperature of 38.1\u00b0C (100.5\u00b0F) and has been \"floppy \"for the past several hours. On physical examination, he is dif cult to wake. His respiratory rate is 36 breaths/min, heart rate is 120 beats/min, blood pressure is 57/35 mm Hg, and temperature is 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F).His lungs are clear and cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm withoutmurmur. His abdomen is soft. He has poor capillary re ll (4-5 sec) and markedly decreased tone. You suspect infection or a metabolic disorder. Which of the following is the initiallaboratory test in the evaluation of a metabolic disorder? A. Blood glucose. B. Liver panel. C. Plasma amino acids. D. Serum ketones. E. Urine organic acids. 2. An 8-day-old female infant is admitted to the general pediatric ward with a 2-day history of lethargy and vomiting. She was born at 38 weeks 'gestation via repeat cesarean section and did well. She was discharged home on postnatal day 3. She has been breastfeedingevery 3 hours with supplemental 20-cal/oz formula. Since last evening, she has become difcult to arouse and has had multiple episodes of vomiting. She is not febrile and does not have cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, or a rash. There have been no ill contacts. She is started on ampicillin and gentamicin after obtaining blood, urine, and cerebrospinalfluid for culture. The third-year medical student on the service raises his hand and says he has been researching a differential diagnosis. He states that urea cycle defects can presentin this manner and perhaps plasma ammonia should be assessed. Which of the following istrue when evaluating plasma ammonia? A. A capillary specimen is more reliable than a venous specimen. B. Elevated results require a repeat specimen sent the following day, after initiation of therapy. C. The specimen should be placed on ice at bedside and immediately sent to the laboratory. D. The specimen should be tested within 3 hours. E. Venous compression from tourniquet use may cause a falsely low result. 3. You are seeing a 17-year-old girl in the adolescent medicine clinic for the rst time. She states that she was diagnosed with phenylketonuria as an infant. She also mentions shehas been sexually active for the past 3 years and believes she is currently pregnant.Although her primary physician has repeatedly counseled her to maintain a strictphenylalanine-free diet, she has been noncompliant. You explain to her the risks to the fetus associated with elevated phenylalanine levels, which includes which of the following? A. Craniosynostosis. B. Hepatoblastoma. C. Intellectual disability. D. Renal insuf ciency. E. Skeletal dysplasia. 4. As the intern covering the pediatric ward, you check on a 5-day-old infant who was recently admitted for a sepsis evaluation. His babysitter felt he had been lethargic, withthree episodes of emesis over the previous 12 hours. You note he has been started onantibiotics, but you decide to obtain an ammonia assessment, which is reported as 16 Pediatrics in Review by guest on June 22, 2017 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from 1,742.3 mg/dL (1,244 \u00b5mol/L) 20 minutes later. You review the initial management of urea cycle defects. Which of the following is most accurate in the treatment of a urea cycle defect? A. All US states screen for ornithine transcarbamylase de ciency. B. Fever and common childhood illnesses do not play a role in exacerbations in infants with urea cycle disorders. C. Hemodialysis is commonly required to lower plasma ammonia concentrations and nephrology should be consulted upon diagnosis. D. Liver transplantation does not improve the long-term management of hyper- ammonemia due to urea cycle defects. E. Other dietary strategies, rather than removing protein from the diet, are recom- mended by experts to avoid hyperammonemic crises. 5. You are preparing a lecture for pediatric residents on inborn errors of metabolism. Your goal is to provide the information they need to immediately identify infants who maypresent with a metabolic disorder and to begin management of these infants. Which of the following acute treatments is most useful in the emergent management of suspected metabolic disorders? A. Dextrose-containing fluids with salt. B. Dextrose-containing fluids saline bolus (10 mL/kg).
