Get to know a little bit more about Dr. Mackler, Naturopathic Physician and Licensed Acupuncturist! How did I become interested in Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine? My first exposure to acupuncture was as a child watching [acupuncture on injured horses. In 1996 I spent a semester abroad in China and observed and experienced the power of Chinese medicine for myself and for hundreds of patients in Chinese medicine hospitals. Then I worked at a holistic veterinary clinic where acupuncture and herbal medicine was used. I watched dogs limp in and walk out after acupuncture sessions. I saw improvements in chronic skin conditions, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic urinary tract infections. Knowing there is no placebo effect on animals, I knew this medicine worked and I wanted to learn more about it! ](https://www.flourishnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tree.jpg) Why also practice Naturopathic medicine? Naturopathic Medical school gave me a strong background in western diagnosis, western herbal medicine, as well as nutrition. This allows me to more effectively communicate with other physicians as well as my patients in their language. I can also work with foods, nutritional supplements and plants that are more familiar to us. I can order lab work, or diagnostic imaging, refer to specialists and write prescriptions when needed. How do I flourish? By cooking and sharing meals with family and friends, swimming, taking hikes, puttering in my urban garden, reading a good book, riding horses and helping you "}
