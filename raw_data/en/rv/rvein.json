Last week in The Protocol, we talked about the frenzy that was happening on the [Friend.tech](http://Friend.tech) app, atop Coinbase's Base blockchain - and made the point that, like a lot of crypto crazes, it might pass quickly. That appears to be happening now. But there is [a lesson here from looking at Ethereum fees](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/30/ethereum-handled-friendtech-frenzy-without-fee-spike-why-thats-a-big-deal/#:~:text=Friend.tech%2C%20Crypto's%20latest%20fad,new%20Base%2C%20are%20bearing%20fruit.) - that the largest smart-contracts blockchain's plan for scaling via the addition of supplemental \"layer-2\" networks might be paying off.

[Subscribe here](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/the-protocol/) to get it every week. Network news Activity has slumped on the [Friend.tech](http://Friend.tech) platform \"as quickly as it rose,\" according to the analysis firm Messari. ( [Messari](https://messari.io/report/an-end-to-the-friendzy)) FICKLE [FRIEND.TECH](http://FRIEND.TECH): The social marketplace [Friend.tech](http://Friend.tech), which went viral after being launched a few weeks ago on Coinbase's new Base blockchain, is now at risk of being discarded as the latest crypto has-been. According to a Dune Analytics [dashboard](https://dune.com/austin_adams/friendstech-dashboard), the number of buys and sells on the platform plunged in the past week along with prices for shares or [keys](https://twitter.com/friendtech/status/1696599323637846444) in listed influencers. The analysis firm Messari, in a report titled, \" [An End to the Friendzy](https://messari.io/report/an-end-to-the-friendzy),\" estimated that the number of traders was down 40% off their peak, and users complained of high feeds and slow load times. \"As quickly as it rose, activity on [Friend.tech](http://Friend.tech) has cooled off,\" according to the firm. There might be a second act, however: Decrypt [reported](https://twitter.com/friendtech/status/1694880415318954358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1694880415318954358%7Ctwgr%5Eb4ebcc425ed9625feebdcda2e18a87c9d93285d1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F153723%2Fonlyfans-accounts-take-over-friend-tech-crypt-app-adds-photo-feature) that creators of adult (and often explicit) content from the website OnlyFans were flocking over to the [Friend.tech](http://Friend.tech) platform, after it enabled the sending of photos to \" [key holders](https://twitter.com/friendtech/status/1694880415318954358).\" BINANCE BUZZ: There's been a lot of news over the past week on the big U.S. crypto exchange - some of it good, some not so good, some neutral. The overarching theme is that the company expanded rapidly in recent years, and now it's facing intense scrutiny from regulators, having to retrench in some business lines and regions, while pivoting in others. Binance this week [cut ties with five sanctioned Russian banks](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/25/binance-delists-sanctioned-russian-banks-from-peer-to-peer-service/) listed on the exchange's peer-to-peer service for transferring funds in rubles. The move came just days after the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/finance/binance-cryptocurrency-russia-sanctions-ddb948c3) that Binance was enabling peer-to-peer trades of rubles for digital tokens, frequently involving banks on Western blacklists - a popular method for Russians to transfer money abroad. Binance said it was [discontinuing its crypto-backed debit card](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/24/binance-to-withdraw-debit-card-in-latin-america-middle-east/) in Bahrain and Latin America, where it has been available for less than a year. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/mastercard-binance-end-crypto-card-partnership-2023-08-24/), Mastercard decided to end the programs. Then on Tuesday, Binance announced it had launched a new crypto-based program Send Cash that will allow users in nine Latin American countries to transfer money directly into friends' and family members' bank accounts in Colombia and Argentina. In Belgium, Binance has been ordered to cease operations by the country's local regulator, but customers [can continue using the exchange via a Polish entity](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/28/binances-belgian-customers-to-use-polish-entity-in-bid-to-escape-regulators-ban/). On the trading side, Binance announced that, starting Wednesday, it would offer [\"T+3\" daily options](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/29/binance-to-offer-t3-daily-bnbusdt-options/) contracts allowing traders to bet on the BNB token over a three-day period. The BNB token has been volatile this year, [falling recently to a one-year low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/22/bnb-token-stumbles-to-1-year-low-amid-mounting-scrutiny-over-binance/) (get update on this). Market observers have long speculated that Binance might attempt to prop up the token's value by selling bitcoin ( [BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)), but exchange CEO \"CZ\" Zhao has it [wasn't the case](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/14/binance-ceo-hits-back-at-rumors-of-exchange-selling-bitcoin-for-bnb-coin/). Binance and Zhao were [sued](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/05/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao/) by the SEC in June, accused of offering unregistered securities to the general public allowing for commingling of customer funds, along with other violations of securities laws. ByteTree, a research firm, wrote this week that Binance was \"in the crosshairs,\" adding that its share of global crypto exchange trading volume has slid to about 45%, from 64% six months earlier. Bitstamp said it would shut down its ether staking service in the U.S. as of Sept. 25 [due to regulatory scrutiny](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/24/bitstamp-to-stop-ether-staking-in-us-amid-regulatory-scrutiny/) of the practice, which the Securities and Exchange Commission has likened to investment contracts. The crypto exchange Kraken agreed in February to en [d its staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/09/us-securities-and-exchange-commission-sues-kraken-over-crypto-staking-services/#:~:text=Crypto%20exchange%20Kraken%20will%20%E2%80%9Cimmediately,from%20earlier%20in%20the%20day.) and pay $30 million to settle SEC allegations it offered unregistered securities. Magnate Finance, a lending and borrowing platform on Coinbase's new Base blockchain, appears to have rug-pulled users out of $6.5 million, just hours after the blockchain sleuth ZachXBT [warned on X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1694914871165345997) that the project might be a scam - based on data records tying Magnate to an earlier $4.8 million exit scam known as Solfire, Cointelegraph [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vauld-gets-permission-for-board-restructuring-from-the-court).

The company also inadvertently provided customers with addresses where they could contribute cryptocurrency into a muti-signature wallet, known as 98f, before later realizing that it couldn't gain access to the wallet; so employees reportedly had to use some $76.4 million of fiat currency from the company's accounts to satisfy ETH withdrawal requests. - Binance Labs wrote in a [blog post](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-in-delphinus-lab-the-first-opensource-zkwasm-virtual-machine-to-support-next-era-of-web3-applications-3444797851566042967)that it has invested in Delphinus Lab, an infrastructure provider that is \"leading the zkWASM space, where zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography is deployed in [WebAssembly](https://blog.devgenius.io/webassembly-wasm-in-blockchain-f651a8ac767b)(WASM) environments.\" - Wintermute Trading, one of the biggest market makers in crypto, is trying and [failing](https://snapshot.org/#/veyfi.eth/proposal/0x3840d5b6daa3363933806c98335103c9086419b68513bd40f326f5cb0e07e9cf)to convince supporters of Yearn Finance to loan it 350 YFI tokens - worth over $2 million, with no collateral posted - in exchange for Wintermute supporting markets for Yearn's yCRV token.

Right after the change happened, some 16 trillion tokens (about $14M worth) flowed out of the PEPE wallet, heading to addresses associated with the crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Bybit. Late Friday, the twitter user [@pepecoineth](https://twitter.com/pepecoineth) [posted an explanation on X](https://twitter.com/pepecoineth/status/1695267128428114005), noting that the project has \" [unfortunately been plagued by inner strife](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/28/pepecoin-says-bad-actors-on-team-stole-15m-pepe/)\" since inception, \"with a portion of the team being bad actors led by big egos and greed.\" The user said that the \"multi-sig was set up to require 3/4 signers present for an approval,\" and that the a theft of tokens occurred after \"Yesterday these 3 ex-team members came back behind my back.\" The user apologized and said the remaining 10 trillion tokens are safe. - THORChain, a cross-chain liquidity protocol [built using Cosmos software](https://docs.thorchain.org/), saw the price of its native token [RUNE](https://www.coindesk.com/price/thorchain/)surge as wealthy investors seeking alternatives to centralized exchanges used the platform to conduct multi-million dollar token swaps and tried a new \"streaming swaps\" product that debuted in early August, The Defiant [reported](https://thedefiant.io/thorchain-processes-record-volume-after-introducing-streaming-swaps).
