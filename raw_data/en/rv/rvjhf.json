A 19-bed teaching service on this floor is staffed entirely by family medicine residents and attending physicians. \"Service Without Walls\" Family medicine patients who require specialized services elsewhere in the hospital are followed closely by family medicine hospitalists who coordinate care with patients' primary care providers. In all instances, hospital care is treated as an acute episode requiring a thoughtful, safe transition back to care in the community, with emphasis on the prevention of future hospitalizations. Maternity and newborn care is provided to family medicine patients by family physicians at the Montefiore Wakefield Campus. Specialized Inpatient Services Montefiore's [Palliative Care Service](palliative-care.html) provides consultation services for adults with late-stage disease at all three of Montefiore's inpatient divisions.
