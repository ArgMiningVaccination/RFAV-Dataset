We have adjusted our policies and procedures to comply. All applicants are encouraged to carefully review and follow these Admissions Protocols. These new rules, policies and procedures help medical schools ensure they don't over or under accept their class and that applicants have the highest opportunity for timely acceptance. All applicants holding acceptance to Quillen are expected to comply fully and professionally with all AAMC Admissions Protocols throughout the process beginning in February. They are also required to formally indicate their intention of enrolling at Quillen by selecting the \"Commit to Enroll\" selection through the AMCAS \"Choose Your Medical School Tool\" at a date not later than 21 days prior to the first day of orientation or other required attendance at Quillen. All will additionally be required to formally notify Quillen that they are in compliance with this protocol and that they have withdrawn all other applications, no matter what the status of that application, from all other allopathic, osteopathic and Texas medical schools for the current year. Those not in timely compliance with this policy may have their acceptance to Quillen immediately withdrawn and that class position offered to another applicant.
