CHOI & P . KROPF Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK SUMMARY Experimental leishmaniasis is widely used to study the effector functions of T helper cell subsets in vivo . Healing and nonhealing Leishmania major infections have been correlated with T helper 1 and T helper 2 responses, respectively. In thepresent study, we determined T cell effector functions ex vivo , without any further restimulation and compared them to thoseobtained following antigen-specic restimulation in vitro . Our results show that T helper cell responses are signicantlyless polarized when determined ex vivo as compared to those measured after restimulation in vitro . Moreover, the differences in CD4 + T cell proliferation observed between healer and nonhealer strains of mice differed ex vivo and in vitro . Our results suggest that determination of both ex vivo as well as in vitro T cell responses is crucial to characterize immune responses during experimental leishmaniasis. Keywords cell proliferation, T cells, Th1/Th2 cells INTRODUCTION The leishmaniases are a group of vector-borne parasitic diseases that inflict an immense toll in the developing world;they are major causes of morbidity and mortality and impedeeconomic development. Currently, these diseases affect anestimated 12 million people in 88 countries, and approximately350 million people are at risk. The leishmaniases belongto the most neglected tropical diseases, affecting the poorestpopulations, for whom access to diagnosis and effective treat-ment are most difcult (http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/).Leishmaniases present with a wide range of symptoms, rangingfrom the self healing cutaneous form, which produces localizedskin ulcers; to the mucocutaneous form, which leads to thedestruction mucous membranes of the mouth, throat,nose and neighbouring to the visceral form, the mostsevere form of leishmaniasis, in which the mortality rate canbe as high at 100%. A multitude of factors, including parasiteand vector species, host immune responses, genetic and environ-mental factors influence the outcome of infection. T lymphocytes are central players in the host response of all forms of leishmaniasis; they are decisive for both healingand the generation of protective immunity as well as fornonhealing persistent disease and pathology. Experimentalstudies in inbred strains of mice with Leishmania (L.) major mimic the healing and nonhealing manifestation of leishma- niasis and have established the current paradigm of T helper(Th) cell subset involvement (1-3). In this model, the majorityof inbred strains of mice develop small lesions that willspontaneously heal within a few weeks; this ability to controlinfection is associated with the expansion of Th1 cells,characterized by the production of IFN- . In contrast, a few strains of mice such as BALB/c develop nonhealing disease,attributed to the expansion of Th2 cells and the productionof their signature cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. Leishmania are obligate intracellular parasites in their mammalian host. After transmission into their host, they invadeand parasitize mainly macrophages, which are decisive effector Correspondence : Dr P .

Choi & P . Kropf Parasite Immunology cells that either kill or host the intracellular parasites depending on the balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokines: Th1 (iNOS) that oxidizes l -arginine into nitric oxide (NO), a metabolite responsible for the killing ofintracellular Leishmania parasites (4). Th2 cytokines result in alternative activation of macrophages and the inductionof arginase (5), which metabolizes l -arginine into urea and ornithine; the latter is the main intracellular source for thesynthesis of polyamines necessary for parasite growth (6,7). In addition to the canonical type 1 and type 2 T helper cell responses, IL-10, a cytokine originally described as a type 2cytokine (8), plays an important role in leishmaniasis. BothCD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells (9) and CD4 + CD25 - FoxP3 - Th1 cells (10) have been shown to express IL-10 and play a crucialrole in parasite persistence and in immunosuppression. In the experimental model of leishmaniasis, the type of immune responses that is associated with healing ornonhealing has been largely dened by measuring cytokineproduction following in vitro restimulation of lymphoid cells with Leishmania parasites. However, these do not necessarily reflect immune responses in the infected host in vivo . There- fore, to assess immune responses induced in response to infec-tion with L. major in vivo , we measured CD4 + T cell effector functions directly ex vivo , in freshly isolated cells from the lymph nodes draining the cutaneous lesions and comparedthem to recall responses obtained after in vitro restimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice Female BALB/c and CBA mice (6- to 8-week old) (Charles River, UK) were kept in individually vented cages. Animal colonies,screened regularly for mouse pathogens, consistently testednegative. Animal experiments were performed in accordancewith Governmental (Home Ofce) and Institutional Guidelines. Experimental infection with L. major parasites For infections, 2 \u00d7 10 6 stationary phase L. major LV39 (MRHO/ SU/59/P-strain) promastigotes were injected subcutaneously(s.c.) into the footpad (11). Proliferation assay Preparation of cells Ex vivo : L. major infected mice were treated with 1 mg 5-bromo- 2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma) i.p. once a day for the last 4 daysbefore experiments were terminated. Draining lymph nodes fromindividual mice were homogenized into single cell suspensionsusing cell dissociation sieves and labelled as described below. In vitro : Popliteal lymph nodes from 2 or 4 week infected nonhealer (BALB/c) and healer (CBA) strains of mice werehomogenized and 5 \u00d7 10 6 /mL cells were restimulated for 5 days with 1 \u00d7 10 6 live L. major parasites or 1 \u00d7 10 6 crude L. major antigen (frozen and thawed three times) in Dulbecco's Modied Eagle's mg/mL l -glutamine (Gibco). BrdU was added to the cell culture 18 h before the cells were harvestedand labelled as described below. Before surface labelling with (clone H129\u00b719 or GK1\u00b75, monoclonal antibody CD32/CD16 (Fc II/ III receptor, Pharmingen). Cells were washed, xed andpermeabilized using the method described in (12). Detectionof CD4 + BrdU + cells was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD) and Intracellular cytokine determination Preparation of cells Ex vivo : Individual draining lymph nodes were harvested from 2 week infected mice and were homogenized into single cellsuspensions using cell dissociation sieves. In vitro : Lymph node cells were stimulated with L. major parasites as described above and harvested after 5 days. Cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) were stimulated with 50 ng of 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) and 500 ng of ionomycin(Calbiochem) or, as a control, in the presence of completemedium alone for 4 h, with 10 g of Brefeldin A (Sigma) added for the last 2 h. Before surface labelling with anti-CD4 mAb (cloneH129\u00b719 or CD32/CD16 receptor, Pharmingen). Cells were washed, xed and permeabilized as described in (13) before the anti-cytokine antibodies or the isotype the detection limit when the cells were stimulated inthe absence of PMA/ionomycin stimulation. The detectionlimits were iMFI: The integrated mean fluorescent intensity (iMFI) (14) was obtained by multiplying the percentage of CD4 + T cells with the value of the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) forBrdU or with the value of the MFI for the relevant cytokine. \u00a9 2009 The Authors 201 Journal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Parasite Immunology , 31 , 199-209 Volume 31, Number Leishmania major-specic T cell responses Luminex Lymphocytes were stimulated as described above and 3 days later, supernatants were harvested and IFN- and IL-4 were detected simultaneously in each sample by the Luminex-basedMultiplexed assay (Luminex 100 System).

Statistical analyses Statistical differences were determined using a two-tailed Mann- Whitney test and differences were considered statisticallysignicant at P < 0\u00b705. RESULTS Production of the cytokines IFN- , IL-4 and IL-10 is strongly amplied after restimulation In the experimental model of leishmaniasis, immune responses have mostly been characterized by restimulating lymphoidcells from infected mice with Leishmania antigen in vitro (1,2). To determine how closely these responses reflect the host response to Leishmania infection, we compared CD4 + T cell responses from L. major infected mice ex vivo and in vitro . We infected nonhealer mice (BALB/c) and healer mice (CBA)with L. major promastigotes and measured 2 weeks later CD4 + T cell effector functions directly ex vivo in the draining lymph nodes and compared them with those obtained after in vitro restimulation with L. major parasites as antigen. We rst assessed the production of the type-1 cytokine IFN- in L. major infected healer and nonhealer strains directly ex vivo , without in vitro restimulation. As shown in Figure 1A,the frequency of CD4 + IFN- + T cells was lower in the lymph nodes from BALB/c mice as compared to CBA Figure A recent study has described a new metric parameter, the integrated mean fluores-cence intensity (iMFI), which reflects more precisely the totalfunctional response of activated T cells (14). iMFI is calcu-lated by multiplying the percentage of positive cells, whichrepresents the magnitude of the response by the MFI, whichrepresents the quality of the response. As shown in Figure 1, the CD4 + IFN- + iMFI was lower in BALB/c than in CBA mice when 52\u00b78 \u00b1 3\u00b74, P results were obtained when the frequency, MFI and iMFI of CD4 + IFN- + T cell were determined directly ex vivo 4 weeks post L. major infection ( P < 0\u00b705, Table 1A). Next we restimulated lymph node cells from 2 week infected mice with L. major parasites for 5 days (15) and measured the percentages, MFI and iMFI of CD4 + IFN- + . As shown in Figure 1C, after in vitro restimulation these three parameters were considerably higher in the lymph node cultures fromCBA mice as compared to those of BALB/c mice ( P < 0\u00b705). Similar results were obtained when we measured IFN- levels in the supernatants of restimulated increase in percentage, MFI andiMFI of CD4 + IFN- + T cells was observed when lymphoid cells from 4 weeks infected mice were restimulated with L. major parasites in vitro (P < 0\u00b705, Table 1B). The higher production of IFN- observed in vitro with cells from CBA mice (Figure 1C,D) was not due a higher numberof cells after restimulation, as the total number of cellsafter in vitro restimulation was even higher in BALB/c (CBA shown).

Next, we measured the ex vivo and in vitro production of IL-4 by CD4+ T cells in draining lymph nodes of BALB/c andCBA mice two weeks post infection.

Similar results were obtained when lymphoid cells from 4 week infected BALB/c and CBA mice were restimulatedwith L. major parasites in vitro (P < 0\u00b705, Table 3).To determine how different preparations of L. major parasites might affect the levels of cytokine production, westimulated lymph node cells from two weeks infected BALB/cmice and CBA mice with live L. major parasites or with crude L. major antigen (freeze and thawed L. major parasites).

Choi & P . Kropf Parasite Immunology The proliferative response of CD4+ T cells from L. major infected healer and nonhealer strains of mice differs both ex vivo and in vitro. To characterize further CD4+ T cell effector functions ex vivo and in vitro in healer and nonhealer strains of mice, we measured the capacity of CD4+ T cells to proliferate. We rst measured L. major -induced proliferation of CD4+ T cells directly ex vivo by quantifying the frequency of CD4+ T cells that had incorporated BrdU in vivo . We found that there was a small decrease in the frequency of proliferatingCD4 + T cells in the draining lymph nodes of nonhealer mice compared with healer P < Similar results were obtained 4 weeks post-infection (Table 5A). In contrast, afterrestimulation in vitro with L. major antigens, CD4 + T cells from nonhealer mice observed 4 weeks post-infection ( P < 0\u00b705, Table 5B). These results show that the ex vivo frequency of proliferating CD4 + T cells was lower in the draining lymph nodes of nonhealer mice than in those of healer mice. However,CD4 + T cells from draining lymph nodes of nonhealer mice displayed a more pronounced proliferative response torestimulation with Leishmania than those from healer mice. DISCUSSION Infections of mice with different strains of Leishmania parasites have proved to be very useful models to characterize thedevelopment and regulation of immune responses duringleishmaniasis. The balance of cytokines produced by Th1 andTh2 cells generated in response to L. major infection pro- vides an important conceptual frame work for understanding healing vs. nonhealing forms of leishmaniasis . Healing of infection and development of protection against leishmani-asis crucially depends on the development of Th1 type immunity that can instruct parasitical control mechanisms ininfected macrophages. However, the mechanisms accountingfor insufcient control of growth and dissemination ofLeishmania parasites and resulting in persistent nonhealing disease in infected patients are less well understood (16). Studies with L. major parasites in particular have clearly established the current Th1/Th2 paradigm in which con-trol of infection is associated with the expansion of Th1cells, characterized by the production of IFN- and the use of gene knockout mice conrmed the important role of Th1type responses in the control of disease (17-19). In contrast,nonhealing disease has been attributed to the expansion ofTh2 cells, characterized by the production of IL-4 (1-3). InFigure 4 Ex vivo and in vitro CD4+ T cells proliferation. Groups of BALB/c and CBA (n = 4) mice were infected with L. major parasites in one hind footpad and were treated with 1 mg BrdU (Sigma) i.p. once a day for the last 4 days before experiments were terminated. Individual popliteal lymph nodes were harvested and the percentage of BrdU +CD4+ T cells was determined directly ex vivo by flow cytometry or following restimulation of lymph node cells with L. major parasites for 5 days. The error bars represent standard deviations.

Individual popliteal lymph nodes were harvested and the percentage of BrdU +CD4+ T cells was determined directly ex vivo (A) by flow cytometry or following restimulation of lymph node cells in vitro (B) with L. major parasites for 5 days later. Data are \u00b1SD and show the results of one representative experiment out of three independent experiments.\u00a9 2009 The Authors 207 Journal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Parasite Immunology , 31, 199-209Volume 31, Number 4, April 2009 Leishmania major-specic T cell responses this context, it is important to note that Th2 cells and the spectrum of cytokines they release is not only impacting onthe immune response, they will directly promote the growthof the intracellular parasites by inducing arginase 1, whichcatalyses the hydrolysis of l-arginine into urea and the amino acid l-ornithine; the latter is the rst building block for the generation of polyamines which are essential for the intrac-ellular growth of Leishmania parasites (6,7). The regulation of immune responses against Leishmania parasites is com- plex and Th2 dominance cannot fully explain nonhealing(20-24); in addition, intralesional injection of IL-4 has beenshown to induce healing and immunity to reinfection (25).IL-4 can instruct dendritic cells to produce IL-12 and promoteTh1 development and healing in BALB/c mice (26). Further-more, it has been shown that cure can be achieved in anIFN- independent manner (18,27). Moreover, in human leishmaniasis, the different clinical outcomes do not appearto be associated with polarized Th1- or Th2-type responses:whereas IL-4 is higher in the plasma of patients with visceralleishmaniasis (VL) (28,29), and TNF- are also increased (30,31). Our in vitro results, in agreement with those of many others [reviewed in (1-3)], substantiate this Th1/Th2 model:we show that after in vitro restimulation, lymphoid cells from healer mice display a strong IFN- response, whereas in nonhealer mice there is predominantly an IL-4 response.However, when Th responses were measured directly ex vivo , without any further restimulation, we show that the dichotomyof Th cell responses is not as pronounced as those afterin vitro restimulation. These results suggest that the healing or nonhealing phenotype of L. major infected mice does not correlate with such a polarized Th1 or Th2 response whendetermined ex vivo . The causes for this strong increase in the frequencies of CD4 +IFN- + or CD4+IL-4+ T cells following in vitro restimulation are unclear. We can exclude that apoptosis was more prominent in any of the cultures, sincethere was no increase in caspase + CD4+ T cells (P . Kropf, unpublished results). It is possible that factors such ascostimulation or antigen presentation (32) that are specicallyinfluenced by in vitro restimulation conditions influence this strong preferential expansion of Th1 or Th2 cells. Further-more, it is possible that flow cytometry is not sensitiveenough to detect CD4 + T cells that express low levels of IL-4 and IL-10. Indeed, IL-10 was below detection limit whendetermined ex vivo even though it was clearly detectable following in vitro restimulation with L. major parasites. IL-10 mRNA has been previously measured in the draining lymphnode of healer and nonhealer mice following infection withL. major parasites (33,34). Taken together, these results suggest that flow cytometry might not be a technique that issensitive enough to measure the frequency of CD4 +IL-10+ Tcells directly ex vivo without any further restimulation. The production of IL-10 by CD4+ T cells was clearly detectable by flow cytometry following in vitro restimulation with L. major parasites; CD4+ T cells from nonhealer mice produce signi- cantly more IL-10 than those from healer strains of mice. Itis well established that IL-10 has a down-regulatory effecton macrophages and Moreover, IL-10 synergizes with IL-4 in theinduction of alternative activation of macrophages andour previous results clearly demonstrated that IL-10 andIL-4 synergize in promoting the parasite growth via enhancedarginase induction and polyamine synthesis (7). Recentwork indicates that failure to control leishmaniasis is notdue to a dominant Th2 or a defective Th1 response per se but could be ascribed to a concomitant production of IL-10(36). Moreover, experimental evidence showed that IL-10decient BALB/c mice as well as inhibition of binding ofIL-10 to its receptor improved the control of L. major infec- tion in nonhealer strains of mice (37,38). Interestingly, someL. major isolates produce nonhealing lesions in strains of mice such as C57BL/6 that are usually considered to be healersand mount a Th1 response, thus, this work clearly showsthat although Th1 responses are required for healing, theyare not sufcient (24). Importantly, our in vitro results as well as those from others underpin these results as theyshow that IL-10 is strongly expressed after restimulation oflymphoid cells from nonhealer mice as compared to healermice and strengthen further the role that IL-10 might havein the pathogenesis of nonhealing leishmaniasis. It is also important to note that the experimental model of infection that has been used to characterize Th cell responsesdoes not reproduce the biology of natural infection; indeed,factors such as the dose of parasites inoculated (39-41), thesite of infection (39,42), the presence of saliva (43) or parasitecomponents, such as lamentous proteophosphoglycan (40)have been shown to greatly influence the outcome of infec-tion. Little is known about T cell responses in mice directlyinfected with sandflies and more studies in the naturalinfection model are of paramount importance to fully under-stand T cell polarization and effector functions. To characterize further T cell effector functions, we determined the proliferation of CD4 + T cells ex vivo or after restimulation in vitro : there was a higher frequency of CD4+BrdU+ T cells in CBA mice when measured ex vivo , however, after in vitro restimulation, the frequency of CD4+BrdU+ T cells was signicantly higher in BALB/c mice as compared to CBA mice. It is possible that the cultureand restimulation conditions favour a higher activation ofCD4 + T cells from BALB/c mice; indeed, the frequency of CD4+CD25+, CD4+CD40L+, CD4+OX40L+ and CD4+CD62L T cells were signicantly higher in the cultures of BALB/c miceas compared to CBA mice (P . Kropf, unpublished results).208 \u00a9 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Parasite Immunology , 31, 199-209B.-S. Choi & P .
