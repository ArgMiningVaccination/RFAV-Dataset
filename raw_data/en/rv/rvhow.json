{"title": "Allergy & Asthma Network - Day 2 of Latex Awareness Week! Today's topic: Latex and Vaccines. How are they related? Well, hard and dry latex is minimally processed and is used to make vial closures for some vaccines. These latex proteins may be mixed with the medication through packaging and storage of the vaccine vial, and also through puncturing the vial stopper to \"draw up\" the vaccine. The same concern exists with vaccines that are stored in syringes with latex in the plungers. But it is important to note that the reported risk of latex allergic reactions to vaccines appears very small in comparison with the number of vaccines that are administered each year. If you are worried about a latex allergic reaction from the COVID-19 vaccine, don't be! The Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines use vial stoppers that are not made with natural rubber latex. People with latex allergy are not at risk for a latex allergy reaction from the vaccine!
