[LEARN MORE](/adultservices) Group Therapy The idea of group therapy can feel intimidating at first, often prompting clients to ask \"Why would I ever subject myself to talking about my feelings in a room of strangers?!\" It's a valid question. However, we've found that once people make it past the initial hurdle of showing up, they quickly find a place of belonging. This experience ultimately provides a safe space for you to finally be able to break through the barriers in your healing journey. [LEARN MORE](/grouptherapy) Yoga When navigating life, we first receive vital information via the body and which then makes it's way to the brain. The practice of yoga creates dual awareness, allowing us to think and feel at the same time. This helps us to consciously respond to situations, utilizing all the parts of the brain, rather than unconsciously reacting with only our survival responses online. Our classes also offer an opportunity to find relief from the impact of hardship and support us in reclaiming and healing our relationships with our selves, bodies, and others. Nutrition Nutritional psychology is the study of the impact of food and nutrients on our mood, emotions and mental health. The majority of our serotonin (the feel good neurotransmitter) is produced within the gut. As a result, the foods we eat everyday interact with the neurotransmitters in our digestive system. This can produce either positive or negative effects depending on what we eat. We provide Medical Nutrition Therapy, Nutrition Education and Classes, Nutritional Psychology, and Ayurvedic Wellness services in order to help you create a healthy relationship with food. We truly believe that food can heal and provide us with the healthy energy we need in our everyday lives. Massage Massage not only relieves pain and tension from sore, achy muscles, but it also improves mental health. It does this by decreasing cortisol (a stress hormone) and regulating serotonin and dopamine. These two neurotransmitters play a key role in mood regulation, motivation, emotional processing, and feelings of hopefulness. Trauma often lives within the physical body, thus massage plays an important role in integrating healing. It does this by easing the body and nervous system out of chronic fight-flight-freeze survival responses - ultimately helping you to find a sense of balance and renewal. Reiki Reiki is a Japanese energy healing technique, that provides an opportunity for deep relaxation through the practice of receptivity and trust. This technique helps to cultivate a harmonious relationship between our higher consciousness and vital energy by releasing blockages in the energetic field and tension from the body. During a Reiki session, the practitioner works to soften the nervous system and bring to the surface anything within you that needs healing, ultimately restoring a state of balance and well-being. [LEARN MORE] Energetic Healing Therapy Energetic Healing Therapy is a spiritual talk therapy originating in Brazil. A mix of traditional therapy and energy healing, but differentiates itself by focusing on exploring the depths of the client's mind through conscious and superconscious content. It is a powerful tool for self-knowledge, re-framing the past, and building the desired future. These unique techniques, such as guided relaxation and visualization, allow the client to explore aspects of themselves that may not be so clear in the fully awakened state of consciousness. "}
