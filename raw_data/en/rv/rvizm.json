Citizens can easily identify the E-Routes by the District stars and bars emblem located onthe street signs. During an emergency, stay tuned to your local emergency station or listen to emergency officials for instructions onwhich route to follow. The HSEMA website -- http://hsema.dc.gov -- contains preparedness information, including the District Response Plan (DRP) and other materials. The DDOT website -- http://ddot.dc.gov -- contains additional evacuation information. And, for general information or to report signal outages, call DDOT's 24-hour Hotline: 202-671-DDOT (3368) EV ACUATION MAP The map shown on the next page highlights the primary corridors radiating from downtown Washington, DC that have been identified asemergency event/evacuation routes (in red). Each of the routes extendsto the Capital Beltway (I-495) and beyond. During a major event or emergency situation, radial evacuation routes featuring traffic signals will be timed. In addition, 70 critical intersections on the event/evacuation routes within Washington, DC willbe manned with uniformed police officers to expedite the flow of traffic and to prevent bottlenecks. Also, these officers will direct you toalternate routes should an emergency warrant the closing of currentevent/evacuation routes. Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, between Rock Creek Park and the U.S. Capitol serves as the dividing line for event/evacuation routes. When evacuation is ordered, motorists north of Pennsylvania Avenue will be directed North, East, and West on radial event/evacuation routes; motorists south of Pennsylvania Avenue will be directed South, East, and West on radial event/evacuation routes. None of the routes cross and no vehicles will be permitted to cross Pennsylvania Avenue during an emergency evacuation. dc-5 WASHINGTON DC A REAEvent/Evacuation Routes N The mission of the Technical Services Branch is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of District residents by managing land disturbing activities to prevent accelerated soil erosion and sediment deposition in thePotomac and Anacostia Rivers and their tributaries.

During an emergency, NWS sends a specialtone that activates weather radios in the listening area. Weather radiosequipped with a special alarm tone feature can sound an alert and provideimmediate information about a life-threatening situation. NOAA Weather Radios are found in many electronics stores and cost about $25-$100. Some features to consider are alarm tone, battery backup, and\"Specific Area Message Encoding\" (SAME) programming. NWR broadcasts warnings and post-event information for all types of hazards - weather (blizzards, winter/ice storms and torrential rain) , natural (floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes), technological (chemical or oil spills, nuclear power plant emergencies, etc.) and national security emergencies . NOAA collaborates with other Federal agencies and the FCC's Emergency Alert System (EAS) to issue non-weather related emergency messages. Also, NWR cooperates in providingnotices under the Department of Homeland Security Threat AdvisorySystem and issues AmberAlerts. Local NWS offices broadcast non-weather related emergency messages on NWR at the request of local or state government officials . During this type of emergency, officials provide text information about the hazard andrecommend protective actions for the affected areas. NWS offices havepre-arranged agreements with the government to speed the process, since minutes and seconds make a difference. Programming Your NOAA Weather Radio After purchasing an NWR with \"Specific Area Message Encoding\", you should program it with coding for your area. Follow the manufacturer'sdirections to program your receiver using the six-digit SAME code(s) forthe warning areas of interest to you.

The confusion immediately following a disaster is scary - especially if you have not prepared yourself in advance and discussed these ideas with yourfamily members. Hopefully every time you see or hear about a disaster it makes you stop and think... \"What if that was me or my family?\" But what have YOU done to get yourself and your family ready? The best thing you can do to deal withany type of disaster is... BE AWARE ... BE PREP ARED ... and... HAVE APLAN ! If you do these 3 things, the life you save could be your own... because what you don' tknow CAN hurt you! The more the public is prepared for a disaster, the less strain we place on our local emergency services. Any major disaster will temporarily swampFirst Responders, therefore, both the Red Cross and the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency recommend persons to try to be self-sufficient for atleast 72 hours following a disaster. And if you are prepared for a longerperiod (like 4 days to 2 weeks or more)... that's even better! A majority of this information was compiled from various publications provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, the RedCross, Public Safety Canada, the CDC and the Public Health Agency ofCanada to help assist you in preparing for various types of disasters andbasic first aid. It also offers suggestions on personal checklists and important telephone numbers for your family members and emergencygroups that can be written in the spaces provided or attached inside thismanual. Most importantly, there are many web sites throughout the book tohelp you find more information. We realize you may not experience every type of disaster in your part of the world, but if you ever travel you could potentially be placed in a disaster situation so please educate yourself and your family. Please stop your hectic lives for just a few hours and sit down with your entire family (from children to seniors) to read this Manual and discusshow each of you would handle these types of situations. It will be quality time with your loved ones and could save your lives! x www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Disaster Facts & Figures www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DISASTER FACTS & F IGURES Both natural and man-made disasters are becoming more common all around the world. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events impact billions of peoplesince these climate extremes disrupt jet streams and regions of high andlow pressure. These disruptions can potentially increase or decrease weather-related disasters such as extreme heat and cold, floods, hurricanesand thunderstorms. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Tropical Atmosphere Oceanproject, El Ni\u00f1o happens when tropical Pacific Ocean trade winds die outand ocean temperatures become unusually warm. La Ni\u00f1a occurs when thetrade winds blow unusually hard and sea temperatures become colder thannormal. These warm and cold phases are referred to as El Ni\u00f1o/SouthernOscillation, or ENSO, which has a period of roughly 3-7 years. AlthoughENSO originates in the tropical Pacific system, it has effects on patterns ofweather all over the world. 1 El Ni\u00f1o (warm episodes) occur about every 4-5 years and can last up to 12to 18 months. 2La Ni\u00f1a (cold episodes) conditions recur every few years and typically last 9 to 12 months but can persist for as long as 2 years.3 There are also periods where the system is neither warm nor cold (calledneutral conditions). Even though there is still much to learn about these systems and their impacts on the global community, ENSO forecasts can help individuals,businesses, and governments prepare for these events. To learn more about NOAA' s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project visit www .pmel.noaa.gov/tao/ In addition to the climate extremes mentioned above, some key elementsin the increasing numbers of worldwide disasters include: Global warming and cooling, earth's crust moving, etc. Larger cities are sprawling into high-risk zones World population is nearly 6 billion and growing causing global water consumption to increase Humans damaging our natural resources (e.g. pollution, destroying rain forests, coral reefs, wetlands, etc.) The World Meteorological Organization has released evidence that the 1990s were the warmest decade globally since instrumental measurementsstarted in the 1860s with 1998 being the warmest year on record so far. 2 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325GENERAL FACTS & F IGURES ONDISASTERS There are many unknowns but as our violent planet's surface continues to shift and move it will continue to alter sea levels, food and water suppliesand climate conditions around the world. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 10 million people died as a result of natural catastrophes in the 20th century. The costs of weather-related disasters in just the United States alone average $1 billion per week! Year after year it appears the most frequent natural disasters are wind- storms and floods, which combined usually account for 80%-90% of theworldwide economic losses. Every year hundreds of millions of people worldwide are evacuated or driven from their homes due to natural disasters. According to Munich Re Group, (a reinsurance company that monitors worldwide disasters) the following summarizes major losses: Worldwide # of Major # of deaths by Year Economic Losses Disasters Major Disasters 2006 $45 billion (in US $) 850 18,000 2005 $219 billion (in US $) 670 101,0002004 $150 billion (in US $) 650 245,473*2003 $65 billion (in US $) 700 89,0002002 $60 billion (in US $) 700 11,0002001 $40 billion (in US $) 720 25,0002000 $38 billion (in US $) 850 10,300 * Adjusted to reflect estimated tsunami victims as of October 2006. Please note the above figures do not include economic losses and deaths caused by smaller natural disasters that occur daily around the world. Alsonote, the 2004 tsunami killed more people in that one major event than theprevious 4 years combined. This dramatic statistic proves how devastatingdisasters can be in highly populated areas. Now let's look at some facts and figures on specific types of disasters to get a better understanding of how they impact the world. 3 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FACTS & F IGURES BYTYPEOFDISASTER Avalanches, Landslides & Mudflows Statistics show there are about 1 million snow avalanches worldwide each year. Flooding in Venezuela triggered landslides and mudflows that washed away entire villages and mountain slopes claiming more than 30,000 livesin 1999. Peru experienced one of their worst landslide disasters when a 3-million- ton block of ice split from a melting glacier creating a destructive wave ofice, mud and rocks that traveled 10 miles (16 km) in just 7 minutes killingmore than 4,000 people. Earthquakes The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there are 500,000 detectable earth-quakes in the world each year - only 100,000 are felt and 100 causedamage. The world's deadliest earthquake on record hit central China in 1557 killing an estimated 830,000 people. Scientists are finding the Cascadia Subduction zone along the Northwest coastline (from southern British Columbia to Northern California) couldproduce mega-quakes similar to the 9.0 that rocked Indonesia late-2004. Some of the strongest earthquakes in U.S. history (est 7.9-8.2) occurred on the New Madrid fault (general area between St. Louis and Memphis) backin 1811-1812. This area still experiences about 200 earthquakes a year. Two of the most violent earthquakes in North America were in British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Island (8.3) and in Anchorage Alaska (9.2). Aftershocks may be felt for several days, weeks, months or even years depending on the force of a major earthquake. Extr eme Heat According to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, 80% of the contigu-ous United States was in moderate-to-extreme drought back in July 1934. Today less than half a billion people live in water-stressed countries but projections indicate by 2025 that number could increase to 3 billion! 4 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Fire At least 80% of all fire deaths occur in residences -- and careless smoking is the leading cause of fire deaths. And cooking fires (leaving foodunattended or human error) is the leading cause of home fires. Fire kills more Americans every year than all natural disasters combined. More forests burned in 1997 than at any time in recorded history. According to a report issued by the World Wide Fund for Nature, 80% ofthose fires were set deliberately to clear land for planting or development. Floods According to FEMA, everyone lives in a flood zone - it's just a question ofwhether you live in a low, moderate or high risk area. More than 90% of declared disasters include flooding.The Worldwatch Institute reports 13 of the world's 19 megacities (cities with over 10 million people) are in coastal zones -- and 2 billion (or 1 in 3)people live within 60 miles (100 km) of a coastline. Flash floods can cause walls of water reaching heights of 20 feet (6 m). Hailstorms In 1991, Calgary Alberta experienced the worst hailstorm in Canadian history when a 30-minute storm caused about $400 million in damage. On May 22, 1986 an unusual killer hailstorm in China's Sichuan Province left 9,000 people injured and 100 dead. The largest known hailstone ever measured in the U.S. was found in Aurora, Nebraska on June 22, 2003 with a record 7-inch (17.78 cm) diameter and a circumference of 18.75 inches (over 47 cm)! Hazardous Materials As many as 500,000 products pose physical or health hazards and can bedefined as \"hazardous materials\" and over 1,000 new synthetic chemicalsare introduced each year. Each year about 400 million metric tons of hazardous wastes are generated worldwide. According to FEMA, varying quantities of hazardous materials are manu- factured, used, or stored at an estimated 4.5 million facilities in the U.S. 5 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Hurricanes, Cyclones & Typhoons Japan, China, the Philippines and other parts of Southeast and East Asia average about 20 typhoons a year. The 2005 U.S. season broke records with 27 named storms (previous record was 21 in 1933) and 15 hurricanes (previous record was 12 in 1969).The National Hurricane Center states this active cycle could last 10-20more years similar to the above-average hurricane activity from the 1940sthrough the 1960s. Nine out of 10 hurricane deaths are due to storm surge (a rise in the sea level caused by strong winds). Storm surges can get up to 20 feet (6 m)high and 50 miles (80 km) wide! One of the worst cyclone disasters in recorded history struck Bangladesh and India killing between 500,000 and 1 million people back in 1970. Nuclear Power Plants / Nuclear Incident The most immediate danger from an accident at a nuclear power plant isexposure to high levels of radiation. The April 1986 explosion at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant burned for 10 days releasing about 5% of the radioactive reactor core intothe atmosphere exposing millions of people to varying doses of radiation. According to the World Nuclear Association, about 20 million packages of all sizes containing radioactive materials are routinely transported world-wide annually on public roads, railways and ships in secure containers. 4 There has never been any accident in which a Type-B container with highly radioactive material has been breached or has leaked. 5 Terrorism According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there have beenover 661 confirmed incidents of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioac-tive materials worldwide since 1993 with several hundred more reportedbut not yet confirmed. Nearly 121 such incidents occurred in 2004 alone,11 involving nuclear material. IAEA also reports 18 of the 661 confirmedincidents involved nuclear weapons grade material. 6 The U.S. Department of Defense estimates that as many as 26 nations maypossess chemical agents and/or weapons and an additional 12 may be seek-ing to develop them. And the Central Intelligence Agency reports that atleast 10 countries are believed to possess or be conducting research on bio-logical agents for weaponization. (Per FEMA' s site as of October 23, 2005) 6 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Thunderstorms & Lightning On average, the U.S. has 100,000 thunderstorms each year. At any given moment, nearly 1,800 thunderstorms can be in progress over the face of the earth. It is a myth that lightning never strikes the same place twice -- it often strikes the same site several times in the course of one storm. Tornadoes The U.S. has more tornadoes than any other place in the world and aver-ages 1,200 tornado sightings each year. According to NOAA, 2004 had a record 1,717 tornado reports in the U.S.In 1974, during a 21-hour period, 148 tornadoes ripped through 13 states and 1 province between Alabama and Ontario, Canada killing 315 people. Tornadoes can last for several seconds or more than an hour, but most last less than 10 minutes. A waterspout is a tornado over water but isn't recorded until it hits land.The force of a tornado can strip asphalt chunks off roads, rip clothes off people and pluck feathers off chickens. Tsunamis A tsunami [soo-nah\u00b4-mee] is a series of huge, destructive waves usuallycaused by an earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide or meteorite. A tsunami is NOT a tidal wave \u2014 it has nothing to do with the tides.The 2004 seaquake-generated tsunami that slammed 12 countries in the Indian Ocean is the deadliest on record with almost 187,000 people killedand 42,883 still missing. (Per UN OSE' s web site as of October 2006) The West Coast / Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reports a 1958 landslide- generated tsunami in Lituya Bay, Alaska produced a 1,722 foot (525 m)wave. Volcanoes More than 65 active or potentially active volcanoes exist in the U.S. andover 40 of them are in Alaska! 7 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325According to the Smithsonian Institution's Global V olcanism Program, about 1,300 volcanoes have erupted in the last 10,000 years and should beconsidered \"historically active\". This does not include the large number of eruptions from an estimated 1 million young volcanoes on the ocean's floorwhich pump out roughly 3/4 of the lava reaching the earth's surface. The \"Ring of Fire\" that encircles the Pacific Ocean has about 600 histori- cally active volcanoes. V olcanic eruptions can hurl hot rocks easily 20 miles (32 km) or more. An erupting volcano can also trigger tsunamis, flash floods, lightning, earthquakes, rockfalls, landslides and mudflows. Yellowstone National Park actually sits on top of a supervolcano which erupted 3 times in the past 2 million years forming 3 massive calderas (orhuge craters). The largest one (Yellowstone Caldera) is more than 60 miles(100 km) across! According to the Yellowstone V olcano Observatory, some other large calderas formed by supervolcanoes are in Alaska, eastern California,Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand and South America. Winter Storms / Extr eme Cold The leading cause of death during winter storms is from automobile orother transportation accidents. Cold weather puts an added strain on the heart. Exhaustion or heart attacks caused by overexertion (like shoveling snow or pushing a car) are the second most likely cause of winter storm-related deaths. The risk of hypothermia is greatest among elderly persons who literally \"freeze to death\" in their own homes. The Canadian ice storm of 1998 created an economic loss of almost $3 bil- lion with massive power outages affecting over 4 million people. 8 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 1 Family Information, Plan, Kits & Shelter 9 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FAMILY INFORMATION & P HONE NUMBERS Place these records in a safe location (like a metal box or safety deposit box).

PREPARE NOWfor a sudden emergency and discuss these ideas with your entire family tocreate a Family Emergency Plan . Even though this checklist looks long and scary, it is easy to do and can help you make a plan. We suggest you and your family review this list, thenread through the Manual since there are many tips mentioned in varioustopics and Sections that could help develop your plan. PLEASE make some time in your busy lives to prepare for a disaster... a few minutes now could possibly save a life when a disaster hits! Remember - be aware... be prepared... and have a plan! LEARN ABOUT RISKS &E XISTING PLANS : (See Section 4 for phone numbers of State & Provincial Emergency Management and Red Cross offices - or check city/county white pages) [ ] Find out which disasters could occur in your area.[ ] Ask how to prepare for each disaster... but read this Manual first![ ] Ask how you will be warned of an emergency.[ ] Learn your community's evacuation routes.[ ] Ask about special assistance for elderly or disabled persons.[ ] Ask your workplace about Emergency Plans.[ ] Learn about emergency plans for your children's school(s) or day care center(s). TIPS ON MAKING YOUR FAMILY PLAN: (Review all and complete Family Emergency Plan on pages 16-17) : [ ] Meet with household members to talk about the dangers of fire, severe weather, earthquakes and other emergencies. Explain how torespond to each using the tips in this Manual. 12 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325[ ] Find safe spots in your home for each type of disaster that affects your community. (see Section 2 for explanations of each disaster) [ ] Talk about what to do when there are power outages and injuries. [ ] Draw a floor plan of your home then, using a black or blue pen, show location of doors, windows, stairways and large furniture.Mark locations of emergency supplies, disaster and first aid kits, fireextinguishers, smoke detectors, collapsible ladders, and utility shut-off points. Next, use a colored pen to draw a broken line charting atleast two escape routes from each room. [ ] Show family members how to turn off water, gas and electricity at the main switches when necessary. [ ] Post emergency telephone numbers near telephones.[ ] Teach children how and when to call 9-1-1, police and fire depart- ments (see Section 3) . [ ] Make sure household members understand they should turn on the radio for emergency information. [ ] Pick one out-of-state and a local friend or relative for family mem- bers to call if separated during a disaster. (It is often easier to callout-of-state than within the affected area.) [ ] Pick two emergency meeting places in case you can't go home. 1. A place near your home. 2. A place outside the neighborhood [ ] Teach children emergency phone numbers and meeting places.[ ] Put ICE before a name and number in cell phone address books so First Responders would know who to call \" In Case of Emergency\". [ ] Take a basic first aid and CPR class. (see Section 3 for some Red Cross programs) [ ] Practice emergency evacuation drills with all household members at least two times each year. [ ] Keep family records in a water- and fire-proof container. Consider keeping another set of records in a safety deposit box offsite. [ ] Check if you have enough insurance coverage. (see Section 2 for more information on flood insurance.) 13 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS FOR ELDERLY & D ISABLED FAMILY MEMBERS : [ ] Ask about special aid that may be available in an emergency for elderly and disabled family members. Find out if assistance isavailable for evacuation and in public shelters. FEMA suggests people with a disability register with local fire departments or emergency services office so help can be provided quickly in anemergency. Check if this is available in your community. [ ] Ask your children's teachers and caregivers about emergency plans for schools, day care centers or nursing homes. [ ] If you currently have a personal care attendant from an agency, check to see if the agency will be providing services at anotherlocation if there is an evacuation -- and tell family members. [ ] Learn what to do and where to go for each type of emergency. For example, basements are not wheelchair-accessible so you should have alternate safe places for different types of disasters for disabled or elderly persons. [ ] Learn what to do in case of power outages and personal injuries. Know how to connect or start a back-up power supply for essentialmedical equipment! [ ] If someone in the home uses a wheelchair, make sure 2 exits are wheelchair-accessible in case one exit is blocked. [ ] Consider getting a medical alert system that will allow you to call for help if you have trouble getting around. [ ] Both elderly and disabled persons should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace at all times if they have special needs. [ ] Consider setting up a \"Buddy\" system with a roommate, friend or neighbor. Give buddy a copy of your Family Emergency Plan phone numbers and keep numbers updated. Also give buddy an extra house key or tell them where one is available. [ ] Consider putting a few personal items in a lightweight draw string bag (e.g. a whistle, some medications, a small flashlight, extrahearing aid batteries, etc.) and tie it to your wheelchair or walker foremergencies. Make sure to rotate items so current and working. [ ] Visit the National Organization on Disability web site to learn more about Emergency Preparedness issues at www .nod.or g 14 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS FOR PETS OR LIVESTOCK / LARGE ANIMALS : TIPS FOR PETS [ ] If you have to evacuate your home, DO NOT leave pets behind! Make sure you take a secure pet carrier, leash or harness with you. [ ] Emergency shelters may not accept pets (unless it is a service animal assisting a disabled person). Find out which motels and hotels in your area allow pets in advance of needing them. Include your local animal shelter's number on next page since they might provide information during a disaster. [ ] Make sure identification tags are up to date and securely fastened to pet's collar or consider getting a microchip implanted in your pet.Keep a photo in your wallet for identification purposes. [ ] Make sure a roommate, neighbor or friend has an extra house key to evacuate your pets in the event you are unavailable. TIPS FOR LIVEST OCK / L ARGE ANIMALS [ ] Evacuate livestock whenever possible. Make arrangements for evacuation, including routes and host sites, in advance. Alternateroutes should be mapped out as a backup. [ ] The evacuation site should have food, water, veterinary care, handling, equipment and facilities. [ ] Trucks, trailers, and vehicles for transporting animals should be available with experienced handlers and drivers to transport them. [ ] If evacuation is not possible, a decision must be made whether to move large animals to available shelter or turn them outside. This decision should be based on the type of disaster and the soundnessand location of the shelter or structure. [ ] If you board animals, ask if facility has an evacuation plan in place.Next, we suggest you sit with your family and write down your Family Emergency Plan using the next 2 pages as a guide. Put this information on sheets of paper near telephones where everyone can see it and keep itupdated. Then review how to put together a Disaster Supplies Kit since you may not have much time if you are told to evacuate quickly. Again, we suggest you and family members read this manual together - especially your kids - since there are many tips here that could help youmake a plan and learn what to do if the unexpected happens. You may justwant to review the book first and then come back to this Section later. 15 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FAMILY EMERGENCY PLAN EMERGENCY CONTACT NUMBERS (Post a copy of this information near each phone for easy access!)

And sometimes services may be cutoff or first responders can't reach people right away. Would you and yourfamily be prepared to cope until help arrives? Both FEMA and the Red Cross recommend keeping enough supplies in your home to meet your family's needs for at least three days (we suggest 4 days to 2 weeks in home, if possible.) Once disaster threatens or hits, youmay not have time to shop or search for supplies ... but, if you've gatheredsupplies in advance in your Disaster Supplies Kit , your family could handle an evacuation or shelter living easier. And since everything is alltogether in one place... all you gotta do is GRAB & GO ! Put items you'd most likely need (water, food, first aid, emergency items, etc.) in a container that is easy-to-carry and that will fit in your vehicle. Forexample, a large trash can or storage container with a lid that snaps shuttightly (some even come with wheels), or a waterproof backpack or largeduffel bag (waterproof, if possible) would be useful. We're also including suggestions for a CAR KIT and a CLASSROOM or LOCKER or OFFICE KIT since these are usually the most common placesyou would be if and when a disaster strikes. There are seven basic categories of supplies you should stock in your home kit: water , food , first aid supplies ,tools and emergency supplies , sanitation, clothing and bedding , and special items . Take advantage of sales and stock up as you can -- also put dates on food cans or labels to show when they were purchased. Supplies should ALL be checked every 6 months to make sure they are still good and working!We suggest you mark dates on your calendar and have the entire familyhelp check all the items together. It'll be good quality time with the familyand give you all a chance to update any phone numbers or information thathas changed. WATER A normally active person needs to drink at least 2 quarts (2 litres) of water each day and possibly as much as a gallon (4 litres) a day. [ ] Store one gallon of water per person per day (two quarts/litres for drinking and two quarts/litres for food preparation and sanitation). 18 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325[ ] Keep at least a three-day supply of water for each person in home and store extra water for pets. Rotate new bottles every 6 months. [ ] Consider purchasing a certified portable water purification filter.[ ] Review TIPS ON WATER PURIFICATION at end of Section 2. FOOD Choose foods that require no refrigeration, preparation or cooking and little or no water. If you must heat food, pack a can of sterno or a smallpropane camping stove. Select foods that are compact and lightweight androtate food out every 6 months. (Keep items like this handy in pantry too.) [ ] Ready-to-eat canned meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables (and put in a manual can opener !!) [ ] Canned juices, milk, soups (if powder or cubes, store extra water)[ ] Staples - sugar, salt, pepper[ ] High energy foods - peanut butter, jelly, crackers, granola bars, trail mix, nuts, jerky, dried fruits, Emergency Food bars, etc. [ ] Vitamins & herbs (e.g. a good multiple, Vitamins C & E, garlic pills [boosts immune], L-Tyrosine [amino acid for stress], etc.) [ ] Foods for infants, elderly persons or persons on special diets[ ] Foods for your pet (if necessary)[ ] Comfort / stress foods - cookies, hard candy, suckers, sweetened cereal, instant coffee, tea bags, powdered drink mixes, etc. [ ] Some companies offer survival and long-term storage foods that are freeze dried and sold in months, 1-year, and 2-year supplies FIRST AIDKITS You should always be prepared and keep a First Aid Kit in your home and in every car and make sure everyone knows where kits are and how to use them. And if you like the outdoors (hiking, biking, etc.) you should carry asmall Kit in your fanny pack or backpack as a precaution. 19 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325There are many different sizes of First Aid Kits on the market that vary in price. You can also make your own kits using things that may already be inyour home. Consider including the following items in a waterpr oof container or bag so you can be prepared for almost any type of emergency. We realize there are a lot of items suggested here, but the more you prepare ... the better off you and your family will be during a disaster situation. ITEMS TOINCLUDE IN FIRST AID KIT - Ace bandage(s)- Adhesive bandage strips in assorted sizes- Adhesive tape- Antibiotic ointment or gel- Antiseptic towelettes- Assorted sizes of safety pins & needles- Box of Baking soda- Cleansing agent (isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and/or soap)- Cold & Heat packs- Contact lens solution and Eyewash solution- Cotton and Cotton swabs- Copy of IT'S A DISASTER! manual - Dental repair kit (usually near toothpaste section)- Disposable Face shield for Rescue Breathing- Disposable gloves and face masks (with N95 rated particulate filter)- Flashlight & batteries - check often to make sure it works & batteries are good (Tip: remove batteries while stored or get hand crank units) - Gauze pads- Hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol)- Hydrogen peroxide- Lip balm (one with SPF is best)- Liquid bandage (to seal cuts or scrapes) - Moleskin (for blisters on feet)- Petroleum jelly or other lubricant- Plastic bags- Roller gauze- Scissors- Small bottle of hand lotion- Snake bite kit with extractor- Sunscreen (choose one with SPF 30 or higher)- Thermometer- Triangular bandages- Tweezers NON-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TOINCLUDE IN FIRST AID KIT - Activated charcoal (use if advised by the Poison Control Center) 20 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325- Antacid (for upset stomach) - Anti-diarrhea medication- Antihistamine and decongestant (for allergic reactions or allergies and sinus problems) - Aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium- Laxative- Potassium Iodide (see NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY) - Vitamins & herbs (e.g. a good multiple, Vitamins C & E, garlic pills or zinc [boosts immune sys], L-Tyrosine [amino acid for stress], etc.) PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TOINCLUDE IN FIRST AID KIT Since it may be hard to get prescriptions filled during a disaster, talk toyour physician or pharmacist about storing these types of medications. And make sure to check labels for special instructions and expiration dates. TIPS ONSOME INEXPENSIVE FIRST AIDITEMS Activated charcoal - absorbs poisons and drugs in the stomach and intes- tines and helps prevent toxins from being absorbed into the bloodstream bycoating intestinal walls. (You should check with the Poison Control Centerbefore taking since it doesn't work on all toxic substances.) It is found atnatural foods stores and pharmacies in powder, liquid, and capsule forms.The capsules can also be broken open to use powder for making a paste oninsect bites and stings. Baking soda - aid for heartburn or indigestion; use as substitute for tooth- paste; sprinkle in bath water for sore muscles or bites & stings; or make apaste (3 parts baking soda to 1 part water) to use on stings or insect bites,poison ivy, canker sores, sunburn, and rashes (but too strong for infants!) Hydrogen peroxide - can help clean and disinfect wounds, treat canker sores, gingivitis, and minor earaches. Also can be used for cleaning handsor for brushing teeth. (The reason it foams up on skin or item is because ofthe oxygen at work - means it's killing germs!) Meat tenderizer - (check ingredient list on bottle for \"papain\") make a paste to use on insect bites and stings. Papain is a natural enzyme derivedfrom papaya that can help break down insect venom. Vinegar - helps relieve jellyfish stings, sunburn, and swimmer's ear.

You may not have time to shop orsearch for items once a disaster threatens or hits so make your kits now soyou're prepared for the unexpected. Some things to keep in mind include ... Store your Disaster Supplies Kit in convenient place known to ALL family members. Keep a smaller version in the trunk or back of every vehicle (see CAR KIT). Keep items in airtight plastic bags to keep them dry in kit. Take advantage of end-of-season clearance sales and grocery sales (esp. can goods) and stock up as you can. Look aroundyour home since you may be able to put a lot of these thingstogether from what is already on shelves or in drawers ormedicine cabinets. Replace your stored food and water supply every 6 months! It's best to test or replace batteries at this time too. Make agame of it by keeping track on a calendar or on a posterdrawn by children so they can help. Also, everyone shouldmeet every 6 months anyway to go over the Family Emergency Plan and update any data (phone numbers, address changes, etc.) Suggestion: Do this every DaylightSavings time - it's twice a year on a weekend so easy toremember. Ask your physician or pharmacist about storing prescription medicines. Visit the U.S. Department of Homeland Security web site for more tips about Kits at www .ready .gov 27 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325THINK ABOUT SHELTER Sheltering may take many forms since it depends on the type of disaster or situation. There may be times where you and your family may need to\"shelter-in-place\" meaning you stay put wherever you are (home, school,work or car) until wicked weather passes or local authorities say it's okayto come out. Or, in some cases, your family may have to leave your homeand go to a shelter or mass care facility determined by local officials (likea high school gym or convention center.) For example, during a tornado warning you should seek shelter in a base- ment or an inside room away from windows. However, during a hazardousspill or chemical attack you should take shelter in a room above ground andpossibly seal off room to keep gas or fumes from coming in. Or if there'sa wildfire nearby or a hurricane brewing along the Coast your family mayneed to evacuate your home. Some things you should talk about in advance with family members include: Make a plan - Develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kits for home, car and office / locker (covered on previous pages). Make sure you include important paperwork, money, etc. Pick safe rooms - Talk about which room would be best for each type of disaster that may occur where you live. (Section 2 covers things to thinkabout and do before most natural and man-made disasters with shelter tips.) Where would we go? - Decide in advance where you would go in case you can't return home for weeks or months .. or ever. If your home is damagedor destroyed or you're forced to leave your home due to on-going threats(like mudslides or flooding), you will need to find temporary or permanentliving quarters. This could mean staying in a public shelter or hotel, livingwith friends or relatives, or renting a home or apartment in the middle ofall the chaos, so discuss several options now. Then, write down thoseoptions and share them with relatives and friends. A way from home - Learn \"shelter-in-place\" procedures at work and school so everyone knows what to expect for each type of disaster or incident. Also review TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER and TIPS ON SHELTER LIVING DURING OR AFTER AN EMERGENCY at theend of Section 2. And see APPENDIX D for tips on fallout shelters. By planning ahead, your family will know where to go and what to do which can help reduce some fear and anxiety that surrounds a disaster. 28 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 2 Disaster Preparedness & Prevention 29 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325WHAT TO DOBEFORE AD ISASTER STRIKES (MITIGATION TIPS)... There are many things you can do to protect yourself, your home and your property BEFORE any type of natural hazard or disaster strikes. One of themost important things citizens can do is learn about hazards and risks inyour area and take personal responsibility to prepare for the unexpected. Please realize that natural disasters have common elements that overlap (like wind and floods) and we are only summarizing some key topics hereto help get you started. There are many mitigation tips and programs available from government agencies, public and private businesses, nonprofits and NGOs listed hereand in Section 4 of this book that can help you and your family learn more. WHAT IS MITIGATION ? Mitigation simply means an effort to lessen the impact disasters have onpeople, property, communities and the economy. It is also about reducingor eliminating risks before disasters strike and involves planning, commit-ment, preparation and communication between local, state and federal government officials, businesses and the general public. Some examples of mitigation include installing hurricane straps to secure a structure's roof to its walls and foundation, building outside of floodplains, securing shelves and loose objects inside and around the home,developing and enforcing effective building codes and standards, usingfire-retardant materials ... and the list goes on and on. Soon we'll explain what to do BEFORE, DURING and AFTER specific types of natural and man-made disasters and emergencies. But first thereare some things you should do in advance that take time and planning...otherwise known as prevention or mitigation tips. First we'll cover some mitigation strategies available for businesses and consumers, then cover mitigation tips on the two most common disasters (winds and floods ) followed by other topics listed alphabetically. Also please review the BEFORE sections on common disasters that occur inyour area since there may be a few other mitigation tips there too. Remember... the more you prepare BEFORE disaster strikes, the better off you and your loved ones will be financially, emotionally and physically! 30 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR BUSINESSES &C ONSUMERS Both the United States and Canada have national programs designed to help the public, businesses and communities prepare for the unexpected. In the U.S., the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Mitigation Division (formerly FIMA) combines organizational activities topromote Protection, Prevention, and Partnerships at the Federal, State,Local and individual levels to lessen the impact of disasters upon families,homes, communities and economy through damage prevention and floodinsurance. The Mitigation Division manages the National Flood Insurance Program and oversees a number of FEMA's programs and activities like theNational Hurricane Program, National Dam Safety Program, NationalEarthquake Hazards Reduction Program and others. For example,Mitigation Grant Programs provide funding for State and Local govern-ments to reduce the loss of lives and property on future disasters, andMitigation Planning offers resources to determine risks and hazards incommunities. Plus the Division provides citizens information about \"saferooms\" and flood insurance, and small businesses can learn about Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) loans and other cost-saving mitigation tips forstructures and property. To learn more please visit FEMA online at www .fema.gov In Canada, Public Safety Canada (formerly Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada) is working with federal departments and agencies todetermine how the Government of Canada can support the development ofa National Disaster Mitigation Strategy and the co-operative arrangementsthat are needed for its implementation. To learn more please visit PS online at www .publicsafety .gc.ca MITIGATION TIPS TO HELP PREVENT DAMAGE AND LOSS WINDMITIGA TION (MOST COMMON ) Wind damage is the most common disaster-related expense and usually accounts for about 70% or more of the insured losses reported worldwide.Many natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, microbursts or thunder-storms, and winter storms include damaging winds. And certain parts of theworld experience high winds on a normal basis due to wind patterns. Realize when extreme winds strike they are not constant - they rapidly increase and decrease. A home in the path of wind causes the wind to 31 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325change direction. This change in wind direction increases pressure on parts of the house creating stress which causes the connections between buildingcomponents to fail. For example, the roof or siding can be pulled off or thewindows can be pushed in. S trengthen weak spots on home Experts believe there are four areas of your home that should be checked for weakness -- the roof, windows, doors and garage doors. Homeownerscan take some steps to secure and strengthen these areas but some thingsshould be done by an experienced builder or contractor. ROOF: Truss bracing or gable end bracing (supports placed strategically to strengthen the roof) Anchors, clips and straps can be installed (may want to call a professional since sometimes difficult to install) WINDOWS and DOORS: Storm shutters (for windows, French doors, sliding glass doors, and skylights) or keep plywood on hand Reinforced bolt kits for doors GARAGE DOORS: Certain parts of the country have building codes requiring garage doors to withstand high winds (check with local building officials) Some garage doors can be strengthened with retrofit kits (involves installing horizontal bracing onto each panel) Secur e mobile homes Make sure your trailer or mobile home is securely anchored. Consult the manufacturer for information on secure tiedown systems. Secur e or tie down loose stuf f Extreme winds can also cause damage from flying debris that can act like missiles and ram through walls, windows or the roof if the wind speeds arehigh enough. You should consider securing large or heavy equipmentinside and out to reduce some of the flying debris like patio furniture, bar-beque grills, water heaters, garbage cans, bookcases and shelving, etc. Consider building a shelter or\"safe r oom\" Shelters or \"safe rooms\" are designed to provide protection from the high winds expected during hurricanes, tornadoes and from flying debris.Shelters built below ground provide the best protection, but be aware theycould be flooded during heavy rains. 32 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FEMA provides an excellent free booklet called \"Taking Shelter From the Storm: Building a Safe Room Inside Your House\" developed in associationwith the Wind Engineering Research Center at Texas Tech University. Learn more about safe rooms by visiting www .fema.gov FLOOD MITIGA TION (2NDMOST COMMON ) Flood damage is normally the second most common disaster-related expense of insured losses reported worldwide. Many natural disasters likehurricanes, tornadoes, rain, thunderstorms, and melting snow and ice causeflooding. According to FEMA, everyone lives in a flood zone - it's just a question of whether you live in a low, moderate or high risk area. There are certainparts of North America known as \"flood plains\" that are at high risk offloods. You may want to contact your local emergency management offi-cial to develop a community-based approach and there may even be fundsavailable to assist you and your area. Some examples of State grant programs officials can access include the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program ( HMGP ), Flood Mitigation Assistance Pre-Disaster Mitigation ( PDM ) Program. Individual citizens cannot apply for grant money but local agencies or non-profit organizations may apply on behalf of citizens. But I have insurance... Insurance companies will cover some claims due to water damage like a broken water main or a washing machine that goes berserk. However, standard home insurance policies DO NOT generally cover flood (or mud)damage caused by natural events or disasters! The United States offers a National Flood Insurance Program available in most communities and there is a waiting period for coverage. Talk toyour local insurance agent, check the Yellow Pages, or contact NFIP at1-888-379-9531 or 1-800-427-5593 (TTY) or visit www .floodsmart.gov . Currently Canadians do not have a national flood program, however, there are certain parts of Canada that offer limited flood-damage coverage but itmust be purchased year-round and the rates are relatively high. TheInsurance Bureau of Canada suggests you consult your insurance repre-sentative with questions regarding coverage. Move valuables to higher ground If your home or business is prone to flooding, you should move valuables and appliances out of the basement or ground level floors. 33 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Elevate br eakers, fuse box and meters Consider phoning a professional to elevate the main breaker or fuse box and utility meters above the anticipated flood level so flood waters won'tdamage your utilities. Also consider putting heating, ventilation and airconditioning units in the upper story or attic to protect from flooding. Pr otect your proper ty Build barriers and landscape around homes or buildings to stop or reduce floodwaters and mud from entering . Also consider sealing basement walls with waterproofing compounds and installing \"check valves\" in sewertraps to prevent flood water from backing up into drains. The next few pages cover some key mitigation tips on several types of disasters and topics (sorted alphabetically). After this mitigation section wecover specific natural and man-made disasters in more detail. AIR QUALITY MITIGA TION We want to briefly mention indoor air quality here since it affects so manypeople at home, school and work (especially children and the elderly).Poor air quality often results naturally from many environmental andweather-related factors. There are things people can do like install a High Efficiency Particulate Air(HEPA ) filter in your central heating and cooling system (or get a portable filter) to remove contaminants. There are also kits available fortesting home, work and school environments so please learn more aboutcarbon monoxide ,mold , and radon by visiting or calling ... EPA's Indoor Air Quality: www .epa.gov/iaq or call 1-800-438-4318 Center for Disease Control's National Center for Environmental Health Air Pollution & Respiratory Health: www .cdc.gov/nceh/airpollution National Radon Info Line: 1-800-SOS-Radon or www .epa.gov/radon EARTHQUAKE MITIGA TION A lot of the ongoing research by scientists, engineers and emergencypreparedness officials has resulted in improvements to building codesaround the world. Proven design and construction techniques are availablethat help limit damage and injuries. There are some things you can do toreduce risk in earthquake-prone areas: Consider retrofitting your home There are options to retrofit or reinforce your home's foundation and frame available from reputable contractors who follow strict building codes. 34 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Other earthquake-safety measures include installing flexible gas lines and automatic gas shutoff valves. Changes to gas lines and plumbing in yourhouse must be done by a licensed contractor who will ensure that the workis done correctly and according to code. This is important for your safety. Secur e loose stuf f Use nylon straps or L-braces to secure cabinets, book- cases and other tall furniture to the wall. Secure heavy appliances like water heaters, refrigerators, etc. using bands of perforated steel (plumber's tape). Use buckles or safety straps to secure computers, TVs, stereos and other equipment to tabletops. Use earthquake or florist putty to tack down glassware, heirlooms and figurines. FIRE MITIGA TION Home fire protection is very important and covered on pages 55-56. Alsosee Wildfire Mitigation to learn additional ways to protect your home. LIGHTNING MITIGA TION Here are some safety tips to prepare your home for lightning. Install a Lightning Pr otection System A lightning protection system does not prevent lightning from striking but does create a direct path for lightning to follow. Basically, a lightningprotection system consists of air terminals (lightning rods) and associatedfittings connected by heavy cables to grounding equipment. This providesa path for lightning current to travel safely to the ground. Install surge pr otectors on or in home Surge protection devices (SPDs) can be installed in the electrical panel to protect your entire home from electrical surges. Sometimes it may benecessary to install small individual SPDs in addition to the home unit forcomputers and television sets due to different ratings and voltage levels. If a home unit is too expensive, consider getting individual surge protec- tion devices that plug into the wall for the refrigerator, microwave andgarage door openers. Appliances that use two services (cable wire and electrical cord) may require combination SPDs for computers, TVs, andVCRs. (Better yet - consider getting an uninterrupted power supply [UPS]with surge protection and battery backup so you can shut down computerssafely.) 35 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325WILDFIRE MITIGA TION As our population continues to grow, more and more people are building homes in places that were once pristine wilderness areas. Homeownerswho build in remote and wooded areas must take responsibility for the waytheir buildings are constructed and the way they landscape around them. Use Fir e Resistant Building Materials The roof and exterior structure of your home and other buildings should be constructed of non-combustible or fire-resistant materials. If wood siding,cedar shakes or any other highly combustible materials are used, theyshould be treated with fire retardant chemicals. Landscape wisely Plant fire-resistant shrubs and trees to minimize the spread of fire and space your landscaping so fire is not carried to your home or other surroundingvegetation. Remove vines from the walls of your home. Cr eate a \"safety zone\" ar ound the house Mow grass regularly. Stack firewood at least 100 feet (30 m) away and uphill from home. Keep roof and gutters free of pine needles, leaves, and branches and clear away flammable vegetation at least 30to 100 feet (9 to 30 m) from around structures. Thin a 15-foot (4.5 m) space between tree crowns and remove limbs within 10-15 feet (3 - 4.5 m) of the ground. Remove dead branches that extend over the roof. Prune tree branches and shrubs within 10 feet (3 m) of a stovepipe or chimney outlet. Remove leaves and rubbish from under structures. Ask power company to clear branches from power lines. Keep combustibles away from structures and clear a 10- foot (3 m) area around propane tanks, boats, etc. Pr otect your home Install smoke detectors, test them each month and change batteries once a year. Install protective shutters or fire-resistant drapes. Inspect chimneys twice a year and clean every year. Cover chimney and stovepipe flue openings with 1/2 inch (1 cm) or smaller non-flammable mesh screen. Use same mesh screen beneath porches, decks, floor areas and home itself. Also screen openings to attic and roof. 36 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325 Soak ashes and charcoal briquettes in water for two days in a metal bucket. Keep a garden hose connected to an outlet. Have fire tools handy (ladder, shovel, rake, ax, etc.) Put address on all structures so it can be seen from road. WINTER STORM & E XTREME COLD MITIGA TION Severe winter weather causes deterioration and damage to homes every year. There are many things you can do to prepare for the bitter cold, iceand snow in advance to save you money and headaches in the long run.Some of these tips should be used by apartment dwellers too! \"W interize\" your home Insulate walls and attic. Caulk and weather-strip doors and windows. Install storm windows or cover windows with plastic film from the inside to keep warmth in. Detach garden hoses and shut-off water supply to those faucets. Install faucet covers or wrap with towels and duct tape. Show family members the location of your main water valve and mark it so you can find it quickly. Drain sprinkler water lines or well lines before the first freeze. Keep inside temperature of your home at 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or higher. Wrap pipes near exterior walls with towels or heating tape. Change furnace filters regularly and have it serviced. Make sure you have good lighting from street and drive- ways to help others see snow and ice patches and try tokeep paths clear of drifts. Remove dead tree branches since they break easily. Cover fireplace / stovepipe openings with fire-resistant screens. Check shingles to make sure they are in good shape. Pr eventing \"ice dams\" A lot of water leakage and damage around outside walls and ceilings are actually due to \"ice dams\". Ice dams are lumps of ice that form on gutters 37 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325or downspouts and prevent melting snow from running down. An attic with no insulation (like a detached garage) or a well-sealed and insulated atticwill generally not have ice dams. But if the roof has peaks and valleys, ispoorly insulated, or has a large roof overhang, ice dams usually happen. Some tips to prevent ice dams: Keep gutters and downspouts clear of leaves and debris. Find areas of heat loss in attic and insulate it properly. Wrap or insulate heating duct work to reduce heat loss. Remove snow buildup on roof and gutters using snow rake or soft broom. Consider installing roof heat tapes (electric cables) that clip onto the edge of your shingles to melt channels in theice. (Just remember - cables use a lot of energy and maynot be pretty but could help on older homes with compli-cated roofs.) Pr eventing fr ozen pipes Keep doors open under sinks so heat can circulate. Run a slow trickle of lukewarm water and check water flow before going to bed and when you get up. (First signof freezing is reduced water flow so keep an eye on it!) Heat your basement or at least insulate it well. Close windows and keep drafts away from pipes since air flow can cause pipes to freeze more often. MITIGATION TIPSSUMMARY ... Take r esponsibility ... Basically, no matter where you live, YOU should take personal responsi-bility and prepare yourself, your family and your property BEFORE disasters or natural hazards strike. ...and learn mor e! After reviewing the remainder of this manual, please contact your local emergency officials or your local building department to learn about all therisks in your area and what to expect if disaster strikes. Or visit FEMA's Mitigation Division at www .fema.gov 38 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Remember ... it's not a matter of IF but rather WHEN a disaster of some type will affect you or a loved one. The best thing you can do to deal withANY type of disaster is... BE AWARE ... BE PREP ARED ... and... HAVE APLAN ! If you do these 3 things, the life and property you save could be your own... because what you don' tknow CAN hurt you! Now we are going to explain what to do BEFORE , DURING and AFTER specific types of natural and man-made disasters (sorted alpha- betically). Then we'll cover some tips on RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER (includes many \"AFTER\" tips that apply to most every type of disaster)and on SHELTER LIVING . We then offer some tips on USING HOUSEHOLD FOODS , WATER PURIFICATION , and SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE followed by tips for HELPING OTHERS at the end this Section. Section 3 covers a variety of basic First Aid topics (sorted alphabetically) that may be necessary to use during a major disaster or just for the minorinjury at home. Section 4 contains many helpful telephone numbers of organizations in America and Canada. And finally, we ask you please take some time to review the Appendixes, resources and web sites near the back of this manual. As mentioned in the Introduction, a majority of this data was compiled from various publications provided by the U.S. Department of HomelandSecurity and FEMA, the CDC, Public Safety Canada, the Red Cross andothers to assist you in preparing for various disasters. We realize you may not experience every type of disaster or emergency in your part of the world but, if you ever travel away from home, you couldpotentially be placed in a disaster situation so please educate yourself andyour family. Knowledge is power and can help reduce fear and anxiety. 39 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... AV ALANCHES , LANDSLIDES & M UDFLOWS ? Avalanches - masses of loosened snow or ice that tumble down the side of a mountain, often growing as it descends picking up mud, rocks, trees anddebris triggered by various means including wind, rapid warming, snowconditions and humans. Landslides - masses of rock, earth or debris that move down a slope and can be caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and by humans whodevelop on land that is unstable. Mudflows - rivers of rock, earth, and other debris soaked with water most- ly caused by melting snow or heavy rains and create a \"slurry\". A \"slurry\"can travel several miles from its source and grows in size as it picks uptrees, cars, and other things along the way just like an avalanche! Please realize data on avalanches fill up entire books and we are briefly touching on some basic information here with some references to obtainmore information, then we'll cover landslides and mudflows. A valanche Basics Snow avalanches are a natural process and happen about a million times per year worldwide. Contrary to what is shown in the movies, avalanchesare not triggered by loud noises like a shout or a sonic boom -- it's just not enough force. An avalanche is actually formed by a combination of several things -- a steep slope (the terrain), the snowpack, a weak layer inthe snowpack, and a natural or artificial \"trigger\". Nearly all avalanches that involve people are triggered by the victim or a member of their party. Each year avalanches claim between 100-200 livesaround the world and thousands of people are partly buried or injured inthem. Millions of skiers, hikers, climbers, boarders, and snowmobilers venture out to enjoy winter sports each year pushing towns, roads and activitiesinto avalanche-prone areas. Compound that with recreationists who crossinto the backcountry with little or no basic avalanche training... and you'vegot a recipe for potential disaster! Types of avalanches Slab - the most dangerous type of avalanche since it causes most fatalities. Experts compare slab avalanches to a dinner plate sliding off the table - aheavier plate of snow slides on top of weaker snow down a slope. An 40 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325average-sized dry slab avalanche travels about 80 mph (128 km/h) and it's nearly impossible to outrun it or get out of the way! Most avalanche deaths are caused by slab even though there are many obvious signs that indicate danger -- so educate yourself before venturingout into the backcountry. Powder or loose snow - fresh fallen, light, dry snow (similar to fine sugar) rolls downhill with speeds of 110-180 mph (180-290 km/h) and swirls ofpowder climbing several thousand feet into the air. This is the most com-mon type of avalanche and the danger is usually not the weight or volumebut rather victims being pushed over a cliff or into a tree. Some other types of avalanches include ice falls , wetand point release . You can find more information on the Internet at the WestWide Avalanche Network web site www .avalanche.or gor visit your local library. Typical Avalanche Victims Nearly everyone caught in an avalanche is either skiing, snowboarding, riding a snowmobile, snowshoeing, hiking or climbing in the backcountryand they, or someone in their party, almost always trigger the avalanchethat injures or kills them. According to the American AvalancheAssociation, the majority of victims are white, educated men between theages of 18-35 who are very skilled at their sport. One key is for the public to take personal responsibility and learn more about avalanche risks and safety procedures. The AAA has seen an increasein attendance now that avalanche educators have re-designed their coursesto accommodate snowmobilers, snowboarders and other groups. People should be prepared and learn how to recognize, assess and avoid avalanche danger by taking an avalanche-related course before entering the backcountry. The \"A valanche Triangle\" The following was excerpted from the U.S.D.A. Forest Service National Avalanche Center at www .fsavalanche.or g(see \"Avalanche Basics\"): Avalanches are formed by a combination of 3 ingredients (sometimes called the \"avalanche triangle\")... Terrain - the slope must be steeper than 25 degrees and most often occur on slopes between 35 and 45 degrees. Most slab avalanches occur onslopes with starting zone angles between about 30 and 45 degrees. 41 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Snowpack - the snowpack accumulates layer by layer with each weather event and both strong and weak layers exist. Strong layers contain smallround snow grains that are packed closely together and well bonded (orcohesive). Weak layers are less dense and appear loose or \"sugary\". Whena strong dense layer is over a weak less dense layer it's like a brick on topof potato chips -- the chips can't hold up the weight of the brick so an ava-lanche occurs. Backcountry recreationists must learn the relationship ofthese layers because weak layers prevent strong layers from bonding withone another thus causing unstable conditions. A snowpack is balanced between stress and strength -- add additional stress (like more snow or a human) and an avalanche could be triggered. W eather - precipitation, wind and temperature can alter the stability of the snowpack by changing the balance between stress and strength. The typeof precipitation and at what rate it falls are equally as important as theamount. If a lot of snow falls in a short amount of time, the snowpack hasless time to adjust to the additional stress. Wind can blow large amounts ofsnow around shifting the stress on the snowpack. And rapid warming temperatures can cause snowpacks to become very wet and unstable. BEFORE ANAV ALANCHE : Learn risks - Ask about local risks by contacting your local emergency management office (see Section 4 for State and Provincial listings), especially if visiting or moving to an \"avalanche-prone\" area. Take a course - Professional trainers and educators offer a variety of ava- lanche safety training courses and levels ranging from recreational novicesto backcountry experts. To learn more visit www .avalanche.or gand click on \"Resources\" then \"Education\". Know your colors - Learn the Avalanche Danger Scales and corresponding colors used where you live or plan to visit. Get equipped - Carry avalanche rescue equipment or gear like portable shovels, collapsible probes or ski-pole probes, high frequency avalanchebeacons (transceivers), etc. and learn how to use it! Remember ... justhaving avalanche equipment will NOT keep you out of an avalanche!! Check it out - Check forecasts and avalanche advisories before going out. Turn it on - Switch beacon on prior to entering the backcountry! Check the battery strength and verify the \"transmit\" and \"receive\" functionality witheveryone in your group to ensure beacons are picking up both signals. 42 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Secure it - Before crossing a snow covered slope in avalanche terrain, fasten clothing securely to keep snow out and remove your ski pole straps. DURING AN AV ALANCHE : Bail - Try out get out of the way if possible! (For example, if a skier or boarder - ski out diagonally... if on a snowmobile - drive downhill, etc.) If YOU are caught in the avalanche... Scream and drop it - Yell and drop your ski poles (or anything in your hands) so they don't drag you down. Start swimming - Use \"swimming\" motions, thrusting upward to try to stay near the surface of the snow. Prepare to make an air pocket - Try to keep your arms and hands moving so the instant the avalanche stops you can make an air pocket in front ofyour face by punching in the snow around you before it sets. If you see SOMEONE ELSE caught in the avalanche... W atch - Keep an eye on victim as they are carried downhill, paying partic- ular attention to the last point you saw them. AFTER AN AV ALANCHE : If YOU are caught in the avalanche... Make an air pocket ASAP! - The INSTANT the avalanche stops try to maintain an air pocket in front of your face by using your hands and armsto punch in the snow and make a pocket of air. (You only have 1-3 secondsbefore the snow sets -- and most deaths are due to suffocation!) S tick it out - If you are lucky enough to be near the surface, try to stick out an arm or a leg so that rescuers can find you. Don' t panic - Keep your breathing steady to help preserve your air space and help your body conserve energy. Listen for rescuers - Since snow is such a good insulator, rescuers probably won't even hear you until they are practically on top of you, sodon't start yelling until you hear them. (This will conserve your preciousair!) 43 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If you see SOMEONE ELSE caught in the avalanche... Watch - Keep watching the victim(s) as they are carried downhill, paying particular attention to the last point you saw them. DO NOT go for help! - Sounds crazy but the victim only has a few min- utes to breathe under the snow, so every second counts! Spend 30 minutesto an hour searching before going for help (unless you have a large partyand someone can go while the rest search). Be aware - Assess the situation and dangers... in many cases it is safe to go in after the avalanche settles but proceed with caution! Look for clues - Start looking for any signs on the surface (like poles, a hand or foot, etc.) where victim was last seen. And remember, equipmentand clothing can be ripped off during the avalanche but can help determinethe direction they were carried. Switch to \"receive\" - Turn all transceivers to \"receive\" to try to locate vic- tim's signal (in the event victim is wearing one and has it set correctly!) Mark the spot - If you lost sight of the victim or can't find any visible clues on the surface, mark the spot where victim was last seen. Probe in a line - When searching with probes, stand shoulder to shoulder in a line across the slope and repeatedly insert probes moving down the slope. Listen - Make sure you listen for any muffled sounds as you search. Find them...dig 'em out! - If you find the victim, dig them out as quickly as possible! Survival chances reduce the longer they are buried. To learn more about avalanches visit www .avalanche.or g. Or see our ADDITIONAL RESOURCES & WEB SITES listed at the end of this book. Now we will briefly cover LANDSLIDES and MUDFLOWS . Realize many types of disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, rain and winderosion can cause land, rocks and mud to shift and move, sometimes atrapid speeds. Compound that with gravity and these earth movements canbecome extremely destructive. Another major factor is the world's growing population is sprawling out of major cities and developing in high-risk areas. There are some warningsigns to indicate if you have a potential problem. 44 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325BEFORE AL ANDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW : Learn risks - Ask your local emergency management office (see Section 4 for State & Provincial listing) if your property is a \"landslide-prone\" area. Or call your County/Municipal or State/Provincial Geologist or Engineer. Get insurance...? - Talk to your agent and find out more about the National Flood Insurance Program since mudflows are covered by NFIP's flood policy. (Visit www .floodsmar t.gov - also see FLOOD MITIGATION) Be prepared to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) Where would we go? - Decide in advance where you would go in case you can't return home for weeks or months .. or ever. If your home is damagedor destroyed or you're forced to leave your home due to on-going threats(like mudslides or flooding), you'll need to find temporary or permanentliving quarters. This could mean staying in a public shelter or hotel, livingwith friends or relatives, or renting a home or apartment in the middle ofall the chaos, so discuss several options now. Then, write down thoseoptions and share them with relatives and friends. Reduce risks - Plant ground cover on slopes and build retaining walls. Inspect - Look around home and property for landslide warning signs: cracks or bumps appear on hill slopes, ground or roads water or saturated ground in areas not normally wet evidence of slow, downhill movement of rock and soil tilted trees, poles, decks, patios, fences or walls doors and windows stick or cracks appear on walls, etc. Call an expert...? - Consult a professional landscaping expert for opinions and advice on landslide problems. DURING A LANDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW : Strange sounds - Listen for trees cracking, rocks banging together or water flowing rapidly (especially if near a stream or river) - could be close by! Move it! - Whether you are in a vehicle, outside, or in your home - GET TO SAFER GROUND! Be small - If there is no way to escape, curl into a tight ball and protect your head the best you can. 45 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325(Since most other disasters cause landslides and mudflows, we'll discuss them further in those specific cases - please see other topics to learn more.) AFTER A LANDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW : Listen - Local radio and TV reports will keep you posted on latest updates or check with your local police or fire departments. Don' t go there - Stay away from the area until authorities say all is clear since there could be more slides or flows. Things to watch for : flooding - usually occur after landslides or debris flows damaged areas - roadways and bridges may be buried, washed-out or weakened -- and water, gas & sewer linesmay be broken downed power lines - report them to power company Inspect - Look for damage around home and property and watch for new landslide warning signs: check foundation, chimney, garage and other structures report any broken utility lines or damaged roads to local authorities watch for tilted trees, poles, decks, patios, fences or walls notice doors or windows stick, cracks appear, etc. Replant - Try to fix or replant damaged ground to reduce erosion, possible flash flooding or future landslides. Call an expert...? - Consult a professional landscaping expert for opinions and advice on landslide problems. Also call an expert out if you discoverstructural damage to home, chimney or other buildings. Insurance - If your home suffers any damage, contact your insurance agent and keep all receipts for clean-up and repairs.

Earthquakes can cause buildings and bridges to collapse, down telephone and power lines, and result in fires, explosions and landslides. Earthquakescan also cause huge ocean waves, called tsunamis [soo-nah'-mees], whichtravel long distances over water until they hit coastal areas. Our planet's surface is actually made up of slowly-moving sections (called \"tectonic plates\") that can build up friction or stress in the crust as theycreep around. An earthquake occurs when this built up stress is suddenlyreleased and transmitted to the surface of the earth by earthquake waves(called seismic waves). There are actually about one million small earthquakes, or seismic tremors, per year around the world. Many earthquakes are too small to be felt, butwhen they happen, you will feel shaking, quickly followed by a rollingmotion that can rotate up, down, and sideways that lasts from a few seconds to several minutes! BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE : Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with earthquakes... Earthquake - a sudden slipping of the earth's crust that causes a series of vibrations Aftershock - usually not as strong as earthquake but can occur for hours, days, months or years after a main quake Fault - area of weakness where two sections of crust have separated Subduction zone - where 2 tectonic plates collide and one plate dives or \"subducts\" underneath the other Epicenter - area of the earth's surface directly above the crust that caused the quake Seismic Waves - vibrations that travel from the center of the earthquake to the surface Magnitude - used to define how much energy was released (A Richter Scale is the device used to measurethis energy on a scale from 0-10 ... each whole numberequals an increase of about 30 times the energy releasedmeaning a 5.0 is about 30 times stronger than a 4.0.) Prepare - See EARTHQUAKE MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. 47 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Reduce risks - Look for things that could be hazardous... Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves and fasten shelves to walls, if possible. Hang heavy pictures and mirrors away from beds. Store bottled foods, glass, china and other breakables on low shelves or in cabinets that can fasten shut. Repair faulty electrical wiring and leaky gas connections. Learn to shut of f- Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions. Do drills - Hold earthquake drills with your family to learn what to do... DUCK - drop down to the floor COVER - get under heavy desk or table or against inside wall protecting head and neck with your arms HOLD - grab something sturdy, be ready to move with it and hold on until shaking stops! Make a plan - Review Section 1 and develop a Family Emergency Plan. Check policies - Review your insurance policies. Some damage may be covered even without specific earthquake insurance. DURING AN EARTHQUAKE : Stay calm & be aware - Watch for falling objects and find a safe spot! Realize most injuries happen when people are hit by things when runningIN or OUT of buildings. IF INDOORS - Stay inside and ... Avoid danger zones like glass, windows, heavy things that can fall over or down on you. DUCK , COVER and HOLD until the shaking stops. If there isn't a table or desk near you, cover face and headwith arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building. IF IN A HIGH-RISE BUILDING - Stay on the same floor! Move away from outside walls and windows. Stay on the same floor - you may not have to evacuate. Realize electricity may go out and alarms and sprinkler systems may go on. DO NOT use the elevators! 48 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF OUTDOORS - Stay outside and, if possible, move away from build- ings, signs, trees, power lines and street lights. IF IN A MOVING VEHICLE - Stop as quickly and safely as you can! Try not to stop near buildings, trees, overpasses, or power lines and stay in vehicle until shaking stops. Watch for road and bridge damage and be ready for after- shocks once you drive again. If you are trapped in an area : light - use a flashlight (if you have one) - don't use matches or lighters in case of gas leaks be still - try to stay still so you won't kick up dust breathing - cover your mouth with a piece of clothing make noise - tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can hear you (shouting may cause you to inhale a lot of dust) AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE : Aftershocks - Usually not as strong but can cause more damage to weak- ened structures and may continue for days, months or even years. Injuries - Check yourself and people around you for injuries - do not try to move seriously injured people unless they are in danger. If you must movea person who is passed out keep their head and neck still and call for help!(see Section 3 - TIPS ON BASIC FIRST AID) Light - Never use candles, matches or lighters since there might be gas leaks. Use flashlights or battery powered lanterns. Check home - Look for structural damage -- call a professional if needed. Check chimney - First check from a distance to see if chimney looks nor- mal and have a professional check it if it looks strange! Check out theChimney Safety Institute of America's homeowner tips at www .csia.or g Clean up - Any flammable liquids (bleaches, gasoline, etc.) should be cleaned up immediately. Inspect - Check all utility lines and appliances for damage: smell gas or hear hissing - open a window and leave quickly. Shut off main valve outside, if possible, and calla professional to turn back on when it's safe 49 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325electrical damage - switch off power at main fuse box or circuit breaker water pipes - shut off water supply at the main valve toilets - do not use until you know sewage lines are okay Water - If water is cut off or contaminated then use water from your Disaster Supplies Kit or other clean water sources. Phones - Keep calls to a minimum to report emergencies since most lines will be down. Listen - Keep up on news reports for the latest information. Things to avoid: going out - try to stay off the roads to reduce risk stay away - unless emergency crew or First Responders ask for your help stay away from damaged areas downed power wires Tsunami - If you live near the coast, a tsunami can crash into the shorelines so listen for warnings by local authorities. (see section on TSUNAMIS) RED or GREEN sign in window - After a disaster, V olunteers and Emergency Service personnel will be going door-to-door to check on peo-ple. By placing a sign in your window that faces the street near the door,you can let them know if you need them to STOP HERE or MOVE ON . Either use a piece of RED or GREEN construction paper or draw a big RED or GREEN \"X\" (using a crayon or marker) on a piece of paper and tape it in the window. RED means STOP HERE! GREEN means EVERYTHING IS OKAY...MOVE ON! Nothing in the window would also mean STOP HERE! Recovery tips - Review TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER at end of this Section. 50 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... ANEV ACUATION ? Evacuations are quite common and happen for a number of reasons - fires, floods, mudflows, hurricanes, or chemical spills on the roads or railways. When community evacuations become necessary, local officials provide information to the public usually through the media. Government agencies,the Red Cross and other disaster relief organizations provide emergencyshelter and supplies. But, as we have said before, you should have enoughfood, water, clothing and emergency supplies for 3 - 4 days - or longer ina major disaster - in case you cannot be reached by relief efforts. The amount of time to evacuate obviously depends on the type of disaster. Hurricanes can be tracked and allow a day or two notice to get ready, butmany types of disasters happen without much notice... so prepare NOW!! BEFORE AN EV ACUATION : Ask & learn - Ask emergency management officials about community evacuation plans and learn the routes that should be used. Also learn thesigns used for your area - and, if you're traveling, make a mental note whatevacuation signs look like in case something happens while on the road.And ask if your local officials have developed pet-friendly shelters and pet-related disaster plans through the 2006 PETS Act. Make a plan - Review Section 1 and develop a Family Emergency Plan (so you know where to meet if separated, know what schools or day caresdo with kids, have a Disaster Supplies Kit ready to go, etc.) If you don't have a car, make arrangements with friends, neighbors or local officials soyou have a way to evacuate. Where do we go? - Talk with your family members and decide in advance where you would go in case you can't return home for weeks or months. Ifyour home is damaged or destroyed or you're forced to leave your homedue to on-going threats (like mudslides or flooding), you will need to findtemporary or permanent living quarters. This could mean staying in a pub-lic shelter or hotel, living with friends or relatives, or renting a home orapartment in the middle of all the chaos, so discuss several options. Then,write down your various options and share them with relatives and friends. Paperwork & money - As discussed in Section 1, put important paperwork (wills, photo I.D.s, insurance policies, list of bank and credit card numbers,etc.) in a portable fireproof container (and have copies in an off-site safety 51 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325deposit box) so you have identification to get access to your bank or to set up new accounts if you have to relocate long-term to another town. Fill 'er up - Keep car fueled up -- stations may close during an emergency. Learn to shut of f- Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions (andkeep a wrench handy). Review tips on basic needs - Please review TIPS ON SHELTER LIVING, TIPS ON USING HOUSEHOLD FOODS, TIPS ON WATER PURIFICA-TION and TIPS ON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE near end of thissection to prepare yourself and family for what to expect. DURING AN EV ACUATION : Listen - Keep up on news reports for the latest information. Grab & Go - Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit (has water, food, clothing, emergency supplies, insurance and financial records, etc. ready to go). What do I wear? - Put on protective clothing (long sleeve shirt and pants) and sturdy shoes - may even want to grab a jacket, hat or cap. Shut of f utilities - Turn off main water valve and electricity (if authorities tell you to do so). Secure home - Close and lock doors and windows, unplug appliances, protect water pipes (if freezing weather), tie down boats, etc. (See specific types of disaster for additional tips on securing home.) Alert family / friends - Let others know where you are going (or at least leave a message or note in clear view explaining where you can be found). Things to avoid : bad weather - leave early enough so you're not trapped shortcuts - may be blocked -- stick to the recommended Evacuation routes flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines Review tips on basic needs - Make sure you review tips on SHELTER LIVING, USING HOUSEHOLD FOODS, WATER PURIFICATION andSANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE at end of this section to prepare yourfamily for the unexpected. 52 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... EXTREME HEAT? What is Extreme Heat? Temperatures that hover 10 degrees or more above the average high temperature for that area and last for several weeksare considered \"extreme heat\" or a heat wave . Humid and muggy condi- tions can make these high temperatures even more unbearable. Really dryand hot conditions can cause dust storms and low visibility. Droughts occur when a long period passes without enough rainfall. A heat wavecombined with a drought is a very dangerous situation! Doing too much on a hot day, spending too much time in the sun or stay- ing too long in an overheated place can cause heat-related illnesses . Know the symptoms of heat illnesses and be ready to give first aid treatment. (see HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES in Section 3) BEFORE EXTREME HEATHITS: Keep it cool - Tips to keep hot air out and cool air inside include... Close any floor heat vents nearby. Seal gaps around window units with foam or duct tape. Use a circulating or box fan to spread the cool air around. Use aluminum foil covered cardboard in windows to reflect heat back outside. Use weather-stripping on doors and windowsills. Keep storm windows up all year to help keep cool in. DURING EXTREME HEAT: Protect windows - If you hang shades, drapes, sheets, or awnings on win- dows you can reduce heat from entering home by as much as 80%. Conserve power - During heat waves there are usually power shortages since everyone is trying to cool off, so stay indoors as much as possible. Conserve water - Tips to lower water usage, esp. during drought conditions Check plumbing for leaks. Replace toilet and shower head with \"low flow\" versions. Don't leave water running while shaving, brushing teeth, washing dishes, cleaning fruit or veggies, etc. 53 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If washing dishes or clothes, make sure it's a full load. Take short showers rather than filling up a bathtub. Limit watering lawn or washing cars. No A/C..? - If you have no air conditioning, try to stay on the lowest floor out of the sunshine and use electric fans to help keep yourself cool. Cars - Never leave children or pets in vehicles on warm or hot days!! Eat light - Light meals are best, especially fresh fruits and veggies. Drink WATER - Increase your daily intake of water, esp. in dry climates (deserts and high elevations) -- you don't realize how dehydrated you get. Limit booze - Even though beer and alcoholic beverages may be refreshing on a hot day, they actually cause your body to dehydrate more! What to wear - Light-colored (to reflect heat) loose-fitting clothes are best... and cover as much skin as possible. Dark colors absorb the sun'sheat. Also, wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect face and neck. Use sunscreen - Apply lotion or cream at least 20 minutes before going out- side so skin can absorb and protect, esp. face and neck (SPF 30 or higheris best). You usually burn within the first 10 minutes outside, so take careof your skin... especially children ! A sunburn slows the body's ability to cool itself and can be extremely dangerous. Working outdoors - If you have to do yard work or other outdoor work, try to do it in the early morning hours to limit exposure in the sun. The mostpowerful sun is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (when you burn the quickest)so limit outdoor activity during the heat of the day, if possible. Ozone alerts - These can cause serious danger to people with breathing and respiratory problems (especially children and the elderly) so limit yourtime outdoors when alerts are announced on the radio, newspapers or TV . ozone - a colorless gas that is in the air we breathe and is a major element of urban smog. ground-level ozone - an air pollutant that can lower resistance to colds, cause problems for people with heartand lung disease, and cause coughing or throat irritation ozone levels - (also called Air Quality Index) between 0-50 are fine, but anything above 100 is extremely dangerous! Heat Index - Visit NOAA's heat safety page at www .weather .gov/om/heat 54 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... FIRES & W ILDFIRES ? Since fire spreads so quickly, there is NO time to grab valuables or make a phone call! In just two minutes a fire can become life threatening! In five minutes a house can be engulfed in flames! A fire's heat and smoke are more dangerous than the actual flames since you can burn your lungs by inhaling the super-hot air. Fire produces apoisonous gas that makes you drowsy and disoriented (confused). Insteadof being awakened by a fire, you could fall into a deeper sleep! First we will discuss FIRES like you might encounter in your home or apartment, then we will cover WILDFIRES since there are many things people need to think about when living near wilderness areas. BEFORE AF IRE(FIRESAFETY TIPS): Install smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) detectors! - Test alarms 1-4 times a month, replace batteries once a year, and get new units every 10 years! Make a plan - Review Section 1 and create an Escape Plan that includes two escape routes from every room in the house and walk through theroutes with your entire family. Also... Make sure your windows are not nailed or painted shut. Make sure security bars on windows have a fire safety opening feature so they can be easily opened from theinside...and teach everyone how to open them! Teach everyone how to stay LOW to floor (air is safer). Pick a spot to meet after escaping fire (meeting place) . Clean up - Keep storage areas clean - don't stack up newspapers & trash. Check power sources - Check electrical wiring and extension cords -- don't overload cords or outlets. Make sure there are no exposed wires anywhereand make sure wiring doesn't touch home insulation. Use caution - Never use gasoline or similar liquids indoors and never smoke around flammable liquids! Check heat sources - Check furnaces, stoves, cracked or rusty furnace parts, and chimneys. Always be careful with space heaters and keep themat least 3 feet (1 m) away from flammable materials. 55 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Know how to shut of f power - Know where the circuit breaker box and gas valve is and how to turn them off, if necessary. (And always have a gascompany rep turn on a main gas line.) Install & learn A-B-C - Install A-B-C fire extinguishers in the home and teach family members how to use them. (A-B-C works on all types of firesand recommended for home - please read label.) Call local fire - Ask local fire department if they will inspect your home for fire safety and prevention. Teach kids - Explain to children that matches and lighters are TOOLS, not toys... and if they see someone playing with fire they should tell an adult right away! And teach them how to report a fire and when to call 9-1-1. Prevent common fires - Pay attention when cooking & don't smoke in bed! DURING AF IRE: If only a small fire that's not spreading too fast ... Try to put out...? - Use a fire extinguisher or water (unless it's an electrical or grease fire) ... and never try to put out a fire that's getting out of control! electrical fire - never use water... use a fire extinguisher approved for electrical fires oil or grease fire in kitchen - smother fire with baking soda or salt (or, if burning in pan or skillet, carefully puta lid over it -- but don't try to carry pan outside!) If fire is spreading ... GET OUT - DO NOT take time to try to grab anything except your family members! Once outside, do NOT try to go back in (even for pets) - let thefiremen do it! Ask a neighbor to call fire department if not already called. GET DOWN - Stay low to the ground under smoke by crawling on your hands and knees or squat down and walk like a duck... but keep moving tofind a way out! Closed door - Using the back of your hand (not your palm) always feel the top of the door, doorknob, and the crack between the door and door framebefore you open a closed door! if door is cool - leave quickly, close door behind you and crawl to an exit if door is hot - DO NOT open it ... find another way out 56 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325No way out - If you can't find a way out of the room you're trapped in (door is hot and too high to jump) then hang a white or light-colored sheet,towel or shirt outside a window to alert firemen. Use stairs - Never take the elevator during a fire ... always use stairs! If YOU are on fire - If your clothes ever catch fire, STOP what you're doing, DROP to the ground, cover your face and ROLL until the fire goes out. Running only makes the fire burn faster! Toxic gas - Plastics in household goods create deadly fumes when burned. AFTER AF IRE: Don' t go in there - Never enter a fire-damaged building until officials say it's okay and watch for signs of smoke in case the fire isn't totally out.Even if a fire's out, hydrogen cyanide and other toxic fumes can remain. Utilities - Have an electrician check your household wiring before you turn the power back on and DO NOT try to reconnect any utilities yourself! Damage - Look for structural damage (roof, walls, floors, etc.) since they may be weak. Call for help - Local disaster relief service (Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc.) can help provide shelter, food, or personal items that were destroyed. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative and... Keep receipts of all clean-up and repair costs (for both insurance and income taxes). Do not throw away any damaged goods until an official inventory has been taken by your insurance company. If you rent - Contact your landlord since it is the owner's responsibility to prevent further loss or damage to the site. Move your stuf f- Secure your personal belongings or move them to anoth- er location, if possible. Recovery tips - Review TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER at end of this Section. To learn more about fire safety and fire prevention visit the U.S. Fire Administration' s web site www .usfa.dhs.gov or contact your local fire department, emergency official, or your insurance agent / representative. 57 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Wildfires are intense fires that are usually caused by careless humans or lightning. Campfires, children playing with matches or lighters, and ciga-rettes are the most common things that cause brush fires or wildfires soplease be careful when you're out in deserts, mountains, or any other heavy vegetation areas. And please don't toss cigarettes out when driving! NEVER leave a campfire burning - make sure it is completely out using plenty of water before leaving the area. Stir the coals around with a stickor log while pouring water over them to ensure all the coals get wet andthey are no longer hot. Any hot coals left unattended can be easily ignitedby wind since they can stay hot for 24 - 48 hours! When building a campfire, always choose a level site, clear away any branches and twigs several feet from the fire, and never build a fire beneathtree branches or on surface roots. Also, build at least 10 feet (3 m) from anylarge rocks that could be blackened by smoke or cracked from a fire's heat. See your local Forest Service office or Ranger Station for more informa- tion on campfires and permits. Or visit www .fs.fed.us or www .pc.gc.ca BEFORE AW ILDFIRE (FIRESAFETY TIPS): Prepare - See WILDFIRE MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn fire laws - Ask fire authorities or the forestry office for information on fire laws (like techniques, safest times to burn in your area, etc.) Could they find & reach you? - Make sure that fire vehicles can get to your property and that your address is clearly marked. Safety zone - Create a 30-100 foot (9-30 m) safety zone around your home. (see WILDFIRE MITIGATION) Teach kids - Explain to children that matches and lighters are TOOLS, not toys... and if they see someone playing with fire tell an adult right away! And teach kids how to report a fire and when to call 9-1-1. Tell authorities - Report hazardous conditions that could cause a wildfire. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING AW ILDFIRE : Listen - Have a radio to keep up on news, weather and evacuation routes. 58 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Evacuate? - If you are told to leave - do so ... and IF you have time also... Secure your home - close windows, vents, all doors, etc. Turn off utilities and tanks at main switches or valves. Turn on a light in each room to increase the visibility of your home in heavy smoke. See WILDFIRE MITIGATION at front of this section. Head downhill - Fire climbs uphill 16 times faster than on level terrain (since heat rises) so always head down when evacuating the area. Food & water - If you prepared ahead, you'll have your Disaster Supplies Kithandy to GRAB & GO ... if not, gather up enough food and water for each family member for at least 3 days or longer! Be understanding - Please realize the firefighters main objective is getting wildfires under control and they may not be able to save every home. Tryto understand and respect the firefighters' and local officials' decisions. AFTER AW ILDFIRE : Don' t go there - Never enter fire-damaged areas until authorities say it's okay and watch for signs of smoke or heat in case the fire isn't totally out. Critters - Don't try to care for a wounded critter -- call Animal Control. Utilities - Have an electrician check your household wiring before you turn the power back on and DO NOT try to reconnect any utilities yourself! Damage - Look for structural damage (roof, walls, floors) -- may be weak. Call for help - Local disaster relief services (Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc.) can help provide shelter, food, or personal items that were destroyed. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative and...

Some floods develop over a period of several days, but a flash flood can cause raging waters in just afew minutes! Mudflows are another danger triggered by flooding that canbury villages without warning, especially in mountainous regions. Everyone is at risk from floods and flash floods, even in areas that seem harmless in dry weather. Always listen to the radio or TV to hear the latestupdates. Some other types of radios are the NOAA (National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration) Weather Radio and Environment CanadaWeatheradio with battery backup and tone-alert feature that automaticallyalert you when a Watch or Warning has been issued. BEFORE AF LOOD (ORHEA VY RAIN): Prepare - Review FLOOD MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with floods... Flood watch - flooding is possible Flash flood watch - flash flooding is possible so move to higher ground if in a low-lying area Flood warning - flooding is occurring or will occur soon so listen to radio or TV for updates or evacuation alerts Flash flood warning - flash flood is occurring so seek higher ground on foot immediately Urban and Small Stream Advisory - flooding of small streams, streets and low-lying areas is occurring Learn risks - Ask local emergency management office if your property is a \"flood-prone\" or high-risk area and what you can do to mitigate (reducerisks to) your property and home. Find out what official flood warning sig-nals are and what to do when you hear them. Ask if there are dams in yourarea and if they could be a hazard. (Also review Landslides and Mudflows on pages 44-46.) Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate.

Get insurance...? - Talk to your agent and find out more about the National Flood Insurance Program . (see FLOOD MITIGATION) Did you know... ... you can buy federal flood insurance through most major insurance companies and licensed agents?! ... you do not have to own a home to have flood insurance as long as your community participates in the NFIP ?! ... NFIP offers coverage even in flood-prone areas?! ... NFIP offers basement and below ground level coverage?! Put it on film - Either videotape or take pictures of home and personal belongings and store them in a safe place with your important papers. DURING AF LOOD (ORHEA VY RAIN): Be aware - Listen to local news and watch for flash floods especially if near streams, drainage channels, and areas known to flood. Get to higher ground - If in a low-lying area, move to higher ground. Prepare to evacuate - (see EVACUATION ), and IF time also... Secure home and move important items to upper floors. Turn off utilities at main switches or valves if instructed by authorities and DO NOT touch electrical equipment ifyou are wet or standing in water! Fill up your car with fuel. Obey warnings - If road signs, barricades, or cones are placed in areas - OBEY THEM! Most areas fine people who ignore posted warnings. DONOT drive around barricades... find another way! Things to avoid : moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) of moving water can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooding car - if flood waters rise around your car, get out and move to higher ground if you can do it safely! bad weather - leave early enough so you're not trapped flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines - extremely dangerous in floods!! or call 1-888-999-4325AFTER AF LOOD (ORHEA VY RAIN): Things to avoid : flood waters - avoid flood waters since they may be contaminated by oil, gasoline or raw sewage or may be electrically charged from underground or downed powerlines - local authorities will say when okay to return moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out or weakened downed power lines - extremely dangerous and report them to the power company Obey warnings - If road signs, barricades, or cones are placed in areas - OBEY THEM!

HAILSTORMS ? Hail is the largest form of precipitation that begins as tiny ice pellets and grows by colliding with supercooled water droplets as it gets tossed aroundviolently in strong updraft winds. As the pellet continues to be tossed, itbuilds layer by layer until it becomes so heavy that it drops out of the skyas hailstones. Hailstone diameters can range from 1/16 of an inch to 5 inches (2 mm to 13 mm) - basically meaning they can range in size from tiny pebbles to golfballs to grapefruits or softballs! One of the largest hailstones ever recordedin the U.S. weighed 1.67 pounds and had a 17.5 inch (44 cm) circumfer-ence. Hail is usually present in powerful storms like tornadoes, thunderstorms and even some winter storms mainly due to the strong winds and rapidlyrising air masses needed to form hailstones. The U.S. averages about 3,000 hailstorms each year across the country and a majority of the storms occur between March and June. Hail occurs allacross Canada but more frequently happens in the Canadian Prairies (par-ticularly the Calgary-Medicine Hat area). This region can expect up to 10hailstorms a year and most damaging hailstorms generally occur from Mayto October. The worst hailstorm in Canadian history hit Calgary, Alberta in September 1991. The 30-minute downpour caused almost $400 million in insuranceclaims devastating crops, property and livestock. In 1996 Alberta started ahail suppression program using aircraft that fly over developing storms andseed clouds with silver iodide particles to reduce the size of the hailstones. BEFORE A HAILSTORM : Since hailstorms are pretty localized events, it is difficult to prepare for\"hail\", however please review the other topics that create hailstorms(Thunderstorms, Tornadoes and Winter storms) to learn what to do andhow to protect yourselves during these events. Listen - Keep up on local radio or TV weather forecasts and updates. Park it - If possible, secure vehicles in a garage or under substantial cover. Bring 'em in - Put pets and livestock in a shelter for their safety. 63 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Stay put - Stay inside until the entire storm system passes. DURING A HAILSTORM : Listen - Keep radio or TV tuned in for more information and updates on weather conditions and other types of warnings. IF INDOORS - Stay inside until the storm passes and don't try to go out and protect your property! IF OUTDOORS - Take shelter under the strongest structure you can find (especially if hailstones are large!) IF IN A VEHICLE - Carefully pull over to the shoulder and seek shelter under an overpass or the closest substantial structure available. AFTER A HAILSTORM : Listen - Continue listening to radio or TV for updates on weather. Check it out - Check for damage to trees and shrubs because, if damaged, your roof most likely is too. Also check your vehicles and structures fordamage but don't put yourself in danger if storms are still active! S top leaks - Cover up holes in your roof and broken windows in your car and home to keep water out. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative to set up a visit to your home or to take your vehicle down for inspection.

Chemical plants are one source of hazardous materials, but there are many others that exist in large industry, small businesses, and homes. There areabout 500,000 products that could pose a physical or health hazard -- thingsranging from waste produced by a petroleum refinery to materials used bythe dry cleaners to pesticides stored in your home. Most hazardous materials are transported around the country by road, rail and through pipelines potentially causing spills on highways, near railroadtracks or underground. Many U.S. communities have a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC ) that keeps local planners, companies and members of the community informed of potential risks. All companies thathave hazardous chemicals must report to the LEPC every year and the pub-lic is encouraged to get involved. We [the public] should all learn moreabout hazardous materials and how they can affect our lives so contact youremergency management office to learn more. We're going to cover two topics here -- HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER (where a spill or incident affects an area or community) and HOUSEHOLD CHEMICAL EMERGENCIES (how to handle products and react if there's an emergency in the home). Also, please review theTERRORISM topic since it covers several biological and chemical agents that are also classed as \"hazardous materials\". BEFORE A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER : Learn the buzzwords - Ask your local officials about emergency warning procedures and terms... Outdoor warning sirens or horns - ask what they mean and what to listen for Emergency Alert System (EAS) - information and alerts via TV and radio \"All-call\" telephoning - an automated system for send- ing recorded messages via telephone Residential route alerting - messages announced from vehicles equipped with public address systems (loud speakers on top of car or van) Learn risks - Ask Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Emergency Management Office, or Fire Department about communityplans for responding to a hazardous materials accident at a plant or a 65 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325transportation accident involving hazardous materials. Ask where large quantities of hazardous substances are stored and where they are used. Make a plan - Use LEPC's or agency's information to see if your family is at risk, especially people living close to freeways, railroads, or factorieswhich produce or transport toxic waste. And review Section 1 to develop aFamily Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . T ake a tour - Arrange a neighborhood tour of industries that produce or transport toxic waste and include neighbors, local officials and the media. Pick a room - It could take authorities time to determine what the haz- ardous material is (if any) so pick a room in advance that your family coulduse as \"shelter-in-place\" if told to stay indoors for several hours. It's bestto pick an internal room where you could block out air, if instructed to doso. To save critical time consider measuring and cutting plastic sheets inadvance for each opening (vents, windows, and doors). Remember, toilets/ drains are vented meaning outside air comes in constantly or whenflushed / open (depends on design) - in case using bathroom as safe room. Calculate air for room - Keep in mind people can stay in a sealed off room for only so long (or you'll run out of air!) FEMA suggests 10 square feetof floor space per person (like 5ft x 2ft / 1.5m x 0.6m ) will provide enoughair to prevent carbon dioxide buildup for up to 5 hours. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER : Call for help - If you see a hazardous materials accident, call 9-1-1, local emergency number, or the fire department. Listen - Keep radio or TV tuned in for more information, especially if you hear a warning signal... and stay calm! IF INDOORS - If instructed to stay inside, prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"... Close windows, vents, and fireplace dampers and turn off A/C or heat and fans to reduce air drawn in from outside. Keep a radio with you at all times. Grab Disaster Supplies Kit and get to a closed off room. Seal gaps under doorways and windows with wet towels or plastic and duct tape (see above tips on picking a roomand calculating air!) 66 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF OUTDOORS - Stay upstream, uphill, or upwind from the disaster since hazardous materials can be carried by wind and water quickly. Try to get atleast 1/2 mile or kilometer away or as far away as possible! IF IN A VEHICLE - Close your windows and shut off vents to reduce risk. S tay away - Get away from the accident site to avoid contamination. Evacuate...? - If told to leave... DO it! If officials say you have time, close windows, shut vents and turn off attic fans. (see EVACUATION) What to wear - Keep your body fully covered and wear gloves, socks and shoes. (Even though these may not keep you totally safe, it can help!) Things to avoid: chemicals - spilled liquid materials or airborne mists contaminated food or water - don't eat or drink food or water that may have been exposed to hazardous materials AFTER A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER : Don' t go there - Do not return home until local authorities say it is safe. Air out - Open windows, vents and turn on fans in your home. Listen - Keep up with local reports from either the radio or TV . Clean up - A person, critter or item that has been exposed to a hazardous chemical could spread it. decontamination - follow instructions from local author- ities since it depends on the chemical. May need to rinseoff or may be told to stay away from water - check first! strange symptoms - if unusual symptoms show up, get to a hospital or medical expert right away! Remove contam-inated clothing and put on fresh, loose, warm clothing andlisten to local reports on the radio. store clothes & shoes - put exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers/bags without touching othermaterials and ask local authorities how to get rid of them tell people you've been exposed - tell everyone who comes in contact with you that you may have beenexposed to a toxic substance land and property - ask authorities how to clean area 67 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Strange vapors or danger - Report any strange vapors or other dangers to the local authorities immediately. To learn more about hazardous materials, visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Emergency Management's ChemicalEmergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO) atwww .epa.gov/ceppo ... or the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Hazardous Materials Safety at http://hazmat.dot.gov / Or visit Environment Canada at www .ec.gc.ca (Click on \"Topics\" then several to choose from like Environmental Emergencies, Pollution, WasteManagement, etc.) ... or the Canadian Transport Emergency Centre of the Department of Transport at www .tc.gc.ca/canutec/ BEFORE A HOUSEHOLD CHEMICAL EMERGENCY : Learn risks - Call your local public health department or the Environmental Protection Agency for information about hazardous household materials. Read labels - Always read product labels for proper use, safe storage and disposal of chemicals. Recycle it? - Call your local recycling center or collection site to ask what chemicals can be recycled or dropped off for disposal -- many centers takethings like car batteries, oil, tires, paint or thinners, etc. S tore it - Keep all chemicals and household cleaners in safe, secure loca- tions out of reach of small children. Put it out - Don't smoke while using household chemicals. DURING A HOUSEHOLD CHEMICAL EMERGENCY : Call for help - Call your local Poison Control Center, 9-1-1, fire depart- ment, hospital or emergency medical services. If possible, have containerhandy since medical professionals may need specific data from label.

HURRICANES , CYCLONES & T YPHOONS ? Hurricane season in North America is generally between June and November. Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with torrential rains and windsof 74 - 155 miles per hour (120 - 250 km/h) or faster. These winds blow ina counter-clockwise direction (or clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere)around a center \"eye\". The \"eye\" is usually 20 to 30 miles (32 to 48 km)wide, and the storm may be spread out as far as 400 miles (640 km)! As the hurricane approaches the coast, a huge dome of water (called a storm surge) will crash into the coastline. Nine out of ten people killed inhurricanes are victims of storm surge. Hurricanes can also cause tornadoes,heavy rains and flooding. What' s with all the dif ferent names? You may have heard different words used to describe different storms depending on where you live in the world. It is confusing but hopefully wecan help explain all the different names... and hopefully we don't upsetany weather specialists. Cyclone - an atmospheric disturbance with masses of air rapidly rotating around a low-pressure center... (sort of like a dust devil or a tornado) Tropical Depression - maximum surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour (62 km/h) over tropical or sub-tropical waters with storms and circu-lar winds T ropical S torm - a tropical cyclone is labeled a Tropical Storm if winds are between 39-73 mph (62 - 117 km/h) and given a name to track it Hurricane, Typhoon, Tropical cyclone - surface winds are higher than 74 mph (120 km/h)... and depending on where it is happening will determinewhat it is called Wher e in the world do they use these names? (Please note: We are only listing a few major countries or areas for each!) Cyclone - used in several parts of the world - Indian Ocean, Australia, Africa, SW and southern Pacific Ocean Hurricane - used in North Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Pacific Ocean (east of the dateline), or South Pacific Ocean (east of 160) - both coasts of North America, Puerto Rico, Caribbean Islands, and Central America 69 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Typhoon - used in Northwest Pacific Ocean west of the dateline - Guam, Marshall Islands, Japan, Philippines, Hong Kong, coastal Asia Tropical cyclone - used in Southwest Pacific Ocean west of 160E or most of Indian Ocean - Australia, Indonesia, Africa, Middle East Hurricanes are classed into five categories based on wind speeds, central pressure, and damage potential. The chart below is called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with examples of damage provided by FEMA: Scale # Sustained Damage Storm (Category) Winds Surge 1 74-95 mph Minimal : Untied mobile 4-5 ft 119-153 km/h homes, vegetation & signs 1.2-1.5 m 2 96-110 mph Moderate : All mobile homes, 6-8 ft 154-177 km/h roofs, small crafts, flooding 1.8-2.4 m 3 111-130 mph Extensive : Small buildings, 9-12 ft 178-209 km/h low-lying roads cut off 2.7-3.6 m 4 131-155 mph Extreme : Roofs and mobile 13-18 ft 210-249 km/h homes destroyed, trees down, 3.9-5.4 m beach homes flooded 5 > 155 mph Catastrophic : Most bldgs and > 18 ft > 250 km/h vegetation destroyed, major > 5.4 m roads cut off, homes flooded BEFORE A HURRICANE : Prepare - Review WIND, FLOOD, and LIGHTNING MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with hurricanes... Hurricane/Tropical Storm Watch - hurricane/tropical storm is possible within 36 hours so listen to TV and radioupdates Hurricane/Tropical Storm Warning - hurricane/tropical storm is expected within 24 hours -- may be told to evac-uate (if so, do it) and listen to radio or TV for updates Short term Watches and Warnings - warnings provide detailed information on specific hurricane threats (likeflash floods and tornadoes) Listen - Keep local radio or TV tuned in for weather forecasts and updates. (Some other radios to consider are Environment Canada's Weatheradio and 70 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325NOAA's Weather Radio with battery backup and tone-alert feature that automatically alert you when a Watch or Warning has been issued.) Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Learn to shut of f- Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions. Batten down - Make plans to protect your property with storm shutters or board up windows with plywood that is measured to fit your windows.Tape does not prevent windows from breaking. (see WIND MITIGATION) Get insurance...? - Talk to your agent and find out more about the National Flood Insurance Program . (see FLOOD MITIGATION) Put it on film - Either videotape or take pictures of home and personal belongings and store them in a safe place (like a fireproof box or a safetydeposit box) along with important papers. DURING A HURRICANE THREAT : Listen - Have a battery-operated radio available to keep up on news reports and evacuation routes. Evacuate? - If you are told to evacuate - do it! (see EVACUATION) And if you have time also... Secure your home - close storm shutters or put up boards on windows, moor your boat, and secure outdoor objectsor put them inside since winds will blow them around. Turn off utilities at main switches or valves, if instructed. Fill up your car with fuel. Food & water - If you prepared ahead, you'll have your Disaster Supplies Kithandy to GRAB & GO... if not, gather up enough food and water for each family member for at least 3 days! IF INDOORS - Stay inside! Find a SAFE SPOT - get to small interior room, closet or hallway ... or lie on the floor under a heavy desk or table. Move away from windows and glass doors. 71 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF IN A MULTI-STORY BUILDING - Go to the first or second floor! Find a SAFE SPOT - get to a small interior room or hall- way ... or lie on the floor under a heavy desk or table. Move away from outside walls and windows. Realize electricity may go out and alarms and sprinkler systems may go on. Pets - Make arrangements for pets since shelters may not allow them. Things to avoid : moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooding car - if flood waters rise around your car, get out and move to higher ground if you can safely! (Don't tryto walk through moving water!) bad weather - leave early enough so you are not trapped flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines - extremely dangerous in floods!! S tay indoors - If you do not evacuate, stay indoors and stay away from glass doors and windows. Keep curtains and blinds closed and remember,a lull in the storm could only be the middle of the storm (the \"eye\") andwinds can start again! Keep listening to radio or TV reports. Limit phone calls - Only use telephones in an emergency so it keeps lines open for local authorities. AFTER A HURRICANE : Stay put - Stay where you are (if you're in a safe location) and don't return home (if you've been evacuated) until local authorities say it's okay. Listen - Continue listening to your battery-powered radio for updates on weather and tips on getting assistance for housing, clothing, food, etc. Stick together - Keep family together since this is a very stressful time. Try to find chores for children so they feel they're helping with the situation. Things to avoid : flood waters - stay away from flood waters since it may be contaminated by oil, gasoline or raw sewage or may be electrically charged from underground or downed powerlines - wait for local authorities to approve returning toflooded areas 72 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out or weakened downed power lines - extremely dangerous and report them to power company Things to watch out for : weak structures - be careful since buildings and homes could have been weakened by wind or floods looting, guns and panicked people - be aware people may become violent trying to find loved ones, water orfood (or there may be criminals and jerks out stealingwhatever they can) bodies - strong storm surges, floods, and high winds may cause deaths so be aware there may be dead bodiesaround Drinking water - Use bottled water or purify water until officials advise it is okay to drink out of the tap. (see TIPS ON WATER PURIFICATION) Flooded food - Throw away any food that has come into contact with flood waters since eating it can make you sick! Wash your hands - Use clean water and soap when washing hands. Use bleach - The best thing to use for cleaning up flooded areas is house- hold bleach since it will help kill germs. Insurance - Call your insurance agent to set up a visit to your home. Mold - Consider asking a restoration professional to inspect your house for mold. (see AIR QUALITY MITIGATION) Donations - Lots of people want to help victims of a hurricane and here are some tips... wait & see - don't donate food, clothing or personal items unless they are specifically requested money - donations to a known disaster relief group, like the Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc. is always helpful volunteers - if local authorities ask for your help, bring your own water, food and sleeping gear Recovery tips - Review TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER at end of this Section. 73 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... AN UCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY (OR A NUCLEAR INCIDENT )? The World Nuclear Association reports as of January 2007 there are 435 commercial nuclear power reactors in 30 countries with 250 more reactorsunder construction or planned. The U.S. has over 100 commercial powerplants and Canada has 20 power stations meaning millions of citizens livewithin 10 miles (16 km) of an operating reactor. And WNA reports thereare 280 research reactors (54 in the U.S.) mainly on university campuses. Even though governments and associations monitor and regulate construc- tion and operation of plants, accidents are possible and do happen. Anaccident could result in dangerous levels of radiation that could affect thehealth and safety of the public living near a nuclear power plant, as well aspeople many miles away depending on winds and weather - so millions ofNorth Americans could potentially be affected. Some other incidents involving possible radiation exposure may be a nuclear missile or suitcase nuke (plutonium creates massive energy anddestruction) or a \"dirty devices are briefly covered in the next topic calledTERRORISM, but please review next several pages before moving on.) A nuclear blast (detonation) produces a series of deadly events: blinding light, intense heat (called thermal radiation), initial nuclear radiation, 2explosive shock waves, mass fires, and radioactive fallout. When the nukeexplodes, a large fireball is created that vaporizes everything inside it(including dirt and water) forming a mushroom cloud. The vaporized mate-rials mix with radioactive materials then fall back to earth (called fallout). Damage caused by a nuclear event or device depends on the extent of the accident at a plant or the size of the weapon detonated. It also depends onwhether a device explodes in the air or at the earth's surface and what theweather conditions are at the time of impact. Obviously \"ground zero\"(where the accident or blast occurs) will suffer massive deadly damage, butwidespread radioactive fallout can contaminate the air, water and ground surfaces for potentially hundreds of miles. After reviewing this topic, also read APPENDIX D - More About Nukes . How is radiation detected? You cannot see, feel, taste or smell radiation, but special instruments can detect even the smallest levels of it. If radiation is released, authorities will 74 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325monitor levels of radioactivity to determine the potential danger so they can alert and protect the public. Learn about detection devices on page 234. What is best way to r educe radiation exposur e? Limit the amount of radiation you are exposed to by doing 3 things ... Distance - The more distance between you and the source of radiation, the less you'll receive. During a serious accident you may be told to evacuate. Shielding - Heavy, dense materials between you and radiation is best - this is why you want to stay indoors since the walls in your home should begood enough to protect you in some cases... but listen to radio and TV tolearn if you need to evacuate! T ime - Most radioactivity loses its strength rather quickly. Limiting your time near the source of radiation reduces the amount you receive. What is the most danger ous par t of a nuclear accident? Radioactive iodine - nuclear reactors contain many different radioactive products, but a dangerous one is radioactive iodine which, once absorbed,can damage cells of the thyroid gland. The greatest population that suffersin a nuclear accident is children (including unborn babies) since their thy- roid is so active, but all people are at risk of absorbing radioactive iodine. How can I be pr otected fr om radioactive iodine? Potassium iodide (KI) - can be purchased over-the-counter now (usually from companies selling disaster-related kits) and is known to be an effec-tive thyroid-blocking agent. In other words, it fills up the thyroid with goodiodine that keeps radioactive iodine from being absorbed into our bodies. What if I am allergic to iodine? According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, the FDA suggests that risks ofallergic reaction to potassium iodide are minimal compared to subjectingyourself to cancer from radioactive iodine. Ask your doctor or pharmacistwhat you should keep on hand in the event of an allergic reaction. Many European countries stockpile potassium iodide (KI), especially since the Chernobyl incident. Several states are considering or already havestockpiles of KI ready in case of an accident or incident. As of Jan 2005, the FDA has approved 3 KI products - Iosat, ThyroSafe, and ThyroShield. Learn more at call 1-888-999-4325What is Electr omagnetic Pulse (EMP)? If a nuclear device is detonated in the air high above North America, it would create a high-density electrical field called an electromagnetic pulse. An EMP creates a split-second energy burst (like a stroke of lightning) that could fry electronics connected to wires or antennas like cell phones, cars,computers, etc. Unless electronics are grounded or encased in a metallicshield (hardened), North Americans could experience anything from minorinterference to crippled power, transportation, banking and communica-tions systems. According to FEMA, most electronic devices within 1,000 miles of a high- altitude nuke could be damaged by EMP but battery powered radios withshort antennas could be okay. Most people wouldn't be harmed by an EMPbut folks with pacemakers or other implanted devices could be. See additional tips on page 240. Community Planning for Emergencies (U.S. and Canada) Local, state and provincial governments, Federal agencies and utilities have developed emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear powerplant accident. United States' plans define 2 \"emergency planning zones\" (EPZs) Plume Exposur e EPZ - a 10-mile radius from nuclear plant where people may be harmed by radiation exposure NOTE: People within a 10-mile radius are given emergency informa- tion about radiation, evacuation routes, special arrangements forhandicapped, etc. via brochures, phone books, and utility bills. Ingestion Exposur e EPZ - about a 50-mile radius from plant where accidentally released radioactive materials could con-taminate water supplies, food crops and livestock Canada's Provincial Nuclear Emergency Response Plans define 3 \"zones\" Contiguous Zone - approximately 3 kilometres from nuclear facility where evacuation and sheltering may be ordered Primar y Zone - approximately 10 kilometres from the nuclear facility where evacuation and sheltering may be ordered Secondar y Zone - approximately 50 kilometres from the nuclear facility where radioactive contamination couldcause monitoring and/or bans on some food and water sources NOTE: Public Education brochures are available to residents and businesses within the Primary Zone (10 km) of each nuclear facility. 76 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325BEFORE A NUCLEAR EMERGENCY OR INCIDENT : Learn the buzzwords - Know terms used in both countries to describe a nuclear emergency at a plant: U.S. / (Canada )... Notification of Unusual Event / (Repor table Event )- a small problem has occurred. No radiation leak is expected.Federal, state/provincial and county/municipal officials willbe told right away. No action on your part will be necessary. Alert / (Abnormal Incident )- a small problem has occurred, and small amounts of radiation could leak inside plant. Thiswill not affect you and you shouldn't have to do anything. Site Area Emergency / (Onsite Emergency )- a more seri- ous problem... small amounts of radiation could leak fromthe plant. If necessary, officials will act to ensure public safety. Area sirens may be sounded and listen to your radio orTV for information. General Emergency / (General Emergency )- the MOST serious problem... radiation could leak outside the plant andoff the plant site. In most cases sirens will sound so listen tolocal radio or TV for reports and updates. State/Provincialand county/municipal officials will act to assure public safe-ty and be prepared to follow their instructions! Learn signals - Ask about your community's warning system and pay atten- tion to \"test\" dates to learn if you can HEAR it. Nuclear power plants arerequired to install sirens and other warning devices to cover a 10-mile areaaround the plant in the U.S. (If you live outside the 10-mile area you willprobably learn of the event through local TV and radio, but just be awarewinds and weather can impact areas as far as 200 miles [320 km] away!!) Learn risks - Ask the power company operating the nuclear power plant for brochures and information. Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Double check on emergency plans for schools, day cares or places family may be and where they'll go if evacuated. Andplease review APPENDIX D - More About Nukes (You CAN Survive) to learn more about long-term sheltering, protection from fallout, etc. Go? - Listen to authorities and leave if told to go. (see EVACUATION) DURING A NUCLEAR EMERGENCY OR INCIDENT : Stay calm - Not all accidents release radiation - may only be power plant! 77 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF AN EXPLOSION OR BLAST - (like from a possible nuclear device) Do NOT look at flash, blast or fireball - turn away! Duck & cover .. and watch out for flying debris or fires. Take shelter in case of radioactive fallout. Blast could create EMP that may fry electronics like cell phones, computers, cars, etc. and may harm people withpacemakers. Listen - Turn on radio or TV . Authorities will give specific instructions and information... pay attention to what THEY tell you rather than what iswritten in this Manual since they know the facts for each specific incident. S tay or go..? - Evacuate if told to do so by local authorities ... and ... Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit . Close doors, windows and fireplace damper. Cover your mouth and nose with face mask or cloth. Close car windows and vents and use \"re-circulating\" air. Keep listening to radio for evacuation routes & updates. As long as you ar e NOT told to evacuate, do the following... IF INDOORS - Stay inside and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"... Close doors and windows and your fireplace damper. Turn off air conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakes (they pull in air from outside). Go to a basement or underground area (if possible). Keep a battery-operated radio with you to hear updates. Stay inside until authorities tell you it is safe to go out! IF OUTDOORS - Get indoors as soon as possible! Cover mouth and nose with a cloth or handkerchief and find shelter. Once inside, remove clothing, shower & wash hair and put on fresh clothing and different shoes. Put clothes and shoes you were wearing in plastic bags, seal andstore. Local authorities can tell you what to do with bags. IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows up, close vents, use \"recirculating\" air and keep listening to radio for updates. If possible, drive away from site. Pets & livestock - Get them indoors or in shelters with clean food and water that has not been exposed to air-borne radiation (food and water that hasbeen stored), especially milk-producing animals. 78 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Food - Put food in covered containers or in refrigerator -- any food that was not in a covered container should be washed first. Take potassium iodide..? - IF radioactive iodine has been released into the air from a power plant accident, some states may decide to provide KI pills mentioned at beginning of this topic to people in a 10-mile radius. (In June 2002 President George W. Bush signed a provision that gave state and local governments supplies of potassium iodide for people within 20miles of a nuclear power plant, increasing protection beyond the NuclearRegulatory Commission's current 10-mile radius. 7 This is at the option of state and local government and realize it will take time for them to disperseto citizens ... unless you prepare in advance and keep KI handy for suchemergencies, but only take if officials confirm radiation was released!) NOTE: Take KI pills ONL Yas directed by local public health authorities and follow instructions on the package exactly! (see page 75) AFTER A NUCLEAR EMERGENCY OR INCIDENT : Listen - Keep radio and TV tuned in -- stay in until authorities say all clear. Clean up - If you were possibly exposed to radiation... store clothes & shoes - put clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers or plastic bags and ask health officials what to do with them shower - wash your body and hair to remove radioactive particles land and property - ask authorities how to clean up area Weird symptoms - Seek medical attention if you have symptoms like upset stomach or feel queasy after a reported incident since it could be related toradiation exposure. (see page 116 for more about radiation sickness) Gardens - Authorities will provide information concerning safety of farm and homegrown products -- or check with agricultural extension agent. Crops - Unharvested crops are hard to protect but crops that are already harvested should be stored inside, if possible. Milk - Local officials should inspect cows' and goats' milk before using.

TERRORISM ? Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property usually for emotional or political reasons or for ransom. The main goal of terrorists is to create public fear and panic. Obviously there is a lot of anxiety since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S., however, being afraid or worrying is very unhealthy - especiallyabout something you have little control over. But remember, terroristattacks are a very low risk possibility. Let's put a few \"risks\" in perspec- tive ... the chances of having high blood pressure is 1 in 4 ... the odds ofdying from cancer is 1 in 500 ... and the odds of dying from anthrax is 1 in56 million ! People need to remain calm about the threat of terrorist attacks and learn about some of the types, how to prepare for them, and what to expect insome cases. Discuss this with everyone - even the kids so they can talkabout their feelings too. Stay current on news but don't obsess over it ... andjust be aware of your surroundings as you go about your daily routines. One type of terrorism that we can help prevent is the use of guns and bombs by children and youth against other groups of children at schools.A key solution to stopping this type of school violence is through commu-nication, education and awareness - and it starts within the F AMIL Y! (see also APPENDIX C - SCHOOL SAFETY RESOURCES) The Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes terrorism in two ways:Domestic terrorism - terrorist activities are directed at certain groups or parts of the government within the U.S. without foreign direction. Some examples of domestic terrorism include shootings and bomb threats at schools, the Oklahoma City bombingof the Federal Building, and the letters mailed to variousgroups with a white powdery substance (anthrax scares). International terrorism - terrorist activities are foreign-based by countries or groups outside the U.S. Some examples of international terrorism include bomb- ings like the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen and U.S. Embassies inother countries, the attacks on the Pentagon and WorldTrade Center, hostage situations with civilians in variouscountries, or threats with weapons of mass destruction. 80 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Until recently, most terrorist attacks involved bombs, guns, kidnappings and hijackings, but some other forms of terrorism involve cyber attacks,biological or chemical agents, radiological or nuclear devices (the last 4considered weapons of mass destruction [or \"disruption\" in some cases]). Cyber attacks - computer-based attacks from individuals or terrorist groups causing severe problems for government, businesses and public in general(sometimes causing or leading to injury and death) Biological agents - infectious microbes (tiny life forms), germs or other substances that occur naturally or are \"designed\" to produce illness ordeath in people, animals or plants -- can be inhaled, enter through a cut inthe skin, or swallowed when eating or drinking Chemical agents - poisonous vapors, liquids or solids that can kill or slow down or weaken people, destroy livestock or crops -- can be absorbedthrough the skin, swallowed or inhaled Radiological threat or device - a \"dirty bomb\" or RDD uses conventional explosives to spread radioactive materials over a general or targeted area Nuclear device - a bomb or missile using weapons grade uranium or plu- tonium ( please note, we cover nuclear-related incidents on pages 74-79 and in APPENDIX D - More About Nukes on pages 231-243. ) Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) - chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear devices are now all classed as WMDs Terrorism is quite an extensive topic now -- below we are listing some basic things to do before ANY type of terrorist attack followed by severalpages explaining the Homeland Security Advisory System (color-codes). Then we will cover specific types of potential terrorist attacks shown above in red - including what to do BEFORE, DURING and AFTER each and where to find more information. We also threw in some tips for handling\"bomb threats\" or \"suspicious packages\". Keep in mind, the best thing you can do about terrorism is prepare yourself and your family for the unexpected, so please review this topic and theprevious one on \"nuclear\" threats. By learning about potential threats, weare all better prepared to know how to react if the unthinkable happens. BEFORE ANYTYPE OF TERRORIST ATTACK : BEAWARE! - You should always be aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activities to local authorities. 81 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Stay current on threats - Both U.S. Department of Homeland Security www .dhs.gov and Canada's PS www .publicsafety .gc.ca post alerts online. Learn \"Threat Levels\" - Review below Homeland Security Advisory System to see what your family or business should do at each color. Know the tar gets - Terrorists usually prefer to pick targets that bring little damage to themselves and areas that are easy to access by the public (likeinternational airports, military and government buildings, major events,schools, malls, etc.) Some other high risk targets include water and foodsupplies, nuclear power plants, and high-profile landmarks. Things to watch out for: unknown packages - DO NOT accept a package or case from a stranger unattended bags - report unattended bags or backpacks to authorities and don't ask strangers to watch your stuffor leave bags or purses alone (esp. when traveling) emergency exits - always be aware of where EXITS are... just casually look around for signs since most aremarked well in public places Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . And Appendix B has plans & tips for businesses . Get involved - Join a local Citizen Corps or CERT. (see pages 217-219) ABOUT THE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISORY SYSTEM In March 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS ) was implemented using color-coded \"Threat Conditions\" that increase ordecrease based on reports from the Intelligence Community. HSAS' s \"Thr eat Conditions\" or \"Thr eat Levels\": SEVERE = RED (Severe risk of terrorist attacks) HIGH = ORANGE (High risk of terrorist attacks) ELEV ATED = YELLOW (Significant risk of terrorist attacks) GUARDED = BLUE (General risk of terrorist attacks) LOW = GREEN (Low risk of terrorist attacks) Alerts and threat conditions can be declared for the entire nation, or for a specific geographic area or industry. The public should stay current withnews and alerts issued by officials ... and be aware, be prepared, and havea plan at all threat levels. 82 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325The District of Columbia Emergency Management Agency (DCEMA ) developed and contributed the following \"Terrorist Threat AdvisorySystem\" that mirrors the national Homeland Security Advisory System.The DCEMA's suggested precautions provide general guidance only tohelp organizations and families take actions best tailored for their needs.Please note, there are some protective measures for federal departmentsand agencies per DHS included here too. LOW (Green) - a low risk of terrorism. Routine security is implemented to preclude routine criminal threats. Residents are advised to: Continue to enjoy individual freedom. Participate freely in travel, work, and recreational activities. Be prepared for disasters and family emergencies. Develop a family emergency plan. Keep recommended immunizations up-to-date.

Develop a communications plan for emergency response and key per- sonnel. Conduct training for employees on physical security precautions. Budget for physical security measures. Federal depar tments and agencies should consider: Refine and exercise planned Protective Measures. Ensure emergency personnel receive proper training on HSAS measures. Assess facilities for vulnerabilities and take measures to mitigate them. 83 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325GUARDED (Blue) - a general risk of terrorism with no credible threats to specific targets. In addition to previously mentioned precautions, r esidents are advised to: Continue normal activities but be watchful for suspicious activities. Report suspicious activity to local law enforcement. Review family emergency plans. Avoid leaving unattended packages or briefcases in public areas. Increase family emergency preparedness by purchasing supplies, food, and storing water. Increase individual or family emergency preparedness through training, maintaining good physical fitness and health, and storing supplies. Monitor local and national news for terrorist alerts. In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, business owners and managers are advised to: Ensure that key leaders are familiar with the emergency operations and business contingency plans. Review, update, and routinely exercise functional areas of plans. Review and update the call down list for emergency response teams. Develop or review Mutual Aid agreements with other facilities and/or with local government for use during emergencies. Review physical security precautions to prevent theft, unauthorized entry, or destruction of property. Have you provided for: - Employee picture ID badges? - Background checks on all employees (as applicable)? - Access control and locking of high security areas at all times? - All security keys marked with \"Do not Duplicate?\" - Surveillance Cameras? - Backup power? - An alarm system? In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, federal depar tments and agencies should consider: Check communications with designated emergency response or com- mand locations. Review and update emergency response procedures. Provide public with information that would strengthen its ability to act appropriately. 84 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325ELEV ATED (Yellow) - an elevated risk of terrorist attack but a specific region of the USA or target has not been identified. In addition to previously mentioned precautions, r esidents are advised to: Continue normal activities, but report suspicious activities to the local law enforcement agencies. Network with your family, neighbors, and community for mutual support during a disaster or terrorist attack. Learn what critical facilities are located in your community and report suspicious activities at or near these sites. Contact local officials to learn about specific hazards in community. Develop a family plan and check contents of your Disaster Supplies Kit (see Section 1) . Individual or family emergency preparedness should be maintained through training, good physical fitness and health, and stor-ing food, water, and emergency supplies. Monitor media reports concerning situation. In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, business owners and managers are advised to: Announce Threat Condition ELEV ATED to employees. Review vulnerability and threat assessments and revise as needed. Identify and monitor government information sharing sources for warn- ings and alerts. Update and test call down list for emergency response teams and key employees. Review, coordinate, and update mutual aid agreements with other critical facilities and government agencies. Establish and monitor more active security measures. Review employee training on security precautions (bomb threat proce- dures, reporting suspicious packages, activities, and people). Conductcommunications checks to ensure contacts can be maintained. In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, federal depar tments and agencies should consider: Increase surveillance of critical locations. Coordinate emergency plans with nearby jurisdictions, as needed. Assess whether the precise characteristics of the threat require further refinement of preplanned protective measures. Implement, as appropriate, contingency and emergency response plans. 85 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325HIGH (Orange) - credible intelligence indicates that there is a high risk of a local terrorist attack but a specific target has not been identified. In addition to previously mentioned precautions, r esidents are advised to: Resume normal activities but expect some delays, baggage searches, and restrictions due to heightened security at public buildings and facilities. Continue to monitor world and local events as well as local government threat advisories. Report suspicious activities at or near critical facilities to local law enforcement agencies by calling 9-1-1. Inventory and organize emergency supply kits and test emergency plans with family members. Reevaluate meeting location based on threat. Consider taking reasonable personal security precautions. Be alert to your surroundings, avoid placing yourself in a vulnerable situation, and mon-itor the activities of your children. Maintain close contact with family and neighbors to ensure their safety and emotional welfare. In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, business owners and managers are advised to: Announce Threat Condition HIGH to all employees and explain expect- ed actions. Place emergency response teams on notice. Activate the business emergency operations center if required. Establish ongoing liaison with local law enforcement and emergency managementofficials. Monitor world and local events. Pass on credible threat intelligence to key personnel. Ensure appropriate security measures are in place and functioning prop- erly. Instruct employees to report suspicious activities, packages, and people. Search all personal bags, parcels, and require personnel to pass through magnetometer, if available. Inspect intrusion detection systems and lighting, security fencing, and locking systems. Inspect all deliveries and consider accepting shipments only at off-site locations. Remind employees to expect delays and baggage searches. Implement varying security measures (listed on next page) The following measures incorporate a comprehensive list of security actions, some of which may need to be implemented at lower levels. They are designedto respond to the elevation to HIGH Risk ( Orange ) of terrorist attacks. 86 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325(Orange) Security Measures for Businesses - Little or No Cost Actions Increase the visible security personnel presence wherever possible. Rearrange exterior vehicle barriers (traffic cones) to alter traffic patterns near facilities. Institute / increase vehicle, foot, and roving security patrols. Implement random security guard shift changes. Arrange for law enforcement vehicles to be parked randomly near entrances and exits. Approach all illegally parked vehicles in and around facilities, question drivers and direct them to move immediately. If owner cannot be identi-fied, have vehicle towed by law enforcement. Limit number of access points and strictly enforce access control proce- dures. Alter primary entrances and exits if possible. Implement stringent identification procedures to include conducting 100% \"hands on\" checks of security badges for all personnel (if used). Remind personnel to properly display badges, if applicable, and enforce visibility. Require two forms of photo identification for all visitors. Escort all visitors entering and departing. X-ray packages and inspect handbags and briefcases at entry if possible. Validate vendor lists for all routine deliveries and repair services. Security Measures for Businesses - Actions That May Bear Some Cost Increase perimeter lighting. Remove vegetation in and around perimeters, maintain regularly. Institute a vehicle inspection program to include checking under the undercarriage of vehicles, under the hood, and in the trunk. Provide vehi-cle inspection training to security personnel. Conduct vulnerability studies focusing on physical security, structural engineering, infrastructure engineering, power, water, and air infiltration,if feasible. Initiate a system to enhance mail and package screening procedures (both announced and unannounced). Install special locking devices on manhole covers in & around facilities. (Orange) In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, federal depar tments and agencies should consider: Coordinate security efforts with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, National Guard or other security and armed forces. Take additional precautions at public events, possibly considering alter- native venues or cancellation. Prepare to work at an alternate site or with a dispersed workforce. Restrict access to a threatened facility to essential personnel only. 87 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325SEVERE (Red) - terrorist attack has occurred or credible and corroborat- ed intelligence indicates that one is imminent (a severe risk ). Normally, this threat condition is declared for a specific location or critical facility. In addition to previously mentioned precautions, r esidents are advised to: Report suspicious activities and call 9-1-1 for immediate response. Expect delays, searches of purses and bags, and restricted access to pub- lic buildings. Expect traffic delays and restrictions. Residents should have Disaster Supplies Kits stocked and in place ready to go (medicines, glasses, important legal and financial papers) and emer-gency supplies kits (first aid kits, duct tape, blankets, non-perishablefood, water) for sheltering in place, if requested to do so. (see Section 1) Take personal security precautions to avoid becoming a victim of crime or terrorist attack. Avoid participating in crowded optional public gatherings, like sporting events and concerts. However, do not avoid going to public emergencygathering locations such as hospitals and shelters, if directed or neces-sary. These locations will have developed and initiated a strong securityplan to protect the residents. Do not travel into areas affected by the attack or that are likely to become an expected terrorist target. Keep emergency supplies accessible and automobile fuel tank full. Be prepared to either evacuate your home or shelter-in-place on order of local authorities. (see EVACUATION in Section 2) Be suspicious of persons taking photographs of critical facilities, asking detailed questions about physical security or dressed inappropriately forweather conditions. Report incidents immediately to law enforcement. Closely monitor news reports and Emergency Alert System (EAS) radio/TV stations. Assist neighbors who may need help. Ensure pets can be readied quickly for boarding or evacuation. Avoid passing unsubstantiated information and rumors. Prepare to activate your personal Family Emergency Plan. (see Section 1) In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, business owners and managers are advised to: Announce Threat Condition SEVERE and explain expected actions. Deploy security personnel based on threat assessments. Close or restrict entry to the facility to emergency personnel only and restrict parking areas close to critical buildings. Maintain a skeleton crew of emergency employees. Deploy emergency response and security teams. Activate Operations Centers (if applicable). 88 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Maintain close contact with local law enforcement, emergency manage- ment officials and business consortium groups (Chamber of Commerce,Board of Trade, etc.) Be prepared to implement mutual aid agreements with government and with other similar/neighboring businesses/industries. Provide security in parking lots and company areas. Report suspicious activity immediately to local law enforcement. Restrict or suspend all deliveries and mail to facility. Emergency supplies or essential shipments should be sent to off-site location for inspection. Activate your business emergency / contingency plan. (Red) In addition to all previously mentioned precautions, federal depar t- ments and agencies should consider: Increase or redirect personnel to address critical emergency needs. Assign emergency response personnel and pre-position and mobilize spe- cially trained teams or resources. Monitor, redirect, or constrain transportation systems. Close public and government facilities not critical for continuity of essen- tial operations, especially public safety.

ABOUT CYBER ATTACKS There are 3 key risk factors related to information technologies systems: A direct attack against a system \"through the wires\" alone (called hacking) -- meaning an attacker or user \"hacks\" inor gains \" access \" to restricted data and operations. An attack can be a physical assault against a critical IT element meaning an attacker changes or destroys data,modifies programs or takes control of a system (basicallycan cause a loss of data \" integrity \" = data is no good). The attack can be from the inside -- meaning private information could get in the wrong hands and becomepublic or identities stolen (basically \" confidentiality \" is broken = data is no longer secure or private). 89 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Cyber attacks target computer networks that run government, financial, health, emergency medical services, public safety, telecommunications,transportation and utility systems - also known as \"critical infrastructure\". Because technologies have improved our access to information, we have opened ourselves up for attacks by our enemies to destroy or alter this data.Cyberterrorism is different than computer crime or \"hactivism\" (which canbe costly and a pain to fix but doesn't threaten lives or public safety.) Cyberterrorism is usually done with a minimal loss of life but there are cer- tain terrorist groups that could potentially use cyber attacks to cause humancasualties or fear by disrupting transportation or public safety systems. We are not trying to cause worry or panic, but understand the possibility exists and services could be disrupted or cut off or man-made disasterscould happen due to cyber attacks. For example, services like banking, gaspumps, or internet access could be down or slow. And some emergencyplanners are concerned a cyber attack combined with a physical act of terrorism (like a \"dirty bomb\" or releasing a chemical or biological agent)could potentially interfere with response capabilities. Most countries have agencies committed to securing and monitoring criti- cal infrastructure and share information on a regular basis. Businesses andconsumers can help too by taking some preventative measures. BEFORE A CYBER ATTACK : Protect computers - Make sure your computers and wireless devices have current anti-virus software and firewalls and update them often. Learn about US-CER T- Consumers and businesses should take some time to visit the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team and learnmore about Internet security at www .us-cert.gov What .. no services? - Think about how you would handle not having access to the Internet, telephones, ATMs and other electronic devices youuse daily. A cyber attack could disrupt or crash systems so have a backupplan and listen to authorities for updates.

Business Continuity tips - See APPENDIX B to learn about resources that can help businesses and employees prepare for the unexpected. 90 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325ABOUT BIOLOGICAL AGENTS Biological agents are actually tiny life forms or germs that can occur naturally in plants, animals and soils or can be developed for scientific ormilitary purposes. Many biological agents affect humans by being inhaled,absorbed into the skin through a cut, or by swallowing contaminated foodor water. But there are things that make it difficult for some biologicalagents to live like sunlight (ultraviolet light) or dry conditions. Wind couldcarry agents long distances but also spreads it out making it less effective. Many animals and insects carry diseases that affect humans but most don't make us sick when eaten or inhaled because our immune systems arestrong enough to fight them. But, if a person's immune system is weak (likein babies or the elderly), it's possible that person could become sick or die. What biological agents could be used in an attack? There are 3 basic groups of biological agents that could be weaponized and used in an attack (but realize there are some that occur naturally too): Bacteria - tiny life forms that reproduce by simple divi- sion and are easy to grow -- diseases they spread arekilled by strong or boosted immune system or antibiotics Viruses - organisms that need living cells to reproduce and are dependent on the body they infect -- most diseasescaused by viruses don't respond to antibiotics but some-times antiviral drugs work (and a boosted immune systemmay fight invading organisms - depends on type of virus) Toxins - poisonous substances found in and extracted from living plants, animals or microorganisms; some toxins can be produced or altered -- some toxins can betreated with specific antitoxins and selected drugs Remember, biological weapons - or germ warfare - have been around for centuries so it's not anything new ... it's unfortunate we have to discuss itat length, but try not to let this topic frighten you. Educate yourself aboutthe types and where to find more information so you are prepared to react. How could biological agents be used in an attack? As mentioned earlier, most biological agents break down when exposed to sunlight or other conditions, and they are very hard to grow and maintain. There are 3 ways biological agents could be spread: Aerosols - dispersed or spread into air by a number of methods forming a fine mist that could drift for miles 91 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Animals and insects - some diseases can be carried and spread by critters like birds, mice or rodents, mosquitoes,fleas, or livestock -- called bioterrorism or agroterrorism Food and water contamination - most organisms and toxins are killed or deactivated when we cook food andboil or treat water but some may continue living Some biological agents could remain in the environment and cause prob- lems long after they are released. Keep in mind, both the Center for DiseaseControl and Environmental Protection Agency are working closely withvarious Departments of Defense and Energy and many other agenciesaround the country to monitor systems and security and develop plans. Thesame goes for Health Canada and many Canadian government agencies. The CDC also suggests citizens not be frightened into thinking they need a gas mask or be concerned about food and water sources. In the event of apublic health emergency, local and federal health departments will tell peo-ple what actions need to be taken. What ar e the names of some biological agents and what can they do? According to the Center for Disease Control's Emergency Preparedness and Response web site, there are many types of biological diseases andagents - in fact, too many to list here. The CDC has categorized biologicalagents into 3 groups (A, B and C). The diseases and agents listed inCategory A are considered \"highest priority\" and rarely seen in the UnitedStates. Since most agents were also listed on Public Health Agency ofCanada's Emergency Preparedness site, we are covering 7 specific agents(6 in Category A plus ricin from Category B) in alphabetical order. Anthrax - is an infection caused by bacteria ( Bacillus anthracis ) found naturally in soil where it can live for years. The bacteria form a protectivecoat around themselves called spores which are very tiny, invisible to thenaked eye, and odorless. Anthrax is most common in cows and sheep butcan also infect humans (primarily people who work with hoofed animals). How it spr eads :Anthrax cannot spread person to person. People come into contact with bacteria by breathing in spores ( inhalation ), by getting it through a cut in skin ( cutaneous ) or by eating something containing bac- teria - like undercooked meat from an infected animal ( gastrointestinal ). Signs & Symptoms :Signs depend on type of anthrax you're exposed to: Inhalation - most serious form - first signs similar to cold or flu (sore throat, fever and extremely tired but no runny nose) -- after several days may lead to severe breathing problems, shock, then possibly death 92 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Cutaneous - least serious form - first symptom is a small sore that turns into a blister -- a day or two later blisterturns into a skin ulcer with a black area in the center. Thesore, blister and ulcer do not hurt. Gastrointestinal - first nausea, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea and fever -- followed by bad stomach pain Symptoms for all 3 types can appear within 7 days of coming in contact with anthrax, but inhalation symptoms may take up to 42 days to appear. Treatment :All three forms of anthrax are treatable with antibiotics. Chances of coming into contact with anthrax are very low, and your bodynaturally fights off bacteria so you may not even become ill. Botulism - is a muscle-paralyzing disease caused by a toxin made by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum . C. botulinum occurs naturally and can be found in soil, water, animals, contaminated foods or crops.According to Health Canada, the toxin produced by C. botulinum is the most potent toxin known and can affect humans, animals and even fish.There is only one form of human-made botulism known to date. How it spr eads :Botulism cannot spread person to person. People come into contact with the naturally formed bacteria by eating something ( food- borne - usually due to improper storage or home canning methods), through a cut in the skin ( wound ), or a small number of infants (typically less than a year old) can eat bacterial spores that get into intestines ( infant botulism ). The only human-made form has been known to be transmitted from monkeys to veterinarians and lab workers ( inhalation ). Signs & Symptoms :Depends on type of botulism you're exposed to and the degree of exposure to the toxin but generally ... Foodborne - rare - signs usually appear in 6 to 36 hours Wound - first signs usually appear in 4 to 8 days Infant botulism - signs usually appear in 6 to 36 hours Inhalation - first signs usually appear in 72 hours Early symptoms for ALL forms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, hard to speak or swallow, dry mouth and fatigue(very tired). Muscle weakness starts at top of body and goes down causingnerve damage that results in paralysis of face, head, throat, chest, arms andlegs -- could possibly lead to death since breathing muscles do not work. T reatment :There is an antitoxin for botulism , but it must be treated as quickly as possible since it may or may not reverse effects of the diseasebut can stop further paralysis. Antibiotics are not effective against toxins. 93 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Plague - is caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis that affects animals and humans. Y. pestis is found in rodents and their fleas in many areas of the world, including the U.S. The bacterium is easily killed by sunlight anddrying but could live up to an hour when released into the air depending onweather conditions. How it spr eads :There is only one cause of plague but three different types of illness the infection can cause. One type of infection comes fromthe bite of an infected flea or gets in through a cut in the skin by touchingmaterial infected with bacterium ( bubonic ), another can be spread through the air and inhaled ( pneumonic ), and a third type occurs when plague bac- teria multiplies in the blood of a person already infected with plague(septicemic ). Signs & Symptoms :Plague types may occur separately or in combination with each other ... and all start with fever, headache, weakness, chills (pos-sibly puking and diarrhea) usually within 1 to 10 days of being exposed. Bubonic - most common - also develop swollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes). Does not spread person to person. Pneumonic - least common but most deadly -- could be used in attack but hard since sunlight kills it. Also get rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery spit-tle. May cause respiratory failure, shock or death. Can spread person to person through air (inhaling dropletsfrom a cough, sneeze, etc.) Septicemic - can occur with either bubonic or pneumonic plague due to bacteria multiplying in blood. Also developabdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into skin and otherorgans. Does not spread person to person. Treatment :There are several antibiotics that can effectively treat plague . (It is very important to get treatment for pneumonic plague within 24 hours of first symptoms to reduce the chance of death.) Ricin - is said to be one of the most toxic natural poisons made very easi- ly from the waste left over from processing castor beans. A castor beanplant is a shrub-like herb with clustered seed pods containing bean-likeseeds. Accidental poisoning by ricin is unlikely -- it would have to be aplanned act to make and use the toxin as a weapon. Ricin can be in manyforms and is not weakened much by extreme hot or cold temperatures.(Note: Ricin is also classed as a \"biotoxin\" under the CDC's chemicalagents' list.) 94 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325How it spr eads :Ricin cannot spread person to person. People come into contact with ricin by breathing in a mist or powder spread into the air(inhalation ), by eating or drinking something containing toxin ( ingestion ), or by having a ricin solution or pellet stuck into the body ( injection ). It can also irritate skin and eyes if exposed to the powder or mist. It is hard to say how much ricin could kill a person since it depends on how that person was exposed to the toxin. For example, about 500 micrograms(about the size of the head of a pin) could kill a person if injected into thebody, but it would take a lot more if inhaled or swallowed. Ricin preventscells from making proteins they need when toxin gets inside the body. Cellswill die without proteins and eventually entire body shuts down and dies. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much ricin a person is exposed to -- in large amounts death could occur within 36 to 72 hours. If a personlives more than 3-5 days without problems, there's a good chance they'llsurvive: Inhalation - within a few hours of breathing in large amounts of ricin, the first signs are usually coughing,tightness in the chest, hard time breathing, fever, nausea(sick to stomach), and heavy sweating. In the next fewhours excess fluid would build up in lungs making it evenharder to breathe and skin may turn blue. Finally, bloodpressure drops and breathing will stop leading to death. Ingestion - if a large amount of ricin is swallowed it will cause internal bleeding of the stomach and intestines,leading to puking and bloody diarrhea within 2 to 6 hours-- and most likely lead to liver, spleen and kidneys shut-ting down, and person could die within several days Injection - if enough ricin is injected into a person, it immediately kills muscles and lymph nodes around areawhere it entered body eventually organs would shut down Skin or eyes - mist or powder can cause redness and pain Treatment :There is no antidote for ricin exposure. Supportive medical care can be given based on how a person was exposed to ricin (like oxygen[if inhalation] or I.V . fluids or flushing stomach with activated charcoal [ifingestion]), but care mainly helps symptoms. If a mist or powder was released, get the ricin off or out of body asap: First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move away and upwind from area ... if in building - get outside to high ground and upwind If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If mist or powder on clothing or skin - remove clothes and 95 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325shoes that are contaminated but don't pull anything over head - cut it off. If possible, seal items in a bag, then sealthat bag in a bag. Immediately wash body with cleanwater and soap. If mist or powder in eyes - remove contacts and put in bags with clothing - do not put back in eyes! If eyes burn-ing or vision blurred, rinse eyes with plain water for 10 to15 minutes. If wearing glasses, wash them with soap andwater before putting back on. Smallpox - is a very serious, highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease caused by the variola virus. The most common form of smallpoxcauses raised bumps on the face and body of an infected person. There hasnot been a case of smallpox in the world since 1977, however in the 1980sall countries consolidated their smallpox stocks in two government-controlled laboratories in the U.S. and Russia. These secured laboratoriesstill have the virus in quantities for research purposes, but it is very possi-ble some vials have gotten or could get into the hands of terrorist groups. Smallpox disease killed over 300 million people in the 20th century and experts say it is the most dangerous infectious disease ever. There is nocure for smallpox and most patients infected with the disease recover, butdeath may occur in as many as 3 of every 10 persons infected. How it spr eads :Smallpox is primarily spread person to person through droplets that are inhaled but usually requires close contact. It can also bespread by infected bodily fluids (especially fluid from bumps) or from bedlinens or clothing from an infected person. It is very rare but the virus couldcarry in the air of an enclosed area like a train or building. Smallpox onlyinfects humans and is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals. Someone carrying the virus may not even know they have it since it lies dormant (incubation period) for up to 17 days. A person with smallpox ismost contagious from the time the rash starts until the last scab falls off(usually about 1 month). Anyone face-to-face with an infected person(within 6 - 7 feet / 2 meters) will most likely get the virus by inhalingdroplets or dried fluids or by touching infected materials. Signs & Symptoms :According to the CDC, exposure to the smallpox virus has an incubation period of 7 to 17 days (average is 12 to 14 days)where people feel fine, show no symptoms and are not contagious, then... Prodrome phase - first symptoms of smallpox include fever, weird or uneasy feeling (malaise), head and bodyaches, and sometimes puking. Fever may be high(between 101F-104F or 38C-40C) -- may be contagious.Phase can last 2 - 4 days. 96 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Spotty mouth - small red spots appear on the tongue and in the mouth (this is start of the \"early rash phase\") Spots become sores - spots turn into sores that break open and spread large amounts of the virus into the mouth andthroat -- person is VERY contagious at this point! Rash - as sores in mouth break down, a rash starts on the face and spreads to arms and legs, then hands and feet --usually takes about 24 hours to cover body. As the rashappears, fever drops, and person may feel a little better. Raised bumps - by third day, rash turns into raised bumps Bumps fill up - by fourth day, bumps fill with a thick, clear fluid -- each bump has a dent in the center (like abellybutton) Bumps become pustules - fever returns and bumps become pustules (which is a raised bump, usually round,firm and feels like there's something hard inside - like aBB pellet) -- lasts about 5 days Pustules become scabs - fever still high, next the pustules form a crust turning into scabs - lasts about 5 days --about 2 weeks after rash first appears most of the soreswill be scabbed over Scabs fall of f- takes about 6 days for all the scabs to fall off leaving a scar or dent in the skin where each scab was(most are gone about 3 weeks after early rash firstappears). Person is no longer contagious when all scabs have fallen off. Treatment :There is no cure or treatment for smallpox . A vaccination within 4 days of being exposed could help stop disease but, if vaccinatedyears ago, it's doubtful you'd be protected now. Many countries are stock-piling vaccine and considering vaccinations for all citizens, but manyexperts feel that may not be necessary yet. There are certain people whoshould not get the vaccine. If you do decide to take vaccination, considerboosting your immune system before getting shots -- may help your bodyfight any adverse reactions. If you have concerns or questions about smallpox , visit the CDC' s Emer- gency Preparedness & Response site at www .bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox or the Public Health Agency of Canada' s Emergency Preparedness site atwww.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ep-mu/smallpox_e.html T ularemia - (also known as \"rabbit fever\") is a disease caused by a strong bacterium, Francisella tularensis , found in wild animals and some insects (especially rabbits, hares, beavers and other rodents, mosquitoes, deerflys 97 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325or ticks) and found in soil, water sources and vegetation in those critters' habitats. F . tularensis is one of the most infectious bacteria known and it doesn't take much to cause the disease, plus it can remain alive for weeksin water and soil. Tularemia has been considered useful as an airborneweapon worldwide since the 1930s which is why there's valid concern itcould be used today in a terrorist attack. How it spr eads :Tularemia is not known to spread person to person. Some wild animals carry the disease - usually because they were bitten by aninfected bug or drank or ate from contaminated water or soil. Hunters andpeople who spend a lot of time outdoors can get the disease from crittersthrough a bite or handling a diseased carcass ( skin), from eating an infected animal not properly cooked or by drinking contaminated water(stomach ), or from breathing in dust from contaminated soil ( lungs ). Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how person is exposed to tularemia and all symptoms may not occur -- all 3 usually appear in 3 to 5 days (or takeup to 14 days) ... may include fever, chills, joint pain, weakness, and ... Skin - may also include a bump or ulcers on bite, swollen and painful lymph glands Stomach - may also include sore throat, abdominal pain, ulcers on or in mouth, diarrhea or puking Lungs - may also include dry cough, chest pain, bloody spittle, trouble breathing or stops breathing Treatment : Tularemia can be treated with antibiotics but exposure to F. tularensis should be treated as soon as possible since it can be deadly. Viral hemorr hagic [hem-o-RAJ-ik] fevers (VHFs) - are a group of dis- eases or illnesses caused by several families of viruses. There are manytypes of VHFs - some the public may recognize are Ebola, Marburg or hantavirus. Some VHFs cause mild reactions or illnesses while others aredeadly. Most VHFs are highly contagious and associated with bleeding(hemorrhage), but that's usually not life-threatening. In severe cases, theoverall vascular - or blood vessel - system is damaged so the body can'tregulate itself thus causing organs to shut down. Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs ) are quite an extensive and complex topic so we are only mentioning it here since it's on the CDC's Category A list.Both the CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada cover VHFs atlength on their web sites if you would like to learn more. We're just brieflyexplaining how it can spread and listing some general signs and symptomsin the event you ever hear about \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\" in the news. 98 www.itsadisaster.net or it spr eads :Most viruses associated with VHFs naturally reside in animals (mice or other rodents) or insects (ticks or mosquitoes). SomeVHF viruses could spread to humans by the bite of an infected insect or bybreathing in or touching an infected animal's pee, poop, or other body fluids. (For example, a person crawling in a rat-infested area could stir upand breathe in a virus, or someone slaughtering livestock infected by aninsect bite could also spread the virus.) Some other viruses spread personto person through close contact with an infected person's body fluids. Signs & Symptoms :Signs vary (from minor to deadly) by the type of VHF , but first symptoms often include sudden fever, fatigue (very tired), dizziness, weakness and headache. Person could also have a sore throat,abdominal pain, puking, and diarrhea. Severe cases often show signs ofbleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from the mouth, eyes, or ears.Blood loss is not usually life-threatening, but the damaged vascular systemcan cause shock, coma, seizures, organ failure or death. T reatment :There is no specific cure or vaccine for most VHFs . Hospitalization and supportive care can be given in strict isolation to pre-vent the virus from spreading to others, but care mainly helps symptoms.Keeping rodents and mosquitoes out of your home is good prevention. BEFORE A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK : If you skipped the last several pages discussing some BIOLOGICALagents, you may want to review them along with the following BEFORE,DURING and AFTER tips developed by FEMA and the Department ofHomeland Security. W atch & listen for signs - Many biological agents do not give immediate \"warning signs\" -- and most symptoms show up hours or days later so it'shard to say what to watch for, but learn about some common agents (seeprevious pages) and stay current by listening to radio and TV reports tohear what local authorities tell people to do -- and DO it! Report strange things - Be aware of your surroundings -- watch for strange or suspicious packages ... or spray trucks or crop dusters in weird places atstrange times ... and report suspicious activities to local authorities. Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Get rid of pests - Keep home clean and put food away that might attract rats or mice and get rid of \"standing water\" sources around yard (like buckets,tires, pots, or kiddie pools) since they are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. 99 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK : During any type of biological attack, local authorities will instruct the public about where to go and exactly what to do if exposed to an agent(which may require immediate attention with professional medical staff).It's possible there may be signs (as seen with the anthrax mailings), butmore likely it would be discovered after the fact when local health care workers have a wave of sick people seeking emergency medical attentionor there are reports of unusual illnesses or symptoms. Don' t panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is in danger or if you were in the area when it was contaminated. Learn signs and symptoms of agent or disease (see previous pages briefly describing anthrax Ebola or Marburg] ). Find out if medications or vaccines are being distributed by authorities and, if so, where you can get them. Cover up - Cover your mouth and nose with layers of fabric to filter air but still let you breathe (like 2-3 layers of cotton T-shirt or towel or severallayers of paper towel, napkins or tissues). Clean up - Wash with soap and water to keep from spreading germs. Stay away - Get away from the attack site to avoid contamination. Evacuate...? - If you are told to evacuate... DO it! If officials say you have time, close windows, shut vents and turn off attic fans. (see EVACUATION) Things to avoid: powder - white powdery substance in strange places aerosol mists - could drift for miles / may be hard to see contaminated food or water - don't eat or drink any food or water that may have been exposed to agents Feel sick...? - Many symptoms from biological agents take time to show up so watch family members for signs of illness. 100 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325AFTER A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK : Don' t panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is or was in danger. Learn signs and symptoms of specific agent or disease. Find out if medications or vaccines are being distributed by authorities and, if so, where you can get them. Feel sick...? - In most cases, people won't be aware they have been exposed to an agent -- some cause immediate symptoms but many take a while toshow up so keep watching for signs of illness. Don' t go there - Do not return home until local authorities say it is safe. Don' t spread it - A person, critter, or item that has been exposed to a disease or biological agent may spread it so... clean up - if your skin or clothing comes in contact with a suspected visible powder or liquid, wash with soap andwater to keep from spreading germs store clothes & shoes - put exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers without touching other materialsand call local authorities to ask how to get rid of them strange symptoms - if unusual symptoms show up, get to a hospital or medical expert right away! tell people you've been exposed - tell everyone who comes in contact with you that you may have beenexposed to a biological agent land and property - ask local authorities how to clean up (or ask if it's even necessary) For more information about biological agents orbioterrorism , please visit the Center for Disease Control' s Emergency Preparedness & Responseweb site at www .bt.cdc.gov or Public Health Agency of Canada' s Emergency Preparedness site at www .phac-aspc.gc.ca/ep-mu/index.html or call the CDC Public Response Hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) or 1-888-232-6348 (TTY). ABOUT CHEMICAL AGENTS Chemical agents are toxic vapors (gas), sprays (aerosols), liquids or solids that can poison people, animals and the environment. Some compounds oragents do have industrial uses, but many are man-made substancesdesigned, developed and stockpiled as military weapons around the world. 101 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325A known terrorist tactic combines bombs and chemical trucks to spread deadly fumes. Most chemical agents are difficult to produce and very hardto deliver in large quantities since they scatter so quickly. Most are liquidsand some may be odorless and tasteless. They could be inhaled, absorbedinto the skin, or swallowed from a contaminated food or water source.Chemical agents can take effect immediately or over several hours or days- and can be deadly if exposed to enough of the agent. If exposed, the bestthing to do is distance yourself from the agent and area and get fresh air. What chemical agents could be used in an attack? According to the CDC, there are several categories of chemical agents that could potentially be used in a terrorist attack - some common ones include: Blister Agents / Vesicants (Sulfur Mustard / Mustard Gas or Lewisite) - primarily cause blisters but can also dam-age eyes, airways, and digestive system Blood Agents (Arsine or Cyanide) - gets in blood stream and prevents cells from absorbing oxygen so cells die Choking / Lung / Pulmonary Agents (Ammonia or Chlorine) - cause breathing problems and lack of oxygendamages organs Incapacitating Agents (BZ or LSD) - disrupts central nervous system, causes confusion, and slows breathing(makes you woozy or knocks you out) Nerve Agents (Sarin, Soman, Tabun or VX) - the most toxic agents -- basically turns \"off\" the body's ability tostop muscles and glands from twitching (body goes intoconvulsions). Most agents were originally developed aspesticides / insecticides. Some other categories include ... Biotoxins (like Abrin or Ricin), Caustics (Hydrofluoric Acid), Metals (Arsenic or Mercury), Organic Solvents (Benzene), Riot Control Agents / Tear Gas (CS or CN), Toxic Alcohols (Ethylene Glycol), and Vomiting Agents (Adamsite). Remember, many chemical weapons - or chemical warfare - have been around since World War I ... it's unfortunate we have to even discuss it buttry not to let this topic frighten you. As we stated earlier, educate your-selves about the types and where to find more information so you are prepared to react in the event of a chemical threat or attack. How could chemical agents be used in an attack? There are several ways chemical agents could be spread: Vapors / Gas / Aerosols - spread into air by a bomb or from aircraft, boats or vehicles -- could spread for miles 102 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Liquids - could be released into the air, water or soil or touched by people or animals Solids - could be absorbed into water, soil or touched Some chemical agents can remain in the environment and cause problems long after they are released. Again, keep in mind, both the Center forDisease Control and Environmental Protection Agency are working close-ly with various Departments of Defense and Energy and many officialsaround the country to monitor systems and security and develop plans. Thesame goes for Health Canada and other Canadian government agencies. Again, the CDC asks citizens to not be frightened into thinking they need a gas mask or be concerned about water or food sources. In the event of apublic health emergency, officials will tell people what actions need to betaken. What ar e the names of some chemical agents and what can they do? According to the Center for Disease Control's Emergency Preparedness and Response web site, there are many types of chemical agents - again toomany to list here. We're only mentioning several common agents in alpha-betical order, but realize there are many others we are not covering thatcould potentially be used. Always listen to authorities for instructions in theevent of a chemical threat or attack. BZ (Incapacitating ) - and other stun agents (LSD, etc.) disrupt the central nervous system causing confusion, short-term memory loss and immobili-ty (means you can't move or are incapacitated). How it spr eads :BZcould be released by a bomb or sprayed into the air as an aerosol but has been proven unpredictable if used outdoors. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how person is exposed to BZand varies by person -- basically it screws with your nervous system causing confu-sion, dream-like feelings or strange visions (called hallucinations), dilationof the pupils (means pupils bigger than normal), slurred speech, and loss ofmotor skills (can't move). It can also slow down breathing and heart rate. T reatment :BZis treated with an antidote that reverses symptoms for about an hour. May need repeated doses since the effects can last for hoursor days. Chlorine (Choking / Lung / Pulmonary ) - is used in industry (to bleach paper or cloth), in water (to kill germs), and in household products.Chlorine can be in the form of a poisonous gas or gas can be pressurizedand cooled into a liquid. When gas comes in contact with moist tissues 103 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325(eyes, throat, or lungs), an acid is produced that can damage these tissues. Chlorine is not flammable but reacts explosively if mixed with certainliquids. Terrorists use bombs on chlorine trucks to spread deadly fumes. How it spr eads :Chlorine could be released into water, food or air. People can be exposed by drinking or eating something contaminated with excessamounts of chlorine or by inhaling the poisonous gas. Chlorine gas is yel-low-green, smells like bleach, and stays close to the ground as it spreads. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much and how exposed but signs may show up during or right after exposure to dangerous amounts of chlorine : Skin - if gas: burning pain, redness, and blisters if liquid: skin white or waxy, numbness (like frostbite) Eyes - burning feeling, blurred vision, watery eyes Nose, throat & lungs (respiratory tract) - burning feeling in nose and throat, tightness in chest, coughing, hardtime breathing or shortness of breath, fluid builds up inlungs within 2 to 4 hours S tomach / gastrointestinal : puking, sick to stomach Treatment :- There is no antidote for chlorine exposure -- main things are to remove it from body and seek medical attention as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - get to high ground (avoid low-lying areas) ... if in building - get outside to high ground and upwind If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove clothes and shoes that are contaminated but don't pull anything over head - cut it offbody. If possible, seal clothing in plastic bag, then sealthat bag in a bag. Immediately wash body with cleanwater and soap. Ask officials how to dispose of bags. If in eyes - remove contacts and put in a bag - do not put back in eyes! If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyeswith plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If wearing glasses,wash them with soap and water before putting back on. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to chlorine, do NOT make them puke or drinkfluids - call 9-1-1 Cyanide (Blood ) - is a very fast acting and potentially deadly chemical that exists in several forms. The CDC categorizes cyanide as \"blood\" agents butsometimes called \"cyanide or cyanogen\" agents. Cyanide can be a color-less gas (cyanogen chloride or hydrogen cyanide) or a crystal solid form 104 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325(like potassium or sodium cyanide). It may smell like \"bitter almonds\" but most often is odorless. Cyanide is naturally present in some foods or plants- it's also in cigarette smoke or given off when some plastics burn. It is alsoused to make paper or textiles and in chemicals used to develop photos. How it spr eads :Cyanide could enter water, soil or air as a result of natu- ral or industrial processes or be spread indoors or outdoors as a weapon.People can be exposed by breathing gas or vapors or cigarette smoke, bydrinking or eating something contaminated (either accidentally or on pur-pose) or by touching soil or clothing that was exposed to cyanide. The gasdisappears quickly and rises (less dense than air) so pretty useless outdoors. Signs & Symptoms :Basically cyanide prevents the cells from absorbing oxygen so cells die. No matter how exposed (breathing, absorbed throughskin, or eating / drinking) some or all signs show up within minutes: Exposed to small amount - rapid breathing, gasping for air, dizziness, weakness, headache, sick to stomach, puking, restlessness, rapid heart rate, bluish skin or lips(due to lack of oxygen in blood) Lar ge amount - above signs plus convulsions, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, passes out, stops breathing lead-ing to death. Survivors of serious poisoning may developheart and brain damage due to lack of oxygen. T reatment :Cyanide poisoning is treated with antidotes and supportive medical care (mainly to help symptoms). The main things are to avoid areawhere it was released and seek medical attention as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move upwind and stay low to ground ... if in building - get outside and get upwind If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove contaminated shoes and clothes but don't pull anything over head - cut it off. Sealall in a bag then put that bag in a bag - ask how to disposeof. Immediately wash body and hair with soap & water. If in eyes - remove contacts if necessary. If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyes with water for 10-15 minutes. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to cyanide, do NOT make them puke or drinkfluids - call 9-1-1 Sarin (Nerve ) - is a clear, colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid that could evaporate into a vapor (gas) and contaminate the environment. It is man- 105 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325made and originally developed to kill insects. Nerve agents basically turn \"off\" the body's ability to stop muscles and glands from twitching. How it spr eads :Sarin could be released into the air, water, or soil as a weapon. People can be exposed by breathing vapors, by drinking or eatingsomething contaminated, or by touching water, soil or clothing exposed tosarin. A person's clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after beingexposed to vapor. Because sarin vapor is heavier than air, it settles in low-lying areas creating a greater exposure hazard. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much, what form, and how people are exposed to sarin . No matter how exposed (breathing, absorbed through skin, or eating / drinking it), the following may show up within seconds(vapor or gas) or within minutes to 18 hours (liquid)... Head - runny nose, drooling or excess spittle, headache Eyes - watery, small pupils, blurred vision, eye pain Lungs - cough, tight feeling in chest, fast/rapid breathing Nervous system - confusion, drowsiness, weakness Heart/blood - slow/fast pulse, rise/drop in blood pressure Stomach/gastrointestinal - abdominal pain, puking, sick to stomach, diarrhea, pee lot more than normal ... plus ... If exposed to small amount - just a drop of sarin on skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching If lar ge amount - can cause convulsions (body can't stop the muscles and glands from twitching), paralysis (can'tmove), pass out, stops breathing leading to death T reatment :Sarin poisoning is treated with antidotes and supportive med- ical care. Mainly want to avoid area where released, get decontaminated(strip & wash), and seek medical attention as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move to higher ground and stay upwind ... if in building - get outside to highest ground possible If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove contaminated clothes and shoes but don't pull anything over head - cut it off body.Seal all in plastic bag, then seal that bag in a bag and askhow to dispose of. Immediately wash body with cleanwater and soap. If in eyes - remove contacts if any. If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyes with water for 10 -15 minutes. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something 106 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325exposed to sarin, do NOT make them puke or drink fluids - call 9-1-1 Sulfur Mustard / Mustard gas (Blister/Vesicant ) - (also known as mus- tard agent) can be in the form of a vapor, an oily-textured liquid or a solidand be clear to yellow or brown when in liquid or solid form. It is not normally found in the environment, however, if released, can last for weeksor months under very cold conditions. During normal weather conditions,it usually only lasts a day or two. Mustard gas is fairly easy to develop so many countries that decide to have chemical warfare agents usually stock up on this one. Sulfur mustard wasoriginally produced in the 1800's but first used as chemical warfare inWorld War I and in many wars since. Exposure to mustard gas is usuallynot fatal but could have long-term health effects. How it spr eads :Sulfur mustard / mustard gas can be released into the air as a vapor or gas and enter a person's body by breathing or get on skin orin eyes. The vapor would be carried for long distances by wind so couldaffect a wide area. Sulfur mustard is heavier than air so vapors will settlein low-lying areas. A liquid or solid form could be released into water anda person could be exposed by drinking it or absorbing it through the skin.Since it often has no smell or smell doesn't raise a red flag (can smell likegarlic, onions or mustard), people may not realize they have been exposed. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much, what form, and how a per- son is exposed to sulfur mustard / mustard gas and may not occur for 2 to 24 hours ... some immediate signs include... Skin - redness and itching of skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure -- changes to yellow blistering of skin Eyes - a mild case causes irritation, pain, swelling and watery eyes within 3 to 12 hours -- a more severe casecauses same within 1 to 2 hours - may also include lightsensitivity, severe pain or temporary blindness (lasting upto 10 days) Nose & lungs (respiratory tract) - runny nose, sneezing, sinus pain, bloody nose, short of breath, may get hoarse,and cough (mild exposure shows within 12 to 24 hours --severe shows within 2 to 4 hours) Digestive tract - abdominal pain, sick to stomach, diarrhea, puking, and fever Some long-term health effects may include ... Burns or scarring - exposure to the liquid (not gas) may produce second- and third-degree burns and later scarring 107 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Breathing problems or disease - severe exposure could cause chronic respiratory disease, infections, or death Blindness - severe exposure can cause permanent blind- ness Cancer - may increase risk of lung or respiratory cancer Treatment :There is no antidote for sulfur mustard / mustard gas exposure - the best thing to do is avoid it by leaving the area where it was released. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move upwind and get to higher ground ... if inside - get outside, upwind and to higher ground If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove everything that got con- taminated. Seal clothing and shoes in plastic bag, thenseal that bag in a bag - ask how to dispose of later.Immediately wash exposed body parts (eyes, skin, hair,etc.) with plain, clean water. If in eyes - remove contacts if any. Flush eyes with water for 5 - 10 minutes but do NOT cover eyes with bandages- put on shades or goggles to protect them. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something con- taminated with sulfur mustard, do NOT make them pukeit up -- give the person some milk to drink and call 9-1-1 VX (Nerve ) - is an oily liquid that is odorless, tasteless, amber or honey- yellow in color, and evaporates about as slowly as motor oil. VX is themost potent of all nerve agents, which basically turn \"off\" the body's abil-ity to stop muscles and glands from twitching. Like other nerve agents, VXis a man-made chemical originally developed to kill insects and pests. How it spr eads :VXcould be released into the air or water as a weapon, however it does not mix with water as well as other nerve agents. If VX gasor vapors are released into the air, people can be exposed by breathing oreye or skin contact and a person's clothing can release VX for about 30minutes after being exposed. If VX liquid is put in food or water source,people could get it from eating, drinking or touching something exposed tothe liquid. VX vapor is heavier than air so settles in low-lying areas. Under average weather conditions, VX can last for days on objects that come in contactwith the agent, but in cold weather it could last for months. The liquid takestime to evaporate into a vapor so could be a long-term threat to the environment. 108 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Signs & Symptoms :VXis similar to sarin - depends on how much, what form, and how people are exposed. No matter how exposed (breathing,absorbed through skin, or eating / drinking it) the following may show upwithin seconds to hours ... Head - runny nose, drooling or excess spittle, headache Eyes - watery, small pupils, blurred vision, eye pain Lungs - cough, tight feeling in chest, fast/rapid breathing Nervous system - confusion, drowsiness, weakness Heart/blood - slow/fast pulse, rise/drop in blood pressure Stomach/gastrointestinal - abdominal pain, puking, sick to stomach, diarrhea, pee more than normal ... plus ... If exposed to small amount - a tiny drop of VX on skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching If lar ge amount - can cause convulsions (body can't stop the muscles and glands from twitching), paralysis (can'tmove), may pass out, stops breathing leading to death T reatment :VXpoisoning can be treated with antidotes but must be given shortly after exposure to be effective. The main things are avoid area whereagent was released, get decontaminated (strip & wash), and seek medicalcare as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move to higher ground and stay upwind ... if in building - get outside to highest ground possible If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove clothes and shoes contam- inated with VX but don't pull anything over head - cut itoff body. Seal all in plastic bag, then seal that bag in a bagand ask how to dispose of. Immediately wash body withclean water and soap. If in eyes - remove contacts if any. If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyes with water for 10 to 15 minutes. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to VX, do NOT make them puke or drink fluids- call 9-1-1 BEFORE A CHEMICAL ATTACK : If you skipped the last several pages discussing some CHEMICAL agents,you may want to review them, along with these BEFORE, DURING and 109 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325AFTER tips developed by FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. You may also want to review HAZARDOUS MATERIALS topic. Watch & listen for signs - Many chemical agents can cause watery eyes, choking, trouble breathing, coughing or twitching. If you see or hear a lotof people doing this or see a bunch of birds, fish or critters sick or dead, itshould raise a red flag. Learn about some common potentially hazardouschemical agents (see previous pages) and stay current by listening to radioand TV to hear what local authorities tell people to do -- and DO it! Report strange things - Be aware of your surroundings -- watch for strange or suspicious packages ... or spray trucks or crop dusters in weird places atstrange times ... and report suspicious activities to local authorities. Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Some key items include a battery-powered radio (with extra batteries), food and drinking water, duct tape, plastic and scis-sors, first aid kit, and sanitation items (soap, extra water and bleach). Pick a room - It could take authorities time to determine what (if any) agent was used so pick a room in advance your family could use if told to\"shelter-in-place\" for several hours. It's best to pick an internal room whereyou could block out air IF told to do so. To save time consider measuring and cutting plastic sheets in advance for openings (vents, windows, anddoors). Remember, toilets / drains may be vented meaning outside aircomes in constantly or when flushed / open (depends on design) - in caseusing bathroom as a safe room. Calculate air for room - Keep in mind people can stay in a sealed off room for only so long (or you'll run out of air!) FEMA suggests 10 square feetof floor space per person (like 5ft x 2ft / 1.5m x 0.6m ) will provide enoughair to prevent carbon dioxide buildup for up to 5 hours. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A CHEMICAL ATTACK : During any type of chemical attack, local authorities will instruct the pub- lic on where to go and exactly what to do if exposed to an agent (whichmay require immediate attention with professional medical staff). W atch for signs - If you see or hear a lot of people choking, coughing or twitching or see a bunch of sick or dead critters - leave area quickly! Don' t panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... 110 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Determine if your area is or was in danger. Learn signs and symptoms of some agents (see previous pages briefly describing BZ, chlorine, cyanide, sarin, sulfur mustard / mustard gas , and VX). Find out if and where antidotes are being distributed. IF INDOORS - Stay inside and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"... Close your windows, vents and fireplace damper and turn off A/C and fans to reduce air drawn in from outside. Seal gaps under doorways and windows with wet towels, plastic (if available) and duct tape. If you picked a safe room in advance, grab your Disaster Supplies Kit and seal off that room - remember, you can only stay there for so many hours or you'll run out of air. Some vapors and gases may sink so avoid basements. IF OUTDOORS - Stay upwind from the disaster area since many agents can be carried by wind. Try to find a shelter as quickly as possible! IF IN A VEHICLE - Close your windows and shut off vents to reduce risk and drive away and upwind from the attack site, if possible. Cover up - Cover mouth and nose to filter air but still let you breathe (like a T-shirt or towel or several layers of paper towel, napkins or tissues). Feel sick...? - Some agents can cause immediate symptoms and some take a while to show up so watch family members for signs of illness. Evacuate...? - If you are told to evacuate... DO it! If officials say you have time, close windows, shut vents and turn off attic fans. (see EVACUATION) Things to avoid: chemicals - any spilled liquid materials, vapors or gas contaminated food or water - don't eat or drink any food or water that may have been exposed to materials Stay away - Get away from the attack site to avoid contamination. AFTER A CHEMICAL ATTACK : Feel sick...? - In some cases, people won't be aware they have been exposed to an agent -- most cause immediate symptoms and some take awhile to show up so continue watching for signs of illness. 111 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Don' t panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is or was in danger. Learn signs and symptoms of specific chemical agent(s). Find out if antidotes are being distributed by authorities and, if so, where you can get them. Don' t go there - Don't return home until local authorities say it is safe. Air out - Open windows, vents and turn on fans in your home. Clean up - A person, critter or item that has been exposed could spread it... decontamination - follow instructions from authorities since it depends on chemical. May need to shower with orwithout soap or may be told to avoid water - check first! strange symptoms - if unusual symptoms show up, get to a hospital or medical expert right away! store clothes & shoes - put exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers or bags and ask local authoritieshow to get rid of them tell people you've been exposed - tell everyone who comes in contact with you that you may have beenexposed to a chemical agent land and property - ask local authorities how to clean up S trange vapors or danger - Report any strange vapors or other dangers to the local authorities immediately. For more information about chemical agents , please visit the Center for Disease Control' s Emergency Preparedness & Response web site atwww .bt.cdc.gov .. or .. call the CDC Public Response Hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) or 1-888-232-6348 (TTY). ABOUT RADIOLOGICAL THREAT OR DEVICE Due to the heightened threat of terrorist attacks using a \"dirty bomb\", we are briefly covering it here, but please review NUCLEAR topic since itcontains additional information about radiation. What is a \"dir ty bomb\"? A radiological dispersion device ( RDD ) - also known as a \"dirty bomb\" - uses conventional explosives (such as dynamite) to spread radioactive materials in the form of powder or pellets over a targeted area. 112 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325A terrorist's main reasons for using a \"dirty bomb\" is to cause damage to buildings, contaminate an area, and spread fear or panic. This type of attackappeals to terrorists since it doesn't require a lot of technical know-how tobuild and use ... plus low-level radioactive materials are pretty easy toobtain since they are used in many fields like agriculture, research andmedicine. The most harmful, high-level radioactive materials would be found in nuclear power plants and at nuclear weapons sites, but with the heightenedstate of alert at many of these locations, it'd be hard for terrorist organiza-tions to get them within the U.S. Please note, nuclear incidents are covered on pages 74-79 and 231-243. (Also note, another known terrorist tactic uses bombs on chemical trucks to spread deadly fumes. See previous pages covering Chemical Agents.) What ar e the dangers of an RDD (\"dir ty bomb\")? According to the Center for Disease Control, the primary danger from a dirty bomb would be the blast itself - not necessarily the radiation.Knowing how much (if any) radiation might be present at the attack site isdifficult when the source of the radiation is unknown until site is tested.However, since many RDDs use low-level radioactive materials, thereprobably would not be enough radiation to cause severe illness. Has anyone used a \"dir ty bomb\" befor e? According to a United Nations report, Iraq tested a dirty bomb device in 1987 but found the radiation levels were too low to cause significant damage. Thus, Iraq abandoned any further use of the device. 8 What if you or your office r eceives a \"bomb thr eat\"? Bomb threats are usually received by a telephone call or in the mail. It ishighly unlikely a terrorist organization using a \"dirty bomb\" would giveanyone advance warning or call with a bomb threat, however, in the eventyou or someone in your office receives a bomb threat, do the following... If you ever receive a bomb threat, get as much informa- tion from the caller as possible (e.g. what kind of bomb,what does it look like, where is it, when will it go off, etc.) Try to keep caller on phone as long as you can and write down everything that is said! (Since you'll be nervous or scared, good notes will be very helpful to officials later!) Notify the police and building management. Calmly evacuate the building, keep the sidewalks clear and stay away from windows. 113 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What if you or someone in your office r eceives a \"suspicious package\"? According to the United States Postal Service, the likelihood of you ever receiving a bomb in the mail is remote. Unfortunately, there have been asmall number of explosive devices and biological agents that have surfacedin the mail over the years. Some possible motives for an individual orgroup sending a \"suspicious package\" include revenge, extortion, love triangles, terrorism, and business disputes. The following are some unique signs or characteristics from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service that may help identify a \"suspect\" piece of mail ... Package may have restricted markings like \"Personal\" or \"Private\" to one who doesn't receive personal mail atoffice or to someone no longer working there. Package is sealed with excessive amounts of tape or has way too much postage on it. Postmark city different than Return Address city. Misspelled words, written badly or done with letters cut from newspaper or magazine and pasted on. Package has wires or aluminum foil sticking out, oil stains, smells weird or sounds funny (sloshing noise). Package may feel strange or look uneven or lopsided. If you are unsure about a letter or package and are not able to verify the Sender or contents with the person it is addressed to then... DO NOT open it, shake it, bump it or sniff it! Cover the letter or package with a shirt, trash can or whatever is handy. Evacuate the area quickly and calmly. Wash your hands with lots of soap and water. Call building security, police and your postal inspector. List all the people who were near the package or letter in case they are needed for further questioning. BEFORE A RADIOLOGICAL THREAT OR EVENT : Make a plan - Review Section 1 and check emergency plans for schools, day care and nursing home to find out where everyone goes if evacuated. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to authorities -- if told to leave - DO it! Learn about radiation - Please review pages 74-79 since a nuclear-related incident is a similar situation. 114 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DURING A RADIOLOGICAL EVENT OR EXPLOSION : Don' t panic... - Stay calm and don't stop to retrieve personal items or make phone calls - get to a safe place. Don' t look... - Do NOT look directly at explosion, flash, blast or fireball! Things to watch out for : falling objects - if things are falling off bookshelves or from the ceiling get under a sturdy table or desk fire- stay below the smoke (crawl or walk like a duck) - only use the stairs (don't use elevators) - check doors with back of hand before opening (If HOT , do NOT open - find another exit!) weak floors or stairs - be careful since floors and stairs could have been weakened by the blast IF INDOORS - Stay put if building is not damaged but leave if warned of a radiation release inside. Cover nose and mouth and find shelter in a build-ing not damaged by blast and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\". IF OUTDOORS - Cover mouth and nose with a cloth or handkerchief and take shelter in a safe building as quickly as possible! IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows up, close vents, use \"recirculating\" air and keep listening to radio for updates. If possible, drive away from site. AFTER A RADIOLOGICAL EVENT OR EXPLOSION : If you are trapped in an area: light - use flashlight - never use matches or lighters in case there are gas leaks be still - try to stay still so you won't kick up dust breathing - cover your mouth with a piece of clothing make noise - tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can hear you (shouting may cause you to inhale a lot of dust) Rescuing others - Untrained persons should not try to rescue people who are inside a collapsed building... wait for emergency personnel to arrive -then, IF they need you, they will ask. Reduce exposure - Get out of area quickly and into nearest building to reduce chances of being exposed to radioactive materials (or chemicals).The less time you spend in a potentially contaminated area the better. 115 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If radioactive materials were possibly present: Don' t panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is in danger or contaminated. Find out where to go for radiation monitoring and blood tests to determine if you were exposed and what to do toprotect your health if radioactive materials are found. Learn if KI(potassium iodide) is being passed out by authorities and, if so, find out where to get it. Or ask ifyou should take KI if in your Disaster Supplies Kit (more about KI on page 75). Dirty bombs don't normallyhave radioactive iodide so KI may not be needed. As long as you are NOT told to evacuate: S tay put - Stay inside and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"! Close doors, windows, vents and fireplace damper. Turn off air conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakes (they pull in air from outside). Grab Disaster Supplies Kit and go to a basement or underground area (if possible). Keep a battery-operated radio with you to hear updates. Stay inside until authorities tell you it is safe to go out! Clean up - If you were possibly exposed to radiation (or chemicals)... store clothes & shoes - put clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers or plastic bags and ask health officials what to do with them shower - wash body and hair to remove particles / toxins Will I get radiation sickness or cancer ...?- Just because you were at the site of a dirty bomb does not mean you were exposed to radioactive materials.Radiation cannot be seen, smelled, felt, or tasted. Until doctors are able tocheck skin with sensitive detection devices or run blood tests to determinethere was any radiation - no one really knows if they were exposed (unlessyou have your own detection devices - see page 234). And, even if youwere exposed to small amounts of radioactive material, it does not meanyou'll be sick or get cancer. Stay calm -- listen to and work with medicalhealth professionals since it depends on each situation or incident.

In many cases,WMD would create mass disruption, widespread panic, and huge econom-ic losses without necessarily causing mass casualties. In the event of a threat against North America with WMD, there are officials from all levels of government responsible for employing andequipping WMD terrorism response units to manage the situation. Theinformation in this book may be helpful, but it is critical the general public stays calm and listens to local and federal officials for specific instructions. Again, citizens need to remain calm about the threat of terrorist attacks and learn about some of the types, how to prepare for them, and what to expectin some cases. Stay current on news but don't obsess over it ... and just beaware of your surroundings as you go about your daily routines.

AT HUNDERSTORM ? Thunderstorms are very common... in fact, at any given moment, nearly 1,800 thunderstorms can be in progress over the face of the earth! The U.S.usually averages about 100,000 thunderstorms each year. Lightning always comes with a thunderstorm since that is what causes the thunder. If you have ever heard someone say lightning never strikes thesame place twice... WRONG... it can! In fact, lightning OFTEN strikesthe same place several times during one storm. Lightning actually comesfrom the ground up into the air and back down - we just see it as it comesdown so it looks like it's coming from the clouds. Severe thunderstorms can also bring heavy rains, flooding, hail, strong winds, tornadoes and microbursts (a sudden vertical drop of air). BEFORE A THUNDERSTORM : Prepare - Review WIND, FLOOD, and LIGHTNING MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with thunderstorms... Severe Thunderstorm Watch - tells you when and where severe thunderstorms are possible Severe Thunderstorm Warning - severe thunderstorms have been spotted or are occurring Watch for lightning - If you hear thunder, you're close enough to be struck by lightning - take cover as quickly as possible. Unplug it - Unplug appliances if possible - even ones on a surge protector and it's best to move plugs away from outlets. DURING A THUNDERSTORM : Listen - Keep a battery-operated radio handy for local reports on storm (especially severe storms which could cause tornadoes!) IF INDOORS - Stay inside until the storm passes. Don' t shower - sounds weird, but wait since water can carry an electrical charge if lightning strikes near home 118 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Telephone - corded phones conduct electricity (could shock you). Cordless and cell phones are safe. IF OUTDOORS - Try to get to safe shelter quickly. Move away from tall things (trees, towers, fences or power lines) and metal things (umbrellas, motorcycles orbicycles, wire fences, etc) since they all attract lightning. If surrounded by trees, take shelter under the shorter trees. Get to a low lying area but watch out for flash floods. Be small - make yourself a small target by crouching down and put your hands on your knees (and don't lie flaton the ground since that makes you a bigger target!) IF IN A BOAT - Get to land and to shelter quickly! Water is extremely dangerous when there's lightning! IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows closed and stay out of a convertible, if possible (mainly since you may the highest target if lightning strikes). Hairy sign - If you feel your hair stand on end and feel tingly (which means lightning is about to strike)... crouch down and bend forward putting handson your knees (be small)! Don't lie flat on ground... makes a bigger target! If someone is struck by lightning: Victim does not carry electrical charge - CAN be touched. Call 9-1-1 or local EMS (emergency) telephone number. Victim will have 2 wounds - an entrance and an exit burn (see BURNS [Electrical] in Section 3) AFTER A THUNDERSTORM : Things to avoid: flooded areas - stay away from flood waters since may be contaminated by oil, gas or raw sewage or electricallycharged from underground or downed power lines orlightning - wait for authorities to say okay to return moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (.6 m) can float a car storm-damaged areas downed power lines Recovery tips - Review TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER at end of this Section. 119 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... AT ORNADO ? The U.S. has more tornadoes than anywhere else in the world (averaging about 1,000 per year), with sightings in all 50 states. Canada is # 2 in volume of tornadoes (averaging about 80 per year) with several high riskareas mostly in central provinces. Most injuries or deaths caused by tornadoes are from collapsing buildings, flying objects, or trying to outrun a twister in a vehicle. Tornadoes can alsoproduce violent winds, hail, lightning, rain and flooding. Dr. T. Fujita developed the Fujita Scale (F-scale) based only on damage to homes. As of 2007, the National Weather Service uses a new scale calledthe Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale that classifies tornadoes based on 28 Damage Indicators to more accurately estimate wind speeds. Scale Wind Estimate Typical Damage (per NOAA and Wikipedia) EF0 65-85 mph Light : damage to 105-137 km/h gutters or siding; broken branches, etc. EF1 86-110 Moderate : Strips surface off roofs; mobile 138-177 km/h homes overturned; broken windows, ripped off sturdy homes; 218-266 km/h trees debarked; heavy cars lifted & thrown, 166-200 mph Devastating : Well-constructed homes leveled; 267-322 km/h cars thrown; small missiles generated, etc. EF5 > 200 mph Incredible : All homes leveled and swept away; > 322 km/h car-sized missiles fly thru air over 100 metres (109 yards); structural damage to high-rises, etc. BEFORE A TORNADO : Prepare - Review WIND, FLOOD, and LIGHTNING MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with tornado threats... Tornado watch - a tornado is possible - listen for updates Tornado warning - a tornado has been sighted so take shelter quickly and keep a radio with you for updates 120 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Learn risks - Ask local emergency management office about threats in your area, what the warning signals are, and what to do when you hear them. Where am I? - Make sure your kids know what county or area you live in and listen for that name on radio or TV updates. Get tuned in - Keep a battery-operated radio (with spare batteries) handy for weather forecasts and updates. (Some radios like EnvironmentCanada's Weatheradio and NOAA's Weather Radio have tone-alert featuresthat automatically alert you when a Watch or Warning has been issued.) Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and if told to leave - DO it! (see EVACUATION) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Learn to shut of f- Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions. Where do I go? - Know locations of shelters where you spend time (schools, nursing homes, office, etc.) The best place is underground (like abasement, a safe room, or storm cellar) or find a hallway, bathroom, orcloset in middle of building on the lowest floor. Do drills - Practice going to shelter with your family and \"duck and cover\" (use your hands and arms to protect head and stay down low). Put it on film - Either videotape or take pictures of home and personal belongings and store them in a safe place (like a fireproof box or a safetydeposit box) along with important papers. DURING A TORNADO WATCH OR WARNING : Review above tips and... Listen - Keep up with local news reports tracking the twister or conditions using a battery-operated radio. Watch & listen - Some danger signs of a tornado include dark green-ish sky, clouds moving to form a funnel, large hail, or loud roar (like a freighttrain). Be ready to evacuate - Keep listening to authorities - if told to leave, DO it. 121 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DURING A TORNADO : Listen - Use a battery-operated radio to hear reports tracking the twister. Take cover - If you hear or see a tornado coming take cover immediately! IF IN A TRAILER OR MOBILE HOME - GET OUT!!! Get to a stronger shelter... or ... Stay low to ground in a ditch and cover head with hands. If you hear or see water in the ditch, move quickly to a drier spot (in case lightning strikes nearby). IF INDOORS - Get to a safe place right away - and avoid windows!! In house or small building - Go to basement, storm cellar or middle of building on lowest floor (bathroom, closet orhallway). Get under something sturdy or put mattress orcovers over you for protection & stay until danger passes! In a school, nursing home, factory or shopping center - Go to designated shelter areas (or interior hallways onlowest floor) -- stay away from open areas. In a high-rise building - Go to a small, interior room or hallway on lowest floor possible and avoid windows. IF OUTDOORS - Try to take shelter in a basement or sturdy building. Or lie in a dry ditch with hands covering your head, but watch and listen forflooding and be aware you're a bigger target for lightning. And if you hearor see water, move since it can carry lightning's electrical charge! IF IN A VEHICLE - GET OUT and take shelter in a building or lie flat in a ditch with hands covering head (but be aware you're a bigger target forlightning when lying flat & listen for flooding!) DO NOT try to out-drivea tornado! You never know which direction one will go & it moves too fast. AFTER A TORNADO : Be aware - Watch for broken glass and downed power lines .. and avoid damaged buildings or homes until OK'd to enter. Injured people - Do not try to move injured people unless they are in dan- ger and call for help immediately. (see TIPS ON BASIC FIRST AID) What to wear - Use sturdy work boots and gloves.

A tsunami [soo-nah\u00b4-mee] is a series of huge, destructive waves caused by an undersea disturbance from an earthquake, volcano, landslide, or even ameteorite. As the waves approach the shallow coastal waters, they appearnormal and the speed decreases. Then, as the tsunami nears the coastline,it turns into a gigantic, forceful wall of water that smashes into the shorewith speeds exceeding 600 miles per hour (965 km/h)! Usually tsunamisare about 20 feet (6 m) high, but extreme ones can get as high as 100 feet(30 m) or more! A tsunami is a series of waves and the first wave may not be the largest one, plus the danger can last for many hours after the first wave hits. During thepast 100 years, more than 200 tsunamis have been recorded in the PacificOcean due to earthquakes and Japan has suffered a majority of them. The Pacific Ocean tsunami warning system was put in place back in 1949. As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean now has a tsunami warning system, andNOAA is expanding the Pacific system to include the Caribbean, the Gulfof Mexico and areas of the Atlantic around the U.S. coast by mid-2007. Did you know... ... a tsunami is not a tidal wave - it has nothing to do with the tide?! ... another name used to describe a tsunami is \"harbor wave\" - \"tsu\" means harbor and \"nami\" means wave inJapanese?! ... sometimes the ocean floor is exposed near the shore since a tsunami can cause the water to recede or move back before slamming in to shore?! ... tsunamis can travel up streams and rivers that lead to the ocean?! BEFORE A TSUNAMI : Prepare - Review WIND and FLOOD MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn words used by both the West Coast / Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WC/ATWC - for AK, BC, CA, OR, and WA) andthe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC - for international authorities,HI and all U.S. territories within Pacific basin) for tsunami threats... 123 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Advisory - an earthquake has occurred in the Pacific basin which might generate a tsunami Watch - a tsunami was or may have been generated, but is at least 2 hours travel time from Watch area Warning - a tsunami was / may have been generated and could cause damage to Warning area - should evacuate Learn risks - If new to area, call local emergency management office about tsunami threat and learn what warning signals are and what to do when youhear them. Coastal areas less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mileof shoreline along coasts are at greatest risk. Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Listen - Make sure you have a battery-operated radio (with spare batteries) for weather forecasts and updates. (Radios like Environment Canada'sWeatheradio and NOAA's Weather Radio have a tone-alert feature thatautomatically alerts you when a Watch or Warning has been issued.) W ater signs - If near water or shore, watch for a noticeable rise or fall in the normal depth of coastal water - that's advance warning of a tsunami soget to high ground. Also - if water pulls away from shoreline and exposessea floor - run to higher ground ASAP!! Feeling shaky ...?- If you feel an earthquake in the Pacific Coast area (from Alaska down to Baja), listen to the radio for tsunami warnings. Is that it...? - Don't be fooled by the size of one wave - more will follow and they could get bigger ... and a small tsunami at one beach can be agiant wave a few miles away! Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A TSUNAMI : Leave - If you are told to evacuate, DO IT! Remember - a tsunami is a series of waves - the first one may be small but who knows what the restwill bring! Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit and GO! IF ON OR NEAR SHORE - Get off the shore and get to higher ground quickly! Stay away from rivers and streams that lead to the ocean sincetsunamis can travel up them too. You cannot outrun a tsunami ... if you see the wave it's too late! 124 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF ON A BOAT - It depends where you are -- either get to land or go further out to sea ... In port - May not have time to get out of port or harbor and out to sea - check with authorities to see what youshould do (smaller boats may want to dock and get to landquickly). In open ocean - DO NOT return to port if a tsunami warn- ing has been issued since wave action is barely noticeablein the open ocean! Stay out in open sea or ocean untilauthorities advise danger has passed. Don' t go there - Do NOT try to go down to the shoreline to watch and don't be fooled by size of one wave - more will follow and they could get biggerso continue listening to radio and TV . AFTER A TSUNAMI : Listen - Whether on land or at sea, local authorities will advise when it is safe to return to the area -- keep listening to radio and TV updates. Watch out - Look for downed power lines, flooded areas and other damage caused by the waves. Don' t go in there - Try to stay out of buildings or homes that are damaged until it is safe to enter and wear sturdy work boots and gloves when work-ing in the rubble. S trange critters - Be aware that the waves may bring in many critters from the ocean (marine life) so watch out for pinchers and stingers! RED or GREEN sign in window - After a disaster, V olunteers and Emergency Service personnel may go door-to-door to check on people. Byplacing a sign in your window that faces the street near the door, you canlet them know if you need them to STOP HERE or MOVE ON . Either use a piece of RED or GREEN construction paper or draw a big RED or GREEN \"X\" (using a crayon or marker) on a piece of paper and tape it in the window. RED means STOP HERE! GREEN means EVERYTHING IS OKAY...MOVE ON! Nothing in the window would also mean STOP HERE!

A volcano is a mountain that opens downward to a reservoir of molten rock (like a huge pool of melted rocks) below the earth's surface. Unlike moun-tains, which are pushed up from the earth's crust, volcanoes are formed bytheir buildup of lava, ash flows, and airborne ash and dust. When pressurefrom gases and molten rock becomes strong enough to cause an explosion,it erupts and starts to spew gases and rocks through the opening. V olcanic eruptions can hurl hot rocks (sometimes called tephra ) for at least 20 miles (32 km) and cause sideways blasts, lava flows, hot ash flows,avalanches, landslides and mudflows (also called lahars ). They can also cause earthquakes, thunderstorms, flash floods, wildfires, and tsunamis.Sometimes volcanic eruptions can drive people from their homes forever. Fresh volcanic ash is not like soft ash in a fireplace. V olcanic ash is made of crushed or powdery rocks, crystals from different types of minerals, andglass fragments that are extremely small like dust. But it is hard, gritty,smelly, sometimes corrosive or acidic (means it can wear away or burnthings) and does not dissolve in water. The ash is hot near the volcano but is cool when it falls over great dis- tances. Ashfall is very irritating to skin and eyes and the combination of ashand burning gas can cause lung irritation or damage to small infants, theelderly or people with breathing problems. Did you know... ... there are about 1 million young volcanoes on the ocean's floor which pump out roughly 3/4 of the lava reaching the earth's surface?! ... volcanic eruptions can impact our global climate since they release ash and gases (like sulfur and carbon dioxide) into the earth's atmosphere and warm the oceans?! ... the primary danger zone around a volcano covers about a 20-mile (32 km) radius?! ... floods, airborne ash or dangerous fumes can spread 100 miles (160 km) or more?! ...a pyroclastic flow is an avalanche of ground-hugging hot rock, ash and gas that races down the slope of a volcano at speeds of 60 mph (97 km/h) with temperatures of near-ly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit (704 degrees Celsius)?! ... Alaska has had over 40 active volcanoes?! 126 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325BEFORE A VOLCANIC ERUPTION : Prepare - Since volcanic eruptions cause many types of disasters, review all MITIGATION tips at beginning of this Section. Also try to cover and protect machinery, electronic devices, downspouts, etc. from ashfall. Learnmore by visiting the USGS Cascades V olcano Observatory Hazards Safetypage at http://vulcan.wr .usgs.gov/Hazards/Safety Learn alert levels - Ask emergency management office which volcano warnings or alert levels are used since they vary depending on where youlive (can be alert levels, status levels, condition levels or color codes). Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . (Note: Put in goggles or safety glasses and dust masks for each family member to protect eyes and lungs from ash.) Okay to go? - Don't go to active volcano sites unless officials say it's okay. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A VOLCANIC ERUPTION : Listen - Do what local authorities say, especially if they tell you to leave! Leave - If you are told to evacuate, DO IT! Don't think you are safe to stay home ... the blast can go for miles and cause wildfires and other hazards! Watch out - Eruptions cause many other disasters: flying rocks - hurled for miles at extremely fast speeds! mudflows, landslides or lahars - they move faster than you can walk or run lava flows - burning liquid rock and nothing can stop it gases and ash - try to stay upwind since winds will carry these -- they are very harmful to your lungs fires - hot rocks and hot lava will cause buildings and forests to burn IF INDOORS - Stay in, but be aware of ash, rocks, mudflows or lava! Close all windows, doors, vents and dampers and turn off A/C and fans to keep ash fall out. Put damp towels under doorways and drafty windows. Bring pets inside (if time, move livestock into shelters). 127 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Listen for creaking on your rooftop (in case ashfall gets heavy -- could cause it to collapse!) IF OUTDOORS - Try to get indoors, if not... Stay upwind so ash and gases are blown away from you. Watch for falling rocks and, if you get caught in rockfall, roll into a ball to protect your head! Get to higher ground - avoid low-lying areas since poi- sonous gases collect there and flash floods could happen. Use dust-mask or damp cloth to help breathing, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, and use goggles. Ashfall can block out sunlight and may cause lightning. IF IN A VEHICLE - Avoid driving unless absolutely required. Slow down -- keep speed at 35 mph (56 km/h) or slower, mainly because of thick dust and low visibility. Shut off engine and park in garage (driving stirs up ash that can clog motor and damage moving engine parts). Look upstream before crossing a bridge in case a mud- flow or landslide is coming. AFTER A VOLCANIC ERUPTION : Listen - Local authorities will say when it's safe to return to area (espe- cially if you had to evacuate) and give other updates when available. Water- Check with authorities before using water, even if eruption was just ash fall (gases and ash can contaminate water reserves). Don't wash ashinto drainpipes, sewers or storm drains since wet ash can wear away metal. What to wear - If you must be around ash fall, you should wear long sleeve shirts, pants, sturdy boots or shoes, gloves, goggles (or safety glasses) andkeep your mouth and nose covered with a dust-mask or damp cloth. Ash - Dampen ash before sweeping or shoveling buildup so it's easier to remove and won't fly back up in the air as much - but be careful since wetash is slippery. Wear protective clothing and dust mask too. Realize ash candisrupt lives of people and critters for months. Protect - Cover machinery and electronic devices like computers.

WINTER STORMS & E XTREME COLD? Winter storms can last for many days and include high winds, freezing rain, sleet or hail, heavy snowfall and extreme cold. These types of winterstorms can shut down a city or area mainly due to blocked roads anddowned power lines. People can be stranded in their car or trapped at homefor hours or days, but there are many other hazards that come with thesestorms. The leading cause of death during winter storms is automobile or other transportation accidents and the second leading cause of death is heartattacks. Hypothermia (or freezing to death) is very common with the elderly who sometimes die inside their homes because it is so cold. Thebest way to protect yourself from a winter disaster is to plan ahead beforethe cold weather begins. Take advantage of spring sales when winter itemsare cheaper so you're ready for next winter! BEFORE A WINTER STORM : Prepare - Review WIND, FLOOD, and WINTER STORM MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn terms / words used with winter conditions... Freezing rain - rain that freezes when it hits the ground, creating a coating of ice on roads and walkways Hail - rain that turns to ice while suspended and tossed in the air from violent updrafts in a thunderstorm Sleet - rain that turns to ice pellets before reaching ground Winter Weather Advisory - cold, ice and snow expected Winter Storm Watch - severe winter weather such as heavy snow or ice is possible within a day or two Winter Storm Warning - severe winter conditions have begun or are about to begin Blizzard Warning - heavy snow and strong winds producing blinding snow (near zero visibility) and life-threatening wind chills for 3 hours or longer Frost/Freeze Warning - below freezing temperatures expected Be prepared - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit , and add the following at home for winter storms: 129 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325calcium chloride - good for melting ice on walkways (rock salt can blister concrete and kill plants) sand or kitty litter - to improve traction emergency heating equipment and fuel - have backup... fireplace - gas or wood burning stove or fireplace generator - gas or diesel models available kerosene heaters - ask Fire Department if they are legal in your community and ask about safety tips in storing fuel! charcoal - NEVER use charcoal indoors since fumes are deadly in contained room -- fine for outdoor use!! extra wood - keep a good supply in a dry area extra blankets - either regular blankets or emergency blankets (about the size of a wallet) DURING A WINTER STORM : Listen - Get updates from radio and TV weather reports. What to wear - Dress for the season... layer - much better to wear several layers of loose-fitting, light-weight, warm clothing than one layer of heavyclothing (outside garment should be waterproof) mittens - mittens are warmer than gloves hat- most body heat is lost through the top of your head scarf - cover your mouth with a scarf or wrap to protect your lungs from cold air Don' t overdo it - Be careful when shoveling snow or working outside since cold can put strain on heart and cause a heart attack (even in children!) Carbon monoxide - Learn how to protect your home from winter heating dangers by visiting CDC's Carbon Monoxide site at www .cdc.gov/co/ Watch for signs - playing or working out in the snow can cause exposure so look for signs of... frostbite - loss of feeling in your fingers, toes, nose or ear lobes or they turn really pale hypothermia - start shivering a lot, slow speech, stum- bling, or feel very tired If signs of either one ... get inside quickly and get medical help (see COLD- RELATED ILLNESSES in Section 3) . Also check out NOAA's Windchill Chart and safety information at www .weather .gov/om/windchill 130 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325WINTER DRIVING TIPS Driving - If you must travel, consider public transportation. Best to travel during the day, don't travel alone, and tell someone where you're going.Stay on main roads and avoid taking back roads. W interize car - Make sure you have plenty of antifreeze and snow tires (or chains or cables). Keep gas tank as full as possible during cold weather. Winter Kit - Carry a \"winter\" car kit in trunk (see Section 1) and throw in... warm things - mittens, hat, emergency blanket, sweater, waterproof jacket or coat cold weather items - windshield scraper, road salt, sand emergency items - bright colored cloth or distress flag, booster cables, emergency flares, tow chain, rope, shovel miscellaneous - food, water, radio, etc. Stranded - If you get trapped in your car by a blizzard or break down... get off the road - if you can, drive car onto shoulder give a sign - turn on hazard lights and tie a bright cloth or distress flag on antenna, door handle or hang out driverside window (keep above snow so it draws attention) stay in car - stay inside until help arrives (CAR KIT can provide food, water and comforts if you planned ahead) start your car - turn on car's engine and heater about 10 minutes each hour (open window slightly for ventilationso you don't get carbon monoxide poisoning) light at night - turn on inside light so crews or rescuers can see you if you walk - if you walk away from car, make sure you can see building or shelter (no more than 100 yards/10 m) exercise - DO NOT overdo it, but light exercises can help keep you warm sleeping - if others in car, take turns sleeping so someone can watch for rescue crews exhaust pipe - check exhaust pipe now and then and clear out any snow buildup AFTER A WINTER STORM : Restock - Stock up on items you used so you're ready for the next one. Recovery tips - Review TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A DISASTER. 131 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM AD ISASTER Unless you've been in a disaster before, it is hard to imagine how you will handle the situation. Coping with the human suffering and confusion of adisaster requires a certain inner strength. Disasters can cause you to lose aloved one, neighbor or friend or cause you to lose your home, property andpersonal items. The emotional effects of loss and disruption can show upright away or may appear weeks or months later. We are going to briefly cover \"emotional\" recovery tips then cover some \"general\" recovery tips on what to do AFTER a disaster. Remember -- people can and dorecover from all types of disasters, even the most extreme ones, and you can return to a normal life. EMOTIONAL RECOVERY TIPS- H ANDLING EMOTIONS Since disasters usually happen quickly and without warning, they can be very scary for both adults and children. They also may cause you to leaveyour home and your daily routine and deal with many different emotions,but realize that a lot of this is normal human behavior. It is very importantthat you understand no matter what the loss is... there is a natural grievingprocess and every person will handle that process differently. SOME NORMAL REACTIONS TO DISASTERS Right after disaster - shock, fear, disbelief, has hard time making decisions, refuses to leave home or area, won't find help or help others Days, weeks or months after disaster - anger or moodiness, depression, loss of weight or change in appetite, nightmares, trouble sleeping, cryingfor \"no reason\", isolation, guilt, anxiety, domestic violence Additional reactions by children - thumb sucking, bed-wetting, clinging to parent(s) or guardian, won't go to bed or school, tantrums (crying orscreaming), problems at school Please note: If any of your disaster reactions seem to last for quite some time, please consider seeking professional counseling for Post-TraumaticStress Disorder (PTSD). There is nothing wrong with asking for help! TIPS FOR ADULTS & K IDS Deal with it - Recognize your own feelings so you can deal with them prop- erly and responsibly. 132 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TALK - Talking to others helps relieve stress and helps you realize you are not alone... other victims are struggling with the same emotions... includ-ing your own family! And don't leave out the little ones ... let them talkabout their feelings and share your feelings with them. Accept help - Realize that the people who are trying to help you want to help you so please don't shut them out or turn them away. Time out - Whenever possible, take some time off and do something you enjoy to help relieve stress... and do something fun with the whole familylike a hike, a picnic, or play a game. Rest - Listen to your body and get as much rest as possible. Stress can run you down so take care of yourself and your family members. Slow down - Don't feel like you have to do everything at once and pace yourself with a realistic schedule. Stay healthy - Make sure everyone cleans up with soap and clean water after working in debris. Also, drink lots of clean water and eat healthymeals to keep up your strength. If you packed vitamins and herbs in yourDisaster Supplies Kit , take them. W ork out - Physical activity is good for releasing stress or pent-up energy. Hug - A hug or a gentle touch (holding a hand or an arm) is very helpful during stressful times. They're watching you - Kids look to adults during a disaster so your reac- tions will impact the kids (meaning if you act alarmed or worried - they'llbe scared, if you cry - they cry, etc.) S tick together - Keep the family together as much as possible and include kids in discussions and decisions whenever possible. Draw a picture - Ask your kids to draw a picture of the disaster to help you understand how he or she views what happened. Explain - Calmly tell your family what you know about the disaster using facts and words they can understand and tell everyone what will happennext so they know what to expect. Reassurance - Let your kids and family know that they are safe and repeat this as often as necessary to help them regain their confidence. Praise - Recognizing good behavior and praise for doing certain things (even the littlest of things) will help boost morale. 133 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Watch your temper - Stress will make tempers rise but don't take out your anger on others, especially kids. Be patient and control your emotions. Let kids help - Including children in small chores during recovery and clean up processes will help them feel like they are part of the team andgive them more confidence. Let others know - Work with your kids' teachers, day-care staff, babysitters and others who may not understand how the disaster has affected them. GENERAL RECOVERY TIPS- AFTER ADISASTER RETURNING TO A DAMAGED HOME: Listen - Keep a battery-operated radio with you for emergency updates. What to wear - Use sturdy work boots and gloves. Check outside first - Before you go inside, walk around outside to check for loose power lines, gas leaks, and structural damage. Call a professional - If you have any doubts about the safety of your home, contact a professional inspector. Don' t go in there - If your home was damaged by fire, do NOT enter until authorities say it is safe (also don't enter home if flood waters remainaround the building). Use a flashlight - There may be gas or other flammable materials in the area so use a battery-operated flashlight (do not use oil, gas lanterns, can-dles or torches and don't smoke!) W atch out - Look for critters, especially snakes (flooding will carry them) and use a stick to poke through debris. Things to check - Some things you want to do first... Check for cracks in the roof, foundation and chimneys. Watch out for loose boards and slippery floors. Check for gas leaks (smells like rotten eggs, hear a hissing or blowing sound or see discolored plants or grass) ... - Start with the hot water heater.- Turn off main valve from outside and call gas company. Check electrical system (watch for sparks, broken wires or the smell of hot insulation) ... - Turn off electricity at main fuse box or circuit breaker. 134 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325- DO NOT touch fuse box, circuit breaker or wires if in water or if you're wet! Check appliances after turning off electricity at main fuse and, if wet, unplug and let them dry out. Call a profession-al to check them before using. Check water and sewage system and, if pipes are damaged, turn off main water valve. Clean up any spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline, etc. Open cabinets carefully since things may fall out. Look for valuable items (jewelry, etc.) and protect them. Try to patch up holes, windows and doors to protect home from further damage. Clean and disinfect everything that got wet (bleach is best) since mud left behind by floodwaters can contain sewageand chemicals. Wear gloves, mask and eye protection whenusing disinfectants. If basement is flooded, pump it out slowly (about 1/3 of the water per day) to avoid damage since walls may collapse ifsurrounding ground still waterlogged. (see page 62) Check with local authorities about water since it could be contaminated. Wells should be pumped out and the watertested before using, too. Throw out food, makeup and medicines that may have been exposed to flood waters and check refrigerated foods to see if they are spoiled. If frozen foods have ice crystals in them then okay to refreeze. Throw out moldy items that are porous (like rotten wood, carpet padding, furniture, etc.) if they're too difficult toclean and remove mold. Remove standing water and scrubmoldy surfaces with non-ammonia soap or detergent, or acommercial cleaner, rinse with clean water and dry com-pletely. Then use a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts cleanwater to wipe down surfaces or items, rinse and dry. If possible, visit California Dept of Health Services web sitefor tips on cleaning mold at www .cal-iaq.or g/MOLD Consider having your house tested for mold. (see AIR QUALITY MITIGATION) Call your insurance agent, take pictures of damage, and keep ALL receipts on cleaning and repairs. Protect stuf f?- Secure valuable items or move them to another location, if possible. Sometimes looting occurs but be smart about protecting yourproperty, it's not worth getting hurt or shot defending it. 135 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325GETTING HELP: DISASTER ASSISTANCE \"The government will save me\" - Officials and groups will try to keep basic functions working while helping as many people as possible, but ittakes time so expect delays. Local First Responders will be overwhelmedand may not be able to help if you need Police, Fire or EMS services. Listen - Local TV and radio will announce where to get emergency hous- ing, food, first aid, clothing and financial assistance after a disaster. Help finding family - The Red Cross maintains a database to help people find family, but don't call office in disaster area since they'll be swamped! Agencies that help - The Red Cross is often stationed right at the scene of a disaster to help people with immediate medical, food, and housing needs.Some other sources of help include Salvation Army, church groups andsynagogues, and various other Social Service agencies. President declares a \"Major Disaster\" (in U.S.) - According to FEMA's Floodsmart.gov web site, less than 10% of all weather emergencies in theU.S. are declared. In severe disasters, the government (FEMA) steps in andprovides people with ... Temporary housing (several components available to meet housing needs of victims) - Mortgage and Rental Assistance Program (if evicted) - Rental Assistance (if dwelling unlivable)- Minimal Repair Program- Mobile Homes or Other readily fabricated dwellings (may be set up when all other options are exhausted) Counseling Low interest loans and grants Businesses and farms are eligible for aid through FEMA FEMA 's Disaster Recovery Centers - FEMA will set up DRCs at local schools and municipal buildings to manually process applications andwhere people can meet face-to-face with agencies to ... Discuss their disaster-related needs. Get information about disaster assistance programs. Teleregister for assistance. Learn about measures for rebuilding that can eliminate or reduce risk of future loss (mitigation tips). Learn how to complete Small Business Administration (SBA) loan application (same form used to qualify all 136 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325individuals for low cost loans or grants, including repair or replacement of damaged homes & furnishings). Request status of their Disaster Housing Application. Or people can apply for assistance with DRC by calling 1-800-621-FEMA. Long-term shelter - If your home is damaged or destroyed or you're forced to leave due to on-going threats (like mudslides or flooding), you may needto find temporary or permanent living quarters. This could mean staying ina public shelter or hotel, living with friends or relatives, or renting a homeor apartment. During a major disaster, FEMA and the Red Cross offer someassistance but you may be on your own in some cases. I lost my job (in U.S.) - People who lose their job due to a disaster may apply for weekly benefits using Disaster Unemployment Assistance(DUA). You can call 1-800-621-FEMA (TTY: 1-800-462-7585) or yourlocal unemployment office for registration information. Legal help (in U.S.) - Local members of the American Bar Association Young Lawyers Division offer free legal counseling to low-income indi-viduals after President declares a major disaster. FEMA can provide moreinformation at DRCs or call 1-800-621-FEMA (TTY: 1-800-462-7585). Canadian disaster - In the event of a large-scale disaster in Canada, provin- cial or territorial government would pay out money to individuals and communities in accordance with its provincial disaster assistance program.(Federal assistance - Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements [DF AA]is paid direct to province or territory.) Recovering financially - The American Red Cross and FEMA developed the following list to help you minimize the financial impact of a disaster: First things first - 1) remove valuables only if residence is safe to enter, 2) try to make temporary repairs to limit further damage, and 3) notify your insurance companyimmediately! Conduct inventory - make sure you get paid for what you lost Reconstruct lost records - use catalogs, want ads, Blue Books, court records, old tax forms from IRS, escrowpapers, etc. to help determine value of lost possessions Notify creditors and employers - let people you do busi- ness with know what has happened File insurance claim - get all policy numbers; find out how they are processing claims; identify your property with asign; file claims promptly, work with adjusters, etc. 137 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Obtain loans and grants - local media will announce options available for emergency financial assistance Avoid contractor rip-offs - get several estimates; don't rush into anything; ask for proof of licenses, permits andinsurance; get contract in writing; never prepay; get signedrelease of lien; check out contractors with local BetterBusiness Bureau, etc. Reduce your tax bite - you may be eligible for tax refunds or deductions but know they can be very complex so youmay want to ask an expert for advice * Note: A detailed brochure called \"Recovering Financially After a Disaster\" prepared by the National Endowment for Financial Education\u00ae,the Red Cross, and FEMA is available on the Red Cross' s web site or maybe at your local Red Cross chapter. (see Section 4) MITIGATION (REDUCING THE IMPACT FOR THE NEXTTIME) The last thing you want to think about after a disaster is \"what if it happensagain\"?! Before you spend a lot of time and money repairing your homeafter a disaster, find ways to avoid or reduce the impact of the next one. FEMA recommends the following mitigation tips AFTER A DISASTER: Ask local building department about agencies that purchase property in areas that have been flooded. You may be ableto sell your property to a government agency and move toanother location. Determine how to rebuild your home to handle the shaking of an earthquake or high winds. Ask local government,hardware dealer, or private home inspector for technicaladvice. Consider options for flood-proofing your home. Determine if your home can be elevated to avoid future flood damage. Make sure all construction complies with local building codes that pertain to seismic, flood, fire and wind hazards.Make sure roof is firmly secured to the main frame of thehouse. Make sure contractors know and follow the codeand construction is inspected by a local building inspector. And please review ALL Mitigation tips at the beginning of this Section. 138 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON SHELTER LIVING DURING OR AFTER AN EMERGENCY Taking shelter during a disaster could mean you have to be somewhere for several hours, days or weeks .. even months! It could be as simple as goingto a basement during a tornado warning or staying home without electrici-ty or water for several days during a major storm. In many emergencies, the Red Cross and other organizations set up public shelters in schools, city or county buildings and churches. While they oftenprovide water, food, medicine, and basic sanitary facilities, you should planto have your own supplies - especially water. Whether your shelter is at home or in a mass care facility use the follow- ing tips while staying there during or after an emergency: Don' t leave - Stay in your shelter until local authorities say it's okay to leave. Realize that your stay in shelter can range from a few hours to weeks... or longer in some cases. T ake it outside - Restrict smoking to well-ventilated areas (outside if it's safe to go out) and make sure smoking materials are disposed of safely! Behave - Living with many people in a confined space can be difficult and unpleasant but you must cooperate with shelter managers and others in theshelter. 24-hour watch - Take turns listening to radio updates and keep a 24-hour communications and safety watch going. Toilet - Bathrooms may not be available so make sure you have a plan for human waste. (see TIPS ON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE) Pets - Public shelters may not allow pets (unless it is a service animal assisting a disabled person) so you may have to make arrangements to keepthem somewhere else. Try the Humane Society or local Animal Shelter - ifthey are still functioning after a disaster. T ips for fallout shelter - Review APPENDIX D for more tips on sheltering. Next we're going to cover some basic things to think about in the event you and your family are without power, running water, and/or functioning toilets during an emergency or disaster. We suggest you read over thesetopics and think about things you might want to get in advance so you canbe prepared for several days or longer. 139 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON USING HOUSEHOLD FOODS COOKING IN A DISASTER SITUATION When disaster strikes, you may not have electricity or gas for cooking. For emergency cooking you can use a charcoal grill, hibachi or propane camp-ing unit or stove - but only do this OUTDOORS ! Never use charcoal in an enclosed environment -- it causes deadly fumes! You can also heat food with candle warmers or a can of sterno. Canned food can be heated in the can, but remember to remove the paper label and open the can first. And be careful -- don't burn your hand since itmay be hot! Try to limit using salty foods since they can make you thirsty. Also, keep in mind dried foods (like pasta, beans, etc.) require extra water and cook-ing time so may not be good choices during a disaster situation. IF THE ELECTRICITY GOES OFF , USEFOOD WISELY ... First - Use perishable food and foods from the refrigerator ... and limit opening the frig (don't stand and stare in it like most of us do!) The frigwill keep foods cool for about 4 hours without power if left unopened. Dryice or a block of ice can be placed in refrigerator if power is out more than4 hours. Second - Use foods from the freezer and, if possible, have a list of items in the freezer taped outside or at least know how things are organized insideto find stuff quickly. (Keeping door shut keeps cold in!) Foods in a well-filled, well-insulated freezer won't go bad until several days after powergoes off. Usually there will be ice crystals in the center of food (whichmeans it's still okay to eat or refreeze) for 2-3 days after a power failure. Ifpossible, use block or dry ice to help keep freezer food cold. Third - Use non-perishable foods and staples in your pantry and cabinets. TIPFORYOUR FREEZER : Before a disaster strikes, line your indoor and/or outdoor freezer wall with jugs of bottled water. The frozen bottles can help keep food cold longer ifyou lose power, plus you'll have extra water once it melts. This also helpskeep freezer as full as possible which makes it more energy efficient. 140 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON WATER PURIFICATION Water is critical for survival. We can go days, even weeks, without food but we must have water to live. For example, an average man (154 pounds) can lose about 3 quarts/litres of water per day and an average woman (140pounds) can lose over 2 quarts - and this could increase depending on yourweight and size, on the season, and the altitude. Your body loses preciouswater by sweating and breathing and, of course, by peeing. In fact, you cantell if you are getting dehydrated by the color of your pee. When you drinkenough water, your pee will be light-colored or bright yellow, but whendehydrated, it will be dark-colored and you'll pee in smaller amounts. The average person should drink between 2 and 2 \u00bd quarts/litres of water per day. Plan on storing about one gallon (4 litres) per day per person fordrinking, cooking and personal hygiene - and don't forget water for pets! Did you know... ... almost 6,000 children die every day from water-related disease?... about 1.1 billion people don't have access to safe water? USE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS TO PURIFY DRINKING WATER : Boiling - Boil vigorously for 2-10 minutes. Boiling water kills most harm- ful bacteria and parasites. To improve the taste of boiled water pour it backand forth between two containers to add oxygen back into it. Bleach - Add 10-20 drops of \"regular\" household bleach per gallon (about 4 litres) of water, mix well, and let stand for 30 minutes. A slight smell ortaste of chlorine indicates water is good to drink. (NOTE: Do NOT use scented bleaches, colorsafe bleaches, or bleaches with added cleaners!) Tablets - Use commercial purification tablets and follow instructions. Tablets are pretty inexpensive and found at most sporting goods stores andsome drugstores. (Note: Look for products that contain 5.25 to 6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite as the only active ingredient.) Distillation - Involves boiling water and collecting the vapor to remove impurities. (Check with library or visit www .redcross.or g[search distill ].) Also, learn how to remove water from other places in your home or office (like the hot water heater, ice cubes, toilet tanks [not the bowl], etc.) Andconsider purchasing a certified portable water purification device (pitcherfilter, faucet filter, etc.) and pack an extra unit in your Disaster Supplies Kit. To learn more about water safety visit www .epa.gov/safewater . Also see tips on filtering water contaminated by fallout on page 239. 141 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE In disaster situations, plumbing may not be usable due to broken sewer or water lines, flooding, or freezing of the system. To avoid the spread of disease, it is critical that human waste be handled in a sanitary manner! Did you know... ... one gram (0.035 oz) of human feces can contain 10 million viruses, 1 million bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts, and 100 parasite eggs!? 9 IFTOILET OKAY BUT LINES ARE NOT... If water or sewer lines are damaged but toilet is still intact, you should linethe toilet bowl with a plastic bag to collect waste... but DO NOT flush thetoilet!! After use, add a small amount of disinfectant to bag, remove and seal bag (with a twist tie if reusing), and place bag in a tightly coveredcontainer away from people to reduce smell. IFTOILET IS UNUSABLE ... If toilet is destroyed, a plastic bag in a bucket may be substituted. (Somecompanies make plastic buckets with snap-on lids.) After use, add a smallamount of disinfectant to the bag, and seal or cover bucket. DISINFECT ANTS - easy and effective for home use in Sanitation of Human Waste. Choose one to store with your Disaster Supplies Kit: Chlorine Bleach - If water is available, a solution of 1 part liquid house- hold bleach to 10 parts water is best. DO NOT use dry bleach (can burnyou, corrode or dissolve things) - is not safe for this kind of use. Calcium hypochlorite - (e.g. HTH, etc.) Available in swimming pool supply or hardware stores and several large discount stores. It can be usedin solution by mixing, then storing. Follow directions on the package. Portable toilet chemicals - These come in both liquid and dry formulas and are available at recreational vehicle (RV) supply stores. Use accordingto package directions. These chemicals are designed especially for toiletsthat are not connected to sewer lines. Powdered, chlorinated lime - Available at some building supply stores. It can be used dry and be sure to get chlorinated lime - notquick lime! There are also several types of camping toilets and portable toilets that range from fairly low dollars to hundreds of dollars. Or get a small shovelso you can at least dig a hole or latrine outside like campers do. 142 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON HELPING OTHERS INTHEIR TIME OF NEED A disaster really brings out the generosity of many people who want to help the victims. Unfortunately, sometimes this kindness overwhelms agenciesthat are trying to coordinate relief efforts so please review the followinggeneral guidelines defined by FEMA on helping others after a disaster. In addition to the people you care for on a daily basis, con- sider the needs of your neighbors and people with specialneeds. If you want to volunteer your services after a disaster, listen to local news reports for information about wherevolunteers are needed. Until volunteers are specificallyrequested, please stay away from disaster areas. If you are needed in a disaster area, bring your own food, water and emergency supplies. This is especially importantin cases where a large area has been hit since these itemsmay be in short supply. Do not drop off food, clothing or items to a government agency or disaster relief organization unless a particular item has been requested. They usually don't have theresources to sort through donations and it is very costly toship these bulk items. If you wish, give check or money order to a recognized disaster relief organization like the Salvation Army or RedCross. They can process funds, purchase what is neededand get it to the people who need it most. Your entire donation goes towards the disaster relief since these organizations raise money for overhead expenses throughseparate fund drives. If your company wants to donate emergency supplies, donate a quantity of a given item or class of items (such asnonperishable food) rather than a mix of different items.Also, find out where donation is going, how it's going toget there, who's going to unload it and how it will be dis-tributed. Without good planning, much needed supplies willbe left unused. 143 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DEALING WITH DEATH OR MASSCASUALTIES Quite often natural or man-made disasters bring not only destruction but death to a community. Sometimes First Responders cannot reach a disastersite for hours, days or weeks so citizens should be prepared to deal withdeath or the handling of dead bodies. IFI NA DISASTER SITUATION WITH CASUALTIES AND NOHELP... Dead bodies do not cause epidemics after a natural disaster. In fact, it's survivors who will most likely spread disease. Don't put yourself in danger to recover a body if there is any chemical, biological or radiological contamination inthe area or structural damage due to an earthquake, etc. People handling bodies should wear gloves and boots and avoid wiping their face or mouth with their hands. Washhands with soap and clean water often, and disinfect tools,clothing, equipment and vehicles used to move bodies. Bodies often leak feces after death so avoid contact with it (and body fluids) to limit exposure to any possible diseases. If no First Responders are on scene (and it may be a while before any are), write down any known details about whereand when a body was found, name (if known), etc. In addition to dealing with the sadness and loss, there are several things families may need to think about and plan for if they lose a loved one. IFALOVED ONE DIES... Realize some bodies may never be recovered or could be contaminated in certain types of disasters. Determine who is Executor of the will (if any) and make 10-12 certified copies of death certificate (for probate,insurance benefits, bank accounts, social security, etc.) Contact banks/trusts (to change names on accounts), employer (to check on any available benefits), SocialSecurity, etc. Also check on insurance policies (e.g. life,mortgage, auto, work, etc.), any 401Ks, V .A. benefits, etc. Take care of pets, mail, utilities, credit cards, etc. 144 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 3 Information & Tips on Basic First Aid 145 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325REDCROSS FIRST AIDSERVICES AND PROGRAMS Both the American and Canadian Red Cross prepare people to save lives through health and safety education and training.

You should know who to call and what care to provide. Providing care involves giving first aiduntil professional medical help arrives. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is a network of police, fire and medical personnel, as well as other community resources. People can helpEMS by reporting emergencies and helping out victims until EMS canarrive. During a major disaster, EMS groups will become swamped so if the pub- lic is prepared to handle some types of emergencies then we can help someof the victims until EMS arrives. Your role in the EMS system includes the following things: BE AWARE... Realize this is an emergency situation -- you could be putting yourself in danger! BE PREPARED... Know how to handle the situation. HA VE A PLAN! Check ABCs... , call 9-1-1 (or call for an ambulance) and help victim, if possible. TIPSONTHEABC S... AIRWAY , BREATHING & C IRCULATION In an emergency, you need to check the victim for ABCs... Airway . Open the airway by tilting the head back, gently lifting the jaw up, and leaving mouth open. Breathing .Place your ear over victim's mouth and nose. Look at chest, listen, and feel for breathing for 3 to 5 seconds. Circulation . Check for a pulse using fingertips (not your thumb) in the soft spot between throat and the muscle on the sideof the neck for 5-10 seconds. 148 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPSONMAKING YOUR \"EMERGENCY ACTION \" PLAN 1. BE AWARE ...Make sure it's safe to approach area and victim. Use your senses... Listen for cries for help; screams; moans; explosions; humming orbuzzing noises; lots of coughing, etc. Look for broken glass; open medicine cabinet, container or bottle near victim; smoke; fire; vapors or mist; downed power lines, etc. Watch for signs like trouble breathing; trouble talking; grabbing at throat or chest; pale or blue color in face, lips or ears; lots of peoplecovering mouth or running away, etc. Smell smoke or something burning; strong odors or vapors (leave if odor is too strong), etc. Feel something burning your eyes, lungs or skin, etc. 2. BE PREP ARED ...The best thing you can do is STAY CALM... and THINK before you act! Any time there's an emergency or disaster, most people are scared or confused and many don't know what to do. Take a few secondsand breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth tohelp slow your heartbeat and calm down. Always ask if you can help... either ask the victim or people around who may be helping. 3. HAVE APLAN !Check ABCs , call 9-1-1 and help victim, if possible. ... Check victims' ABCs... Airway, Breathing, & Circulation ... call 9-1-1, 0 for Operator or local emergency number for an ambulance (see tips on next page) ... help the victim, if possible -- and STAY until help arrives.Before giving first aid, you must have the victim's permission. Tell them who you are, how much training you've had, and how youplan to help. Do not give care to someone who refuses it - unless they are unable to respond. 149 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPSONCALLING FORANAMBULANCE Whenever there is an emergency, use the following tips to help decide if you should call 9-1-1 (or local emergency number) for an ambulance. Call if victim... ... is trapped... is not responding or is passed out... is bleeding badly or bleeding cannot be stopped... has a cut or wound so bad and deep that you can see bone or muscles ... has a body part missing or is torn away... has pain below the rib cage that does not go away... is peeing, pooping or puking blood (called passing blood)... is breathing weird or having trouble breathing... seems to have hurt their head, neck or back... is jerking uncontrollably (called having a seizure)... has broken bones and cannot be moved carefully... acts like they had a heart attack (chest pain or pressure) When you talk to 9-1-1 or the emergency number... ... try to stay CALM! ... try to describe what happened and what is wrong with the victim ... give the location of the emergency and phone number you are calling from ... follow their instructions in case they tell you what to do for the victim ... don't hang up until the 9-1-1 operator tells you to. 150 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPSONREDUCING THE SPREAD OF GERMS ORDISEASES Whenever you perform first aid on anyone, there is always a chance of spreading germs or diseases between yourself and the victim. These stepsshould be followed no matter what kind of first aid is being done -- fromvery minor scrapes to major emergencies -- to reduce the risk of infection. BE AWARE... ... Try to avoid body fluids like blood or urine (pee). ... Cover any open cuts or wounds you have on your body since they are doorways for germs! BE PREPARED... ... Wash your hands with soap and water before and after giving first aid. ... Have a first aid kit handy, if possible.... Put something between yourself and victim's body fluids, if possible ... blood or urine - wear disposable gloves or use a clean dry cloth saliva or spittle - use a disposable Face Shield during Rescue Breathing ... Clean up area with household bleach to kill germs. ... and... HA VE A PLAN! ... see TIPS ON MAKING YOUR \"EMERGENCY ACTION\" PLAN two pages back . TIPSONGOOD SAMARITAN LAWS The definition of a \"Samaritan\" is a charitable or helpful person. Most states have Good Samaritan laws that were designed to protect citizenswho try to help injured victims with emergency care. If a citizen uses \"logical\" or \"rational\" actions while making wise or careful decisions during an emergency situation then they can be protected from being sued. To learn more about your state's Good Samaritan laws, check with your local library or contact an attorney. 151 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BITES & S TINGS ? ANIMAL & H UMAN BITES Americans and Canadians report approximately 5 million bites each year (mostly from dogs). Both humans and animals carry bacteria and viruses intheir mouths, however, human bites are more dangerous and infection-prone because people seem to have more reactions to the human bacteria. Things to watch for... Puncture or bite marks Bleeding Infection - Pain or tenderness, redness, heat, or swelling, pus, red streaks Allergic Reaction - Feeling ill, dizzy or trouble breathing What to do... Wash the bite as soon as possible to remove saliva and dirt from the bite wound - use running water and soap orrinse area with hydrogen peroxide. Control bleeding using direct pressure with cloth or gauze. Pat dry and cover with sterile bandage, gauze, or clean cloth - don't put a cream or gel on wound -- may preventdrainage. May want to raise bitten area to reduce swelling or use a cold pack or cloth with an ice cube in it. Call local emergency number or call Animal Control* (usually listed in blue Government pages in phone bookunder County / Municipality). Watch for any allergic reactions for few days (see list above). ...also... Get to a doctor or hospital if bleeding is really bad, if you think animal could have rabies, or if stitches are required! * Note: For Human bites, there is no need to call Animal Control, however, most states/provinces do require all animal and human bites be reported to local police or health authorities. 152 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325INSECT BITES & S TINGS Covering first aid for bites & stings in general, then \"West Nile Virus\". Things to watch for... Stinger (Note: honeybees leave a stinger and venom sac) Puncture or bite markBurning pain or SwellingAllergic Reaction - Pain, itching, hives, redness or discoloration at site, trouble breathing, signs of shock(pale, cold, drowsy, etc.) What to do... Run away from area if there's a swarm or nest nearby. Remove stinger by scraping it away with credit card, long fingernail or using tweezers. Don't try to squeeze it out since this causes more venom to get in the victim. Wash wound with soap and water or rinse with hydrogen peroxide. Cover with a bandage or clean cloth and apply ice pack. Watch for allergic reactions for a few days (see above). Call Fire Department or bee removal expert if needed. (See WEST NILE VIRUS on next page. TICKS are covered on page 157.) To relieve pain from an insect bite or sting: Activated charcoal - Empty 2-3 capsules into a container and add a small amount of warm water to make a paste. Dab paste on the sting site andcover with gauze or plastic to keep it moist. This will help draw out thevenom so it collects on your skin. Note, powder makes a black mess butit's easily wiped off with a towel. (see FIRST AID KITS in Section 1) Baking Soda - Make a paste of 3 parts baking soda + 1 part warm water and apply to the sting site for 15-20 minutes. Clay mudpack - If in the wilderness, put a mudpack over injury and cover with bandage or cloth. The mudpack must be a mix of clay-containing soilsince clay is the key element but don't use if any skin is cracked or broken. Meat tenderizer - Mixing meat tenderizer (check ingredient list for \"papain\") with warm water and applying to the sting will help break downinsect venom. (Papain is a natural enzyme derived from papaya.) Urine (Pee) - Another remedy useful in the wilderness sounds totally gross (but has a history of medical applications in a number of cultures) is urine 153 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325(pee) which reduces the stinging pain. (Unless you have a urinary tract infection, the pee will be sterile and at the least won't do any harm!) Some potential pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory remedies include: fresh aloe - break open a leaf or use 96-100% pure aloe gel lemon juice - from a fresh lemon vitamin C - make paste with 3 crushed tablets + drops of warm water vitamin E - oil from a bottle or break open a few gel capsules store brands - if over-the-counter methods preferred, use calamine cream or lotion and aspirin or acetaminophen WEST NILE VIRUS West Nile virus (WNV) is primarily spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. But realize, out of 700+ species of mosquitoes in the U.S.(and 74 species in Canada), very few - less than 1% - become infected withWNV . And out of all the people bitten by an infected mosquito, less than1% will become severely ill so chances are pretty slim you'd ever get it. Both the CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada test and monitor West Nile virus cases among humans, birds, mosquitoes and domestic animals and post their findings and reports online constantly. Since WNVwas initially detected in North America, reported cases have droppeddramatically mainly due to mosquito control programs and communityeducation efforts, however there are still thousands of human cases everyyear. The virus usually causes fever, aches and general discomfort. Severe cases can cause inflammation of the lining of the brain or spinal cord (meningi-tis), inflammation of the brain itself (encephalitis) or a polio-like syndromethat can result in loss of function of one or more limbs (WN poliomyelitisor acute flaccid paralysis). These conditions can be life-altering or fatal.People of all ages could develop serious health effects, but seniors andfolks with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk. Things to watch for... (Most symptoms appear 2 to 15 days after being bitten) Mild flu-like symptoms - fever, headache & body aches Mild skin rash and swollen lymph glandsSevere symptoms - severe headache, high fever, neck stiffness, confusion, shakes, coma, convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis, meningitis or encephalitis 154 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What to do... There is no \"cure\" other than a body fighting off the virus naturally - mainly just watch symptoms. Consider boosting immune system to help fight virus (like taking astragalus, Vitamin C, garlic, mushrooms,zinc, good multiple vitamin + mineral supplement, etc. -but check with doctor if taking prescription medications). If mild symptoms appear, keep watching person for a few weeks in case symptoms get worse. If severe symptoms appear, get medical attention quickly since it could become deadly. Things to do to avoid mosquito bites ... Stay indoors at dawn, dusk, and early evenings when mosquitoes are most active. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Spray clothing and exposed skin with repellent containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) -- the higher % of DEET, the longer you're protected from bites (6.65%lasts almost 2 hours; 20% lasts about 4 hours, etc.) Twoother repellents are picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus . Don't put repellent on small children's hands since it may irritate their mouths or eyes. Get rid of \"standing water\" sources around yard and home since they are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The CDC says Vitamin B and \"ultrasonic\" devices are NOT effective in preventing mosquito bites! There is a growing concern about mosquitoes and other vectors spreading diseases or being used as \"bioterrorism\", but we're only listing West NileVirus for now due to space. Always listen to health officials for informa-tion on mosquito-borne and other types of infections. For more information about West Nile virus and other diseases visit the CDC NCID' s Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases web site atwww .cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid ..or.. Public Health Agency of Canada' s Infectious Diseases site at www .phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/ SEACRITTER (M ARINE LIFE) STINGS There are just too many types of sea critters in our oceans and seas so wecan't cover all the various kinds of stings and bites that could happen, buta few common stings are shown here. To learn about specific types of seacritters (marine life), check with your local library or on the Internet. 155 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to watch for... Puncture marks or tentacles on the skin Pain or burningSwelling or red marksPossible Allergic Reaction - Pain, itching, hives, redness or discoloration at site, trouble breathing, signs ofshock (pale, cold, drowsy, etc.) What to do... Rinse skin - use seawater, vinegar, ammonia, or alcohol (in whatever form is handy - rubbing alcohol or booze!)Fresh water might make it hurt worse! DO NOT rub skin - it could make it worse! Try to remove any tentacles attached to skin, if possible... but DO NOT use bare hands... use a towel or tweezers! Soak sting or make a paste (below) to help relieve pain: tropical jellyfish - soak area in vinegar stingray or stonefish - soak area in hot water Cover sting with sterile bandage or gauze, or clean cloth. Call local emergency number, if necessary. To relieve pain from a sea critter sting: Baking Soda Paste - Make a paste of 3 parts baking soda + 1 part warm water and apply to sting site until it dries. Scrape off paste with a knife orcredit card to help remove some of the skin. (Note: two other easy pastesare sand and seawater or flour and seawater . Scrape off as above.) Urine (Pee) - Again, we know this sounds weird... but pee has a history of medical applications and can reduce stinging pain. (Unless you have aurinary tract infection, it will be sterile and at least won't do any harm!) SNAKE BITES According to the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, about 8,000people in the U.S. are treated for poisonous snake bites each year usuallyresulting in 9 to 15 deaths. Snake bites can cause infection or allergic reaction in some people -- even bites from non-venomous snakes. Poisonous snakes have triangular heads, slit-like pupils, and two long fangs which make puncture wounds at end of each row of teeth. Non-poisonoussnake bites leave two rows of teeth marks but no puncture wounds, butdon't use bite mark to determine type of snake since swelling could hidewounds. 156 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to watch for... Puncture and/or bite marks Pain and SwellingNausea and pukingDifficulty breathing or swallowingPossible Allergic reaction - Weakness or dizziness; redness or discoloration at bite; trouble breathing; signs of shock (pale, cold, drowsy, etc.) What to do... If possible, try to identify type or color of snake but don't put yourself in danger! Wash bite wound with soap and water. Keep bitten body part (hand, etc.) below heart level, if possible. Call emergency number or animal control, if necessary. If bite is from a Poisonous snake, also do this... Remove constrictive items (like rings or watches) since swelling may occur. DO NOT apply tourniquet or ice. Monitor breathing and make sure airway is open. Keep victim as still as possible to slow down circulation of venom. DO NOT let victim eat or drink anything or take medica- tion since it could interfere with emergency treatment. If possible and safe, remove venom - esp. if help is hours away! (Most snakebite kits have proper venom extractorsin them.) DO NOT use \"cut and suck\" method! Get to a doctor or hospital to receive antivenin. The worst effects may not be felt for hours after a bite from most poison- ous North American snakes, but it is best if antivenin is given as quickly aspossible (or at least within 12-24 hours of the bite). SPIDER BITES, SCORPION STINGS , &TICKS There are only a dozen or so spiders that can actually cause symptoms orside effects to humans with a bite -- the most serious are black widowsand brown recluses. Tarantulas are also a little serious but do not causeextreme reactions and rarely will kill a human. 157 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Scorpions will sting anything that touches them. Their sting feels like a small electrical shock (almost like a hot needle). Scorpions whip their tailsover their body and zap their enemy many times, but it happens so quick itmay only feel like one sting. You may think ticks are insects but they're actually bloodsucking arach- nids. Adult ticks have eight legs and two body segments just like spiders,mites and chiggers. Ticks grab onto a host (animals or people walkingthrough brush) and sink their harpoon-like barbed mouth and head into thehost's skin to dine until they're full of blood. Then they drop off and waitfor the next meal to pass by. Since ticks feast on one spot for days, they canspread bacteria and diseases from host to host (like from animals tohumans) - even by touching them. The main threat of both spiders and scorpions is the allergic reaction humans have to their bite or sting so symptoms need to be watched care-fully. Obviously the main threat of ticks is the risk of illness or disease (likelyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever or tick paralysis). Things to watch for... Bite or sting mark or ticks Pain or burning feelingRedness or Swelling or RashStomach pain or pukingFlu-like symptoms - fever, dizziness, weakness, headache, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, etc. Change in skin color or bruising or rash (may look kind of like a bulls-eye) Possible Allergic reactions - trouble breathing or swallowing, signs of shock (pale, cold, etc.) What to do for SPIDERS and SCORPIONS... Try to identify the type of spider or scorpion, but don't put yourself in danger! Wash bite wound with soap and water or rubbing alcohol. Apply a cold pack (a baggie or cloth with ice will work). Get to a doctor or hospital to receive antivenin (if a poi- sonous spider / scorpion) or call emergency number, ifnecessary. Watch for allergic reactions or infections for several days. What to do for TICKS... Key things are to find a tick before it feasts for days and to remove a tick slowly with head intact so it doesn't spew bacteria into the blood stream. 158 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DO NOT use petroleum jelly, nail polish or heat - they don't work! Use tweezers or commercial tick remover (or at least cover fingers with a tissue). Grasp tick close to skin where head is buried - don't squeeze it! Slowly pull tick straight up until skin puckers (may take several seconds but tick will loosen it's barbs and let go). DO NOT throw tick away - may need it tested! Put it in zippered baggie with moist paper towel, date it, and put inrefrigerator. Wash bite wound and tweezers with soap and water. Call local health department or vet to ask if tick needs to be identified or tested. If not, throw away baggie. Watch for rash, infection or symptoms for a week or so. Things to do to avoid ticks ... Wear light-colored pants & long-sleeve shirt (to see ticks), a hat (to keep out of hair) and tuck in (pants insocks + shirt in pants). Do full body checks couple times a day during tick sea- son. Use tick repellent with DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-tolu- amide). For more information about ticks, lyme disease and other illnesses visit the CDC NCID' s Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases site atwww .cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid .. or .. the Public Health Agency of Canada' s Infectious Diseases site at www .phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/ To relieve pain from spider or tick bite or scorpion sting: Ammonia -- Place a small amount of ammonia on a cotton ball and apply directly on the bite or sting for a few seconds to reduce stinging pain. Tea Tree Oil -- Apply a few drops of 100% Melaleuca alternifolia (Tea Tree oil) directly on bite or sting but avoid getting it in or near your eyes. 159 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BLEEDING ? CONTROLLING BLEEDING Things to watch for... Source of bleeding Pain and/or SwellingObject sticking out or stuck in wound (like a piece of metal or glass or a bullet) Shock (pale, cold or clammy, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Be aware of your surroundings and be prepared to call for help. ( see TIPS ON CALLING FOR AN AMBULANCE ) If there IS object sticking out of wound (or possibly deep inside): Put thick soft pads around the object (or around wound). Gently try to apply pressure to help stop the bleeding. DO NOT try to remove or press on the object! Carefully wrap with a roller bandage to hold thick pads around the object. Get medical attention immediately! If there is NO object sticking out of the wound: Be careful since there might be something inside wound. Cover wound with a clean cloth or sterile gauze pad and press firmly against the wound... and follow above stepsif victim has an object inside the wound. If cloth or gauze becomes soaked with blood, DO NOT remove it! Keep adding new dressings on top of old ones. Carefully elevate injured body part above the level of vic- tim's heart but be aware...there may be broken bones. Keep applying pressure on dressings until bleeding stops. Use firm roller bandage to cover gauze or cloth dressings. If bleeding won't stop: Put pressure on nearby artery to help slow blood flow Arm - press inside upper arm, between shoulder & elbow Leg - press area where leg joins front of the hip (groin) 160 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325INTERNAL BLEEDING Minor internal bleeding is like a bruise - a vein, artery or capillary can break or rupture spewing blood under the skin. A more serious form ofinternal bleeding can be caused by a major fall, crushing accident or a blowto the head. It's very hard to tell if a person is suffering from internal bleed-ing since there may not be blood outside the body. Symptoms don't alwaysappear right away but can be life-threatening so get medical help quickly. Things to watch for... Abdominal pain or tenderness Pain and/or Swelling in abdomen (around belly button) Shock (pale, cold or clammy, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) Either a fast or slow pulseCoughing up bright, foamy blood (if dark red means been bleeding inside for a while) Blood shows up in victim's pee, poop or puke What to do... Be aware of surroundings and call for an ambulance. Don't move victim if injuries to head, neck or spine. Check ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Stay with victim until help arrives. (Please review HEAD, NECK & SPINE INJURIES and SHOCK too) NOSEBLEEDS What to do... Have the person sit down, lean forward and pinch the soft part of the nose for about 10 minutes. Put an icepack or cold compress on the bridge of the nose. SLASHED OR SEVERED BODY PARTS/AMPUT ATION What to do... Keep direct pressure on the stump to stop the bleeding. Find body part, if possible, and wrap in gauze or clean cloth. Put body part in an airtight plastic bag, put bag in ice water and take it to the hospital with the victim. 161 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BREATHING PROBLEMS ? ASTHMA ATTACK Things to watch for... Noisy breathing or wheezing Difficulty in breathing or speakingBlueness of skin, lips and fingertips or nails What to do... Make sure victim has nothing in mouth (open airway). Have victim sit up straight to make breathing easier. If victim has medication, or an inhaler, have them take it. Try to keep victim and yourself calm! If attack is severe, call for ambulance or emergency help. Some tips that could possibly help slow down an asthma attack: (Note: These tips are NOT to be used as a replacement for medical atten- tion but could be helpful in the early stages of an asthma attack.) Pursed lip breathing - At the first sign of an attack, breathe in deeply through nose and out through mouth with lips pursed (like blowing up aballoon). It will help relax the body and may get rid of stale air in lungs. Drink a warm liquid or caffeine - Drinking one or two cups of coffee or tea that have caffeine could help relax the bronchial tubes. If you decide todrink a soda, do not use ice since cold could possibly trigger an attack - thewarmer the better. For more information about Asthma visit the CDC NCEH' s Air Pollution and Respiratory web site at www .cdc.gov/asthma/ RESCUE BREA THING (NOTBREA THING ) Rescue breathing (or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) should only be donewhen the victim is not breathing on his or her own. Make sure the victimis not choking on anything like vomit, blood or food (if so, see CHOKING) and check them using the ABCs... Airway , Breathing , and Circulation ! 162 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to watch for... Grabbing at throat Can't feel, see or hear any breathsTrouble breathing or talkingBluish color of skin, lips, fingertips/nails, and earlobes What to do... BE AWARE... make sure there's no head or neck injury first! Carefully move victim so they are flat on their back. Tilt adult's head all the way back and lift chin. (Be care- ful with child's or infant's head... just tilt it a little bit!) Watch chest, listen, and feel for breathing for 5 seconds. If victim is NOT breathing begin Rescue Breathing ... Pinch victim's nose shut. Open your mouth wide to make a tight seal around the victim's mouth. (Note: For infant , cover both mouth and nose with your mouth.) Give victim 2 slow breaths to make their chest rise. Check for pulse using your fingers in soft spot between throat and the muscle on side of neck for 5-10 seconds. Continue Rescue Breathing if victim has a pulse but is not breathing... Adult - give 1 breath every 5 seconds. Child or Infant - give 1 breath every 3 seconds. Check pulse and breathing every minute until victim is breathing on their own. ...also...If victim pukes... turn them gently on their side, wipe mouth clean, turn them back and continue RescueBreathing until they are breathing on their own. NOTE: If victim NOT breathing and DOES NOT have pulse, see HEART EMERGENCIES for tips on Giving CPR (see page 181)! 163 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BROKEN OR FRACTURED BONES ? A fracture is the same as a break and can range from a small chip to a bone that breaks through the skin. If you suspect a fracture, use a splint to keepthe victim from moving too much and get professional help... and let thetrained medical experts decide what is wrong! Note: Also review HEAD, NECK OR SPINE INJURIES if needed. Things to watch for... Pain, bruising or swelling BleedingLimb or area moves strange or looks strangeShock (pale, cold or clammy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... DO NOT move bone or try to straighten limb if bone breaks through skin! Try not to move the victim unless they are in danger. Have victim sit or lie down to rest the injured part. If possible, raise or elevate the injured part. Put a cold compress or ice pack on injury to reduce swelling. If help is delayed or you need to move victim, splint injury the same way it was found. Be prepared to call an ambulance, if necessary. TIPS ON SPLINTING A splint can be made using magazines, newspapers, a pillow, wood, etc. Some basic tips on splinting include... ... always splint an injury the same way it was found ... make sure item being used is longer than the broken bone... use cloth strips, neck ties, thin rope, etc. for ties... put something soft between the splint and the bone... tie splint above and below the break... but not too tight! ... touch area below the splint and ask victim if they can feel it -- if not, loosen ties! ... keep the victim warm with a blanket or whatever is available. 164 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about...

Depending on how bad a burn is will determine what it is called: First degree burns - hurts only top layer of skin; turns pink or red; some pain and swelling; no blisters (usually from sun, chemicals, or touchingsomething hot) Second degree burns - hurts the two upper layers of skin; very painful and causes swelling that lasts several days; blisters and possibly scars (usuallyfrom deep sunburn, chemicals, fire or hot liquid spills) Third degree burns - hurts all skin layers and possibly tissue; charred, raw or oozing areas; destroys cells that form new skin; nerve cells are destroyedand can take months to heal (usually from being exposed to fire or electri-cal shock for a long time). Can cause severe loss of fluids, shock and death. BURNS FROM FIRE OR HOTLIQUIDS Things to watch for... Skin is red and swollen Blisters may open and ooze clear or yellowish fluidMinor to Severe Pain What to do... BE AWARE... and don't put yourself in danger! Stop the burning by putting out flames and move victim from source of the burn. (If victim is on fire, tell them toSTOP, DROP and ROLL!) Cool burn by using large amounts of running cool water for about 10 minutes. For hard to reach areas, wet a cloth,towel or sheet and carefully keep adding water. Try to remove clothing, rings or jewelry in case of swelling. (DO NOT remove items stuck to burned areas!) Cover burn with a sterile bandage or clean cloth. (Try to keep fingers and toes separated with bandage or cloth.) Seek medical attention, if necessary. Things you should NOT do... DO NOT break any blisters! Continued on next page ... 165 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DO NOT remove any item that sticks to skin! DO NOT apply any creams, oils or lotions to the burns - wait for the medical experts! CHEMICAL BURNS Also see TERRORISM (in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms,and treatment for several chemical agents in liquid, solid or aerosol formsthat may cause chemical burns. Things to watch for... Rash or blisters Trouble breathingDizziness or headacheName of the chemical What to do... Rinse area with cool running water at least 15 minutes. Remove any clothing, rings or jewelry that may have the chemical on it. Make note of chemical name for medical staff or hospital. ELECTRICAL BURNS Things to watch for... Electrical appliances or wires Downed power linesSparks and/or crackling noisesVictim may have muscle spasms or tremblingLightning during a storm What to do... BE AWARE... don't put yourself in danger! If power line is down, wait for Fire Department or Power Company. DO NOT go near victim until power is OFF! Pull plug at wall outlet or shut off breaker. Once off, okay to touchvictim. If victim struck by lightning, they can be touched safely! Check ABCs ... Airway, Breathing, &Circulation if victim is passed out - you may need to do RescueBreathing or CPR. (see BREATHING PROBLEMS and HEART PROBLEMS) 166 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Don't move victim unless they are in danger. There should be 2 wounds - usually have enter and exit burns. DO NOT try to cool the burn with anything! Cover burn with a dry sterile bandage or clean cloth. Seek medical attention, if necessary. SUNBURN Sunblocks and lotions should be applied at least 20 minutes BEFORE going in the sun so it can be absorbed into skin layers, especially on your little ones! Remember... dark colors absorb heat so best to wear light or white colors to reflect sunlight. And you can get sunburned on cloudy days just aseasily as sunny days - if you can see a shadow, you're still catching somerays. Things to watch out for... Blisters or bubbles on the skin Swelling or pain What to do... Cool the burn by using cool cloths or pure aloe vera gel. Get out of sun or cover up to avoid further damage. Take care of blisters by loosely covering them and don't pick at them! To help r elieve the pain fr om a sunburn if NO blisters exist: Aloe vera - Break open a fresh leaf or use 96-100% pure aloe gel. Baking soda - Add 1/2 cup baking soda to a warm bath and soak for half an hour. Vinegar - Put some regular or cider vinegar on a cloth and apply to sun- burned area. Whole milk - Apply a cool compress soaked in whole milk to the area. 167 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... CHOKING ? Things to watch for... Trouble breathing Coughing or choking for several minutesGripping the throat with one or both handsHigh-pitched wheezingBluish color of skin, lips, fingertips/nails, and earlobes ATTENTION : There are TWO separate \" What to do... \" parts here... one for ADUL TS & CHILDREN (below) and one for INFANTS (see next page)! What to do... for ADUL TS & CHILDREN (Children over age 1) Tell victim to try and cough it out. If victim stops breathing, then BE PREPARED to give Heimlich maneuver (next 2 bullets) and tell someone tocall an ambulance. Stand behind victim and place your fist (thumb side in) just above victim's belly button. Grab fist with your other hand and give quick, upward thrusts into their stomach until object is coughed up (orvictim passes out). If ADUL TorCHILD passes out: Check for an object in victim's mouth and try to clear it out with your fingers. Begin Rescue Breathing (see BREATHING PROBLEMS) If NO air gets in ADUL TorCHILD during Rescue Breathing: Combine Heimlich maneuver with Rescue Breathing Put heel of one hand just above victim's belly button and put your other hand on top of the first. Give 6-10 upward thrusts to try to clear their windpipe. Check for an object in victim's mouth and try to clear it out with your fingers. Try to give Rescue Breathing again to see if air will go in. Continue above steps until victim can breathe on their own or until help arrives. 168 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What to do... for INF ANTS (Newborn to age 1) If infant stops breathing, have someone call an ambu- lance. Turn infant face down on your forearm and support its head with that hand -- hold at angle so it's head is lowerthan chest. (May want to brace arm holding infant againstyour thigh!) Give 5 back blows between infants' shoulder blades with heel of your other hand. Turn infant over so it is facing up on your forearm (still at an angle so head lower than chest) -- use your first two fingers to find center of the breastbone on infant's chest. Give 5 thrusts to infant's chest using only 2 fingers ! (Each thrust should be 1/2 to 1 inch [1 to 2.5 cm] deep!) Repeat steps until object is coughed up or infant passes out. If INF ANT passes out: Check for object in the infant's mouth and try to clear it out with your fingers. Begin Rescue Breathing ... and remember, cover both mouth and nose on Infants! (see BREATHING PROB- LEMS) If no air gets in INF ANT during Rescue Breathing: Turn infant face down on your forearm again supporting its head with that hand -- hold at angle so head lower thanchest. Give 5 back blows between infants' shoulder blades with heel of your other hand. Turn infant over so it is facing up on your forearm and use your first two fingers to find center of the breastbone on infant's chest. Give 5 thrusts to infant's chest using only 2 fingers ! (Each thrust should be 1/2 to 1 inch [1 to 2.5 cm] deep!) Try to give Rescue Breathing again to see if air will go in. Continue above steps until infant can breathe on its own or until help arrives. 169 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... COLD-RELATED ILLNESSES ? FROSTBITE Frostbite (or frostnip which is the early stages of frostbite) is when certain parts of your body are exposed to severe or extreme cold - mainly yourfingers, toes, ears, cheeks and nose. Freezing temperatures can form icecrystals in the fluids in and around cells in your body. This damages anddries out cell tissues and membranes, and extreme cases can impact deepnerves, muscles or even bones... or even lead to the loss of a limb! Things to watch for... Skin appears white and waxy Numbness or no feeling in that areaPossible blisters What to do... Handle area gently; DO NOT rub it! Remove tight or constrictive clothing (gloves, boots, socks, etc.) and any jewelry. Warm gently using body heat or soaking area in warm water (between 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit / between 38-41 degrees Celsius) until area is red and feels warm.(Person may feel a burning sensation or pain as the areawarms back up.) Loosely bandage area with dry, sterile dressing or cloth. If fingers or toes are frostbitten, separate them with ster- ile gauze or clean cloth. Try not to break any blisters. Things you should NOT do... DO NOT rub or massage the area since this may cause damage to cells! DO NOT rub snow on the area! DO NOT try to warm with dry radiant heat (meaning don't warm with a blow-dryer or hold in front of fire orhot stove). Using warm water is best! DO NOT try to thaw a frostbitten body part if it has a chance of re-freezing (if you are stuck in the wilderness)since this could cause more damage. 170 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325HYPOTHERMIA Hypothermia starts setting in when your body core (the vital organs - heart, lungs, and kidneys) drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degreesCelsius). When exposed to extreme cold for a long time, your brain beginsto shut down certain bodily functions to save internal heat for the core. Things to watch for... Shivering and numbness Confusion or dizzinessStumbling and weaknessSlow or slurred speechShock (pale, cold or clammy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Gently move victim to a warm place. Check breathing and pulse ( ABCs... Airway, Breathing, &Circulation ). Handle victim gently and DO NOT rub body or limbs. Remove any wet clothing and replace with dry clothing and/or blankets. If possible, place victim in a sleeping bag, especially if in the wilderness. (Note: Your body heat can help heat vic-tim... so cuddle up - if victim says it's okay!) Cover the head and neck with a hat or part of a blanket (75% of the body's heat is lost through top of the head). DO NOT WARM VICTIM TOO QUICKLY , such as put- ting them in warm water! (If the body warms too fast, itcan dump cold blood into the heart and body core causinga possible heart attack or drop in body temperature.) If hot water bottles or hot packs are used, wrap in a towel or blanket first then place on side of the chest or on groin(hip) area. (If heat is put on arms or legs then blood couldbe drawn away from body core - keep heat on the core!) Let victim sip a warm, sweet, nonalcoholic drink. Keep watching victim's ABCs... Things you should NOT do... DO NOT rub or massage the victims limbs! DO NOT put victim in a hot bath! It will warm him/her TOO quickly! DO NOT put hot packs on arms or legs... put them against the body (chest or groin area)! 171 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... CONVULSIONS & S EIZURES ? Convulsions are usually brought on by a high fever, poisoning or injury and is basically a violent seizure (see \"Things to watch for...\") . Seizures are usually related to epilepsy (also known as seizure disorder since seizures occur repeatedly during person's life), and about 2 millionAmericans and 300,000 Canadians suffer from epilepsy. There are manytypes and forms of seizures that range from a short episode of blank star-ing to convulsions -- and most seizures only last from 1-3 minutes or less. Things to watch for... Victim falls to floor and shakes or twitches in the arms, legs or body for a minute or longer Blank staring or vacant expression and minor twitch- ing of the face or jerking of the hand (usually a mild epileptic seizure) Loss of body fluids or functions (drooling, may pee or poop) No memory of what happened, confusion What to do... Have someone call for an ambulance, esp. if victim was poisoned or injured or if seizure lasts over 3-5 minutes. Stay calm... you can't stop the convulsion or seizure. DO NOT put anything between teeth or in mouth! Move things that could hurt or fall on victim. Put something soft under victim's head, if possible. When convulsion or seizure is over, help roll victim on to their side to keep an open airway. Look for any other injuries and keep checking ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Stay with victim until help arrives and try to calm them. If victim is epileptic: Ask if the victim takes any medications for seizures and help him/her take them according to the instructions. Also may want to review TERRORISM (in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment for several chemical agents that may causeconvulsions. 172 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... DIZZINESS & F AINTING ? DIZZINESS Dizziness is a symptom, usually combined with feeling sick to the stom- ach, sweating, and feeling some kind of movement that really isn't there. Things to watch for... If dizzy feeling does not pass quickly or is really bad Fainting or passing outVapors, mist or strange smells What to do... Have victim sit or lie down and close their eyes or focus on a nearby object that is not moving. Tell victim to try to keep their head still. FAINTING Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness (passes out) and may indicate a more serious condition. It's usually caused due to a lack of oxygenatedblood to the brain. Be aware several types of injuries could cause fainting. Things to watch for... Visible injuries like bleeding from the ears or a bite or sting Pupils are enlarged or very small (if different sizes, it could be a stroke) Vapors, mist or strange smellsBluish color of skin, lips, fingertips or nails (may not be getting air - see BREATHING PROBLEMS ) What to do... If victim is still passed out, put victim on their side to keep an open airway. Once victim is awake, gently roll them onto their back. Prop feet and the lower part of legs up with pillows or something (only if victim is not hurt). Loosen any tight clothing, esp. around neck and waist. Check ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Make sure victim rests before trying to get up. If necessary, contact doctor if symptoms persist. 173 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... DROWNING ? Things to watch for... Signs of breathing Bluish color of skin, lips, fingertips or nails (may not be getting air) Pulse What to do... Have someone call for an ambulance. Once victim is out of the water, check ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Check to see if there are any injuries or objects in mouth. If victim is not breathing or has no pulse, begin Rescue Breathing and/or CPR. (see BREATHING PROBLEMS for Rescue Breathing and HEART PROBLEMS for CPR) Once victim starts breathing on their own, cover with a blanket or dry towels to keep warm and have them layon their side for a while. Stay with victim at all times until medical help arrives. 174 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... EARINJURIES ? The ear is made up of 3 parts - sound waves are collected by the outer ear with its funny twists and turns. Sound then travels to the middle ear, which has three tiny bones behind the eardrum and is filled with air. From there,sounds (now vibrations) move on to the inner ear where the vibrations are turned into electrical signals and sent to the brain. It's actually a much more involved process than listed above, but many types of ear injuries - from infections to a ruptured eardrum by a blast - willmost likely require a medical professional. Below are two minor ear-related injuries and tips on noise-induced hearing loss that could occur in some types of natural or man-made disasters. EAR INFECTIONS (OUTER / M INOR ) Things to watch for... Itchy or tickly feeling in ear canal Pain when moving or tugging earInflamed or swollen ear canalWatery or smelly fluid may drain from earFever or dizziness What to do... Use ear drops or gently flush ear with 3% hydrogen per- oxide. Keep ear canal dry when swimming or showering (use ear plugs or shower cap [in shower]). If ear feels plugged, try opening it by yawning, chewing gum or drinking warm teas or soup. Boost immune system to help fight infection (like taking astragalus, Vitamin C, garlic, mushrooms, zinc, and agood multiple vitamin + mineral supplement, etc. - but check with doctor if taking prescription medications). If pain continues or fever gets above 103F [39C] or fluid drains from ear - visit your doctor or an Ear, Nose andThroat specialist. Middle and inner ear infections can lead to long-term problems if left untreated, esp. for small children. 175 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FOREIGN OBJECT IN EAR If something crawls in or gets stuck in the ear... Keep victim calm and ask them sit down with head tilted sideways. Use a flashlight to try to see object in ear... if a bug - turn ear up toward sun or flashlight - most bugs are drawn to light so it might crawl out on it's own if a loose item - tilt head and try to shake it out if still in but see it -IF victim is calm and you see the item, gently try to remove with tweezers, but DO NOT do this if victim is squirming or item is deep in ear - youcould damage the eardrum! Get medical help if not successful or can't visually locate object (doctors have special tools for ears). NOISE-INDUCED HEARING LOSS (NIHL) Millions of people are exposed to hazardous sound levels daily. Loudimpulse noise (like an explosion) or loud continuous noise at work or play(like working in a nightclub or riding motorcycles) damage the delicatehair cells of the inner ear and the hearing nerve. Sometimes damage can be temporary - like after a concert when your ears ring for a bit then go back to normal. But repeated loud noise over your lifeor a massive impulse noise could lead to permanent damage - damage thatcannot be reversed. Just be aware certain types of disasters like tornadoes,a terrorist's bomb, or even hurricanes can cause a form of hearing loss. Things to watch for... Bombs, tornadoes, power tools, loud music, jet ski, etc. Having to shout to be heard over noise (too loud)Ringing or buzzing in ears What to do... Avoid loud situations or at least wear ear plugs or ear muffs. Have hearing tested yearly (esp. if you work around loud noises). Protect children's ears. (Note: using cotton isn't enough.) To learn more about NIHL, visit National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders' web site at www .nidcd.nih.gov (click on \"Hearing, Ear Infections and Deafness\") or call NIHL InformationClearinghouse 1-800-241-1044 or TTY: 1-800-241-1055 176 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... EYEINJURIES ? Things to watch for... Severe or constant pain or burning Object stuck in the eye (like a piece of metal or glass) Redness and swellingBlurry vision, trouble keeping eye open, light sensitiveVapors or fumes in the airIf injury is from a chemical, make a note of the name for Poison Control if possible What to do... Avoid rubbing eye since this can cause more damage. Have victim sit down with their head tilted backwards. Wash hands before touching eye area! If the injury is a loose foreign object: Gently separate eyelids to see if you can locate a foreign object - can try removing it by wiping gently with damptissue. Ask victim if he/she wears contact lenses, and if so, ask him or her to remove them. Have victim lean over sink or lie on back, hold eye open, and gently flush eye with lukewarm water or a salinesolution. Get medical help if you are not successful! If there is an object sticking out of the eye: Put thick soft pads around the object that is sticking out. DO NOT try to remove or press on the object! Carefully wrap with a roller bandage to hold thick pads around the object. Get medical attention immediately! If injury is from a blow to the eye: Apply an icepack to reduce pain and swelling. Seek medical attention if damage to eye or blurred vision. Continued on next page... 177 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If the injury is from a chemical: Call your local Poison Control Center (or 1-800-222- 1222 in the U.S.) and have name of chemical handy, ifpossible. If victim is wearing contact lenses, ask Poison Control if they should be removed and whether to keep or dispose of them ! If okay and able to take out, ask victim to remove. Have victim lean over sink, lie down, or get in shower - hold eye(s) open, and gently flush with lukewarm waterfor at least 15 minutes. (If only one eye has chemical in it,make sure head is turned so it doesn't pour into the othereye!) Tell victim to roll eyeball(s) around while flushing to wash entire eye. DO NOT press or rub the eyes! May want to cover eyes with clean dressing & bandages but ask Poison Control or check label on bottle. Forexample, if chemical is mustard gas (sulfur mustard) youshould not cover eyes ... but wear shades to protect them. Get medical attention immediately! Things you should NOT do... DO NOT try to remove an object that is stuck into the eye! DO NOT try to remove their contacts (if any)... let the victim do it! DO NOT try to move the eyeball if it comes out of the socket! Things you SHOULD do... Protect your eyes with safety glasses or goggles when playing sports or working with tools or chemicals ... andwear shades during the day (to help reduce UV exposure). When an eye injury occurs, have an ophthalmologist (an eye physician and surgeon) examine it as soon as possi- ble. You may not be realize how serious an injury is atfirst. Also may want to review TERRORISM (in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment on several biological and chemical agents thatmay cause eye injuries or discomfort. 178 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... HEAD, NECK OR SPINE INJURIES ? Things to watch for... Convulsions or seizures Intense pain in the head, neck or backBleeding from the head, ears or noseBlurry visionTingling or loss of feeling in the hands, fingers, feet or toes Weird bumps on the head or down the spineShock (pale, cold or clammy, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Do not try to move victim unless they are in extreme dan- ger and support victim's head and neck during movement. Have someone call an ambulance immediately! Check to see if victim is alert and check ABCs... Airway , Breathing & Circulation ... and if you need to give them Rescue Breathing or CPR... DO NOT tilt their head back! (see BREATHING PROBLEMS for Rescue Breathing and HEART PROBLEMS for CPR) Try to control any bleeding using direct pressure. (see BLEEDING) If victim is passed out, hold their head gently between your hands while waiting for help to arrive. This will keepthem from moving suddenly when/if they wake up. 179 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... HEART PROBLEMS ? Heart attacks can kill and most victims die within 2 hours of the first few symptoms. Most people deny they are having a heart attack - even if theyhave chest pains and shortness of breath... but DON'T take any chances!These are your body's warning signs, so pay attention! A heart attack canlead to Cardiac Arrest . Cardiac arrest means that the heart stops beating and causes victim to pass out followed by no sign of breathing and no pulse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is used to help pump oxygenated blood through the body to the brain until the medical experts arrive. Whenyou combine CPR and Rescue Breathing , you are giving a victim better odds of surviving since you help supply more oxygen to vital organs.However, if CPR is not done correctly, there's a chance of injuring a victim internally... especially on the elderly, children and infants. Please realize the primary step during CPR is doing compressions to keep blood flowing. If you have not been trained or don't feel comfortable doingRescue Breathing - at least do the compressions . You don't even have to stop and check for a pulse - look and listen for signs and keep pumping! The Red Cross teaches many First Aid courses, including CPR. (see RED CROSS FIRST AID SERVICES & PROGRAMS at start of this section) HEAR TATTACK Things to watch for... Chest pain that can spread to shoulder, arm, or jaw Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Strange pulse (faster or slower than normal or sporadic) Pale or bluish skin color What to do... Tell victim to STOP what they're doing, sit down and rest. Call for an ambulance immediately! Loosen any tight clothing, esp. around neck and waist. Ask victim if they are taking any prescribed medicines for their heart... and if they do, have them take it! Take a couple of pure aspirin, if available. Watch victim's breathing and be prepared to give CPR. 180 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325CARDIAC ARREST (GIVING CPR) Main thing is do compressions to keep blood moving until help arrives! Things to watch for... Not responding or passed out Not breathing and no pulseBroken bones or chest, head, neck or spine injuries What to do... Call for an ambulance immediately! Check ABCs... Airway, Breathing, &Circulation . Tilt head all the way back and lift chin. (Be careful with child's or infant's head... just tilt a little bit!) Watch chest, listen, and feel for breathing for 5 seconds. If victim is NOT breathing begin Rescue Breathing ... Pinch victim's nose shut. Open mouth wide to make tight seal around victim's mouth. For INF ANT - cover both mouth and nose! Give victim 2 full breaths (each breath should be 1-2 seconds long and make the chest rise.) Immediately begin giving CPR. To begin CPR Find hand position in center of chest over breastbone - see illustrations on next 3 pages... FOR ADUL TS- [see illustration 3-1 on page 182] FOR CHILDREN - [see illustration 3-2 on page 183] FOR INFANTS - [see illustration 3-3 on page 184] Begin chest compressions (at least 100 compressions per minute according to American Heart Association) usingthe following guidelines: ADUL TS- Using both hands, compress chest 30 times. CHILDREN - Using one hand, compress chest 30 times. INFANTS - Using 2 fingers , compress chest 30 times. Give victim 2 full breaths. (If not comfortable giving res- cue breaths, keep doing compressions - push hard & pushfast to keep oxygenated blood moving through victim!) Repeat 30 chest compressions (and 2 full breaths, if doing) until victim recovers or medical help arrives. If victim recovers (starts breathing and pulse resumes), turn victim onto their side to keep airway open. 181 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325182 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325CPR P OSITION FOR ADULTS (8 YEARS & OLDER ) Illustration 3-1 1.

Find finger position 2. Position hand over fingers. Compress chest 30 times, give 2 rescue breaths, and repeat until help arrives/victim recovers.What are YOU gonna do about... HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES ? There are two major types of heat illness - HEAT EXHAUSTION and HEAT STROKE . If heat exhaustion is left untreated it can lead to heat stroke. Both conditions are serious, however, heat stroke is a major medical emergency and getting victim's body temperature cooled down is more critical than getting fluids in their body. Heat stroke can lead to death. Things to watch for... Heat Cramps Muscle pains and spasms (usually first sign that body's having trouble with the heat) Heat Exhaustion Cool, clammy, or pale skin Light-headed or dizzy and weakRacing heartSick to the stomach (nausea)Very thirsty or heavy sweating (sometimes) Heat S troke (also called Sunstr oke) Very hot and dry skin Light-headed or dizzyConfusion, drowsiness or faintingRapid breathing and rapid heartbeatConvulsions, passes out or slips into a coma What to do... Get victim to a cool or shady place and rest. Lightly stretch or massage muscles to relieve cramps. Loosen clothing around waist and neck to improve circu- lation and remove sweaty clothes. Cool down victim's body - put wet cloths on victim's face, neck and skin and keep adding cool water to cloth...or if outdoors, use hose or stream. Also, fan the victim orget inside air-conditioned place. Have victim sip cool water (NO alcohol - it dehydrates!) If victim refuses water, pukes or starts to pass out: Call for an ambulance or call 9-1-1. Continued on next page... 185 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Put victim on their side to keep airway open. Keep cooling down their body by placing ice or cold cloths on wrists, neck, armpits, and groin area (where legmeets the hip) or keep adding water to cloths. Also fan thevictim. Check victim's ABCs... Airway, Breathing, & Circulation . Stay with victim until medical help arrives. Remember, HEAT STROKE (also known as sunstroke) is a medical emergency and can cause the victim to slip into a coma -- getting a victim'sbody temperature cooled down is more important than getting fluids intheir body! 186 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... INFECTION ? It is important to be very careful and protect yourself against the spread of disease or infection when caring for an open wound or a wound that isbleeding. (Review TIPS ON REDUCING THE SPREAD OF GERMS OR DISEASES at beginning of this section) INFECTION Germs are the main cause of an infection so whenever you perform first aidon anyone (including yourself), there is always a chance of spreadinggerms or diseases. All injuries - from tiny cuts to massive wounds - must be cleaned immediately to reduce the chances of infection! And keep cleaning a wound until it is completely healed. Things to watch for... Sore or wound is red and swollen or has red streaks Sore or wound is warm or painfulWound may open and ooze clear or yellowish fluidFever or muscle aches or stiffness in the neck What to do... ALWAYS wash your hands before and after caring for a wound... even if it's your own! Immediately wash minor wounds with soap and water or rinse with hydrogen peroxide. Cover wound with sterile bandage or gauze -- best to clean and change bandage daily. An open wound is adoorway for germs and infection to get inside the body. Use an antibiotic cream or gel to help disinfect the wound and kill germs. (Note: don't use cream or gel if wound is from a bite since it might seal wound and keep it fromdraining.) Boost your immune system to help fight infection (like taking astragalus, Vitamin C, garlic, mushrooms, zinc,and a good multiple vitamin + mineral supplement, etc. -but check with your doctor first if taking any prescriptionmedications). If infection gets worse, you may want to see a doctor. 187 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... INFECTIOUS DISEASES ? The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against attacks by foreign invaders suchas bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Because the human body providesan ideal environment for many microbes, they try to break in. It is theimmune system's job to keep them out or, failing that, to seek out anddestroy them. 10But if a person's immune system is weak or damaged, germs and infection can settle in, leading to illness or possibly death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. And with air travel andinternational trade, infectious microbes are carried across borders everyday by humans, animals, insects and contaminated foods. Some \"old\" diseases like malaria and measles are found in certain parts of the world, but \"new\" diseases like HIV/AIDS and West Nile are spreadingaround the globe. Plus every year there's some form of influenza and thecommon cold that spreads and affects people. There are many infectious diseases -- too many to cover here -- so we're only covering a common one ( flu) and some emerging ones ( avian flu , SARS and staph ). First, we describe each illness followed by \"Things to watch for\", then summarize \"How they spread\" and \"What to do\" for all ofthem at the end. Educate yourself about threats of emerging diseases andlisten to officials for advice on how to protect yourself and your loved ones. Influenza (flu) is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus that affects millions of people each year. Flu causes an estimated 250,000 -500,000 deaths worldwide every year, and a major outbreak (called a pandemic) could increase the death toll dramatically. The best way to pre-vent the flu is to get vaccinated each fall, especially people with weakenedimmune systems. There are several antiviral drugs approved for treatment. There are 3 types of flu viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A viruses can infect humans and mammals but wild birds are the natural host. Typically, wildbirds don't get sick but A viruses can be deadly to domestic poultry (chick-ens and turkeys). Influenza B viruses are normally found only in humansand generally don't cause severe widespread illness, while Influenza Cviruses cause mild illness in humans. Since strains can mutate or cross overinto other species, it could lead to widespread illness and death. The worstinfluenza A outbreak on record was the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919which may have killed up to 50 million people worldwide. 188 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to watch for (flu)... Possible symptoms - fever (usually high), headache, sore throat, cough, runny nose, body aches, weakness, diar-rhea or puking (more common in children) Possible complications - bacterial pneumonia (lung inflammation), shortness of breath, hospitalization Avian flu (bird flu ) is a contagious viral infection that can affect all species of birds and can cause disease in humans in rare cases. To date,most human cases caught the flu from domestic chickens or ducks and over50% of those patients died. There have been some documented cases ofavian flu spreading person-to-person and across species so the threat ishigh and being monitored worldwide. Currently there is no vaccine avail-able but there are some antiviral drugs available for treatment. Things to watch for (avian flu)... Flu-like symptoms - fever, headache, sore throat, cough, body aches Possible complications - eye infections, pneumonia or viral pneumonia, severe breathing problems or death SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome ) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus. Normally these viruses cause mild to moderaterespiratory symptoms (like a cold) but have been linked to pneumonia inhumans (esp. people with weakened immune systems) and can causesevere disease in animals. Over 8,000 people got sick with 774 deathsduring the global outbreak in 2003. Currently there is no vaccine availableand some antiviral drugs are being tested for treatment. Things to watch for (SARS)... Fever - higher than 100.4F (> 38.0C) Possible early symptoms - chills, headache, sore throat, body aches, mild respiratory symptoms, diarrhea After 2 to 7 days, one or more respiratory symptoms appear - dry cough, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, pneumonia Staph (staphylococcus aureus ) are bacteria healthy people can carry on the skin or in the nose. The bacteria can enter the body through a cut orwound and may cause infection. According to the CDC, staph bacteria areone of the most common causes of skin infections in the U.S. Most infec-tions are minor (like a pimple or boil) and can be treated with antibiotics.But staph bacteria can also cause infections in the blood, bones and lungs.Some bacteria have become resistant to drugs (called methicillin-resistant 189 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA) and occur most often in hospitals, nurs- ing homes and facilities where people have weakened immune systems. Things to watch for (staph)... Possible symptoms - skin infection that may look like a pimple or boil and can be red, swollen, painful, orhave pus or other drainage Severe - pneumonia, bloodstream or wound infections How infectious diseases spread... Most infectious diseases are spread by close person-to-person contact primarily by touching people or things contaminated with bodily fluids(like droplets from coughing or sneezing) -- then touching your eyes, nose,or mouth. Body fluids (sweat, spittle, pee, etc.) from people or critters maybe infectious and some bacteria or viruses can survive on objects for days.In extreme cases, wear gloves, mask and eye shield to protect yourself. What to do to reduce the spread of infectious diseases... Wash hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol in it) to reduce the spread of germs. Sick people should cover mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, wash hands often, and weara face mask around others (if extremely ill). Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered until healed. Clean counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, phones, linens, etc. often with a bleach solution. Don't share silverware, razors, clothing, towels, or bed- ding and wash objects with soap and hot water. Wear mask and wash often if you work at a poultry farm. Follow doctor's instructions and limit activities outside home until fever and symptoms have gone away. For more information, visit the following web sites ...

Please make sure you have the local Poison Control Center phone number near a telephone since many poisonings can be cared for withoutthe help of ambulance personnel. The people who staff Poison ControlCenters (PCCs) have access to information on most poisonous substancesand can tell you what care to give to counteract the poison. POISON CONTROL CENTER # 1-800-222-1222 (U.S. only) If outside U.S., write in local Poison Control Centre phone # below: ______________________________________ POISON - ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN Review TERRORISM (in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment on several poisonous biological and chemical agents thatcould be absorbed through skin. Things to watch for... Reddened skin or burns Poison on skin, clothing or in the area Bites or marks from insect or animal (see BITES & STINGS) Possible Allergic Reaction - Pain, discoloration or red- ness at site, trouble breathing, signs of shock (pale,cold, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Be aware - make sure it's safe, then ask what happened. Move victim to safety (away from poison), if necessary. Find the container (if any) or name of the poison and call local Poison Control Center or an ambulance. Remove clothing that may have poison on it - don't pull over head - cut it off. (Seal clothing in a bag then seal thatbag in a bag - ask officials how to dispose of it later.) Flush skin with running water for 10 minutes. Wash area gently with soap and water. (Note: some chem- ical agents don't suggest using soap so may want to ask.) Monitor breathing and watch for any allergic reactions. 191 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325POISON - INHALED BYBREA THING Review TERRORISM (in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment on several poisonous biological and chemical agents thatcould be inhaled from humans' or critters' wet or dried body fluids, fromsoil, or from powders, gas, mist, or vapors. Things to watch for... Strong odors or fumes Find the source of odor or fumes (be aware of threat) Difficulty in breathing or dizzy What to do... Be aware - make sure it's safe...then ask what happened. Get victim out to fresh air. Avoid breathing fumes - open windows & doors (if safe). Call Poison Control Center or an ambulance. If victim isn't breathing consider doing Rescue Breathing - but ONLY if sure poison cannot be spread person to per-son. (see TERRORISM then BREATHING PROBLEMS) POISON - P OISONOUS PLANTS (IVY, OAK, & SUMAC ) Three common poisonous plants found in Canada and the U.S. include: Poison ivy - can grow as a shrub or vine and is found across most of Canada and U.S. It has white or cream-colored berries (or flowers inSpring) and leaves are usually three leaflets to a stem but vary in color,size, shape and texture around the world. [see illustration 3-4 on page 194] Poison oak - can grow as a shrub or vine and found throughout the West and Southwest (very common in Oregon and California). It also varieswidely in shapes and colors but usually has distinctive shape of an oak leafand red fuzzy berries. The leaves usually come in leaflets of three to a stembut can be in groups of five or more. It is best to learn what it looks likewhere you live. [see illustration 3-5 on page 194] Poison sumac - is a tall shrub or small tree and mostly lives in standing water (like swamps and peat bogs). It has whitish green berries and brightgreen, pointy leaves that grow 6 to 12 leaves in pairs along both sides ofeach stem plus one leaf on each tip. [see illustration 3-6 on page 195] All 3 of these plants have a sap called urushiol [oo-roo-she-ol] which is a sticky, colorless oil that stains things black when exposed to air. This sapis in the leaves, berries, stems and roots of all 3 types and can stick around 192 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325a long time if the sap stays dry (which is why you need to rinse off what- ever gets exposed - yourself, pets, clothing, shoes and laces, tools or camping stuff.) Never burn these plants since smoke can carry the oil andirritate skin, nose or lungs. The rash is caused by your body's reaction to this oil and can show up as quickly as a few hours or take several days ... or never, in some cases, sincesome people don't have reactions to urushiol. It can irritate pets' skin too. Note: the rash itself is not contagious but the OIL (urushiol) is what is transferred by hands, fingers, clothing or fur!! Make sure you wash yourhands after touching the rash to avoid spreading any urushiol. Things to watch for... Inflamed red rash Extremely itchy skin or burning feelingBlistersSwelling or feverAllergic reactions (weakness, dizziness, swelling in mouth or lips, trouble breathing or swallowing) What to do... It is CRITICAL to wash affected area with soap and run- ning water then apply rubbing alcohol using cotton ballson area to remove any excess oil as quickly as possible. Immediately and carefully remove and wash any clothing and/or shoes that got exposed to the poison. (Remember to wash pets, tools or anything else exposed to oil too.) If a rash or sores develop, use calamine lotion or baking soda paste several times a day on area. Take an antihistamine to reduce reaction (read label first). If condition gets worse or spreads onto large areas of body, eyes or face, see a doctor. To relieve pain from poison ivy, oak, or sumac: Baking soda - Make a paste using 3 parts baking soda with 1 part water and apply on rash. Jewelweed - Studies indicate a plant that grows near poison ivy called jewelweed (has tiny, orange-yellow, horn-shaped flowers with reddish orwhite spots) can be used directly on area that brushed against ivy. Crushjuicy stems in your hands and apply to the area - even if there's no rash yetsince it may help reduce inflammation.

Things to watch for... Burns on the mouth, tongue and lips Stomach painsOpen medicine cabinet; spilled or open containersDifficulty breathingConvulsions or seizuresWeakness or dizzinessPassed out What to do... Stay calm and find out exactly what, how much, and how long ago it was swallowed. Call Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222 in the U.S.) or an ambulance and have bottle or container handy (ifpossible). NEVER give victim anything to eat or drink unless told to do so by Poison Control Center or a Medical profes-sional!! If victim pukes, lay them on their side to keep airway open. Save a sample of the vomit IF the poison isunknown so the hospital can try to identify it. If victim isn't breathing consider doing Rescue Breathing - but ONLY if sure poison cannot be spread person to per-son. (Check with Poison Control Center. Also review TERRORISM then BREATHING PROBLEMS) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parents no longer use syrup of ipecac (pronounced ip'- \u00ee - kak) as a poison treatment interventionin the home. Immediately contact local Poison Control Center for help. If you decide to keep a few 1 ounce bottles in your First Aid Kit ... use ONL Yon the advice of a Medical professional or the Poison Control Center ! Syrup of ipecac is sold by most pharmacies without a prescription and used to induce vomiting (makes you puke) -- again, use only ifinstructed to do so. 196 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... SHOCK ? Things to watch for... Pale, cold, and clammy skin Rapid heartbeat but weak pulseQuick and shallow breathingDizziness or confusionBluish color on lips and fingertips or nailsSick to their stomach or puking Intense thirst What to do... Call for an ambulance. Look for injuries and watch ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Position victim using the following tips: alert and awake - place victim flat on their back with legs raised slightly passed out or puking - place victim on side to keep airway open Loosen any tight or restrictive clothing. Cover victim with a blanket or towel. Talk calmly to victim until help arrives (whether they are alert or not!) 197 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... ASTROKE ? According to the American Stroke Association, about 700,000 Americans suffer strokes each year and almost 1/4 of those victims die making strokethe #3 killer in the U.S. Canada reports about 40,000-50,000 new strokesannually killing about 16,000 Canadians making it the 4th leading cause ofdeath according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. A stroke (or \"brain attack\") occurs when oxygen and vital nutrients carried by blood are cut off causing brain cells to die. It's cut off because... ...a blood vessel is blocked in the neck or brain (by a blood clot or narrowing of an artery) -- called an ischemic [is-KEM-ik] stroke (causes about 83% of strokes) ... or... ...a blood vessel bursts or leaks -- called hemorrhagic [hem-o- RAJ-ik] stroke or bleeder (causes 17% of strokes) NOTE: You only have 2 - 6 hours maximum to stop permanent brain damage from a stroke - so get to a hospital as quickly as possible (within 3hours is best!) Things to watch for... Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding Loss of muscle control on one side of the bodyLoss of balance, stumbling, dizziness or faintingDifferent sized pupils (one pupil small / one enlarged) Severe headacheBlurred or double-vision in one or both eyesShock (pale, cold or clammy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) Transient ischemic attack (TIA / mini-stroke) - a minor or warning stroke - risk of major stroke is high What to do... Call 9-1-1 for an ambulance. Get victim to lie back with head raised (put pillows or blankets under head and shoulders so partially sitting up). Loosen any tight or restrictive clothing. See if there are any other injuries. If victim is drooling or having problems swallowing, place them on their side to keep the airway open. Stay with victim until medical help arrives. 198 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... TOOTH INJURIES ? Millions of tooth injuries happen every year - many from sports injuries or accidents, but also from chomping down on hard objects. Things to watch for... Tooth or teeth (or pieces if chipped) Object caught between teeth or stuck in gumRedness, swelling or bleeding What to do... Get to a dentist as quickly as possible. If a permanent tooth is knocked out: Hold tooth by the crown or sides (not the root) and, if dirty, gently rinse with milk or water (but don't scrub it). If possible, gently insert tooth back into socket then hold in place or carefully bite down on gauze or cloth. If youcan't get tooth back in socket, put it in milk (or water). Get medical attention immediately since many permanent teeth can be saved if replaced within 15-30 minutes! If tooth is chipped, cracked or broken: Rinse damaged area with warm water. Apply a cold compress on area to reduce swelling. Call your dentist as soon as possible. Things you should NOT do... DO NOT touch, scrub or hold the root or ligaments. DO NOT use teeth to open bottles or tear things and avoid chewing hard candy, ice, etc. DO NOT leave a knocked out tooth exposed to air or it will dry out - put it in milk (or water as a last resort!) Things you SHOULD do... Wear a mouth guard and protective gear when playing sports and always wear your seat belt when in a vehicle. When a tooth injury occurs, go see a dentist. Practice good dental habits - brush & floss daily and rinse toothbrush with hydrogen peroxide weekly to kill germs. 199 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325200 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 4 Emergency Contact Names & Numbers 201 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325ABOUT THE AMERICAN REDCROSS : Extracted from ARC' s Disaster Services web site as of October 2006: When a disaster threatens or strikes, the Red Cross provides shelter, food, and health and mental health services to address basic human needs.

DHS gives state and local officials one primary contact instead of many, an important advantage when it comes to matters related to training, equip-ment, planning, exercises and other critical homeland security needs. Itmanages federal grant programs for enhancing the preparedness of FirstResponders and infrastructure. DHS also set standards for state and localpreparedness activities and equipment. DHS is made up of several major components: Directorate for National Protection and Programs - works to advance DHS's risk-reduction mission with an integrated approach that encompasses both physical and virtual threats and their associated humanelements. NPP components focus on cyber security and communications,critical infrastructure protection, etc. Domestic Nuclear Detection Office - jointly staffed office established to improve the Nation's capability to detect and report unauthorized attemptsto import, possess, store, develop, or transport nuclear or radiologicalmaterial for use against the Nation, and to further enhance this capabilityover time. Science and Technology - coordinates efforts in research and develop- ment, including preparing for and responding to the full range of terroristthreats involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosiveattacks. Some other key agencies and components include Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ), Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE), Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ), the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Secret Service.

Before a disaster, they participate in train-ing exercises and conduct a variety of activities to help the nation preparefor disasters. For example, the Federal Communications Commission andthe Commerce Department's National Weather Service provide on-goingwarning and disaster tracking services. During a catastrophic disaster, FEMA coordinates the federal response, working with 28 federal partnersand the American Red Cross to provide emergency food and water, med-ical supplies and services, search and rescue operations, transportationassistance, environmental assessment, and more. The National DisasterMedical System is a partnership set up to provide emergency medical serv-ices in a disaster, involving FEMA, Department of Health and HumanServices, Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration, as well aspublic and private hospitals across the country. FEMA P ARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PRIV ATE SECTOR FEMA encourages all sectors of society -- from business and industry tovolunteer organizations -- to work together in disaster preparation,response and recovery. ( Please review APPENDIX A and B.) NATIONAL RESPONSE PLAN DHS's National Response Plan establishes a comprehensive all-hazards approach to enhance the ability of the U.S. to manage domestic incidents.The plan incorporates best practices and procedures from incident man-agement disciplines -- homeland security, emergency management, lawenforcement, firefighting, public works, public health, responder andrecovery worker health and safety, emergency medical services, and theprivate sector -- and integrates them into a unified structure. The NRP(along with the National Incident Management System ) forms the basis of how the federal government coordinates with state, local, and tribalgovernments and the private sector during incidents. The National Response Plan (NRP) works to help: Save lives and protect the health and safety of the public, responders, and recovery workers; Ensure security of the homeland; Prevent imminent incident, including acts of terrorism, from occurring; Protect and restore critical infrastructure and key resources; Conduct law enforcement investigations to resolve incident, apprehend perpetrators, and collect and preserve evidence; Protect property and mitigate damages and impacts to individuals, com- munities, and the environment; Facilitate recovery of individuals, families, businesses, governments, and the environment.

Following a disaster, Red Cross works with governmentsand other humanitarian organizations to provide for people's basic needslike food, clothing, shelter, first aid, emotional support and family reunifi-cation. The specific services offered will be based on the community'sneeds and the role that Red Cross has in the local disaster response plan. All Red Cross assistance is provided free of charge and is made possible because of the generosity of financial donors and the volunteers who provide time and expertise.

Citizen Corps , a component of USA Freedom Corps, was created to help coordinate volunteer activities that make the nation's communities safer,stronger, and better prepared to respond to any emergency situation.Citizen Corps is managed at local levels by Citizen Corps Councils, whichbring together existing crime prevention, disaster preparedness, and publichealth response networks with the volunteer community and other groups. CITIZEN CORPS PROGRAMS & P ARTNERS Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) educate people about disaster preparedness and trains them in basic disaster response skills, suchas fire safety, light search and rescue, and disaster medical operations.Using their training, CERT members can assist others in their neighbor-hood or workplace following an event and can take a more active role inpreparing their community. The program is administered by DHS. Fire Corps promotes the use of citizen advocates to enhance the capacity of resource-constrained fire and rescue departments at all levels: volunteer,combination, and career. Citizen advocates can assist local fire departmentsin a range of activities including fire safety outreach, youth programs, andadministrative support. Fire Corps provides resources to assist fire and rescue departments in creating opportunities for citizen advocates and promotes citizen participation. Fire Corps is funded through DHS and ismanaged and implemented through a partnership between the NationalV olunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Fighters, andthe International Association of Fire Chiefs.

MOREABOUT CERT In the United States and Canada, the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT ) program helps train volunteers to assist first responders in emergency situations in their communities. CERT members give criticalsupport to first responders in emergencies, provide immediate assistance tovictims, organize spontaneous volunteers at a disaster site, and collect disaster intelligence to support first responder efforts. The CERT course is taught in the community by a trained team of first responders who have completed a CERT Train-the-Trainer course con-ducted by their state training office for emergency management, orFEMA's Emergency Management Institute (EMI), located in Emmitsburg,Maryland. CERT training includes disaster preparedness, disaster fire suppression, basic disaster medical operations, and light search and rescueoperations and is usually delivered in 2-1/2 hour sessions, one evening aweek over a 7 week period. FEMA's online \"Introduction to Community Emergency Response Teams\", IS 317, is an independent study course that serves as an introduction toCERT for those wanting to complete training or as a refresher for currentteam members. It has six modules with topics that include an Introductionto CERT, Fire Safety, Hazardous Material and Terrorist Incidents, DisasterMedical Operations, and Search and Rescue. It takes between six and eighthours to complete the course. The IS 317 can be taken by anyone interested in CERT. However, to become a CERT volunteer, one must com-plete classroom training offered by a local government agency such as theemergency management agency, fire or police department. To learn more,visit http://training.fema.gov/EMIW eb/IS/is317.asp For more information about CERT programs or to check if a CERT is inyour community, please visit www .citizencorps.gov/cert/ ... or www .cert-la.com (click on \"Other CERT Team Links\") ... or call your local, state, provincial, or territorial Emergency Management Office to askabout volunteer opportunities.

Basically the concept we're focusing on means how quickly your business could reopen and function following a flood, fire, terrorist attack or evenpandemic flu. By planning in advance with managers and employees, theodds of a company surviving and recovering from a disaster increase dramatically. According to the Department of Homeland Security's Ready Business site, America's businesses form the backbone of the nation's economy; smallbusinesses alone account for over 99% of all companies with employees,employ 50% of all private sector workers and provide nearly 45% of thenation's payroll. And, according to the American Red Cross DisasterServices' Business & Industry Guide web page: while reports vary, asmany as 40% of small businesses do not reopen after a major disaster likea flood, tornado or earthquake. They were unprepared for a disaster; theyhad no plan or backup systems. 11 A commitment to planning today will help support employees, customers,the community, the local economy and even the country. TIPS ON DEVELOPING YOUR BUSINESS PLAN No matter what size your business is you should plan in advance to man-age any type of emergency. Obviously, a large company's plan will bemuch more complex than a small home office or a Mom & Pop shop, butthe following tips may help you get started. Please note, we are only covering some key issues here extracted from DHS' Ready Business site then listing some resources and links at the end, but realize there are many resources available to business owners includingconsultants who can develop a business continuity plan for your company. Learn risks - Ask your local emergency management office what types of natural and man-made disasters are common in the places where you haveoffices or buildings and review those topics in this book. Learn \"Threat Levels\" - Review the District of Columbia Emergency Management Agency's Terrorist Threat Advisory System for tips on 220 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325what business owners and managers should be doing at each color code. (see pages 82-89) Make a plan - Visit www .ready .gov/business to download Sample Plans, Checklists, Forms, etc. Also ... Find out which staff, materials, procedures and equipment are needed to keep your business operating. Create a list of suppliers, shippers, and key contacts you use daily. Decide where you would go if your building, office or store is not useable. (Known as a continuity of operations plan or COOP.) Plan for payroll continuity. Define who will help develop your company's emergency plan. Make sure everyone involved knows what to do and have backup staff trained and ready to fill in, if needed. Share your plans with others in your building or complex and talk to local First Responders, vendors and others to exchange ideas,experience and knowledge. Update and review plans at least once a year if not more often. Keep employees in mind - A good plan includes your most important asset. Keep lines of communication open both ways with newsletters, alert systems through email or voicemail, Q & A sessions withmanagement and key personnel involved with planning, etc. Ensure you have plans for disabled employees and assign \"bud- dies\" to help during an emergency. Visit www .nod.or gfor tips. Update employee emergency contact data often and keep a current copy with other important papers off-site or in Grab & Go kits. Practice, practice, practice -- make sure all employees do drills and know what to do and where to go during and after a disaster. Make or get Grab & Go kits - Review Section 1 for tips on assembling a Disaster Supplies Kit for your people. Share ideas with employees too since they may want to make their own small \"Office Kit\" with personalitems. Many companies sell pre-stocked or customized Corporate Kitsbased on number of employees and days needed - check online or Yellowpages for \"disaster products\" or call your local Red Cross. S tay or go..? - Plan in advance how staff should shelter-in-place versus evacuate the building. (see THINK ABOUT SHELTER in Section 1 and EVACUATION topic in Section 2) Things to plan for if instructed to \"Shelter-in-place\": Listen to local authorities and tune in radio or TV for updates. 221 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If possible, know who's in the building if there is an emergency. Set up a warning system (and remember folks with hearing or vision disabilities or non-English speaking workers). Determine which room or area will be used for shelter for each type of disaster in advance (i.e. some emergencies require staying above ground - others may be best underground or in a sealedroom - review Section 2 for tips on sheltering). Discuss ideas withothers in your building or complex or with First Responders. Calculate air requirements for sealed room. (see HAZARDOUS MATERIALS or TERRORISM topic) Consider installing a safe room. (see MITIGATION TIPS) Assign certain people to grab Kits, take headcounts, seal off room, etc. and have backups lined up in case someone's off or injured. Take a headcount or have a checklist of people in shelter. Practice, practice, practice -- make sure employees know shelter- in-place plans and be ready to explain procedures to newbies notfamiliar with your plans (like customers or suppliers who might beat your building when an event occurs). Things to plan for when making an \"Evacuation plan\": If possible, know who's in the building if there is an emergency. Decide in advance who in your staff and your building has the authority to order an evacuation. And if local authorities tell youto leave - DO it! Determine who is in charge of shutting down critical operations and systems and locking doors (if possible) during evacuation. Draw a map of your shop or building and mark locations of exits, disaster and first aid kits, fire extinguishers and utility shut-offpoints. Plan at least two escape routes from different sections offacility. Post copies of maps so employees can find them easilyand share copies with local First Responders. Set up a warning system (and remember folks with hearing or vision disabilities or non-English speaking workers). Have flashlights handy or install emergency lighting to help staff exit safely. (Note: never use lighters since there may be gas leaks.) Pick two meeting places (assembly sites) in advance for staff to go - one near the facility and one further away. Also discuss howemployees should notify someone if they need to leave the site oraren't able to reach one. Take a headcount or have a checklist of people at assembly site. Practice, practice, practice -- make sure employees know evacua- tion plans and be ready to explain procedures to newbies not 222 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325familiar with your plans (like customers or suppliers who might be at your building when an event occurs). Practice drills with othertenants or businesses in your complex and share plans and ideas. Practice fire drills - Fire is the most common of all business disasters. Contact your local Fire Marshal to inspect your shop or building. Install smoke detectors and fire extinguishers and test them often! Set up a warning system (and remember folks with hearing or vision disabilities or non-English speaking workers). Do fire drills and make sure people know how to stay below the smoke, how to test doors to see if they are hot, etc. (see tips in FIRES & WILDFIRES topic) Be prepared for medical emer gencies - Provide first aid and CPR training to your staff and keep first aid kits stocked and accessible. (see Section 3 for TIPS ON BASIC FIRST AID) Get involved - Join or form a CERT with your local EM. ( see page 219) Practice & fine tune - Take notes on things that should be modified during drills and get feedback from employees so your plan is continually improv-ing. Let everyone know about changes to plans and practice drills often.And don't forget your new hires - include plan in Training Programs. Encourage preparedness - Provide customized copies of this book to all your employees (and customers) so they can develop their own personalfamily plans and kits at home. Send preparedness reminder tips in emailsor newsletters. Have a communications plan - Write a crisis communications plan in advance so you are prepared to communicate with employees, customersand others during and after a disaster. Employees - Be prepared to tell workers when, if and how to report to work after an emergency (either through voicemail, emailor manual call system). Explain how the incident may affect jobs. Management - Give executives as much information as possible to protect employees, customers, vendors and nearby facilities. Public - You may need to update the media and general public about the safety or status of employees or buildings and that plansare in place for recovery. Customers - Stay in touch with clients so they know when prod- ucts or services are back in stock or online. Government - Let officials know what your company can do to help in recovery efforts and ask for help, if needed. 223 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Other Businesses/Immediate Neighbors - Be prepared to give neighboring companies or competitors updates on the nature of thesituation in case they need to make plans for their own safety. Help employees recover - Support your workers as they cope with the stress of recovering from a disaster. See TIPS ON RECOVERING FROMA DISASTER ... and ... Provide time off so workers can get their home life in order. Offer care or professional counselors on-site. Get folks back into work routines once possible. TIPS ON PROTECTING YOUR BUSINESS Ready Business suggests in addition to emergency planning, the following steps be taken to safeguard your company and secure your physical assets. Review insurance - Meet with your agent or provider to review policies. Ask if current coverage includes physical losses, flood coverage and business interruption (& visit www .floodsmart.gov for tips). Plan how you would pay creditors, employees and yourself. Find out what records your provider would need after a disaster and store those papers in a safe place. Download Insurance Discussion Form and Computer Inventory Form off the Ready Business site at www .ready .gov/business . Utilities - Think about what your company would do if there's no power, gas, telecommunications, sewer and other utilities. Talk to providers and ask about alternative and backup options during disruptions of service. Ask how and when to turn off utilities and never try to turn gas back on - call the gas company! Consider getting portable generators but never use them inside since they produce deadly carbon monoxide gas. Get wireless phones, walkie-talkies or other devices that don't rely on electricity so you can stay in touch with employees and cus-tomers. Keep extra batteries on-hand too. Have backup providers lined up in case your telephone or Internet services are down locally. Make sure Disaster Supplies Kit includes sanitation items in case sewer lines are damaged. (see TIPS ON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE near end of Section 2) 224 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Protect assets - There are some things you can do in advance to protect your building and equipment ... Install smoke detectors and fire extinguishers and test them often. Draw a map of your building and mark locations of exits, fire extinguishers and utility shut-off points. Post copies so employeescan find them easily and share copies with local First Responders. Consider installing extra security measures like alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, closed circuit TV , keypad or card access sys-tems, or security guards. (see page 87 for additional security tips) Think about all the ways people and deliveries enter and leave your building and the potential risks associated with them.

Learn about FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) loans and other cost-saving mitigation tips for structures and property byvisiting www .fema.gov . Plan how you would replace machinery, computers or equipment quickly if it's damaged or destroyed and keep extra supplies on-hand. Decide where you could run the business if your shop's not usable. Ensure any backup location complies with local, state and federal codes and other safety regulations and ask your insurance agent ifoperating at another facility impacts your policy. Secure equipment - Use straps or L-braces to batten down cabinets or machinery, move heavy items to lower shelves and raise electrical equip-ment off the floor. (see MITIGATION TIPS at beginning of Section 2) Airborne threats - Several types of disasters can impact the air quality of a building from mold due to flooding, airborne particles from a biologicalattack or dirty bomb, or smoke from a wildfire. Ask if there are options toimprove air quality and protection in the Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HV AC) system. Make sure unit is in good, working condition. Practice shut-down procedures for the HV AC system. Secure outdoor air intakes but never seal them. Ask if they can be relocated to an area with limited access (especially intakes that areclose to or underground.) Consider upgrading the filtration system with High Efficiency Particulate Arrester (HEPA) filter fans or get portable HEPA filtersto help remove dander, dust, molds, smoke and other contami-nants. (see AIR QUALITY MITIGATION) 225 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Cyber threats - Computer crime and hactivism cost businesses billions of dollars every year. Whether you use one computer or a massive network, itis critical to keep your system protected from viruses and attacks. Make sure computers and wireless devices have current anti-virus software and firewalls .. schedule them to scan daily or weekly andupdate virus patterns often. Encourage employees to protect theirpersonal home devices too. Set security preferences as high as possible on Internet browsers and virus packages. Do NOT open emails or attachments from unknown sources. Use long passwords (best to use both numbers and letters), change them often and don't share them with others. Backup data often and keep a daily or weekly backup off-site. Make sure someone knows how to download patches or fixes in case a computer or system gets infected. If your business is hacked, file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center at www .ic3.gov (The IC3 is a partner- ship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] and theNational White Collar Crime Center [NW3C].

In fact,crime in schools has been decreasing since 1992. The CDC reports thenumber of children and youth homicides that are school-related make uponly 1% of the total number of child and youth homicides in the U.S.However, recent events have sparked an interest in school safety. Parents / guardians need to be proactive and work with school officials to find out what the procedures and plans are in the event of a disaster, lock-down or evacuation. Get involved by attending school safety planningmeetings, working with local PTAs or volunteering your time at the school.And keep the lines of communication open with your children starting at avery early age so kids feel comfortable coming to you with questions orproblems they may face at school.

No one wants to think about a nuclear crisis - and hopefully it will never happen - but we as a nation must accept the fact nuclear tensions are rising globally so we should prepare ourselves and our loved ones in the event theunthinkable happens. For decades, movies and some in the media have portrayed a nuclear attack as a \"doomsday\" event implying most people would be killed on impact ...and survivors would want to die once they come out of their shelters. Inreality, unless you are actually at ground zero or within a several mileradius of the blast zone (depending on the size of the nuke, of course), thereis a very high probability you will survive as long as you limit your expo-sure to the radiation, take shelter with proper shielding, and wait for themost dangerous radioactive materials to decay. In other words, you CAN survive a nuke attack ... but you MUST make an effort to learn what to do! As mentioned in the \"Terrorism\" topic, by learning about potential threats, we are all better prepared to know how to react if something happens.Earlier in this manual we covered nuclear incidents (primarily involving apower plant accident) and RDDs (dirty bombs) explaining both scenarioswould be pretty localized. We also listed sheltering tips and suggesteditems to be included in Disaster Supplies Kits for several days, however anuclear attack could create more extensive damage and longer shelteringrequirements meaning more preparation is needed. In this section we'll explain a nuke scenario in more detail, give some tips on sheltering and supplies, and suggest what to do BEFORE, DURING andAFTER an attack. Please realize this topic is being written with small nukedevices in mind (like a 1-kiloton to 1-megaton device - similar to what aterrrorist group may try to obtain and use). A much larger device or anuclear war would cause more wide-spread damage and some of this datacould still be helpful. Again, these are some very basic things you can doto prepare yourself and your family so you can survive the unexpected. WHATHAPPENS WHEN A NUKE EXPLODES ? A nuclear blast produces a blinding light, intense heat (called thermal radi-ation), initial nuclear radiation, 2 explosive shock waves (blasts), mass 231 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325fires, and radioactive fallout (residual nuclear radiation). And, if a nuke explodes miles above the earth, it could create an electromagnetic pulse(EMP). Let's break this down a little further... fireball - a combination of heat and light so intense the flash can be seen for hundreds of miles. Just looking atthe flash can cause temporary or permanent eye damage. thermal radiation - an intense heat that could cause fires for several miles around ground zero. The heat flashcould cause severe burns from direct exposure or fromburning objects like clothing, buildings, etc. initial nuclear radiation - penetrating invisible rays that can be lethal in high levels blast - explosive shock wave that happens a split second after the fireball. The blast could destroy most buildingsfor several miles depending on the size of the nuke andstrength of the structures. A blast can also cause seriousinjuries to people from being thrown by the shock waveor getting hit by flying objects or debris. radioactive fallout (residual nuclear radiation) - created when the fireball vaporizes everything inside it (includingdirt and water). Vaporized materials mix with radioactivematerials in the updraft of air forming a mushroom cloud.Fallout can be carried by winds for hundreds of miles andbegin falling to the ground within minutes of the blast ortake hours, days, weeks or even months to fall. The heav-iest fallout would hit ground zero and areas downwind ofthat, and 80% of fallout would occur within 24 hours.Most fallout looks like grey sand or gritty ash and theradiation given off cannot be seen, smelled, tasted or feltwhich is why it is so dangerous. mass fires - any size blast would cause fires due to the intense heat, and keep in mind gas lines, chemicals andother objects just add fuel to the fires EMP - a split-second silent energy burst (like a stroke of lightning) that can fry electronics connected to wires orantennas like cell phones, cars, computers, TVs, etc.Unless electronics are grounded or hardened, NorthAmericans could experience anything from minor inter-ference to crippled power, transportation, banking andcommunications systems. And a high-altitude nuke couldaffect devices within 1,000 miles. Sizes of nukes - Nuclear weapons are measured in kilotons (KT = 1,000 tons of TNT) or megatons (MT = 1,000,000 tons of TNT). According toFEMA, the most common weapons today range from 100KT to 1MT. A 232 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325suitcase nuke or portable device would most likely be a 1KT to 10KT bomb. As fyi, the device used on Hiroshima was about a 15KT bomb. Damage estimates - Effects of a nuke depend on the size of the device and whether it's a surface blast or a high-altitude blast. The following graphicshows the effects of a 500KT surface bomb from Ground Zero (GZ) to several miles out. (Courtesy of www .radshelters4u.com and \"Nuclear Attack Environment Handbook\", FEMA - August, 1990) Please note the number of miles affected by this 500KT blast is fairly small (< 6 mile radius). Also realize a suitcase nuke or portable device used by aterrorist group would potentially be a 1KT to 10KT bomb reducing theblast zone immensely. In other words, if you are several miles away fromGround Zero your chances of survival are good if you take immediateactions to protect yourself. Map your area - An interesting website by author Graham Allison and the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs can provide a visualmap of the impact a 10KT bomb would have by entering a zip code. Checkout www .nuclearterrorism.or g/blastmaps.html MOREABOUT RADIATION Nuclear blasts create radioactive materials that emit harmful invisible rays(radiation). As the materials decay or spread out, radiation levels drop. 233 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325 Moderate damage to commercial-typebuildings Heavy damage to commercial-type buildings and equipmentEFFECTS OF 500-KT psi10 psi5 psi2 psi Miles Ground 1.1 2.2 3.6 5.81 psiLight damage to commercial-type buildings Many fires initiatedPossible fire spread? Learn more about Nuclear Blast, Thermal Pulse Effects and psi overpressure at www .radshelters4u.comDetection - You cannot see, smell, taste or feel radiation, but special instru- ments can detect even the smallest levels of radiation. After an incident, authorities will monitor levels of radioactivity to determine the potentialdanger. However, since it may take days or weeks before First Responderscould get to you, please consider purchasing detection devices for your home and Disaster Supplies Kits. Having these devices handy during a crisis or attack could save your life! survey meter - measures rate of exposure or intensity of radiation at that specific location if you stayed there for anhour ... like a speedometer in a car (cost: $300-$1,000+) dosimeter - a pen-like device you can wear that measures total dose or accumulated exposure to radiation as youmove around (needs a charger too - cost: $45-$65+ each) KFM kit - (Kearny Fallout Meter) measures radiation more accurately than most instruments since it's chargedelectrostatically. Free plans online or available as a low-cost kit ($40-$75). And a great science project for kids. Reduce exposure - Protect yourself from radioactive fallout with ... distance - the more distance between you and the fallout particles, the better shielding - heavy, dense materials (like thick walls, earth, concrete, bricks, water and books) between you and fall-out is best. Stay indoors or below ground. time - most fallout loses its strength quickly. The more time that passes after the attack, the lower the danger. T ypes of radiation - Low levels of radiation are all around us in everyday objects, but the limited exposure allows our body to heal itself so it's notdangerous. Nuclear radiation has 3 main types of radiation ... alpha - can be shielded by a sheet of paper or by human skin. If alpha particles are inhaled, ingested, or enter bodythrough a cut, they can cause damage to tissues and cells. beta - can be stopped by skin or a thicker shield (like wood). Beta particles can cause serious damage to inter-nal organs if ingested or inhaled, and could cause eyedamage or possible skin burns. gamma - most dangerous since gamma rays can penetrate the entire body and cause cell damage throughout yourorgans, blood and bones. Since radiation does not stimu-late nerve cells you may not feel anything while yourbody absorbs it. Exposure to high levels of gamma rayscan lead to radiation sickness or death which is why it iscritical to seek shelter from the fallout in a facility withthick shielding! 234 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Measuring radiation - Radiation is measured in units called roentgens (pronounced \"rent-gens\" and abbreviated as \"R\") ... or \"rads\". Radiationdetection devices measure the amount of radiation at a specific location ordisplay the total amount of radiation you've been exposed to over a periodof time. Exposure limits vary from person to person. Some people can han-dle higher amounts of rad exposure than others, but the key thing toremember is the less radiation you are exposed to the better. How many rads are bad? - High doses of radiation in a short span of time can cause radiation sickness or even death, but if that high dose is spreadout over a long period of time, it's not as bad. According to FEMA, an adult could tolerate and recover from an exposure to 150R over a week or300R over a 4-month period. But 300R over a week could cause sicknessor possibly death. Exposure to 30R to 70R over a week may cause minorsickness, but a full recovery would be expected. But ... radioactive falloutdecays rapidly so staying in a shelter with proper shielding is critical! The \"seven-ten\" rule - An easy way to estimate the decay of radioactive materials is to use the \"seven-ten\" rule. For every sevenfold increase intime after the initial blast, there is a tenfold decrease in the radiation rate.Per FEMA's \"Preparedness Planning for a Nuclear Crisis\" handbook, thebelow table shows how fast it drops from a level of 1,000 rads per hour: Hours after Fraction Level of detonation Remaining Radiation 1 ------- 1000 R / hr 7 1/10 100 R / hr 49 (2 days) 1/100 10 R / hr 346 (2 weeks) 1/1000 1 R / hr In other words, if you have shelter with good shielding and stay put for even just 7 hours ... you've really increased your chances of survival! Protect your thyroid - Slow down the absorption of radioactive iodine by taking potassium iodide (KI) . KI can be purchased over-the-counter and is known to be an effective thyroid-blocking agent. In other words, it fillsup the thyroid with good iodine that keeps radioactive iodine from beingabsorbed into our bodies. However, KI cannot protect the body fromradioactive elements other than radioactive iodine. (Learn more about KI on page 75.) A few other options to protect your thyroid include taking KIO3 or applying an iodine solution to your skin. Radiation sickness - Exposure to high levels of radiation (especially gamma rays) over a short period of time can cause severe illness or death. First symptoms - sick to stomach (nausea), puking and diarrhea can start within minutes to days after exposure.(Note: Keep in mind ... fear can cause similar symptoms.) 235 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325More serious symptoms - person may look and feel healthy for a short time, then become sick again with lossof appetite, fever, nausea, puking, diarrhea, fatigue andpossibly seizures and coma. This seriously ill stage maylast from a few hours up to several months. Skin - damage can start to show up within a few hours after exposure and include swelling, itching, and rednessof skin (like a bad sunburn). Complete healing may takeseveral weeks to a few years depending on dose received. Hair - serious exposure could cause temporary hair loss Please note, radiation sickness is not contagious so will not spread person to person. Consider storing immune-boosting supplements in your DisasterSupplies Kits to help strengthen immune system and rebuild any possible cell damage in the event you are exposed to radiation. Nuke versus dirty bomb - A nuke creates a massive blast and dangerous radiation that could spread for hundreds of miles. A radiological dispersiondevice (RDD or dirty bomb) uses explosives (like dynamite) to spread low-level radioactive materials over a small, targeted area. The bomb blast itselfmay cause more damage than the radiation. (see pages 112-116) TIPS ON SHELTERING AND SHIELDING Some communities provide 2 types of shelters for local citizens, but not all cities have them plus you may not be able to get to one during a crisis. blast shelter - specifically constructed to offer some pro- tection against blast pressure, initial radiation, heat, andfire (but realize it can't take a direct hit from a nuke) fallout shelter - can be any protected space that has walls and materials thick and dense enough to absorb radiationgiven off by fallout. (Note: we are mainly focusing on these types of shelters in this section.) Basic requirements - Whether you build a shelter in advance or throw together an expedient last-minute shelter during a crisis, the area shouldprotect you from radiation and support you for at least 2 weeks. Some basicrequirements for a fallout shelter include ... shielding ventilation water and food sanitation and first aid products radiation monitoring devices, radio, tools, etc. 236 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Shielding materials - All fallout shelters must provide good protection from radioactive particles. FEMA suggests having a minimum of several inchesof concrete or 1 to 2 feet of earth as shielding around your shelter, and themore the better. The following shows examples of shielding materials thatequal the protection of 4 inches (10 cm) of concrete ... 5 - 6 inches (12 - 15 cm) of bricks 6 inches (15 cm) of sand orgravel 7 inches (18 cm) of earth 8 inches (20 cm) of hollow concrete block 10 inches (25 cm) of water 14 inches (35 cm) of books ormagazines 18 inches (46 cm) of wood Under ground is best - Taking shelter in a basement or a facility below ground reduces exposure by 90% . Less than 4 inches (10 cm) of soil or earth can reduce the penetration of dangerous gamma rays by half . Prefab shelter - If you have bucks, time and land, there are many types of prefabricated shelters you can purchase and have buried on your property.Some have complete living quarters and come fully stocked with food andother items. Suggest you do some research and get references first though. Outside shelter - There are free books and pamphlets with instructions on building underground fallout shelters by FEMA, Cresson Kearny (authorof \"Nuclear War Survival Skills\"), Shane Connor (CEO of KI4U, Inc.) andothers. If you have a few days, tools, property you can dig down into, anddon't mind heavy labor ... check out www .oism.or g/nwss or www .ki4u.com . (Both sites describe other shelters too like lean-tos, etc.) Indoor shelter locations - If you don't have a fallout shelter you can get to safely and quickly, these options could provide protection from dangerousradiation by using shielding materials described on the next page. basement - find the corner that is most below ground level (the further underground you are the better) 1-story home / condo / apartment - if no underground facility, find a spot in center of home away from windows trailer home - find sturdier shelter if at all possible (like a basement or a brick or concrete building) multi-story building or high-rise - go to center of the middle section of the building. Note: if the rooftop of abuilding next to you is on that same floor, move one floorup or down since radioactive fallout would accumulate on rooftops. Avoid the first floor (if possible) since falloutwill pile up on the ground outside. 237 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Indoor shelter shielding - Below are some ways to build an expedient last- minute shelter in your home, apartment or workplace. Please realize thesetips are very basic things to help protect you from dangerous radiation. Set up a large, sturdy workbench or table in location you've chosen (see previous page). If no table, make oneby putting doors on top of boxes, appliances or furniture. Put as much shielding - furniture, file cabinets, appli- ances, boxes or pillowcases filled with dirt or sand, boxesof food, water or books, concrete blocks, bricks, etc. - allaround sides and on top of table, but don't put too muchweight on tabletop or it could collapse. Add reinforcingsupports, if needed. (See page 237 for shielding materials and remember, the more shielding you use, the better pro-tection you'll have from radioactive fallout.) Leave a crawl space so everyone can get inside and be prepared to block opening with shielding materials. Leave 2 small air spaces for ventilation (about 4-6\" each) - one low at one end and one high at other end. (Thisallows for better airflow since warm air rises.) If you have time and ability to do so, add more mass or shielding materials (like earth) on the floor above you.Support or brace floor from below for the added weight. Have water, detection devices, radio, food and sanitation supplies in case you have to shelter for days or weeks. V entilation - While inside a shelter you need to circulate fresh air in to reduce carbon dioxide buildup and help reduce heat. If shelter is aboveground, the natural flow of air through cracks or windows outside sheltercan help move stale warm air out, but basements and underground sheltersmay have trouble getting airflow. Some ways to improve airflow ... open a door or window - consider opening a door or win- dow in another part of house or building to improve thenatural air circulation (but don't expose yourself to falloutor high radiation levels and don't open window in shelter) air pump - by planning ahead you can purchase or make a portable pump (read App. B at www .oism.com/nwss ) directional fanning - make a strong 2-handled fan using 2 sticks (or folded cardboard) and tie or tape a piece of cloth (or 2 pieces of cardboard) between sticks to make arectangular fan. You want to push warm air out of theshelter so start with fan straight up in front of your face,then forcefully push it out and down with your arms com-pletely extended until fan is parallel with floor (aboutwaist high), pause then repeat often and as needed. 238 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Water- As mentioned throughout this manual, water is critical for survival. In addition to water tips on page 141, some more suggestions include ... Store about 1 gallon (about 4 litres) of water per person per day for drinking, cooking and sanitation. It may beweeks or months before systems can be tested or theyfunction properly so consider storing some 55-gallondrums of water in advance. Make sure all water containers have tight-fitting lids and cover supply to protect it from bacteria, bugs and dirt. Use water as extra shielding by lining cardboard boxes with 2 large trash bags and fill with water. If water contains fallout particles, filter it through several layers of clean cloth or paper towels ... or ... allow waterto stand for several hours so particles settle to the bottomof container. Only take the water off the top (be careful soyou don't stir up the settled particles), then purify it usingtips on page 141. Food, sanitation items & supplies - Please review pages 18-27 and 140-142 for suggestions and tips on gathering food, first aid items, tools, suppliesand handling sanitation during a crisis. Store enough supplies for severalweeks (or months) in your basement or shelter since services may be disrupted for quite some time after a nuke attack. Make sure you rotate supplies and test batteries every 6 months as discussed on page 27. Next we're mentioning some very basic things to think about and do BEFORE, DURING and AFTER a nuke attack (many covered in previouspages and in nuclear topic on pages 74-79). Remember ... unless you are atground zero or within a several mile radius of the blast zone (depending onthe size of the nuke, of course), there is a very high probability you willsurvive as long as you limit your exposure to the radiation, take shelter with proper shielding, and wait for the most dangerous radioactivematerials to decay. BEFORE A NUCLEAR ATTACK : Make a shelter - If you don't have a basement or underground shelter, think about how you would design a quick shelter with sufficient shielding tokeep you safe from fallout. (see previous page) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit (but expand your supplies so you have 2-4+ weeks worth on-hand.) Also double check emergency plans for schools, day caresor places family may be and where they'll go if evacuated or sheltered. 239 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Protect yourself - Review this Appendix and pages 74-79. And purchase radiation detection devices from a reputable disaster supplies company.There are a lot of devices out there that claim they will work but devicesare known to have calibration problems .. so do your homework. Protect electronics - An electromagnetic pulse could disrupt or fry systems. Unplugging devices is the best protection, but in most cases you won't getadvance warning of an EMP. Electrical and hardware stores carry ground-ing supplies, surge protectors and battery backup units. Look for thestrongest protection available, but realize electronics may still get fried.

DURING A NUCLEAR ATTACK : Don' t panic... - Try to stay calm and ... Do NOT look at flash, blast or fireball - turn away! Duck & cover .. and watch out for flying debris or fires. Be aware the 2 shock waves have the force of a tornadoand may take 30 seconds to 2 minutes to reach you. Take shelter to protect yourself from radioactive fallout. Remember ... distance , shielding and time ! Blast could create an EMP and fry electronics like cell phones, computers, cars, pacemakers, radios, etc. IF INDOORS - If near blast, stay put if home or building is not damaged. If fires are spreading, cover nose and mouth and find shelter in a basementor building further away. Then ... Close doors, windows and fireplace damper and turn off air conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakessince they can pull in air or fallout from outside. Go to an underground shelter or make an expedient shel- ter using as much shielding as possible (like furniture,appliances, books, boxes of dirt, etc.) in your basement orthe center of room or building. Grab your water, food and supplies and have radiation detection devices ready to monitor radiation levels. 240 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Keep a battery-operated radio with you to hear updates and stay inside until it is safe to go out. IF OUTDOORS - Cover mouth and nose with a cloth and take shelter immediately. Remember ... distance , shielding and time. IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows up, close vents, use \"recirculating\" air and listen to radio for updates. If possible, drive away from site. If youcan't and you are near the blast area, seek shelter from deadly fallout. Things to watch out for : fallout - looks like gray sand or gritty ash and is very radioactive the first few days so find heavy shielding fires - gas lines or chemicals may cause them to spread flying & falling objects - the blast and shock waves can shatter windows & hurl objects or body parts like missiles weak floors or stairs - be careful since they could have been weakened by blasts Listen - Turn on radio or TV (if working) to learn projected paths of fall- out or fires. Authorities will give specific instructions for people outsidethe blast zone -- some may need to evacuate ... others should take shelter. S tay or go..? - Evacuate if told to do so by local authorities ... and ... Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit . Close doors, windows and fireplace damper. Cover your mouth and nose with face mask or cloth. Keep listening to radio for evacuation routes & updates. Pets & livestock - If possible, get them indoors or in shelters, especially milk-producing animals. If fallout has already started, don't even try to save them -- it's not worth the risk. Take KI..? - If you are near the blast zone or in the projected fallout path, take your KI according to label instructions. AFTER A NUCLEAR ATTACK : Reduce exposure - Get out of the area quickly and into nearest building to reduce chances of being exposed to deadly radioactive materials.Remember ... distance , shielding and time. Things to watch out for : fallout - looks like gray sand and radiation levels can be 241 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325deadly the first few days without proper shielding. About 80% of fallout occurs within 24 hours and it can startfalling within minutes of a blast. fires - any size nuke will cause fires due to the intense heat - plus gas lines, chemicals and other objects fuel fires body parts - there may be a lot of dead bodies or body parts scattered around from the blasts weak structures - be careful since floors, stairs or walls could have been weakened by the blasts looting, guns and panicked people - be aware people may become violent trying to find loved ones, water orfood HAZMAT - watch for areas marked \"HAZMAT\" or \"radiation hazard\" and don't go there S tay put - If near the blast zone or in projected fallout path ... Close doors, windows and fireplace damper and turn off air conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakessince they can pull in air or fallout from outside. Go to an underground shelter or make an expedient shel- ter using as much shielding as possible (like furniture,appliances, books, boxes of earth, food, water, etc.) inyour basement or the center of room or building. Grab Disaster Supplies Kit , have detection devices ready to monitor radiation levels, and take KI. Keep battery-operated radio with you to hear updates (if working - EMP may knock out communications systems). Realize it may take a few days or weeks before radiation levels drop enough for people to move about safely. What .. no services? - An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) could disrupt or crash systems so you may not have access to TV or radio, phones, theInternet, ATMs, and other devices. Clean up - If you leave shelter and get exposed to fallout, remove clothes and shoes before re-entering shelter so you don't contaminate others. Rinsebody and hair but remember water may be limited. If possible, keep aponcho with a hood just outside the shelter so folks can protect head andclothing while outside. Don't bring poncho inside shelter though. W eird symptoms - Exposure to radiation may cause an upset stomach, puking or diarrhea, but fear and anxiety cause similar symptoms. A personwith radiation sickness is not contagious, but realize severe cases can belethal. (see pages 233-236) 242 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Handling a death in a shelter - If a person (or pet) dies while in a shelter, cover body with a sheet or put it in a bag (or tape several large plastic bagstogether) and move it outside the shelter. Don't try to bury it if high levelsof radiation are still in the area, but do poke several pinholes in bag sogases won't build up. Claiming a body - Hundreds or thousands of people could be killed at or near ground zero from the blast, fires and deadly radiation. Please realizethere may be a long delay before bodies could be recovered, and some maynever be found. W ater - Until water supplies can be tested, water should be filtered and purified using tips on pages 141 and 239. Make sure everyone has enoughwater to drink daily, but use it sparingly for cleaning dishes, clothes or personal hygiene. Food - If you brought perishables into the shelter, use them first (see more tips on page 140). Limit cooking during the first few days in shelter toreduce heat, and make sure you have proper ventilation when you do. Keepin mind, healthy adults can go for weeks with little or no food, so ration outsupplies in case you cannot leave the shelter for some time or have troublefinding more. Any food that was exposed to fallout should be washed first. Milk - Children and infants should drink milk made from dried or canned products until authorities can inspect cows' milk for exposure to fallout. Sanitation - All shelters should have some form of sanitation like a bucket with disinfectant or existing toilets with trash bags since plumbing may notwork. Also realize even mild forms of radiation sickness can cause pukingand diarrhea so it could get smelly in the shelter. If possible, keep smallbags around for folks to use as barf bags and have wipes or sanitizer handyto reduce the spread of germs. (see more tips on page 142) Recovery - Some emotions people may experience after an attack include shock, fear, disbelief and anger. Everyone handles trauma differently, butadversity can also bring people together. Rebuilding would be a long, slowprocess, especially if an EMP knocks out communications and bankingsystems. Once it is safe to move around outside, many volunteers will beneeded to help the area and country rebuild and recover. If more people will learn what to do during a nuclear crisis, there would be less fear and anxiety. Be aware... be prepared ... and have a plan ~ youCAN survive a nuke.

A list of acronyms used in next 6pages is included on page 250. Any County Emergency Preparedness Terrorism Emergency Operations Outline Counteractions Standard Operations Guide I. GENERAL A. Purpose The purpose of this SOG is to assist other officials and emer- gency service personnel with a working outline for developinga written set of guidelines for the conduct of antiterrorism and terrorism counteraction response operations. Contact your localemergency management agency for assistance. This outline of antiterrorism is designed to deter and limit the success of terrorists acts against government / industryresources / personnel and facilities while Counteraction facili-tates response to, and recovery from, an actual terrorist incident.The collection and dissemination of timely threat intelligenceinformation, informative public awareness programs, andthrough the implementation of sound defensive mitigationmeasures usually insure the best countermeasures one mayaccomplish. B. Authority The listing of local city, county, state or federal ordinances as may be applicable for the intended jurisdictions being protected. C. References 1. Presidential Decision Directive 39 [PDD-39], June 1995. 2. State Terrorism Incident Annexes.3. Local Community Bomb Threat Incident Plan. 244 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-43254.

Definitions A list as detailed or as brief as may be applicable to the depth of your SOG. Contact your local emergency management agencyfor assistance. E. Organizations Apply a basic organization chart for primary agencies that may be anticipated to support the various aspects of your SOG.Federal, state, city / county and local. See the local emergencymanagement agency plan. II. SITUATION A. International Terrorism International terrorism continues as a threat and although it has been primarily rooted in other countries, a great number ofAmericans have been affected by these acts. According to theU.S. Department of State and as reported in the media largenumbers of the actual terrorist attacks worldwide were targetedagainst Americans. The impact of international terrorism stillhas vivid images occurring almost worldwide. B. Domestic Terrorism Statistics provided by the FBI prior to the mid-1980's indicated only a few acts of terrorism inside the United States as influ-enced by international terrorism. Since the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York it was a clear reminder that the 245 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325United States is not immune from acts of international terrorism based within our borders. It is very clear that managing the consequences of terrorism in the United States from any source can be a most difficult and challenging task. Trying to recover from such senseless terroristevents has already begun to change the way Americans view thepotential threats and mass effect from a single terrorist act per-petr ated in local communities. C. Conditions 1. Actual events or threat of a terrorist act may cause imple- mentation of precautionary measures from as high up asPresidential sources. 2. The FBI will likely implement a crisis management law enforcement response to any significant threat or actual act of terrorism and include threat assessment / consultation and NBC / WMD Technical Assistance. 3. Incidents that occur without advance threat or warning and that produce major consequences. FEMA will prob-ably respond and implement within the FRP consequencemanagement activities. D. Planning Assumptions No single agency at any government level has the unilateral authority or all the knowledge and skills to act in a terroristevent, especially WMD / WME. The SOG will be activatedupon such threat or an actual event. Certain instances will require, as in NBC events, that perime- ters be set and closed to authorized officials and first responders as well. The SOG may also have to request activa-tion of specialty service resources and/or task forces. Yourlocal emergency management plans may assist this step. III.CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS A. Crisis Management 1. Local Law Enforcement generally has lead responsibility for implementing SOG crisis management. 246 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-43252. Each participating agency will maintain a current copy of the Terrorism Response Alert List of the SOG. 3. A systematic scene approach will often be implemented while self-protective measures as appropriate are takentowards controlling the situation. The IMS/ICS framework and possible transition into the Unified CommandSystem may be used as soon as possible. 4. Responders SITREP, staging, direction and command & control information all within often dynamic incidentevents as agencies / personnel and equipment arrive inforce. 5. Communications size-up will be CONTINUOUS in such a dynamic incident and should address scene stability inthe SOG (e.g. stable, deteriorated, continuing to deterio-rate, unsafe). 6. To avoid infrastructure gridlock, establish from the initial SITREP the priorities needed for life safety and protection.Address immediate and sequential response structuring. B. Consequence Management This level of management integrates all aspects of the response that will generally protect the public's health and safety, managefears and suffering, and enhance evidence-gathering towardsidentifying and eventually apprehending the perpetrators. Forassistance contact your local emergency management agency. 1. Pre-Incident Phase a. Protective actions such as organizational SOG's aimed at coordinating any threat in the local area viaan identified part of a Command Group. Threatcon Alpha or Bravo. b. SOG's that establish actions and security awareness measures that prepare a counter deterrence to terror-ist vulnerabilities. 2. Trans-Incident Phase a. This phase involves the threat emerging to an actual act or imminent action of terrorism. Threatcon Charlie. 247 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325b. Everyone should stay focused on the end objective to \"save lives\" and coordinate cooperative agencies'efforts SOG. 3. Post-Incident Phase a. This phase may involve an incident that occurred without any advance warning and produces majorconsequences and appears to be an act of terrorism.Many concurrent efforts of crisis management willbe initiated to establish a short-term Incident ActionPlan. b. Local officials will mitigate the situation to the best of their ability until further supported by the com-bined state and federal resources tasked. 4. Disengagement a. If no act of terrorism occurs then the federal response will disengage as coordinated. Stand down will occur for all according to their SOP's / SOG's. b. All agencies that responded will be requested to turn in a copy of their incident logs, journals, messages, or other non-sensitive records to the local coordinatingagency. This information will be key to establishing an accurate post incident critique. Critiques are often delayed pending any legal requirements to keep cer-tain information in confidence. c. PISD (post incident stress debriefings) will be offered by the proper mental health agency for responders based on the nature of event and it's circumstances. IV . RESPONSIBILITIES A. Crisis and Consequence Management 1. The County Sheriff LNO will: develop local SOG's. 2. Local Response Agencies will: develop local SOG's. 248 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325B.
