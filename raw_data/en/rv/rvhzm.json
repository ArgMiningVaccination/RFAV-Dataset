Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00935701| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : July 9, 2009 Results First Posted : September 26, 2014 Last Update Posted : April 18, 2017 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT00935701) and With Autism II| |Study Start :||July 2009| |Actual and Acupressure | In Phase 1, 10 children with ASD will receive acupressure for four weeks. At week 5, they will be introduced to acupuncture which will be continued throughout the rest of the study as tolerated. In Phase 2, 40 children with ASD will receive acupressure twice weekly for 12 weeks. Parents will be trained in the acupressure techniques and will be asked to do this daily, at bedtime, and/or as requested by the child or deemed needed by the parent. Children will begin to be assessed for their ability to participate in acupuncture treatment between weeks 5 and 7 at the discretion of the acupuncturist. By week 7, all children will have been introduced to acupuncture/needling. If needling is still refused at this time, acupressure will continue for the remainder of the study. | Device: Acupressure and Acupuncture | Acupressure involves the stimulation of specific acupoints by firm pressure, while acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles (the size of a strand of hair). The needles may be quickly inserted and removed or left in up to 5 minutes at a time. - Proportions of Children Completing Acupressure and Acupuncture Treatment. [ Time Frame: 2 months into Phase 1 ] - Change in Conners' Rating Scales [ Time Frame: Pre intervention (baseline), post intervention (8 weeks) ]The Conners' Rating Scales Revised (CRS-R) is used to assess attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as other related behavioral concerns. The CRS-R is made up of 14 scales. Analysis was done on 6 of these scales: Conners' Global Index Restless-Impulsive, Conners' Global Inattentive, DSM-IV Hyperactive-Impulsive, and DSM-IV Total. Raw scores are converted to T-scores, based on age and gender of the child. A high T-score indicates a greater number and/or frequency of reported concerns. Pre T-scores were subtracted from post T-scores to calculate the change in T-score. - Change in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire [ Time Frame: Pre intervention (baseline), post intervention (8 weeks) ]The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) assesses sleep problems common in school-age children and is comprised of eight subscales. Each item receives a score from 1 (meaning the problem occurs rarely) to 3 (meaning the problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: Bedtime Resistance: 6 to 18, Sleep Onset Delay: 1 to 3, Sleep Duration: 3 to 9, Sleep Anxiety: 4 to 12, Night Wakings: 3 to 9, Parasomnias: 7 to 21, Disordered Breathing: 3 to 9, Daytime Sleepiness: 8 to 24, and Total Disturbance (items from all scales): 33 to 99. Subscale scores from pre intervention were subtracted from post subscale scores in order to get the change in scores. - Change in Parenting Stress Index [ Time Frame: Pre intervention (baseline), post intervention (8 weeks) ]The Parenting Stress Index (PSI) was designed for parents of children ages 1:6 to 12:5 and identifies stressors in the parent-child relationship. Specifically, the PSI measures child's characteristics on six subscales, which are summed get a total score in the child domain (47 to 235). The PSI also has seven subscales that measure parent characteristics, and are summed to get a total score in the parent domain (54 to 270). The totals from the parent and child domains are summed for a total stress score (101 to 505). Higher scores indicate a higher level of stress. Pre scores were subtracted from post scores in order to get the change in scores. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

All of the ADOS-G testing sessions will be videotaped with inter-rater reliability being conducted on 20% of children tested. These videotapes will be destroyed following determination of study eligibility for those found not eligible. For those who are eligible, the videotapes will be destroyed after eligibility is determined or, for the 20% used for determining inter-rater reliability, the videotapes will be destroyed following this analysis. Parents will be asked not to start any new intervention or modification of current intervention during the study period unless deemed absolutely necessary. If such a change has to be made, the parents are requested to inform the Principal Investigator and either participation will be discontinued (without consideration as a treatment failure) or data subsequent to that point will be excluded from analyses. Exclusion Criteria: - Children who have had any significant medication or treatment change within the past four weeks prior to the beginning of the study, children who are in foster care, children with a bleeding disorder, children who are not proficient in English, children who do not have normal hearing with or without aides, and children failing to meet inclusion criteria will not be eligible for the study. If a child has a significant change in his entrance treatment program (e.g.; significant change in medication, school placement) during the study, the PI in consultation with Advisory Committee members, Dr. Rebecca Landa and Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, both autism research experts, will determine if the child is appropriate to remain in the study. Parents who are not proficient in English will not be included in the study.
