Thousands of you donated and wore your Forget Me Not Appeal badge throughout May, and over 1,000 people volunteered to help with bucket collections! It was moving and inspiring to see who you wore your badge for, with many people adding their own messages to our online dedication page - see alzheimerssociety.dedicationpage.org/forgetmenotappealNews Directions After May's Forget Me Not Appeal and Dementia Action Week, our next focus here at Team Alzheimer's is involvement. We're changing how we involve people living with dementia so they have a bigger role in everything we do. In July, we'll celebrate how far we've come and inspire much more. See p12 for me being interviewed about this by Joy, who's been very active in this area. You'll also see an example of how we're involving people in the next magazine, which is being co-produced with a panel of people affected by dementia. With new drug breakthroughs underlining the importance of diagnosis, the \u00a35 million we've just been awarded from the People's Postcode Lottery's Dream Fund is especially ground-breaking. Together with Alzheimer's Research UK, we'll use this to research a simple blood test for the NHS that we hope will detect Alzheimer's in its early stages. I'm also massively proud that Alzheimer's Society has made it into the Sunday Times Best Places to Work for 2023! We couldn't do what we do without the commitment, skills and talent of our incredible people. Want to join us? Then have a look for opportunities to work or volunteer with us at jobs.alzheimers.org.uk Kate Lee, Chief Executive Officer @KateLeeCEO Promising drug results Early trial results show that a new drug, donanemab, slows the progression of Alzheimer's symptoms by 36%. This is compared to 27% with the other recent breakthrough drug, lecanemab. Promisingly, the trial also showed a 40% slowing in the loss of abilities to do everyday activities such as driving, doing hobbies and managing finances. Richard Oakley, our Associate Director of Research, said, 'After 20 years with no new Alzheimer's drugs, we now have two potential new drugs in just 12 months.' We'll need to see the full results to understand how donanemab might help when taken over time. If approved for use in the UK, it's likely to only be available for people in the early stages of Alzheimer's. 'We can't end up in a situation where there are new drugs being approved but people can't get access to them early in their dementia journey when they work best,' said Richard. 'We need more accurate, earlier dementia diagnosis in the NHS.' 5People at recent Society events in Wales, Northern Ireland and England have agreed what needs to change to improve dementia diagnosis rates. People living with dementia came together with clinicians and academics at a series of round-table events. They signed consensus statements about key barriers to good quality, timely and accurate diagnosis. They call for ways to return diagnosis rates to pre-pandemic levels, such as redesigning dementia diagnosis pathways and preparing for new disease-modifying treatments. See alzheimers.org.uk/campaign This year's Dementia Hero Awards took place at the Grand Hotel in Birmingham in April. The awards were co-produced with people affected by dementia, and we'd like to thank all our winners, finalists, judges and everyone who helped us celebrate! Find out about all the winners at alzheimers.org.uk/dementiaheroawards Dementia Hero Awards Our councillor network We need your help to involve newly elected councillors, mayors and chairpersons following May's local elections across Northern Ireland and much of England. We want them to join the Alzheimer's Society Councillor Network, which provides briefings and events to educate and inform locally elected representatives. This is important because they play a key role in shaping local dementia care and support services. The Society can assist councillors with up-to-date dementia information and statistics for their local area. We also provide them with information and recommendations about improving services. Make sure your local representatives know they can join the network by emailing local@alzheimers.org.uk Diagnosis consensus Awards host Marverine Cole and members of our people with dementia panel Joy Watson, Hilary Doxford and Chris Maddocks.

On top of that, both depression and heart disease are known to increase a person's risk of dementia. This may sound a bit worrying, but findings from a recent Society-funded study provide some hope. The researchers looked into how talking therapies in a real-world setting could affect the risk of heart disease. They studied people with depression who were supported through a programme now called NHS Talking Therapies. They found that therapy didn't only improve mental health. People with depression who had therapy were also less likely to develop heart disease. The study showed the reduction in heart disease risk was similar to that of a low fat or low carbohydrate diet. The research didn't look at how therapy for people with depression impacted their dementia risk. But, since talking therapies helped reduce two risk factors for dementia, it's likely they may decrease dementia risk too. More research is needed to understand the potential link between talking therapies and dementia risk.

These are needed to manage someone else's finances and property on their behalf. We're working with the Office of the Public Guardian to address the problems behind this backlog. We still encourage people to make LPAs and to register them straight away rather than waiting to do this later. Helen Quinn, Senior Knowledge Officer, says, 'There's a risk that the person loses mental capacity to manage their finances between making the LPA and it being registered. They may still be able to manage their money in the interim, but this isn't always the case and we do hear of families in difficult situations.' If you're facing delays, alternatives could include applying for appointeeship, appealing directly to a bank, paying bills such as care fees directly and recouping the amount later, or applying to the Court of Protection in urgent cases.

The three-day retreat, in Birmingham, was co-produced with a steering group of people affected by dementia. Prompted by a review that we commissioned into how we involve people, attendees looked at how we can increase the amount of true co- production that we do. 'These events are, without doubt, very important because the recipients know best what they need and therefore, if their voices are heard, it can only help and serve to improve the services,' says Trevor Salomon, an attendee whose wife has dementia. Week of action We used this year's Dementia Action Week, from 15-21 May, to once again focus on the importance of getting a dementia diagnosis. During last year's campaign, we saw a 43% average increase in calls to our support line from people seeking information and support. Increasing diagnosis rates is such a vital issue that we addressed this again, with ads to help people understand dementia symptoms and how to get help. We also promoted our symptoms checklist to help people when talking about possible dementia symptoms, and produced new materials for healthcare professionals.

Carol, who has Alzheimer's, was the first person to respond to a call over 30 years ago to take part in research that would help establish how the condition can be inherited. Since then, she and her husband Stuart have travelled the world advocating for further dementia research. Sarah was on our Board of Trustees for nine years and played an inspiring role in our response to the pandemic.

Some benefits are not only worth getting in themselves, but act as 'passports' to other help. For example, getting Attendance allowance or Personal independence payment could mean you're also entitled to Support for mortgage interest or Council tax exemption. Similarly, more people will be eligible for Pension credit now, and getting just \u00a31 of this means you could also receive full Council tax support or the next Cost of living payment.

Its members - currently numbering over 80,000 - have shared 1.8 million posts since 2003. One remarked, 'I wish I had discovered Talking Point much sooner than last year, as it helped me hugely since then over a very difficult time. Here's to the next 20!' To join Talking Point, see forum.alzheimers.org.ukHelp with costs Our services - your views The people using our services have said they're extremely likely to recommend them to others, and most felt less isolated and more able to cope because of our support. Nearly 3,000 people who we supported between April 2021 and March 2022 gave us feedback about our services. Respondents were keen for more face-to-face services return. Don' t miss...

During the match, the names on one in three Lionesses' shirts were missing, representing how many of us born in the UK today will develop dementia. Over \u00a324,000 was raised from donations, a prize draw and an online auction of memorabilia. As The Football Association's official charity partner, we're supporting players and fans who have been devastated by dementia.

However, she grew up in Hampshire's New Forest and has fond childhood memories of time outdoors. 'We had a little beach called Goatee, in Totton where I lived,' Gill recalls. 'As kids we used to go and swim in the mud, opposite Southampton Docks. 'When I got older, I used to cycle and climb up deer towers and make a lot of noise and wonder why we couldn't see any deer! 'Back in the days, a \"clip\" round the head was normal,' says Gill, 'It was suggested by the consultant that diagnosed me that my dementia could be linked to continuous blows to the head.' As a teenager, Gill moved along the coast to Bournemouth and then to Amesbury. 'I've lived in quite a few places,' Gill explains. 'Amesbury is near Stonehenge, so I used to walk there and sit amongst the stones. It wasn't fenced in at that point. 'When I got married, my husband and I moved to a little village called Mowsley in Leicestershire.' After they separated, Gill moved to nearby Market Harborough, where she stayed for 30 years. 'It suited me, it's a nice little town,' she says, 'But I knew I was having problems with my memory at that point, because my daughter kept telling me, \"You need to go and see someone.\"' Diagnosis delays Gill spoke to a doctor about her memory problems but wasn't prepared for how long it would take to find out the cause. 'I told my doctor, \"There's something wrong.\" I said, \"It's not just not remembering, it's blank.\"' Gill completed some memory tests and was referred to a consultant. At this point she moved out of the area and says she was 'forgotten about for two years'. 'I sold my house and bought a canal boat,' Gill says. 'I was fed up struggling and needed a change. I'd spent a bit of time on somebody's narrowboat, and I thought, \"I love this. I could do this.\"' Gill didn't hesitate when buying her new floating home. 'Water is quite important to me,' she explains, 'This narrow boat just felt right.'Finding home Quick read Gill Taylor, in County Durham, is unashamed of her dementia and determined to support others. Gill was diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer's when she was 58 after delays where she felt 'forgotten about'. Now 70, Gill lived in many places across England before making Seaham her home five years ago. A lack of local activities for people with dementia prompted Gill to start an arts group called Let's Meet Up.Gill Taylor lives with young-onset dementia in County Durham. Gill tells Jessica Hubbard how she got there and why she founded an arts group to help others. Traumatic brain injuries - caused by a blow or jolt to the head - may increase your risk of developing dementia. More research is needed to understand the difference made by the type of injury, or by how often and when it happens. Not everyone who experiences head injuries will develop dementia, and many other factors - such as age, genetics and lifestyle - also affect your dementia risk. For our Risk factors for dementia (450) factsheet, see alzheimers.org.uk/publications or call 0300 303 5933.9 910Total blanks Despite the new start, Gill's memory problems started interfering with work. 'I was working at the YMCA with homeless young people,' she says. 'I'd have a support meeting one day and the next day I would have no memory of them. I was having total blanks.' Thanks to her fast typing, Gill was able to keep accurate records, but she was anxious about forgetting important details. 'We had a new tenant, a 16-year- old with mental health problems,' says Gill. 'I thought, \"What if I forget to tell the night staff to knock on their door and make sure they're okay?\" It was stressing me out something terrible.' Gill was signed off work and, after more tests, diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer's in 2012, still in her late 50s. 'I was in such shock,' she said, 'It's the last thing I ever thought of.' At this time Gill had been married to her new husband for a year and was worried about his reaction. Gill says her husband became abusive, which forced her to sell her canal boat and move to retirement housing in Newbury, Berkshire. 'I wanted to go down that way because my mother had vascular dementia and I felt I ought to be there,' Gill explained.Travel and change Gill enjoys travelling and recalls one trip to Alaska with her daughter Claire. 'Alaska is one of the best places,' says Gill, 'The Inside Passage is just beautiful. We ended up taking a glass-top train to Fairbanks and then we travelled to Seattle.' While in Seattle Gill became separated from her daughter, who was staying with a friend. 'There was an APB missing person alert out on me at one point because I got lost,' Gill said. A cab driver helped Gill find her phone in a restaurant she'd forgotten the name of. 'The phone had low battery,' said Gill, 'So I got just one call.' Gill and her daughter were eventually reunited in a busy marketplace. 'My daughter's face was like thunder, and only now can we laugh about it,' Gill says. 'You've got to find yourself funny or you're gonna be pretty miserable! Often the words come out wrong for me or I'll go out with my dress on back to front and inside out. 'I shall probably laugh about my dementia till the day I go.' When Gill's parents died, she inherited some money and decided to move. 'Because I've moved about a bit, I've never felt anywhere was home,' she said. 'I couldn't afford to return to the New Forest - unless I won the lottery!' My friend's like my memory,' says Gill, 'We speak most days and I'm fortunate to have a friend that will come with me to appointments because there's no way on earth I'd remember what anybody said. Gill on holiday with Claire11 Gill had once been on holiday to Durham and fell in love with the area, so she decided to make it her home five years ago. Arts and crafts Gill started a dementia arts group called Let's Meet Up, because there wasn't much for people with dementia to do locally. 'I feel it's such an important group,' says Gill, 'The pleasure that people get from it is just great. 'We have one couple that comes and the lady can't communicate very well but her husband, who does the art with us, says she just wants to be there. It warms my heart to think that he has somewhere he can talk to other people.' The group recently tried batik - a fabric printing technique originally from Indonesia - using wax, dye and everyday objects to make patterns. Gill tries her hardest to keep the group going, but admits her dementia symptoms can be a challenge. 'Twenty years ago I could have run the group with my eyes closed, but these days I struggle with the confidence to do absolutely anything,' she says. Too difficult Gill describes herself as gregarious but doesn't go out as much as she used to with friends. She puts this down to her dementia and a knee injury. 'I damaged my knee seven months ago and don't venture outdoors unless I go shopping,' she says. 'I hate shopping! I get times where I can't cope with too many people talking and I'll switch off because it's just too difficult. I go to the art group and that's it.' Until three years ago Gill used to review books, but now struggles to do so. Her vision has been affected too. 'For 12 years I've sounded perfectly normal, and for a lot of those 12 years I felt like a fraud because I felt like I'd not got dementia enough,' Gill says. 'There are gaps in my vision. I almost can't put into words how this part of dementia affects me because there's a lack of awareness that dementia affects people differently.' Contrary to her initial diagnosis, Gill has now been told she may have a rarer type of dementia rather than Alzheimer's. She's undergoing more tests to find out. 'Whether they'll give me a specific diagnosis I don't know,' says Gill. 'Mum needs me' Although Gill misses meeting friends for a drink at her local, she has support from a good friend and from Claire. 'My friend's like my memory,' says Gill, 'We speak most days and I'm fortunate to have a friend that will come with me to appointments because there's no way on earth I'd remember what anybody said.' Claire also visits her regularly. 'At first, Claire struggled with the diagnosis,' says Gill, 'But over the last 12 years she has finally come to terms with it. She spends two or three months a year staying with me. 'If we go anywhere, she takes the lead. Like when we're abroad at an airport passport control and they want only you, she'll step in and say, \"Actually Mum has dementia and needs me here.\"' Unashamed passion Gill thinks a 'radical overhaul' is needed to improve life for people with dementia. 'I do get a bit passionate about anything dementia,' she says, 'It makes me angry that there's not enough funding or real education. 'I don't think that's for lack of trying - I think it's people thinking that it doesn't affect them.' Peer support groups can be a great resource, says Gill, who is unashamed of her diagnosis. 'I'm not ashamed of dementia,' she says, 'I'll tell anybody and everybody I've got dementia. Just because I've got dementia doesn't mean to say that I'm not the same as anybody else.' \u00a330 provides two hours' support from a dementia adviser, ensuring people like Gill have access to essential help and advice.

Joy: I'd like to start by saying, I'm interested to know if you've been interviewed by someone living with dementia before? Kate: I have Joy and, strangely, it was you! In Manchester, a little short while ago, when we were very lucky to meet with Andy Burnham, the metro mayor. Not often enough, I should say - it's something I would love to do more of.Joy: It's my understanding that there are plans to help people affected by dementia to get more involved with different aspects of the Society. How do you see your role in bringing this about? Kate: We talk a lot about ensuring that we hear the voices of people with dementia across the organisation, but I was really keen to push further than that and really encourage us to not only consult with people with dementia, but really involve them in everything we do. So, having people on project teams and part of the design of our services. And running some of our services - we've got three incredible gentlemen in Essex, all three with dementia, who are running a service.Joy: That sounds really encouraging for someone like myself who's living with dementia. To hear that makes me quite excited actually. Kate: I just think there's a lot further the organisation could go in pushing ourselves. I'd love to see us employing more people with dementia onto our staff teams. It's a really exciting time to bring, ultimately, the people that the organisation is here for into the fold. I think I'm driving everybody mad at the moment, because every time anybody asks me anything or shows me anything, my first response is - have people with dementia been involved in how this has been set up? What did they say when you designed it? How are they being involved on the day? Joy: How do you intend to help people affected by dementia to be a part of this venture? I think we've homed in on co-design and co-production? Kate: They can sound a bit jargony, but for me, co-design is where we're looking at the things we're doing - at our new services or what we campaign on or what does our brand look like - right from the start. Sitting down as equal partners with people with dementia and saying, 'What works?', 'What do you think?', 'We're trying to achieve this - is there a better way of doing it?' Co-production is a way of us setting the organisation up so that you really can't do something without involving people with dementia.Involving you Joy Watson asks Kate Lee, our CEO, how we're involving more people living with dementia in Alzheimer's Society's work. 13I'd certainly like to put at least one more person with dementia on the board. It's a big responsibility and it's a lot for Chris to be the only voice of someone with dementia on the board. A really simple example would be building into our protocols of how we recruit a new member of staff that someone with dementia has to be involved. Or, when we review how well something has gone, having it built into that process that people with dementia will audit those and be supported to review those, or even write them for us. Joy: Quite often out there, people get sidestepped and don't feel useful and valued. But I think what the Society is promoting is that we can feel that, after a diagnosis, it's not the end of the road. Yourself and the teams involving us means so much. Kate: I think that's true and, if you think about all our brilliant fundraisers and supporters, they're not giving money to Alzheimer's Society. They're giving money to people with dementia or for researchers to find a cause. So, unless we can demonstrate to them that people with dementia are really involved in the organisation, we're not being transparent, we're not being honest about the way the organisation works. We want to show we're having an amazing impact, we are making a difference. I could say that a million times over - it's not as powerful as you saying it, Joy, and that's what matters. Joy: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we now have a person living with dementia on the Board of Trustees. Are there any plans to extend this - on the board or in other parts of the organisation?Kate: We have, we've got Chris Maddocks, who was recruited as a trustee last September. Chris has been living with her diagnosis for some while now and has both vascular and Lewy body dementia. I'd certainly like to put at least one more person with dementia on the board. It's a big responsibility and it's a lot for Chris to be the only voice of someone with dementia on the board. I would like us to have at least two people on that. But we're also involving people in our committees - we've got people on our finance committee, audit committee - and on lots of our major projects. We're putting in a new finance system at the moment and we've got Pete Middleton advising on that. That's been hugely helpful because if people with dementia aren't helping us put that finance system in, they're not pushing us to think about simplicity. Joy: Yeah, and I think that benefits the Society and it benefits us as well, because we can use the skills that we've learned. Kate: It is incredible, you've all had big busy lives before your diagnosis and we need those skills. We need you! Joy: I'm sure you would agree, we all need to be needed, whether you're the CEO of a large organisation, or someone helping out at their local dementia cafe. For me, it's all about belonging and feeling valued.Find out how you can use your experience to help shape our work - visit alzheimers.org.uk/ dementiavoice or call 0330 333 0804.Month of Celebration This July will be a monthlong celebration of how Alzheimer's Society is involving more people with lived experience of dementia in even more ways. We're co-producing more in everything we do, bringing people with lived and learnt experience together in equal partnerships. Keep an eye out for more opportunities to get involved!14Last April, I cycled 1,370 miles between Land's End and John o' Groats via the four corners of mainland Britain. This is equivalent to cycling from Dover to Tangier and took me the best part of 28 days. I had only done two cycle trips with overnight stays before. The latest one was like Land's End to John o' Groats on steroids! Top of the pops I consulted my family about which charity to support and Alzheimer's Society was top of the pops. Dementia affected my mother- in-law, two of my aunts and my uncle. People don't talk about it, yet everybody seems to know at least one person that's been affected. We need to work hard and fund research to find a cure. In the meantime, it's important we don't forget the people that need help right now. Planning and training I was 49 when I started the trip, so felt it was important to be flexible and free of injuries. I didn't really do much until three months before departure. I focused on my core, saddle work and lots of stretching. I also played badminton to improve my lateral movement. That was a disaster because I dislocated my knee three weeks before starting. I knew I was starting at Land's End and would end in John o' Groats via Lizard Point, Ness Point, Ardnamurchan Lighthouse and Dunnet Head. Everywhere in between was in the lap of the gods. I knew where I was sleeping on the first and second nights, but nothing was planned thereafter. Pretty special It's quite nice not having a fixed schedule as it could become out of date almost immediately. You don't know what you're going to encounter - bad weather, an injury, a beautiful spot that you want to spend more time in. The PT sessions before I'd left were the most physically challenging part! Although Cornwall is very lumpy. In Rannoch Moor, Scotland, it was just so cold, windy and wet - it was as if I'd entered a freezing shower fully clothed. On the way down my hands froze. I thought, 'My goodness, my hands aren't working.' Fortunately, adrenaline kicked in before I came to harm. Seeing the crystal-clear water of our native chalk streams was awesome and visiting Glen Etive, made famous by the James Bond film Skyfall, was pretty special. People's generosity My fundraising target was \u00a31,000,000. My logic was that if I didn't make it in one piece, the chances were that I'd make national news at which point I'd have a better chance of reaching my target! Ultimately, I finished the journey fairly intact and raised over \u00a315,000. The best part was people's generosity. I talked to many different people on the way and told them about Alzheimer's Society's work. Many donated or offered board and lodgings. I hope my trip inspires someone to do something similar for charity.Four corners Marcus Watson in Farnham, Surrey, tells us about his epic cycling challenge.

We have been meeting every fortnight at Omagh Library, where I am a library assistant, since September. Paul: Since my diagnosis in 2016, I've been supporting others and working to tackle the stigma surrounding dementia. This includes regular meetings with a Dementia NI Empower and Support group. During the pandemic the meetings had to be moved online to Zoom. But then when we got back together, the meetings were only once a month. The members thought that a month was too long for people with dementia to not be in contact with anybody so I asked Tina if we could set something up at the library. Tina: COVID put a lot of things on the back burner so when the library was back up and running, I approached my line manager Julie Gibson, and she was happy to provide a space. That's how Memory Lane came about. Memory Lane meetings are informal drop-ins where people come together and chat over a cup of tea or coffee. Members come along in the early afternoon, but I give them half an hour to talk among themselves before I come in. Dementia is put on the back burner. As far as we're concerned, we're just a normal group of people getting together in the library and reminiscing. A variety of organisations have been invited to talk at Memory Lane, including the War Memorial Museum in Belfast, local police and the fire service. During a recent session, Memory Lane members were told they could access free magazines and newspapers through the library. They were delighted. One of the members said it was great because the price of magazines now makes them a luxury for her. Before we started the group, we didn't know many people. Not all of the members come every fortnight, but most do, with some travelling 40 miles. Now I know quite a few of them. Paul: I like to help other people in the same boat as myself and reassure them that dementia is not the end of the world - you'll always have a life besides dementia. I know one fella who was diagnosed a couple of months after me who couldn't accept it. He was always saying, 'Why me?' That's why I like to get out and about and talk to people. My goal really is to help other people, some of whom are maybe at the start of their journey.

For example, I have a chair that my cat scratched the arm on but the chair itself was perfectly fine, so I covered the damaged arm with embroidered flowers and now it looks much better. I feel I have put my stamp on my home instead of someone else's style. Gill Lewis, Cheshire I enjoy the before and after of doing a room up, improving the flow, atmosphere and purpose of a room, and it enables me to relax in the evenings when my jobs are done. It keeps me organised, busy and purposed, calms me when the house is tidy and neat. Keith Gibbs, Tyne and Wear I do painting, varnishing, wallpapering and basic carpentry as and when I find time. I get some satisfaction from the results, even if they may not be to professional standard. I can put my own stamp on decorating details, eg designs on doors. I try to recycle or upcycle items of furniture, use odd bits of timber for shelves, and feel I am making use of material that would otherwise have gone to landfill. Steve Belcher, Bristol I like to style my home with art from TV shows or stars of the past - I've art of Mrs Slocombe, Victoria Wood, June Whitfield etc. I have long-term health issues which mean I can no longer work so, once I bought a new apartment, I decided I wanted to decorate and style it with things that make me happy from my youth. I get great pleasure from searching online for items, and it makes me feel happy, nostalgic and relaxed in my home when my health is bad. Rebecca Morris, Conwy I like to refresh areas and make them a focal point. It changes the look of the room, it doesn't cost much and it's easy to do. So, I might clear a shelf and add a pretty candle, or swap around my photos in frames so I'm seeing a different picture, or even buy a new plant. I like to change the look every season. I send a picture to my dad for feedback - as I live far away, it's nice he can see a part of my home. Liz Gibson, Dumfries and Galloway My husband and I have renovated a stone cottage and learned a lot of different skills while doing it. We have exposed stone walls, learned to lime mortar, cut oak lintels and fully renovated the house and garden. I keep fit from it and it gives great satisfaction - also a good night's sleep.Home improvements We ask people about how they keep well, whether they have dementia or not. This issue, we hear about DIY and improving your home. Some things that affect your chance of developing dementia are things you can't change, like your age and genes. However, you can keep your mind and body active, enjoy healthier food, not smoke, drink less alcohol, stay in touch with people and deal with any health problems. If you already have dementia, the same things can help you to stay well.

Friends - I don't see them very often. I think they think that I'm going to have a meltdown every time someone talks to me. It's not that they're being nasty, I just think they're worried they'll say something wrong. It's a shame because we get lonely and want to be out and about in the community just like we always were. We need a little bit of help, but I don't think it's communicated widely that yes, if you've got dementia, you can still have a life. What would you take to your desert island? A Bernard Cornwell book because he's brilliant - and my sister. Bernard Cornwell writes fiction but it's based on history, so I learn while I read. Then an ice cream van on the beach so I can have a Whippy. How has Alzheimer's Society helped you? You've helped a lot, particularly my Dementia Adviser. It was nice just to have somebody to talk to in the beginning - to have a voice when I felt I didn't know what was going on. It gave me the confidence to go through my dementia journey. What song or tune sums up your life so far? You've Got a Friend in Me by Randy Newman. I've had some fabulous friends, and I try to help the people a little bit further on in their dementia journeys as much as I can.What single thing would improve your quality of life? To move out of this house. It's huge with an expansive garden which has gone Pete Tong now. I came here thinking, 'Oh yeah, I can do that,' and now I can't. If I moved, I would stay in the same area because I wouldn't want to start all over again with new support workers. If you could go back in time, where would you go? I would go back to when I was about five years old and my sister and myself were doing horse riding lessons. I remember Brownie, the first horse I learned to ride, and my mum and my dad being there. Of course, there were other people around, but I don't see them - I just see my family having a good time. That's a precious memory. What is your most treasured possession? My mum gave me a blue glass pendant and it has a rhyme on it about the relationship between mother and daughter. It's very personal and precious to me.

The main reason behind my choice to enter the neurodegenerative disease field was that my grandmother Flora was affected by dementia in the last years of her life. So, I decided to apply all the expertise that I have acquired so far to the fight against dementia. How has Alzheimer's Society supported your work? As an Alzheimer's Society funded researcher, I was supported in many ways such as by being invited to participate in the annual Society retreat. This was a great opportunity to meet other researchers who work in the same field to exchange experiences and build a network of collaboration. What are you currently working on? I am currently studying the formation and accumulation of protein aggregates within the brain. We see the build-up of certain types of protein in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, and this interferes with how well the cells of the brain can work. I'm studying how this build-up can be influenced by changes in the size of the spaces between the brain cells.What difference do you hope this will make? I hope that, with my investigation, we'll start to understand more clearly the mechanisms underpinning the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. The end goal is to improve the lives of people affected by this disease. In what direction would you like to take your research in future? I would like to apply my findings to other neurodegenerative diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia.

Full Circle - Harry Filmer, Deke Thompson, Len McCormick, Paul Murray and Nevin Robinson - were inspired to host their sixth charity gig because of the impact dementia has had on their own lives. Nevin said, 'Alzheimer's Society is a cause close to our hearts, as one of the members of our band, Harry, sadly lost his wife Vi to Alzheimer's disease. 'I'm proud that our efforts will help Alzheimer's Society be there for more people affected by dementia and create a lasting change.' In addition to ticket sales and a raffle on the night, funds were topped up by a \u00a33,000 donation from local contemporary jewellery company Argento. Rebecca Neill, Community Fundraiser at the Society, said, 'Last year, Alzheimer's Society services were used over 4.2 million times and people tell us this support is a real lifeline. 'Thanks to the generous support of fundraisers like Full Circle and Argento, we can be there as a vital source of support and a powerful force for change for everyone affected by dementia.'Atlantic row A supporter in Manchester has completed a 3,000-mile rowing expedition across the Atlantic in aid of the Society. Neil Lomas, 56, set off on the 43-day journey earlier this year, rowing from Tenerife to Antigua. There were 11 other rowers accompanying Neil, all living on a tiny 12-metre boat called Roxy. Neil completed the challenge in memory of his late father, Brian. 'Dad had Alzheimer's in his later life, but as a young man he was really involved in sports,' says Neil. 'He played football and cricket for his town in Stoke-on-Trent and, when he went into the navy, he was captain of the football team. He then became rowing coach at Derby School. As a submariner he sailed over and under many of the world's seas and oceans.' Neil remembers Alzheimer's making everyday tasks difficult for his father, which motivated him to complete the rowing challenge. 'It was mentally, physically and psychologically unlike anything I've undertaken,' he says. Neil has raised more than \u00a314,000 so far. He hopes to raise even more by giving presentations to businesses and groups.

'Our crews support the whole community and awareness sessions are an important part of the role of a firefighter,' says Jay Crouch, Safeguarding Lead and Firesetter Officer. 'We are committed, as a member of the blue light services, for all our personnel, cadets and volunteers to undertake dementia awareness training. 'As a service, we are the first point of contact for people living with dementia and their families. We are then in a position to support and connect them with services including Alzheimer's Society, Admiral Nurses and social services.' The service will soon launch a new safety booklet to help support people affected by dementia. This includes tips for fire safety in the home and information about the Herbert Protocol - an initiative encouraging people to gather useful information together so that, if a vulnerable person goes missing, it can be shared quickly and easily. Firefighter friends21Why dementia, why the Society? My lovely mum Gill was diagnosed with dementia 10 years ago. It was a struggle to find the right support for her - first in her own home and then in a care home. It was such an awful experience for our family that I wanted to help others have a better journey. How to fill an unexpected day off? An impromptu trip to London. I love musical theatre so I would catch a West End show. Tickets can be eye- wateringly expensive, but you can get some great deals on the day if you're flexible. I recently got a front row seat for Mary Poppins for \u00a320 before the wind changed and it flew out of the West End! There are also some great dementia-friendly performances. My favourite was a 'relaxed' performance of White Christmas. It was lovely to take my mum because she enjoys a good sing-along. Proudest moment? I appeared on BBC Breakfast in March to talk about the support available post diagnosis. It was my first in- person television interview so to hear that I came across as calm and empathic was gratifying. Calls to our support line doubled that day and there was an 800% increase in website hits. People don't always realise support is out there, so the fact that I was able to help them made me very proud. Worst advice you've been given? If you run out of dishwasher tablets, use washing-up liquid instead - a mistake I only made once! A previous manager once said to me, 'Winners never quit, stick to the plan and everything will be OK.' That was horrible advice. Identifying when you need to change track or quit is how you progress. I didn't follow the advice, instead proposing some sensible alternatives. Biggest priority for coming months? Supporting my team and working with partners to change dementia pathways to reflect local needs. This is critical for us to deliver support in an equitable way. It also ensures the Society is not perpetuating existing health inequalities. No one should feel that our resources, tools and support are inaccessible. Most important thing learned from a person with dementia? Celebrate the moments when they happen. Being told by a person with dementia to slow down and appreciate what is right in front of me was such simple yet brilliant advice. I've used this with my mum by celebrating a hand hold, a small smile or tapping her foot to a beloved song. I've also used this at work, recognising that change doesn't happen all at once and small successes are worth celebrating. Most looking forward to? Workwise, I'm looking forward to seeing how we continue to deliver our Help and Hope strategy. We have a real opportunity to change how we deliver support and raise awareness of our research. Outside of work, I'm looking forward to turning 50 and going to Disneyland Paris. My late dad designed the original benches, so it will be nice to see the legacy of his beloved carpentry work in person.Spotlight Paul Reynolds, Associate Director of Commercial and Partnerships.

Margaret Rooke meets a bereaved son who has no regrets about his choices. Quick read Jonathan Knight was only 20 when his late mum was diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer's. He and Christine had always been a team of two, and he halted his career to look after her full time. They found support and friendship through YODA, a group in south London, but Christine died suddenly early this year. Jonathan recognises there isn't one right decision for everyone, but he's glad he made the choices he did. 23Most 20-year-olds are out with their friends, searching out partners, focused on university or finding a job they love. Not Jonathan Knight. He was just 20 when his mother, Christine, was diagnosed at 54 with young-onset Alzheimer's. And at 20, he made the decision that his mum would always come first. Until she died, just two years later, he cared for her around the clock. Christine had been a single parent. For Jonathan, he and his mum had always been a team of two and he wasn't going to let any illness stand in the way. 'I don't think most of my friends would have been able to cope at our age,' he says, 'But I'd been brought up dealing with hardship and getting on with it so it's something I know.' Joy and support Christine had come to England from Jamaica when she was young. Life was hard at the start, and she struggled to make a living for herself, working out which job she would be good at. When she was 35, she gave birth to Jonathan. Another source of joy was finding she was an excellent carer for older people - in fact, she'd pop in to see some of those who'd been in her care until just before she died. Looking back, Jonathan remembers Christine as a wonderful mum. 'She always put me first and gave me all I needed. She took care of priorities. 'From very early on she put all her qualities into me. I inherited them from her. She was very organised, very clean and tidy. As well as being kind and polite, there was an innocence about her, she was quiet and discreet, almost fairy-like. 'I was happy. Mum made me happy. I was supportive, helping her with cleaning and tidying. At one point she was stressed because the landlord was hassling her for rent that she couldn't pay. 'I was only nine or 10 and I went to court with her to help her deal with the situation. I was her main support and there was no hiding from these difficulties.' Gradual but rapid Just four years ago, Christine began to be more forgetful. 'She noticed the changes, not me,' says Jonathan. 'She kept asking me the same questions two or three times and I'd say to her, \"I already answered that, Mum.\"' When Christine was diagnosed at London's King's College Hospital, Jonathan was shocked. He saw his mum as still perfectly fine, just forgetting little bits of information and conversation here and there. He remembers picking her up in his car and thinking, 'But there's nothing wrong with you.' He describes the progression of her condition as both gradual and rapid at the same time. 'It was moving at a fast rate, but the daily changes were small. Each day she was doing less and less and less. I became used to it and the progress gave me time to adjust. It was a pace that allowed me to understand.' Jonathan realised the true significance of her illness when she started asking him to take her home and she was already there. 'That's when it sunk in,' he says. 'I said, \"Mum, you are at home,\" and tried to reassure her. Just like when we went to court when we couldn't pay the rent, I had no time to get emotional about it. I was just there to support her.' Focus on Mum Before this, Jonathan had been to college and studied business and economics. He'd started a successful career, working both as a BMW vehicle technician and as an apprentice in electrical engineering. A year and a half into his mum's diagnosis, he halted his career to look after her. 'I knew that if she was put into a care home, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night,' he says. 'I decided to focus on Mum while she was with me. I would rather miss out on some of my career. During that time Mum came first and my life came afterwards.'I knew I would lose her eventually,' says Jonathan, 'But I thought by the time Mum passed away, she would be in her 70s. I didn't expect it would happen at 56. 24 His years as a carer were hard work, but he valued them. 'I did everything for her. We didn't have outside carers until five months before she died. Then they would come for 20 minutes in the morning and 45 minutes in the afternoon. 'We never knew when they'd arrive. When they got to us, they'd say, \"Do you need anything?\" but I would have already done everything. I preferred to wash her than let them do that. I knew her better than them.' Friends at YODA Whenever Jonathan needed help, YODA - Young Onset Dementia Activists, a group set up by Bromley, Lewisham & Greenwich Mind - was ready to step in to give him support. Christine had begun shouting and hallucinating. Sometimes she'd leave the home, meaning Jonathan and the police had to search the streets for her. This was exhausting and terrifying, and eventually YODA organised respite care to give Jonathan a break. This ended up lasting three months, longer than anyone wanted, but once she was back home, Jonathan brought Christine back to YODA. She never forgot her friends. The sparkle in her eye would return or she'd make a cheeky joke to someone. Attending YODA was a 'release' for Christine, says Jonathan. She was sociable and friendly and made a wonderful speech at a launch event describing her son as 'her rock'. They went to YODA together for the last time two weeks before Christine died, seeing their friends and enjoying the group's end of year meal. It was a terrible shock when she died earlier this year. 'I knew I would lose her eventually,' says Jonathan, 'But I thought by the time Mum passed away, she would be in her 70s. I didn't expect it would happen at 56.' Thoughtful as ever, Christine had prepared her son by often reminding him to take care of one of his uncles and Milo, their kitten. Sudden loss Christine suddenly developed a chest infection - her second - and had a high level of potassium in her blood, causing her heart to stop. Her diabetes and sickle cell anaemia meant Jonathan had faced her medical issues before, but this one was final. 'It really upsets me when I think about losing her,' says Jonathan. 'She wasn't physically bad. She could still climb in and out of the bath and didn't need a stick to walk with, so I wasn't expecting her to die when she did.' Her other illnesses have meant hospital stays so Jonathan is used to living on his own, but his loss is now permanent. 'I know she wouldn't want me to be a wreck right now. She'd want me to be OK. I miss her, and I miss looking after her. I'm unhappy she won't see me go on to live my own life. I stopped my life to look after her, and she felt guilty about that. I feel so bad she won't see me move out, have a family, do everything I want.' He says he never feels isolated. 'I have eight really close friends,' he says, 'None of them knew about Mum until quite recently. I didn't need to give anyone a sob story. Even my father, who lives close by, didn't know for a long time. I felt confident dealing with things by myself.' 25With your support, \u00a350 could help deliver essential training for those caring for people with dementia via our Carer Information and Support Programme (CrISP).

Donate One advantage of being young is that I have a lot of energy. There was so much I could do. I often had to cancel seeing friends, but I feel I was a genuinely good son. I hope I was.No regrets Jonathan continues to attend YODA outings and comes to the group for support. 'One advantage of being young is that I have a lot of energy. There was so much I could do. I often had to cancel seeing friends, but I feel I was a genuinely good son. I hope I was.' Jonathan is aware of how much he did for his mother at such a young age. His advice to other young people is that they don't have to follow his lead. Far better to do what feels right for them. 'If it's in your heart, do all you can,' he says. 'If it's not in your heart and you can't keep up the pace of caring with little support, don't do it. It will be worse for them and for you.' Either course of action can work well and be the right one. 'What's most important of all,' he explains, 'Is living a life with no regrets.'26Lost Chord UK runs music sessions for people with memory loss and dementia. The charity has expanded from working in 11 residential homes in Rotherham to having 'satellite' schemes across England and Wales. It aims to improve the lives of people with dementia through the transformative effects of music. Clare Langan, CEO and flautist, says, 'The sessions, be they in a care home, community setting, a workshop or a bedside one-to-one, are truly amazing. 'In every session the lives of attendees, including residents, clients, carers, relatives, volunteers or musicians, are improved for the better. 'It is a thing of such beauty - having a 70-year old gentleman say to me, \"Clare, I am 70 and have never done anything musical my entire life and now I have dementia I have written a song... and performed it!\" It's amazing.' Bringing back joy Apathy - losing interest in things - is a common symptom of dementia. Lost Chord UK uses music to help bring back joy and meaning for people living with the condition. A community choir at Sheffield's Quaker Meeting House, funded by the Power of Music Fund, is just one example. It runs twice monthly with musician and composer Luke Carver Goss. 'Originally we were only going into care homes but post-pandemic we've broadened out into choirs, singalong groups and workshops, which are great to be part of,' Luke says. During a session in April, the choir did warm-up exercises before singing both some familiar songs and action songs. They then wrote an instant song together. 'Our job is to go in and make life just that little bit better for people,' Luke says. 'Having worked here for 20 years, I know that the vast majority of people participating in music are going to leave feeling happier. It's not rocket science.' Fortnightly treat June Salt heard about the choir while listening to BBC Radio Sheffield. She's now a regular and travels to the sessions by bus, with volunteers phoning to remind her on the day. June recently treated the choir to a solo of Elvis's Can't Help Falling in Love. 'I'd love to tell you how important this group is to me and spread the news about it,' June tells me. 'This is my third visit and I've been looking forward to coming.' Volunteer Coordinator Anne- Marie Wilcock joined the session with her father, Edwin. 'The musical gene skipped a generation,' says Anne-Marie, 'My dad sings, my nan used to play the piano and I used to practise on her piano before I got my own. 'My brother and my mum aren't particularly musical but while me and Dad are here, Mum's having an hour to herself in the city centre.'Music for wellbeing Quick read Lost Chord UK has been using music to improve the lives of people with dementia for more than 20 years. The charity delivers around 95 choirs, singalongs, virtual and one-to-one sessions, and music workshops every month. Dancing, singing and song writing can engage people who otherwise struggle to take part in activities or lose interest. Describing the impact of her day service's first session, Tracy Hutchinson says, 'We were so spellbound that none of us left our seats.'Lost Chord UK has run music sessions for people with dementia for over 20 years. Jessica Hubbard joined events in Sheffield and Newark to see music create joy. Clare Langan27Time together Long-time friends Bertha and Esther are also members. Bertha has Alzheimer's and is unable to speak. 'I've known Bertha for so many years and it's really upsetting to see her like this,' Esther says. 'Even if she doesn't really speak or sing, sometimes she opens her eyes. We've been coming here for so many years. It's special we can share this time together.' During the session, Esther shared a Spanish song with the group. Bertha is from Chile so including Spanish lyrics helps to make the group inclusive and meaningful. Lisa, who helps to care for Bertha, said, 'Bertha's got no speech, but she can respond to music of all sorts. Bertha's always loved singing and music so I've prioritised the choir as a means of connecting with people.' Lisa describes the sessions as a lifeline. She believes they help families, carers and friends of people with dementia to maintain relationships with them that aren't only based on caring. Spellbound In nearby Nottinghamshire, Tracy Hutchinson, says Lost Chord brought a 'new lease of life' to Newark and Sherwood day services. 'It all started with one gentleman, Roger,' explains Tracy, a day service leader. 'We were struggling to engage him in activities, and he was disturbing other residents. 'But when Clare came down and started playing the flute, Roger - who was virtually \"nonverbal\" - was clapping and saying, \"Oh isn't this excellent.\" 'We were so spellbound that none of us left our seats. The room was soon filled with people.' Without Roger, Tracy says the sessions might not have happened. They have gone on to benefit other service users like Bob, who usually struggles to engage in activities but happily joins in with the music. 'Staff now use music with Bob all the time - different music for different support such as lunchtime, relaxing and movement.' 'I'm so desperate to bring music to this building as therapy. But not therapy for illness, therapy for people's wellbeing.'Music for wellbeingFind out more about Lost Chord UK at www.lost-chord.org.uk or call 0300 131 7889.

CCWS, created in 1989, supports the health and social care needs of the Chinese speaking community across south-west England through a range of services. Among them is a free helpline and a replacement care service. A Dementia Support Hub is also available for carers from East and South-east Asian communities. Tailored services Tailoring its services is vitally important to CCWS and the latest sessions were no exception. They were created in tandem with people with dementia. 'Our project comes under the Dementia Health Integration Team of Bristol Health Partners,' says Emily Choi at CCWS. 'It's called Dementia Arts Intervention, but \"art\" can be music, art therapy, gentle exercises like qigong - anything that people with dementia would enjoy. 'We're just one of the partners delivering the programme to see how arts can help improve the wellbeing of those living with dementia. 'The activities are very much based upon discussions with people from the East and South-east Asian community. We collated all their feedback and they decided they would like gentle exercises.' Project co-facilitator Kelly Zhang says people can take part in the sessions even if they don't enjoy painting or drawing. 'Probably you think art would just be drawing,' she said, 'But maybe a few of them are not Picassos and think, \"Well I can't do that.\" These exercises are more meaningful to them.' Safe and beneficial Around 20 people joined one of the early sessions - both in person and online - to take part in qigong (pronounced chi-gong) which involves meditation, breathing and movement. 'Qigong is a form of \"soft\" martial arts performed by the Chinese for thousands of years to enhance our minds with physical movements,' says Rosa Hui, Director of CCWS. Leading the session was Sunny Chan, a senior lecturer at UWE Bristol. He has researched the benefits of mindfulness and Gentle impact Quick read A Bristol-based charity has developed sessions for people with dementia from East and South-east Asian communities. After finding out what people wanted most, the Chinese Community Wellbeing Society started a series of qigong sessions in April. Qigong involves gentle exercises, meditation, and breathing. All the sessions are offered in Cantonese or with an interpreter. Sunny Chan, a senior lecturer at UWE Bristol, says qigong is safe and beneficial for people with dementia.Qigong sessions developed with Bristol's Chinese speaking communities are benefitting people living with dementia. Jessica Hubbard reports on an impactful project. 29exercises like qigong, which he believes can benefit people living with dementia. 'I spent several years in Hong Kong conducting research, teaching and practising qigong and tai chi,' says Sunny. 'This is a safe and beneficial mind-body intervention for people with dementia. Psychological health can be improved by reducing stress levels and physical function, including balance, can be enhanced. 'Frequent practice may also enhance cognitive function, like memory and attention.' Easy to follow The session exercises could be done sitting down - beneficial for the group, as many are over the age of 80. Carers were also welcome, which Kelly says helps to relieve isolation and stress as well as improving their relationships with the person who has dementia. Fiona and her mum Eliza, who has dementia, attended together. 'The session was very good and Dr Chan was very professional,' Fiona said. 'Even someone with dementia can follow the instructions easily.' Another member Pauline, who has memory problems, said the session was very easy to follow. 'I could follow every movement,' she said, 'I had to join online due to transportation problems. 'It's a good chance to join together (even if we're not face-to-face) and I could see the good atmosphere too.' Language and culture The sessions were in Cantonese, which was important for many group members. 'We understand the community have got language and cultural barriers,' says Kelly. 'We want to illustrate that to local services and tell them that if the tutor is a Cantonese speaker from the same cultural background, it could be much better than a tutor speaking English. If they listen in their mother tongue, they feel more engaged and involved with that activity.' Providing information in multiple languages is something CCWS strives for across its services. 'Having sessions in your native language is so much easier and helps people connect with the service better,' says Emily. 'Pretty much all our Dementia Support Hub sessions were led by Cantonese speakers and it really made a difference. Our free helpline is available in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. It offers advice, support, information and can signpost to other organisations.' 'It's also important to put information into a culturally appropriate context,' adds Emily. 'For example, when talking about struggling with daily tasks as a sign of dementia, we use \"struggling to use chopsticks to put food into your mouth\" as an example to help them understand the subject matter better.' Feel confident Funding for the sessions came from NHS Charities Together and CCWS hopes to continue running them to support people living with dementia lead a healthier lifestyle in the long run. 'Following the session everybody was really sociable and you could not tell they had symptoms,' said Kelly. 'I want them to think, \"I can live well with dementia.\" 'People with dementia - don't feel ashamed, feel confident. You can still live very well with the support of dedicated and proper services.'For more about the Chinese Community Wellbeing Society in Bristol, see www.chinesecws.org.uk or call 0117 935 1462.

'I find it very frustrating that there is a lot of help out there if you have various conditions, eg cancer. Now I know, before anyone says well cancer is a terrible thing to have, I would totally agree with them it is. 'What I'm trying to say is that you're not on your own - you get assigned someone from various organisations, and so you should. 'But if you have dementia - particularly young-onset - there is very, very little out there.

Got something to say? Become a Dementia Friend Helpful Everyday ProductsTake a giant leapSeen elsewhere...Try something new 32We visited Hayes Cafe in west London, a friendly and relaxed Alzheimer's Society group that meets fortnightly, so they could try out specially designed clothing. The clothes - all from The Able Label and available through our online shop - are intended to be easier to put on and take off, while still being attractive and comfortable. Stylish options Katie from The Able Label showed the group a range of their women's and men's clothes, including new items from their spring/summer collection. Katie explained how she'd seen the impact of Parkinson's on her grandmother's ability to dress herself, but found there was a lack of stylish easywear options. A fashion buyer at the time, Katie set up The Able Label to create attractive clothes that are easier to get into and fasten, whether you have physical or cognitive problems, or you need help getting dressed. Menswear The group saw two styles of men's trousers. 'Aubrey' has an elasticated waistband that means you can simply pull them on, as well as an optional zip fly with a velcro top button. 'Blake' is a smarter look, with a full velcro fly and hidden adjustable waistband. Both trousers have belt loops to help when pulling them up or down, which Lorraine said was 'very clever'. Rosemary noted that 'Aubrey's' back pockets still have buttons that her husband Keith would find difficult to fasten. Meanwhile, Keith said 'Blake's' all-velcro fly was 'very good - easy to use'. Group members liked the look and feel of the 'Douglas' checked short-sleeve shirt. With velcro hidden behind its decorative buttons, Rosie said, 'That's a good idea!' You need to do up all the fasteners for the velcro pads beneath not to be visible, though the top button can be left open. Natalie said you'd do them up anyway, and that 'for the purpose, it's good.' The 'Hugo' shirt is smarter and long-sleeved, with velcro fasteners all the way to the top. Group members agreed that pairing it with the 'Clive' clip-on tie worked well. The group liked the 'Maxwell' pyjamas as well, with a velcro fastening shirt and pull-up bottoms with a velcro fly. Katie had also brought samples of three lightweight jackets that they're considering for their autumn/ winter range. Dinesh found the quilted jacket very comfortable, saying, 'It's easy to wear and looks good. Nice fitting as well.' Womenswear As with the men's shirts, the pink floral 'Becky' blouse has velcro hidden behind decorative buttons. Katie added that its elasticated cuffs mean 'you don't have to battle with buttons'. Group members loved the look of both 'Becky' and the floral 'Tabatha' short-sleeve top. 'Tabatha' also opens at the front, so you don't have to pull it over your head.

The two cardigans were also popular - 'Myra' cardi with no fastenings at all, and the 'Moira' with velcro 'buttons' up its front. People especially liked details such as 'Myra's' split cuffs. The 'Deborah' pull-on trousers are made with stretch fabric and an elasticated waistband. The 'Delia' wrap skirt is also easy to put on without having to balance or see very well, which Kulwant said was 'very good'. The group liked the floral 'Jenny' nightdress too. It has velcro fastening down its front, once again so that you don't need to raise your arms to dress. Value and use Everyone agreed the clothes look well made, and Brenda thought the prices were 'good value if they last'. Katie said they would last so long as you fasten any velcro while they're being washed. Rosemary was pleased to hear that there's free delivery on orders over \u00a375 (excluding VAT). Rasila said the clothes were great for anyone who struggles with any aspect of dressing, and Eddie agreed because you don't have to deal 'with all the fiddly bits'.

Books What You Really Want to Know About Life with Dementia seeks to turn the traditional guide to dementia on its head. Rather than compiling information that healthcare professionals want people affected by dementia to know, it asks people with dementia, their family and carers what they think is important. 'This is just the kind of book I would have liked to read and share with my family when a close relative was experiencing dementia a few years ago,' says Caroline Branney in our Knowledge and Learning team. 'Well researched and compiled, the authors have carefully themed the content and covered many of the main topics of concern about living with dementia. 'Each chapter begins with case studies, describing personal experiences, which are then commented on by experienced experts including specialist dementia nurses. The themes were chosen following co-operation and consultation with families affected by dementia.' Understanding and insight Tricot, a Talking Point member in France, appreciated the book's real- life stories. 'I found this book very readable because its starting point was the carer or person with dementia giving their account,' says Tricot. 'This was followed by a professional's response and practical advice. 'Common problems encountered on the dementia journey - and frequently shared on the Talking Point forum - were tackled with understanding and insight.' Clever presentation Caroline Scott-Gall in West Sussex recommends readers find chapters that are relevant to them rather than reading from cover to cover. 'I didn't read it all,' says Caroline, 'Mainly just the chapters that applied to my own situation, as reading about dementia matters that don't apply to my husband creates information and emotional overload. The presentation of each scenario is clever - carer, specialist, Admiral Nurse. 'The only problem with this book is that each chapter is person and situation specific. As you will know, the catchphrase is, \"When you have met one person with dementia, you have only met one person with dementia.\"' Left wanting more Peter Clark in south-west Wales, who has dementia, was disappointed by the book. 'When I saw the title of this book, I hoped that people dealing with people living with dementia were going to be told what they could do to make our lives easier,' he says. 'There are some inspirational excerpts - the foreword by someone 11 years after their diagnosis and Wendy, still living her own life after nine years, and of course the always uplifting and practical voices of Admiral Nurses. What you really want to know 35We have five copies of FAQs on Dementia to give away - email magazine@ alzheimers.org.uk or write to the address on p2 by the end of 2 July quoting 'FAQs' for a chance to win (see p39 for terms and conditions). 'But the fact that there was no mention of euthanasia or even assisted dying in the index suggested that very little notice has been taken of the real concerns of people living with dementia.' Easy to find advice Lynda Porter, in Devon, found the layout and index helpful. 'It all works rather well,' says Linda, 'Like sitting around a table, telling your story and concerns, and receiving specialist help from someone else at the table. 'There is also a great index - I hate it when books don't include indexes, as sometimes you may want help with a particular issue such as appetite loss - this helps you to go straight to it.

Email magazine@alzheimers.org.uk or write to the address on p2.Insurers will want to know if you're having tests for a medical condition or if you already have one. Even if they don't specifically ask, their terms and conditions may assume you have no health issues. It's a good idea to check, since you may find you're not covered if you haven't told them. If you're awaiting test results, the uncertainty means that some insurers may not offer cover at all. If they do, it'll probably be more expensive. You might have to wait until you have a confirmed diagnosis. Whether you're still having tests or you've been diagnosed, it's likely to make your insurance more expensive. It may also limit the number of insurers who will provide cover. Shopping around You may need to try more than one insurer, and that's a good idea anyway so you can compare prices The government's Money Helper website has a directory that can help you find travel insurance - see www.moneyhelper.org.uk/ travel-insurance-directory Another option is to use a broker, who can shop around for you. The British Insurance Brokers' Association could help you find one - visit www.biba.org.uk/ find-insurance or call 0370 950 1790. It will probably be easier and cheaper to buy a single trip policy rather than annual cover. What if they're unreasonable? Equalities law is there to prevent discrimination against people with disabilities. That includes people with dementia, and it can sometimes include someone who's having tests or scans to see if they have dementia. Insurers must follow these laws, though there are some exceptions for them. However, they still have to make a reasonable decision about risk based on reliable evidence. If you think they're being unreasonable, you can complain to the insurer using their own complaints process. If that doesn't work, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk or call 0800 023 4567. Travel within the EU Having a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) entitles you to limited state-provided healthcare if you're travelling within the EU and, in some cases, Switzerland. This healthcare may be free or at a reduced cost, and it varies from country to country. Neither card is a substitute for insurance - you should buy private cover as well. You may already have an EHIC. Despite the UK leaving the EU, your EHIC will still be valid until the expiry date printed on it. If your EHIC expires or you don't have one, you can apply for a GHIC. For more information and to apply, see www.gov.uk/ global-health-insurance-card or, if you can't get online, call 0191 696 8133.

Will that affect what insurance I can get?' For a person diagnosed with dementia, either starting or continuing to swim could help with self-esteem, self-confidence and general wellbeing. Swimming can be social, and it's good exercise that can promote healthy sleep patterns. Floating or simply being in water could be relaxing and calming for some. Pool visits A busy pool might be overwhelming but there may be dedicated slower lanes, quiet times or off-peak periods. Earplugs can reduce background noise as well as keeping water out of the ears. Some pools have dementia- friendly sessions, with staff who have a better understanding of dementia, improved signage or warmer pool temperatures. Changing rooms may also be unisex during these sessions, so that more carers can accompany the person they're supporting. Venues sometimes offer familiarisation sessions, so you can visit in advance, ask questions and get used to the layout and environment. Some pools give free entry to carers too.Around and about If the person's no longer able to use the swimming pool itself, other aspects of being around a pool may still be pleasurable. They might enjoy spending time in a viewing gallery or pool cafe, or in a sauna, steam room, jacuzzi or smaller pool. Simply making the journey to or from the pool could be a positive experience if it's a familiar route. For someone who can't get to the pool, they might like watching swimming videos or handling items such as swimming caps or goggles. If they used to swim in outdoor places such as the sea, lakes or outdoor pools, what might evoke those memories - listening to sounds of the sea? Looking at holiday photos? Tasting foods associated with going to the beach? The feel of seashells? Think about their specific life history and what they might associate with swimming earlier in their life.

He may forget the players' names but has a good friend since childhood who is prepared to take him to all the home games.'

We only have very small bets but enjoy watching together. I never used to join him in this activity before, so it's a new shared interest. We had a wonderful week when Cheltenham was on.'

I'm responsible for her finances and wellbeing but I am also the keeper of her memories. 'I am the one who can tell the staff what she likes, what she means, her life experiences. I am the one who knows what care decisions she would want to make when the time comes. 'The physical aspect of caring may not be present but the emotional one never leaves.' SAP 'At first, I was quite surprised at just how much caring still goes on when someone moves into care. As Mum's attorney I'm still managing her finances, I'm the person the care home asks when vaccination times come round, and like SAP I'm there telling them all what Mum likes and dislikes.' Sarasa 'When Dad went into his care home, I became a long distance carer. I still took him to some appointments and outings and looked after his finances. I also topped up his toiletries, sugar- free treats, clothes and other items.' MaNaAk 'Organising someone's life for them even when in care is still a lot of work! Making sure it's going well at the home, visiting, ensuring they are comfortable with clean, new, suitable clothing as things change, organising toiletries and so on... Yes, you're definitely still a carer!' imthedaughter 'It was so hard handing over my much-loved husband into someone else's care. I had provided 24-hour care for him for six years. 'Am I still his carer? Very much so! I oversee his daily care in a system that pays minimum wage to carers who work long hours and do not have the time to give my husband the care he needs. I spend three to four hours a day there, catching up with my own life at weekends to give myself a break. 'The hardest thing to accept is that I'm no longer in control of his care.' Elkie B 'I still think of myself as my husband's main carer. It brings me great joy to be with him as much as possible. I can do all those things I used to, that augment the care he receives at the care home. 'The managers and staff have accepted my frequent and quite long visiting patterns - though I think they might prefer it if I took more time away! 'It's no easy task for me, letting go. Perhaps this may become easier over time.' Gabby in London 'I've cared for my sister and her husband for a few years. Both have dementia. They've now moved to a care home five minutes away. 'I'm no longer their only carer but I'm still involved in their care planning. After all, I've known them all my life and the care home have only known them for a few months. I now know they're somewhere safe and will get help from professionals when needed.'
