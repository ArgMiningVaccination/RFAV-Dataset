[Sound healing](https://vinyasaproductions.com/gong-bath#what) preparations include a myriad of facets that encourage your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies to enter into this sound healing. As transient, vibrational beings, our energetic bodies are morphing, shifting, evolving, and changing each moment. The emotions and thoughts we bring into any meditation influences the practice and the ensuing journey. The more you prepare for the sound ceremony, the more profound its [potential healing](https://vinyasaproductions.com/gong-bath/#how). Being aware of how you spend the day of the ceremony may impact the healing you receive. The awareness that you are about to enter a sacred space may cultivate an energetic quality of readiness. Cultivating and nourishing this openness to receiving the sound healing can be enhanced through being mindful during the day of a ceremony. If possible, plan for a slow-paced day hiking, reading, creating, taking a bath, or participating in activities that nurture a tranquil space. Consider avoiding alcohol on the day of the ceremony. Other ideas to consider include: Toxins throughout the body will be broken-up and released during our sound healing. Water will help flush the system, clearing the body of that which was released during the meditation. It will also help the vibrations resonate within you for days following the ceremony. We recommend eating healthy foods lightly throughout the day. Many find our Gong Baths to be the most comfortable and impactful on a light-to-empty stomach as this allows your body to use energy within the ceremony rather than digesting food. If you are working with a specific intention, we invite you to integrate it into your ceremony. Bring it into your awareness early into the day so it is already weaved into your energetic bodies when you arrive. Your physical comfort is a top priority as this may set the stage for the type of experience you manifest. Wearing restrictive or loud clothing may be a distraction and inhibit your ability to remain present with your sound healing experience. Please keep in mind that you will be laying down in Savasana for the entire ceremony, approximately 90 minutes. Dress for comfort, warmth, and flexibility. In addition to what you wear, please consider these other preparation ideas. Please arrive around 15 minutes prior to the start of ceremony. This allows you the time to energetically arrive and to settle into your space. Creating a space of calm prior to the meditation prepares you for a deeper experience. Crystals may amplify your energy. If you work with crystals, consider bringing one with you to support you on your journey. Additionally, ideas, visions, thoughts can present themselves to you throughout your journey in a form of Creative Problem Solving. Having a journal to record your experience can be beneficial to help you integrate. Having some of pillow and yoga mat, camping mat, or cushion beneath you helps comfort your body throughout the journey. Additionally, many participants have described experiencing a cold, space-like sensation during our Gong Baths, and so some find that a light blanket also enhances their comfort, and subsequently, their journeys.

Ever wondered where the phrase \"music of the spheres\" came from? Read about the history of the phrase and how it influenced the musical scales we use ... \"GO EXPERIENCE THIS! Glowga & Gongs added multiple new and cosmic sensations to my yoga and meditation practices. It is a refreshing night of visual stimulation that illuminated my body, mind, and overall being. Two glowing thumbs up!\" \"I have been addicted to Megan's classes for a few years! Her style connects your mind, body, and spirit. She knows how to push you past your limits and personalize the practice. Megan guides you through deep intense postures that test your boundaries and build your strength and confidence. She pays attention to your specific needs, bettering your form. Through her classes, I fell in love with my yoga practice.\" \"I feel that there is something unique when vibrations and sounds work in harmony to relax, quiet, and slow the mind. Marshall's presentation of these ancient tools translates a feeling of singularity and connectivity to something beyond this realm. Lay back, settle in, and enjoy a cosmic experience with an open mind!\" \"Megan's 'Glowga' events enabled my tight and clumsy appendages the opportunity to feel beautifully connected to my mind. As darkness consumed my typical self-consciousness, I was gifted several experiences whereby my mind was intertwined with the class's focus, Megan's voice, and sounds of the gongs, giving me a heightened aspiration for my regular practice.\" \"Thank you so much for everything last night! Your gong bath was a really amazing experience and I can't wait to do it again. I also have several friends who would love to join next time! I completely left my body during your gong bath and ended up returning to it with an incredible feeling as the gongs ended. Thanks again!\" \"Tonight I went to your Vinyasa class. I just thought I'd let you know how excited I was to see you teaching at this studio! You were my favorite instructor at the studio I previously went to and tonight was the best of both worlds!\" \"Wednesday night I came down with a head cold. During the night it developed into a sore throat and I lost my voice (and consequently, a lot of sleep). By yesterday morning it had evolved into a chest cold and I expected to miss your gong bath because my head felt like it weighed 4,000 pounds. But after making the event, I woke up early and refreshed this morning. Still draining out from the last few days, but I'm no longer sick (at all). My array of symptoms seems to have aligned with the vibrations of your gong bath and so I wanted to share this with you. Thank you.\" \"Marshall blessed me with a gong bath earlier this morning. It was nothing short of amazing! The energy of the sound vibrations is incredible and should be experienced by all!\" \"Megan's candlelight yoga class is a breath of fresh air every time! After more than a year of attending, I always feel more relaxed, balanced, centered, and at peace compared to how I walked in at the beginning of class. I have taken several different yoga classes from many teachers. I don't always connect with every teacher because everyone has different principles and ways of teaching. But, Megan is a teacher who really stands out from the pack for me and she is someone I really feel connected to in terms of themes, teachings, perspectives, and physical aspects of yoga. Megan loves yoga and it really shows. She is a unique and talented instructor who intuitively knows what everyone needs in their yoga practice. She spontaneously and effortlessly creates a fun flow that is just what I need every time. I highly recommend everyone to take her class! Megan is the best! Thanks for everything you have done for me, Megan! Namaste.\" \"I could visualize the vibrations and kept receiving cool visuals of dragons winding around and flying in and out and through me, and then I was in space (everywhere) immediately. Bad...Ass!\" \"So beautiful, powerful, and amazing! I LOVED it...so incredible, and powerful! Megan and Marshall are magic!\" \"THANK YOU! Officially put, you have revolutionized my life for the better, Megan. Forever indebted...!\" \"A one-of-a-kind gong bath experience, led by Marshall Bendelac, a storied ancient soul focused on peeling back the layers of reality to find true inner peace through sound meditation, music, yoga, "}
