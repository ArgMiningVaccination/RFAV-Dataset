Our faces turn pink with embarrassment or white with fear. Complexions can appear sallow, dry or as if aged overnight, especially during difficult times. I used to suffer from adult acne. Incorporating a regular meditation practice was the key to clearing it up because it led me to address the underlying symptoms that caused my skin problems. Meditation helped me reduce stress, follow a mindful and healthy skincare regimen and eat whole organic foods. Together, my skin and overall health showed profound results. Meditation addresses the underlying issues that create skin problems in the first place. An emerging field of research called psychodermatology studies the interaction between mind and skin, looking at the effects of emotions on the skin as well as disorders that have skin manifestations. By bridging the gap between our emotional and mental states with our overall health, meditation has many benefits. - Meditation reduces negative emotions The past 30 years have seen exponential growth in research examining mindfulness and meditation practices. It scientifically validates numerous health benefits including reduced stress, fear, worry and anxiety - conditions that are often the root causes of skin problems. [New research](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9499471/Skin-disease-hope-through-psychotherapy.html) from the University of Sheffield that combines past studies found techniques like meditation, relaxation sessions and cognitive behavior therapy have real benefit for people suffering from skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, acne and vitiligo (a pigment disorder). In one study, people who suffered from psoriasis listened to meditation tapes while they received ultraviolet light treatments. The result was they healed four times as fast as non-meditators. The study determined that meditation reduced the stress that caused psoriasis in the first place and triggered the body's innate ability to repair itself. Whether chronic or not, skin issues worsen with stress. Reduced stress equals better skin. - Meditation slows down the aging process. Meditating for just a few minutes every day brings energy (also known as prana) into your body and creates a feeling of calm and relaxation. During meditation, prana helps repair your body's the tissues and cells which give skin a fresh, youthful glow. Also, mindful breathing while meditating adds oxygen to the skin, which is key in boosting cellular health. This increased oxygen rejuvenates your skin, balancing your body and your mind while transforming your body's cells and tissues. It improves your complexion, reduces wrinkles and slows down the aging process from the inside out. Meditation also lowers blood pressure and tension-related pain such as headaches, ulcers, insomnia, muscle aches and joint problems, making you look and feel younger. - Meditation improves self-confidence and mood Your complexion is intimately connected to feelings of self-confidence. When your skin looks better, your sense of confidence increases, too. A regular meditation practice increases the brain's ability to repair itself and grow new neural connections. Like a muscle, these neural pathways get stronger and more effective over time with practice. As a result, people who meditate experience more happiness, inner peace and an overall sense of wellbeing. Meditation also increases your brain's serotonin production, which makes you feel better and literally improves your mood. Like a candle, meditation shines your light. And the more you meditate, the more you glow. Indeed, happiness comes from the inside out. - Meditation helps you make healthier choices. With a meditation practice comes more awareness of your breath, your body and your surroundings. This leads to increased ability to pause, be present and consider your lifestyle choices. This can manifest in several ways, from communicating more effectively with your loved ones, or simply becoming more conscious of where and how your food, clothes or skin care products come from. Meditation can also create a gentle space to slow down and enjoy the process of taking care of yourself, such as taking a few extra minutes to enjoy taking care of your skin. When we are more in touch with the present moment, we can fully exist and feel gratitude for every moment in our lives - the only moment we ever truly have. - Your Turn: Listen to a 3-Minute Guided Meditation for Your Skin Imagine how beautiful your skin could be if you included a short daily meditation practice into your daily routine.
