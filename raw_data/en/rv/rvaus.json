Ayush is an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy. Ayurveda is the oldest system with a documented history of its practice for more than 5000 years whereas Homoeopathy is in practice in India for around 100 years. These systems are being practised in the country with diverse preferences of people and infrastructural facilities. Ayurveda is practised widely in the States Unani System is prevalent mainly in Andhra States. The Siddha system is most popular in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry and Kerala. Sowa Rigpa system of medicine is prevalent in Himalayan including Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. Besides, there institutes of Sowa Rigpa in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka also. AYURVEDA Ayurveda, the science of life is one of the ancient and comprehensive systems of health care. Quest for good health and long life is probably as old as human existence. According to Indian philosophy, health is prerequisite to pursue materialistic, social and spiritual upliftment of human being. It is believed that Lord Brahma the creator of the universe was also the first preacher of Ayurveda. Four Vedas considered as oldest Indian literatures composed between 5000 and 1000 BC have information on treatment by plants and natural procedures. Reference of medicine and surgery are also found in Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. However, Ayurveda was established as a fully grown medical system from the period of Samhita (compendium) i.e., around 1000 BC. The compendia like Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita were written in a systematic manner with eight specialties during this period. In these treatises, the basic tenets and therapeutic techniques of Ayurveda got very much organized and enunciated. These treatises stressed the importance of maintenance of health and also expanded their vision to pharmaco-therapeutics. The therapeutic properties of plants, animal products and minerals were extensively described in these compendia, which has made Ayurveda a comprehensive system of health care. There were two main schools of thoughts in Ayurveda: Punarvasu Atreya - the school of physicians and Divodasa Dhanvantari- the school of surgeons. Punarvasu Atreya is mentioned as a pioneer in medicine, and Divodasa Dhanvantari in surgery. Disciples belonging to each school immensely contributed to development of the traditions of their own school. Six pupils of Atreya are believed to have composed their own compendia based on their Guru's teachings, but only two namely Bhela Samhita in its original form and Agnivesa tantra redacted by Caraka and Dridhabala are available today. Considered to be the most ancient and authoritative writing on Ayurveda available today, Caraka Samhita explains the logic and philosophy on which this system of medicine is based. Dhanvantari had six disciples and Susruta Samhita, a treatise primarily focusing on surgery was codified by Susruta based on teachings of Dhanvantari. The essential details of Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita were compiled and further updated in the treatises Astanga Sahgraha and Astanga Hrdaya authored by Vrddha Vagbhata and Vagbhata during 6 - 7 Century AD. Thus, the main three treatises called Brhattrayi i.e., Caraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita and Astanga Sangraha formed basis for subsequent scholars to write texts and among them three concise classics i.e., Madhava Nidana, Sarngadhara Samhita and Bhava Prakasa having distinct features are called as Laghutrayi. Some other eminent practitioners and visionaries like Kasyapa, Bhela, and Harita also wrote their respective compendia. An analysis of Ayurvedic treatises signifies that the different aspects of Ayurveda were evolved and documented from time to time in the form of texts or compendia. For instance, the Caraka Samhita an authentic source of internal medicine emphasizes on philosophy of life and line of treatment for different diseases. Susruta Samhita added a complete systematic approach to surgery and diseases of eyes, ear, throat, nose, head and dentistry. Madhava Nidana, authored by Madhavakara is a work on diagnosis of the diseases. Bhava Prakasa written by Bhava Misra gives additional emphasis on medicinal plants and Diet. Sarngadhara Samhita focused on pharmaceutics and Ayurveda was enriched with addition of more formulations and dosage forms. Subsequently, texts of Ayurveda were commented upon, updated, and methodically written by many authors from time to time. A look into commentaries on the treatises by the scholars indicates that while the theoretical framework of Ayurveda remained the same, the knowledge about drugs and techniques of therapy got expanded. The old concepts and descriptions were reviewed and updated in the light of contemporary understanding by the commentators in their commentaries thus reviving Ayurveda into an applied form. Present form of Ayurveda is the outcome of continued scientific inputs that has gone into the evolution of its principles, theories, and practices. During Buddhist period Jivaka, a famous surgeon who treated Gautam Buddha studied Ayurveda at Takshashila University. Around 200 BC, medical students from different parts of the world used to come to the ancient University of Takshashila to learn Ayurveda. All the specialties of Ayurveda were developed, and full-fledged surgery was practiced. From 200 to 700 AD, University of Nalanda also attracted foreign medical students mainly from Japan, China etc. Evidence show that Ayurveda had nurtured many medical systems of the world. The Egyptians learnt about Ayurveda long before the invasion of Alexander in 400 BC through their sea-trade with India. Greeks and Romans came to know about it after their invasion. In the early part of the first millennium Ayurveda spread to the East through Buddhism and greatly influenced the Tibetan and Chinese system of medicine and herbology. Around 800 A.D., Nagarjuna has conducted extensive studies on medicinal applications of mercury and other metals. These studies have entailed in the emergence of a new branch of Ayurveda viz. Rasa Sastra. Rigorous procedures were developed to purify, detoxify, and process formulations with metallic ingredients by using plant and animal materials. Classical treatises named Rasaratnasamuccaya, Rasarnava, Rasa Hrdaya Tantra elaborating the manufacture of mineral and metallic drugs and their use in therapeutics were written during this period. Ayurveda, in later periods used Mercury as well as other metals as important components of pharmaceutical formulations. Many exotic and indigenous drugs for new uses are found place in Ayurvedic literature. After 16 Century, there have been inclusions of diagnosis and treatment of new diseases based on modem medical science. In 1827, the first Ayurveda course was started in India in the Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta. By the beginning of 20th Century, many Ayurveda colleges were established in India under the patr.onage of provincial Rulers. Ayurveda gained more ground beginning from the 1970, as a gradual recognition of the value of Ayurveda revived. Lots of academic work was done during 20th century and many books were written and seminars and symposia were held. Presently Ayurveda has well-regulated undergraduate, post graduate and doctorate education in India. Commendable network of practitioners and manufactures exists. Infrastructure development in private and public sectors has improved the outreach to the community in a commendable way. Astanga Ayurveda (Eight Branches of Ayurveda): - Ayurveda was divided into eight major clinical specialties. - Kayacikitsa (internal medicine) - This branch deals with general ailments of adults not treated by other branches of Ayurveda. - Salya Tantra (surgery) - This branch deals with various surgical operations using different surgical instruments and devices. Medical treatment of surgical diseases is also mentioned. - Salakya (disease of supra-clavicular origin) - This branch deals with dentistry, diseases of ear, nose, throat, oral cavity, head and their treatment by using special techniques. - Kaumarabhrtya (paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology) - This branch deals with childcare as well as the care of the woman before, during and after pregnancy. It also elaborates various diseases of women and children and their management. - Bhootavidya (psychiatry) - This is study of mental diseases and their treatment. Treatment methods include medicines, diet regulation, psycho-behavioral therapy, and spiritual therapy. - AgadaTantra (toxicology) - This branch deals with the treatment of toxins from vegetables, minerals and animal origin along with development of their antidotes. The pollution of air, water, habitats and seasons has been given special consideration in understanding epidemics and pandemics. - Rasayana Tantra (rejuvenation and geriatrics) - - This branch which is unique to Ayurveda, deals with prevention of diseases and promotion of a long and healthy life. - Vajikarana (Aphrodisiology and eugenics) - - This branch deals with the means of enhancing sexual vitality and efficiency for producing healthy and ideal progeny. Strengths of Ayurveda: Comprehensive definition of health: - Ayurveda defines health as a state of equilibrium of Dosa (regulatory and functional entities of the body), Dhatu (structural entities), Mala (excretory entities) and Agni (digestive and metabolic factors) along with healthy state of sensory and motor organs and mind with their harmonious relationship with the soul. As against definition of health, the diseased state is defined in Ayurveda as a loss of equilibrium of essential body constituents. The objective of disease management is to bring back the equilibrium, principally through lifestyle management rather than through curative therapies. The strength of Ayurveda lies in its three-fold holistic approach of prevention of disease, promotion of health and cure of disease. This is achieved through care of body, mind and soul where physical, mental and spiritual aspects of health are considered. Acceptance by the community: - About 80-90% of population in India is reported to use Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine to meet their primary health care needs. Safety of this system is attributed to time-tested use substantiated by scientific evidence. Besides, synergy of ingredients in conjunction with individual need-based treatment plan forms the basis of efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic formulations. Specific guidelines are prescribed for the use of apparently toxic medicinal plants with certain detoxification processing that also enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of the final product. Emphasis on promotion of health and prevention of diseases: - Considering health of an individual as dynamic integration of environment, body, mind and soul, Ayurveda lays great emphasis on preservation and promotion of health and preventing the occurrence of diseases. The treatment modalities of Ayurveda are based on the inherent ability of the living body to rejuvenate, regenerate and restore the natural equilibrium. While treating the patient, Ayurvedic treatment helps to enhance the natural healing process in the body. The prevention of disease and promotion of health is achieved by judicious practice of Dinacarya (daily regimen), Ritucarya (seasonal regimen) and Sadvritta (ethical code of conduct) in accordance with Prakrti (psychosomatic constitution). In this way significance of healthy lifestyle for maintenance of health is emphasized by Ayurveda. Do's and don'ts on personal and social behavior are elaborated for attaining total health. Great emphasis is given on Nidana Parivaijana i.e., keeping away from factors which cause or precipitate the disease, whereas therapeutic procedures like Panchkarma help in eradicating the disease. Importance of diet and lifestyle: - The ultimate aim of this medical science is preservation of health, and it can be attained in two ways, i.e., observation of lifestyle recommendations to prevent the diseases and eradication of already afflicted diseases. The prerequisites to attain the prevention include wholesome diet, conservation of environment, congenial social and cultural atmosphere. Diet is an essential factor for the maintenance of health. Ayurveda emphasizes on diversified aspects of dietetics and nutrition viz. quality, quantity, processing methods, rationale of combination of food articles, emotional aspects, nature of the consumer, geographical and environmental conditions etc. Advocacy of proper diet and lifestyle, which is congenial to the individual maintains normal body functions thus prevents the diseases. Holistic concept of health: - Ayurveda considers a living being as a combination of body, mind and soul. All health management approaches are intended to maintain the harmony and homeostasis of these entities. Individualized approach: - Ayurveda considers that everyone has distinct psychosomatic constitution and health status. This is considered while advocating preventive, promotive and curative measures. Universal approach: - According to Ayurveda, the individual (microcosm) is a miniature replica of the universe (macrocosm). Every aspect of the universe is represented in the individual. Any change in the environment affects human being. Therefore, emphasis is laid on social and environmental factors which are interlinked with health. Stress on public health and eugenics: - The activities of the individual through his thought, word and deed have their good or bad effects on the environment. Ayurveda emphasizes upon healthy body, sound mind, benevolent speech and spiritual practices to create a healthy and happy environment. The pivotal role of eugenics mentioned in Ayurveda is to produce strong, healthy and ideal progeny. Use of natural products: - Ayurvedic products are derived mainly from plants and other natural resources. Supportive leads are emerging from revalidation of Ayurvedic drugs. Identification of active principles of some plants has led to discovery of many allopathic drugs. Some pharmacologically proven constituents of the longa, withania somnifera, etc. are used globally. Areas of clinical strength: - Ayurveda provides healthcare within the physical and financial reach of rural India. Some of the Ayurvedic medicinal plants and spices are widely used as home remedies in India for a wide range of common ailments. The common users of Ayurveda are individuals suffering from chronic intractable diseases. Ayurvedic treatment is effective in chronic disorders like sinusitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity; psychosomatic disorders like depression, insomnia; digestive disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer, inflammatory bowel diseases; respiratory disorders like bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Musculo-skeletal disorders like arthritis, osteoporosis; neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders like paralytic conditions, sciatica, dementia, Parkinson's disease etc. Unique therapeutic approach: - Ayurveda advocates certain bio-cleansing and rejuvenating therapeutic measures such as Pahcakarma, Rasayana for maintenance of healthy state as well as in the management of chronic diseases. Ksarasutra, a minimal invasive para-surgical procedure using medicated thread, widely cited in ancient medical literatures for its safety and efficacy is being successfully practiced as promising therapy for ano-rectal disorders. Such unique specialties of Ayurveda either as stand-alone or add on therapies are proven to have an edge over conventional medical approach in disease management and improving quality of life. The way forward: - Ayurveda can contribute to the management of chronic and refractory disease conditions sharing huge global burden such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and allied conditions. YOGA The word \"Yoga\" comes from the Sanskrit word \"yuj\" which means \"to unite or integrate\". Yoga is about the union of a person's own consciousness and the universal consciousness. It is primarily a way of life, first propounded by Maharishi Patanjali in systematic form Yogsutra. The discipline of Yoga consists of eight components namely, restraint (Yama), Observance of austerity (Niyama), physical postures (Asana), breathing control (Pranayam), restraining of sense organs (Pratyahar), contemplation (Dharna), meditation (Dhyan) and Deep meditation (Samadhi). These steps in the practice of Yoga have the potential to elevate social and personal behaviour and to promote physical health by better circulation of oxygenated blood in the body, restraining the sense organs and there by inducing tranquillity and serenity of mind and spirit. The practice of Yoga has also been found to the useful in the prevention of certain psychosomatic diseases and improves individual resistance and ability to endure stressful situations. Yoga is a promotive, preventive rehabilitative and curative intervention for overall enhancement of health status. A number of postures are described in Yoga literature to improve health, to prevent diseases and to cure illness. The physical postures are required to be chosen judiciously and have to be practiced in the correct way so that the benefits of prevention of disease, promotion of health and therapeutic use can be derived from them. The United Nations General Assembly had declared June 21st as the International Yoga Day on 11th December, 2014. Every year the Prime Minister of India, leads the nation in celebration of IDY. NATUROPATHY Universal approach: - Naturopathy is rooted in the healing wisdom of many cultures and times based on the principle of natural healing. The principles and practices of Naturopathy are integrated in the life style of the people with emphasis on living close to nature. Naturopathy is a cost effective non-pharmacological therapies involving the use of natural materials for health care and healthy living. It is based on the theories of vitality, boosting the self-healing capacity of the body and the principles of healthy living. Naturopathy is a system of natural treatment and also a way of life widely practiced, globally accepted and recognized for health preservation and management of illnesses. Naturopathy advocates living in harmony with constructive principles of nature on the physical, mental, social and spiritual planes. It has great promotive, preventive, curative as well as restorative potentials. Naturopathy promotes healing by stimulating the body's inherent power to regain health with the help of five elements of nature - Earth, water, air, fire and Ether. It is a call to \"Return to Nature\" and to resort to a simple way of living in harmony with the self, society and environment. Naturopathy advocates 'Better Health with usage of Natural therapeutics, fasting, diet, yoga and physical culture. It is reported to be effective in chronic, allergic, autoimmune, degenerative and stress related disorders. The theory and practice of Naturopathy are based on a holistic view point with particular attention to simple eating and living habits, adoption of purification measures, use of hydrotherapy, cold packs, mud packs, baths, massages, fasting etc. The goals of Naturopathy are not merely curing disease or symptom reduction, but enhancing patients' positive physical psychosocial characteristics as a way to reach and improve well-being when faced with disease (be it somatic or mental); this is complementary to the positive mental health paradigm. These goals implicate the shift from a solely disease-centered approach to a person-centered, strengths-based therapeutic relationship. In Naturopathy, health is equated with the individual's capacity on restoration of the body's inner balance or vitality, the life force present which is responsible for all activities in the body. Reduced vitality is considered to be the cause of all diseases in human body. All the naturopathic therapeutic modalities are directed towards regaining this vital capacity fight against diseases. Vitality is affected by violating nature's law known as \"natural hygiene\" which includes sleep, good food, right exercise, prayer and fasting. Therefore, Naturopathy treatments are close to nature with the use natural elements which can enhance vitality. Thus, to optimize or economize vitality, to conserve it is the foci in natural therapeutics. Naturopathy blends centuries-old knowledge of natural therapies with current advances in the understanding of health and human systems. Naturopathy, therefore, can be described as the general practice of natural health therapies. In promoting health paradigm, the approach of naturopathy focuses more on strengthening wellness through various treatment natural modalities - fasting, mudtherapy, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, dietary supplements, nutrition, herbal medicine, physical manipulation, colonic irrigation, magnetotherapy, chromotherapy, ozone therapy and so on. Hence, it aids the human system to remove the cause of disease i.e. toxins by eliminating unwanted and unused matters from the human body for curing diseases. UNANI The Unani System of Medicine pioneered in Greece and was developed by Arabs into an elaborate medical science based on the framework of the teaching of Buqrat (Hippocrates) and Jalinoos (Galen). Since that time Unani Medicine has been known as Greco-Arab Medicine. The three fundamentals of Hippocratic Medicine were observation, experience and rational principles, which still hold valid in the field of Medicine and Science. This system is based on Hippocratic theory of four humours viz. blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile, and the four qualities of states of living human body like hot, cold, moist and dry. They are represented as earth, water, fire and air, the Greek ideas were put by Arabian physician as seven principles (Umoor-e-Tabbiya) and included, element (Arkan), and functions (Afaal). In this system, it is believed that, these principles are responsible for the body constitution and its health, as well as diseased conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the Unani System of Medicine (USM) as an alternative system to cater the health care needs of human population. Alternative medicine is being practiced worldwide. Unani is one of the most well-known traditional medicine systems and draws on the ancient traditional systems of medicine of China, Egypt, India, Iraq, Persia and Syria. It is also called Arab medicine. Unani is still popular in many Arab and East Asian countries. In fact, Unani medicine and herbal products are gradually more being used in many countries where modern medicine is easily available. India has accepted it as one of the alternative health care systems and has given it official status. Practices of traditional medicine vary greatly with country and region, as they are influenced by factors such as culture, history, personal attitudes and philosophy. In many cases, the theory and application of traditional medicine are quite different from those of conventional medicine. Based on the therapies, traditional medicine can be categorized as medication and non-medication. Traditional medication involves the use of herbal medicines, animal parts and minerals. Non medication involves various techniques, primarily without the use of medication. They include, for example, acupuncture and related techniques, chiropractice, osteopathy, manual therapies, qigong, yoga, and other physical, mental, regimental, spiritual and mind-body therapies. Unani Medicine recognizes the influence of surroundings and ecological conditions on the state of health of human beings. Apart from treating disease conditions, Unani Medicine lays great emphasis on the prevention of disease and promotion of health. In a completely healthy person Unani prescribes lifestyle, diet and environment appropriate for his or her temperament, while for those who have become vulnerable to disease, special diets, nondrug manipulations or regimens and even drugs are prescribed to maintain health and prevent disease. The modern form of Unani medicine that we see today is a result of a long period of evolution which occurred through exchange of knowledge between diverse countries, regions and communities. The system is still increasing its dimensions and scope by incorporating the contemporary scientific knowledge and the newest of technologies. There is growing awareness among the scientific community and the general public about the intrinsic value of our traditional systems of medicine, and as a result Unani system of medicine have entered the mainstream to compliment conventional medicine. SIDDHA Siddha is one of the ancient comprehensive medical systems in India. The Healing Dimension revealed by the Siddhars with highly systematized technology is 'Siddha medicine'. The evolution of Siddha system is believed to date back 10000 - 4000 BC. The Siddha system provides preventive, promotive, curative, rejuvenative and rehabilitative health care with holistic approach. The word 'Siddha' is derived from the root word 'Citti', which means attaining perfection, heavenly bliss and accomplishment in life arts such as philosophy, yoga, wisdom, alchemy, medicine and above all the art of longevity. The Siddha system comprises essentially of philosophical concepts including the four main components: 1. Iatro-chemistry, 2. Medical practice, 3. Yogic practice and 4. Wisdom. Siddha system is named after the founders called 'Siddhars' who explored and explained the reality of nature and its relationship to man by their yogic awareness and experimental findings. Siddhar Agasthiyar is called the Father of Siddha Medicine. The Siddha diagnostic methodology is based on the clinical examination by the physician and these diagnostic tools are very important because they assist in diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Siddha physicians base their diagnosis on three Humors (Mukkuttram) and eight vital tests (Ennvagai Thervu). The treatment in Siddha system is aimed at keeping the three vital life factors in equilibrium and in the maintenance of the seven body Thathus. Special therapies/external therapy techniques such as Pressure Manipulation Therapy (Varmam), Physical Manipulation Therapy (Thokkanam), Bone setting (Otivu \"Sowa-Rigpa\" commonly known as Amchi's medicine, is the traditional medicine of many parts of the Himalayan regions. Sowa-Rigpa means Science of healing in Bodhi language. It is originated from the Bhagwan Buddha in India before 2500 years and plays vital role in public health in many Asian Countries. In India, Sowa-Rigpa is the traditional medicine in Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Darjeeling Tibetan settlements of India. Considering the importance of Sowa-Rigpa and its active role in public health especially in Himalayan regions, Govt. of India has recognized the Sowa-Rigpa system of medicine by amendment to The Indian Medicine Central Council Act. 1970 in September 2010. Being originated from India, Sowa-Rigpa has large number of medical texts translated from India followed by a huge literature written by Tibetan scholars. As per the preliminary study conducted by National Research Institute for Sowa-Rigpa, Leh; there are 22 different Ayurvedic work in Buddhist cannon Stan-Gyur, written by well-known Indian scholars like Nagarjuna, Vagbhat, Chandrananda, Bha-Lipa etc. These are some of very important works of Ayurveda which were then popular in India. Most of these texts were translated during 8th-17th century AD by both Indian and Tibetan scholars. Non-canonical work like the fundamental text Gyud-bZi is believed to have had its source in Sanskrit too and believed to be scribed by Bhagwan Buddha. In the category of non-canonical works, there is a long list of medicinal text authored by different Indian and Tibetan scholars; many of these texts are available in form of gSung-bHum collection and Terma section. The number goes beyond two thousand. Most of these texts can be found in monasteries, Libraries, Amchi's (Sowa-Rigpa practitioners). The Indian System of Medicine is of great lineage. It is the culmination of Indian thoughts of medicine which represents a way of healthy living valued with a long and unique cultural history and epitomizes the Vedic guidance 'Let noble thoughts come to us from every side; thus, one can see an amalgamation of the of the best of influences that came in from the contact of different sources of knowledge. HOMOEOPATHY The physicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C) have observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of disease in healthy people like those of people suffering from the disease. Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician scientifically examined this phenomenon and codified the fundamental principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D by European missionaries and received official recognition by a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by the Parliament. The first principle of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur', says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings suffering from the disease. The second principle of 'Single Medicine' says that one medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. The third principle of 'Minimum Dose' stated that the bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any adverse effect should be administered. Homoeopathy is based on the theory that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruses etc. Homoeopathy is a method of treating diseases by administering drugs which have been experimentally proved to possess the power to produce similar symptoms on healthy human beings. Treatment in Homoeopathy, which is holistic in nature, focuses on an individual's response to a specific environment. Homoeopathic medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances, such as plant products, minerals and from animal sources, nososdes, sarcodes etc. Homoeopathic medicines do not have any toxic, poisonous, or side effects. Homoeopathic treatment is economical as well and has a very broad public acceptance. Homoeopathy has its own areas of strength in therapeutics, and it is particularly useful in treatment for allergies, autoimmune disorders and viral infections. Many surgical, gynaecological & obstetrical and paediatric conditions and ailments affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs etc. are amenable to Homoeopathic treatment. Behavioural disorder, Neurological problems and Metabolic diseases can also be successfully treated by Homoeopathy. Apart from the curative aspects, Homoeopathic medicines are also used in preventive and promotive healthcare. In recent times, there is an emergence of interest in the use of Homoeopathic medicines in veterinary care, agriculture, dentistry etc. Homoeopathic medical education has developed in seven specialties in post-graduate teaching, which are Materia Medica, Organon of Medicine, Repertory, Practice of Medicine, Paediatric, Pharmacy and Psychiatry.
