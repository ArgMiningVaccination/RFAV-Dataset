The intention of this guide is to pro-vide Boston-area chaplains, pastoral counselors, nurses, physicians, and students a place to explore and begin deeper considerations of the wealth ofhealing modalities, philosophies, rituals, materials,and communities from which many of the peoplewith whom they interact draw. These resources can be of particular importance to health care providersand chaplains who serve diverse populations, andwho wish to identify resources that are culturallyappropriate and religiously meaningful for clientsand patients. Thus, this guide is designed to encour-age healers of all kinds to recognize and explore thediverse ways in which people of various faith tradi-tions and healing paths conceptualize and strive forwellness and healing in the world today. From September to June ,the Religion, Health, and Healing Initiative under the direction of Susan Sered, in collaboration with the Boston Healing Landscape Project directed by Linda Barnes, and with the help of students of HarvardDivinity School, Boston University School ofMedicine and School of Public Health, and other friends and collaborators worked to develop projectscharting Boston-area groups and people who are engaged in religious or spiritual healing practices. The spiritual and religious contexts in which heal- ing takes place are diverse and thriving, rangingfrom Ecumenical Healing T ouch and PrayerServices for AIDS sufferers organized by theEcumenical Task Force on AIDS, to Reiki energywork offered as laying on of the hands practice at the Center for Faith, Health and Spirituality atAndover Newton Theological School; from Seventh- Day Adventist Cardio-Kick-Boxing classes offered at the Boston T emple Church, to the Women's LodgeCircles that meet each week at St. John's United Methodist Church in Watertown; from Haitian oun- gans and mambos to African-American root doctors, faith healers, and charismatic preachers.Many of these venues and modalities have been described and analyzed in a series of essays (ofwhich this booklet is the third) entitled Religious Healing in Boston and published by the Center for the Study of World Religions. These essays are avail-able on-line at: http://www.hds.harvard.edu/cswr/research/RHHI/rhhi_publications.html. In addition to the healing practices, approaches, rituals, and communities discussed in the Religious Healing in Boston volumes, over two hundred files containing material of all sorts related to religion, health, and healing in Boston have been collected byaffiliates of the Religion, Health, and HealingInitiative. This material has been organized into a database that has been passed on to HarvardUniversity's Pluralism Project as a part of its mission to help Americans engage with the realities of reli- gious diversity through research, outreach, and the active dissemination of resources. The material isavailable to students, chaplains, and other interested individuals. In order to arrange an appointment touse the database, please contact the PluralismProject staff.
