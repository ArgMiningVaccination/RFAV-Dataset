Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in [Section IV](#_Section_IV._Application_1). When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions. Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. There are several options available to submit your application through Grants.gov to NIH and Department of Health and Human Services partners. You must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity. Purpose: The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support innovative multidisciplinary, investigative, and collaborative research focused on developing and testing multi-level or multi-component strategies -including models of health care- that effectively adapt and implement recommended guidelines of comprehensive clinical care for individuals with Type 2 diabetes from populations with health disparities. This FOA is built on a previous Notice of Special Interest ( [NOT-MD-20-026](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MD-20-026.html)) which expires on May 8, 2021. Key Definitions NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations include Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities ( [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/)). The term \"multi-component\" refers to the different components of the health care models (e.g., health care system organization, clinician decision support, clinical information system, patient self-management support, delivery system design and community and peer or family resources and support). The term \"multi-level\" refers to the multi-dimensional framework of determinants relevant to understand and address minority health and health disparities. This concept is further described under the NIMHD Research Framework ( [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/)). Background: Most current national statistics reveal an overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus (all types) of 14.3%. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among racial/ethnic minorities has consistently been significantly higher (more recently in the 20.6%-23.5% range or twice as high) as that of non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) (11.3%) and is on the rise. In addition, the prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus in rural areas is 17% higher than in metropolitan areas, 20-55% higher in individuals from sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups than non-SGM individuals, and inversely associated with income and socioeconomic status. The limited existing data on diabetes-related complications in U.S. populations with health disparities points towards a significant risk of and burden of complications. For instance, some studies have demonstrated that African Americans have four times and Asians and Pacific Islanders have 1.5 times increased risk for diabetic retinopathy (DR) than NHWs, and individuals from rural settings may have 21% greater risk of DR than those living in urban settings. Other studies have reported that the prevalence of DR in Hispanics/Latinos could be up to 46.9% and for American Indians/Alaska Natives 45.3%. Also, Hispanic/Latinos, African Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives have 1.3-1.5 times greater risk for major amputations than NHWs. Regarding diabetic nephropathy, African Americans with Type 2 diabetes have been shown to have 1.5 greater risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to NHWs. Within a staff model Health Maintenance Organization with diabetes registry, all racial and ethnic minority patients had a significant elevated risk of ESRD compared to NHW. Albuminuria - a known risk factor for coronary artery disease in many populations- has been associated with increased risk left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction among American Indians with Type 2 diabetes. At the same time, from 1996 to 2016, studies have demonstrated a progressive decline in adjusted incidence of diabetes-related ESRD among African Americans (20% decline), American Indians/Alaska Natives (53% decline), and Hispanics/Latinos (33% decline) -no significant change among persons of Asian descent and 17% increase in NHWs- which has been attributed to increased prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). In addition, the Strong Heart Study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos have demonstrated significantly increased likelihood of microalbuminuria among American Indians and Hispanics/Latinos with prediabetes compared to those with normoglycemia. On the other hand, completion rates of all or some of the recommended clinical assessments for persons with diabetes (e.g., hemoglobin A1c /lipid/blood pressure targets, annual fundoscopic exam, foot exam, urine albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate, influenza/pneumonia vaccines and others) tend to be 10-30% lower for racial/ethnic minority populations than for NHWs. Compared to 25% in the U.S. States, only 7-11% of persons with diabetes in the U.S. territories Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam had engaged in biannual hemoglobin A1c testing, attendance to diabetes education classes, daily self-blood glucose monitoring, and annual foot exam. Persons with diabetes living in rural areas have 11-14% lower odds to have at least one foot exam or a fundoscopic exam in the past year than residents of urban areas. These lower completion rates may in part contribute to increased odds for preventable hospitalizations and readmissions. Patient-centered models of care, like the chronic care model (CCM), have been recommended as effective frameworks for optimal diabetes care. The implementation and effectiveness of the full CCM -or some of its variations or components- in the management of Type 2 diabetes have been studied in different populations and settings in the U.S. Significant improvement in clinical outcomes, cardiovascular risk scores, and completion rates of recommended tests have been demonstrated by some studies. Other studies have demonstrated improvement in glycemic control with the integration of cultural competence at the self-management and community resources levels, but no consistent improvement with interventions at the delivery system level. On the other hand, low adherence at the clinician decision support level and lack of necessary infrastructure for sustainable tele-health care delivery may have hindered the potential impact of embedding digital technology within components of the CCM. The percent of patients from racial/ethnic minority groups participating in the previously mentioned studies ranged between 1% and 13%, and very few studies have been dedicated to developing and testing the CCM or other models of diabetes care for populations with health disparities or within the context of low-income/low-resource clinical settings. Effective implementation of and adherence to recommended guidelines of care [e.g., assessment of risk of diabetes-related complications, setting optimal glycemic goals and control of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, designing a treatment plan, medical/dental/nutritional referrals, immunizations and other preventive services] are urgently needed for individuals with Type 2 diabetes from populations with health disparities. Effective strategies would be expected to have a positive impact on health outcomes across all populations, while potentially generating new information and research hypotheses on treatment effectiveness and precision medicine. Research Objectives The overarching goal of this FOA is to support innovative, multidisciplinary, and multi-level/multi-component research designed to optimize Type 2 diabetes care for populations with health disparities concordant with evidence-based guidelines. Proposed projects would be expected to develop and/or test and/or evaluate patient-centered strategies or health care models, which in addition to attainment of optimal glycemic control, would aim at attaining other goals related to recommended guidelines of care: annual fundoscopic exam, comprehensive foot evaluation at least once a year, annual urine albumin test, hemoglobin A1c testing at least two times a year or as needed, peripheral neuropathy assessment as needed -and other recommended assessments based on the patient's health profile- optimal blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol control, and intake of ACEI or ARB/statin/aspirin and other treatments and preventive care, as indicated. The effects of the implementation of these strategies or health care models on health outcomes and health care disparities, quality of life, optimal care of comorbidities, and prevention of short- and long-term complications associated with diabetes -including acute adverse events, infections, hypoglycemia, urgent/emergency care, hospitalizations, retinopathy and other ocular complications, nephropathy, neuropathy, lower extremity infections/amputations- are also of interest. In addition, the National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) is interested in interventions and approaches on increased screening of prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes and prevention of Type 2 diabetes in populations with health/health care disparities (see NIDDK Specific Research Areas of Interest below). Research Methodology The initiative will support interventions (especially multi-level or multi-component interventions), clinical trials (including cluster-randomized trials, pragmatic trials), quasi-experimental studies, mixed-methods studies, retrospective quantitative research, simulation modeling, policy evaluations, and evaluations of existing interventions and practices in health care settings serving U.S. populations with health disparities. Specific Areas of Interest Areas of interest include but are not limited to: Collaborating Institutes' Specific Areas of Interest: National Eye Institute (NEI) NEI is interested in research aimed at improving diabetes-related eye care in heath disparity populations. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to the following research areas: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) NIDDK is primarily interested in clinical trials aimed at prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, including diabetes-related complications in the mission of NIDDK such as metabolic liver disease, diabetic nephropathy and foot ulcers. Proposed observational studies should be limited to the evaluation of natural experiments that employ appropriate designs and methodologies necessary to strengthen casual inferences. Meaningful stakeholder engagement, particularly of hardly reached populations with health/ health care disparities, is strongly encouraged to inform the study design and conduct and to optimize potential uptake and sustainability. Specific topics include but are not limited to: The NIH Office on Research in Women's Health (ORWH) ORWH is part of the Office of the Director of the NIH and works in partnership with the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers to ensure that women's health research is part of the scientific framework at the NIH and is supported in the larger scientific community. ORWH uses a multidimensional framework to represent the intersection of factors that underlie patterns of disease and determinants of health outcomes in populations. Biomedical research that considers sex and gender influences, alongside race, social class and other factors, will enhance understanding and inform disease self-management, clinician/patient-clinician shared decision making, and access to care to ensure health equity and achieve optimal health outcomes for all. For purposes of this Funding Opportunity Announcement, ORWH is interested in providing support for innovative interdisciplinary, behavioral, clinical, and/or translational studies that contribute to diabetes treatment effectiveness, with a particular focus on populations of women who are understudied, underrepresented, and underreported in research.Examples include studies that seek to develop patient-centered care enhancements or create health promotion and health care intervention strategies.

Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact.

Are potential challenges and corresponding solutions discussed (e.g., strategies that can be implemented in the event of enrollment shortfalls)? Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Individuals Across the Lifespan When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Resubmissions For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Renewals For Renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period. Revisions Not Applicable Note: Effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023, the Data Sharing Plan and Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS) as part of the Resource Sharing Plan will not be evaluated at time of review. As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Applications from Foreign Organizations Not Applicable Select Agent Research Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Resource Sharing Plans Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical Resources: For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Budget and Period of Support Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by Center for Scientific Review, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](file:///C:/Users/mckenziene/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/13V4QPZR/Research%20Draft.doc#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications will receive a written critique. Applications may undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review) will be discussed and assigned an overall impact score. Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain applicable clinical trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigators scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicants integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants. This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Not Applicable Data Management and Sharing Note: The NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing is effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023. Consistent with the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.2.3_sharing_research_resources.htm#Data). Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described. A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
