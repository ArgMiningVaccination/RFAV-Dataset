An international online survey Jos/C19e Eizayaga1,*and Association, Rua Diogo de Faria 839, S ~ao Paulo, SP, Brazil Background and objectives: Parental refusal to vaccinate is a cause of serious concern. Use of homeopathy is believed to be a relevant reason for parents to refuse to vaccinate.However, vaccination is one of the main gaps dividing between medically qualied or not homeopathic practitioners. The present study sought to investigate the attitude of homeopathic doctors towards vaccination and associated variables.Methods: An international online survey was conducted with homeopathic doctors by means of an anonymous self-reported questionnaire in Portuguese or Spanish. Ques-tions investigated sociodemographic and professional characteristics, overall opinionon vaccination and on some specic vaccines.Results: A total of 512 responses were obtained, 77.5% of respondents were from Latin American countries, 16.8% from Spain, with small numbers from several other countries. About 75.6% of the respondents considered vaccination safe, effective and necessary, while 12.5% stated they would not recommend vaccination under any circumstance.The variables signicantly correlated with positive attitude towards vaccination were:working in the public health system (p = 0.04) and homeopathy not the main medical ac-tivity (p = 0.005). Homeopaths from Brazil, where homeopathy is ofcially accredited,were more favorable to vaccination compared to respondents from countries where ho-meopathy has inferior status (p < 0.001).Conclusion: The results show that there is no contradiction between homeopathy and primary prevention by means of vaccination.

Keywords: Vaccination; vaccinate is currently a cause of serious concern.1Every once in a while the mass media report on parents who upon deciding to treattheir children with homeopathy concomitantly refusevaccination by default. More serious, on occasions likethe outbreak of measles in California in 2015, countlessvoices are raised claiming that vaccines are not only inef-cacious, but also dangerous, among which many partisans of homeopathy. According to some studies, homeopathy is a relevant reason for parents to refuse to vaccinate theirchildren. 2,3As a result many equate homeopathy with no vaccination. To the public in general, including doctors, it is not clear that there is a large gap dividing between medically and non-medically qualied homeopaths. As a fact, practice of homeopathy by non-doctors is forbidden in severalcountries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France,Italy and Romania, and a large number of homeopathicpractitioners are medically qualied in several others,most notably Germany and the United Kingdom. One case in which the gap dividing between doctors and non-doctors is particularly patent is vaccination. 4Accord- ing to homeopathic doctors, only non-medically qualied practitioners have issues with vaccines,5while some studies showed that homeopathic doctors recommend vaccinationcorrectly. 6In Great Britain, the Faculty of Homeopathy rec- ommends the use of conventional vaccines,7while associa- tions of more numerous lay homeopathic practitioners*Correspondence: /C19e Enrique Eizayaga, Department of dr.silvia.waisse@gmail.com Received 21 September 2015; accepted 3 November 2015 Homeopathy (2016) 105, 180e185 /C2112015 The Faculty of Homeopathy.

Hismain concern in this regard was with the possibility that the lancets used could transmit other infectious diseases. 15 To the best our knowledge, one single study in Germany sought to assess the attitudes of homeopathic physicians to-wards vaccination 14 years ago. 16To achieve a broader un- derstanding of the current state of affairs, we conducted asurvey to investigate the attitudes toward vaccination ofmedically qualied homeopaths from Spanish and Portu-guese speaking countries to cover countries where homeo- pathic care is mostly, if not exclusively provided by doctors. Methods An online questionnaire, with slightly different versions in Spanish and Portuguese, was made available on GoogleForms from March 1 to June 30 2015 (Portuguese versioneP) and from April 1 to June 30 2015 (Spanish version e S) to be anonymously responded by homeopathic physi-cians only. The questionnaires were advertised in mailinglists of homeopathic doctors, professional associations of homeopathic doctors, homeopathic schools for doctors and closed groups in social networks. The questionnairescontained 13 closed-ended questions and one eld foroptional additional comments. The closed-ended questionsinvestigated demographic/professional characteristics(country of residence; length of experience homeopathy as main medical activity; experiencein homeopathy teaching; type of practice: children/adults, acute/chronic conditions) and attitudes toward vaccines (general beliefs on benecial effects, efcacy and safety;vaccination ofcial schedule; beliefs on frequency of com-mon and severe adverse events; recommendations made toparents/patients; and mandatory status of vaccination).One additional closed-ended question in the Portugueseversion concerned the work setting (public/private); Brazilis the only Portuguese/Spanish speaking country where ho- meopathic care is provided within the national health sys- tem. The present study was conducted within the context ofa collaborative initiative with the National Board of Con-trol of Immuno-preventable Diseases (DiNaCEI), HealthMinistry, Argentina, which asked to add a question whetherthe respondents kept themselves up-to-date as to the epide-miological status of preventable diseases and the changes in the latter incidence following vaccination. That question was included in the Spanish version only, as its nalversion was established after the Portuguese version wasmade available to respondents. The two versions of thequestionnaire are included as Supplementary materials . The results were analyzed by means of descriptive statis- tics using software Microsoft Excel 2007 /C210and described as absolute and relative frequencies. The results were analyzed by means of the chi-square or Fisher exact prob- ability test at 5% signicance http:// vassarstats.net ). Results A total of 302 responses to the Spanish and 210 to the Portuguese version of the questionnaire were obtained.As there are no ofcial data about the total number of actu-ally practicing homeopathic doctors in Spanish-speakingcountries, it was not possible to estimate the representative- ness of the sample. Relative to the Portuguese version, it was responded by 207 homeopathic doctors from Brazil,and further 13 Brazilians responded the Spanish version.According to the last census conducted by the BrazilianMedical Association in 2013, 172458 doctors self- declared to be accredited homeopaths, while the BrazilianMedical Homeopathic Association lists about 300 activemembers. 18 All the respondents reported to be medically qualied homeopathic practitioners. They reside in 20 differentcountries, being that Brazil (n = 220; 43.0%), Argentina(n = 90; 17.6%), Spain (n = 86; (n = 48;9.4%) and Colombia (n = 21; 4.1%) accounted for 90.9%of the respondents. The remainder of the participants(9.1%) was from the Americas (Uruguay, n = 6, 1.2%;United States, n = 4, 0.8%; Peru, n = 4, 0.8%; Venezuela, n = 4, 0.8%; Chile, n = 3, 0.6%; Costa Rica, n = 3, 0.6%, Paraguay, Cuba, Ecuador and El Salvador one respondenteach, 0.2%). Only two respondents (0.4%) were fromPortugal, there was one participant (0.2%) from India,Italy, the Netherlands and Romania each, and 13 (2.5%)did not answer this question. About 46.1% (n = 236) of the sample reported to have taught homeopathy in (non-degree) graduate programs. About 44.9% of the participants (n = 230) had practiced ho- meopathy for more than 20 years, 28.9% (n = 148) for lessthan 10 and 26.2% (n = 134) for 10 e20 years. Homeopath- ic practice was the main medical activity for 66.6% of thesample (n = 341). Most respondents reported to see adultsand children (n = 322; 62.9%) for acute and chronic com-plaints (n = 297; 58.0%); 63 participants (12.3%) see chil-dren only and 114 (22.3%) adults only. Among the 207 Brazilian doctors who responded the Portuguese version of the questionnaire, one-third(n = 71; 34.3%) provides homeopathic care at public healthservices full- or part-time, and 135 (65.2%) at their privatepractice only. Relative to the question introduced in theSpanish version of the questionnaire upon DiNaCEIHomeopathic doctors and vaccination JE Eizayaga and S Waisse 181 Homeopathyrequest, 65.6% (n = 198) of the respondents reported to keep themselves up-to-date or quite up-to-date as to theepidemiological situation in their country of residence. The data relative to the respondents' global opinion on the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, current vaccina- tion schedule, mandatory status of vaccination and recom- mendations made to parents/patients are described inTable 1 . The data indicate that the Portuguese-speaking respon- dents consider vaccination signicantly or almost signi-cantly more necessary and safer, the ofcial vaccinationschedule more reasonable and mandatory, and are morekeen to recommend it to patients/parents compared to the Spanish-speaking respondents. The respondents' opinion on specic vaccines is de- picted in Figure 1 . The least accepted vaccines (less than 50% of respondents; influenza, human papillomavirus -HPV, rotavirus, hepatitis A, and varicella) are representedon the left of the graph, while the most accepted ones (diph-theria/pertussis/tetanus eDPT, Haemophilus influenzae type b eHiB, oral polio eOPV, and hepatitis B) on the right side. The pneumococcal, meningococcal, measles/ mumps/rubella eMMR and BCG vaccines have an inter- mediate position.As we wanted to identify variables possibly correlated with the attitude of homeopathic doctors towards vacci-nation, we included in the questionnaire a hypotheticalquestion meant to probe into the respondents' soundestconvictions as to the subject of interest: \" If there were a highly efcient and safe vaccine for a frequent and se- vere illness with high morbidity and mortality rates,would you recommend them it to patients/parents? \" Then we analyzed the correlation of the following vari-ables to the responses given to that question: length ofhomeopathic practice; works at the public health systemor not; sees children; teaches homeopathy or not; home-opathy is the main activity or not; and is or not up-to- date as to the epidemiological situation in the respective country. About 67.0% of the respondents answered they would indeed recommend a highly effective and safe vaccinefor a frequent and severe illness and 15.2% that they wouldnot, while 16.6% manifested to be unsure. The variablessignicantly associated with a more positive attitude to-wards vaccination were to work in the public health system (p = 0.04) and homeopathy not being the main medical ac- tivity (p = 0.005). The homeopathic doctors who see chil-dren only (probably pediatricians) exhibited an almostTable 1 Overall opinion of homeopathic doctors on vaccination Questionnaire items Portuguese questionnaire, n (%)Spanish questionnaire, n (%)Total, n (%)P-value* Overall opinion on vaccination Is necessary, effective and safe 44 (21.0) 17 (5.6) 61 (11.9) <0.001 Only some vaccines are necessary, effective and safe 134 (63.8) 192 (63.6) 327 (63.7) Is unnecessary, poorly effective and unsafe 28 (13.3) 88 (29.1) 116 (22.7)Don't know or missing 4 (1.9) 5 (1.7) 9 (1.8)The current vaccination schedule isReasonable 57 (27.1) 38 (12.6) 95 (18.6) <0.001Excessive 123 (58.6) 166 (55.0) 289 (56.4) Absurd and irrational 25 (11.9) 79 (26.2) 104 (20.3) Don't know or missing 5 (2.4) 19 (6.3) 24 (4.7)Occurrence of severe adverse events isVery rare (<1/10,000) 36 (17.1) 45 (14.9) 81 (15.8) 0.05Rare (1/1000 to 1/10,000) 61 (29.0) 59 (19.5) 120 (23.4)Infrequent (1/100 to 1/1000) 44 (21.0) 74 (24.5) 118 (23.0) Frequent (1/10 to 1/100) 48 (22.9) 80 (26.5) 128 (25.0) Very frequent (>1/10) 6 (2.9) 19 (6.3) 25 (4.9)Don't know or missing 15 (7.1) 25 (8.3) 40 (7.8)Occurrence of common adverse events isVery rare (<1/10,000) 8 (3.8) 4 (1.3) 12 (2.3) 0.43Rare (1/1000 to 1/10,000) 17 (8.1) 26 (8.6) 43 (8.4)Infrequent (1/100 to 1/1000) 32 (15.2) 43 (14.2) 75 (14.6) Frequent (1/10 to 1/100) 98 (46.7) 151 (50.0) 249 (48.6) Very frequent (>1/10) 43 (20.5) 67 (22.2) 110 (21.5)Don't know or missing 12 (5.7) 11 (3.6) 23 (4.5)Recommendations to patients/parentsOfcial vaccination schedule + other vaccines 12 (5.7) 13 (4.3) 25 (4.9) <0.001Ofcial vaccination schedule 93 (44.3) 34 (11.3) 127 (24.8) Some vaccines only 72 (34.3) 161 (53.3) 233 (45.5) Not to vaccinate 17 (8.1) 47 (15.6) 64 (12.5)Doesn't make recommendations on vaccination 16 (7.6) 45 (14.9) 61 (11.9)Don't know or missing - 2 (0.7) 2 (0.4)Vaccination should be mandatoryAgree 59 (28.1) 42 (13.9) 101 (19.7) <0.001Disagree 139 (66.2) 242 (80.1) 381 (74.4) Don't know or missing 12 (5.7) 18 (6.0) 30 (5.9) *P-value of the difference between responses to the Portuguese and Spanish versions of the questionnaire, chi-square test; \" Don't know \" and missing responses excluded from analysis.Homeopathic doctors and vaccination JE Eizayaga and S Waisse 182 Homeopathysignicant more favorable attitude towards vaccination compared to the ones who see both children and adults oradults only (p = 0.067). These ndings suggest that the more integrated home- opathy is with conventional medicine and the morefrequent the interactions of homeopathic doctors withtheir conventional peers are, the more favorable the atti-tude of homeopathic doctors toward vaccination. Rein- forcing this hypothesis, comparison of the answers given to this question by the respondents from the fourmost expressive countries showed that the Brazilian ho-meopaths were signicantly more favorable to vaccina-tion compared to the Spanish-speaking ones (p < 0.001).In Brazil homeopathy is an accredited medical specialtyincluded also in the public health system and funded byinsurance companies, while among Spanish-speaking countries only in Mexico homeopathy is an accredited medical specialty, while at the same time also lay practiceis admitted ( Table 2 ).Discussion To the best of our knowledge, one single study sought to investigate the attitudes of homeopathic doctors towardsvaccination. 16In that study performed in Germany in 2001, 219 homeopathic and 281 conventional doctors re-sponded a questionnaire (response rate: 30.4%). Overall,the homeopaths did not refuse vaccination, but viewedthem with a specic hierarchy, as also did the participantsin our study. While no divergences were found between the groups relative to the tetanus, diphtheria and polio vac- cines, more German homeopaths refused vaccines againstchildhood diseases, risk group vaccines and the onesjudged inefcacious compared to the non-homeopaths(p < 0.001). Relative to the overall opinion of doctors about vaccina- tion, one study recently conducted in Israel found that92.2% of the pediatricians surveyed (n = 376) considered that vaccination is in the baby's best interest. 19In our study, Figure 1 Participants' answers to question: \" To what population would you recommend this vaccine? \" P: Portuguese questionnaire only; S: Spanish questionnaire only.

Missing responses excluded from analysis.Homeopathic doctors and vaccination JE Eizayaga and S Waisse 183 Homeopathyonly 11.3% of the respondents who see children only (probably pediatricians) declared to be absolutely against vaccination. Refusal to vaccinate is currently a serious cause of concern.1In the just mentioned study conducted in Israel,19 identical proportions of pediatricians (38.9%) consideredthat parents have the right to decide or that vaccinationshould be mandatory. In a survey conducted with 395members of the European Academy of Pediatrics Research in Ambulatory network, 69% of the participants reported to prefer a shared decision-making approach. 20In our study, 74.4% of the respondents asserted that patients/parentsshould be free to make their own choices. It is worth tonotice that vaccination is mandatory in most South Amer-ican countries, as well as in Mexico and Spain. In one study conducted in Spain in 2013, 21a question- naire was delivered to patients/parents seeking care (122 respondents/265 eligible sub- jects, response rate: 46.0%). While the primary outcomeswere ethical features of medical practice, some ndingsare relevant to our subject of interest. Questions 6 and 7specically targeted vaccination: the respondents' beliefson vaccination and what their homeopathic and conven-tional doctors had discussed with them in this regard.Almost one third of the sample (28%) reported not to have discussed vaccines with their homeopathic doctors and 15% to have largely discussed vaccines with their ho-meopathic physicians, who respected their decision. In ourstudy, only 11.9% of the respondents (P: 7.6%; S: 14.9%)stated they make no recommendations on vaccinationwhatsoever, which allows inferring that they neitherdiscuss it with patients/parents. About 19% of the respon-dents in the Spanish study stated they preferred homeopa- thy to the point of refusing vaccination and 8% agreed to selected vaccines only, quite close to the proportion ofthe ones who said their homeopathic doctors were rathercritical and recommended selected vaccines only (6%).No respondent reported their homeopathic doctor had triedto dissuade them from vaccination. Curiously, 70% of therespondents declared to ignore the opinion of their conven-tional doctors on vaccination, while 25% informed such doctors were favorable to mass vaccination and had a nega- tive attitude towards homeopathy. Most respondents consider that vaccination is frequently/very frequently associated with common sideevents (70.1%), and about one-third (29.9%) that isfrequently/very frequently associated with severe adverseevents. This perception runs against the currently availabledata on the safety of vaccines, 22,23and might probably be accounted for by the specicity of the factors considered in homeopathic clinical practice.24,25 The main limitation of the present study derives from the lack of accurate information on the number of actuallypracticing homeopathic doctors in any country in theworld, as any formally trained physician is entitled to pre-scribe homeopathic medicines independently from havingor not attended a formal training course in homeopathy. As a result, we were not able to estimate the representativeness of the study population. Closely related, another limitationderives from the fact we chose to distribute the question- naire online, which precluded any estimation of the poten- tially eligible participants. Those shortcomings notwithstanding, the responses ob- tained point to a favorable attitude towards vaccinationamong medically qualied homeopaths. In addition, it isworth to notice that on July 28 2015, a joint position state-ment was published by the Health Ministry of Argentina,representatives of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Argentinian National Immunizations Com- mittee and a panel of experts in complementary and alter-native medicine, including homeopathic doctors. 26 According to that statement, there is no contradiction be-tween complementary and alternative therapeutic ap-proaches and primary prevention by means ofvaccination and that for parents/patients to made sound de-cisions in this regard they must have access to accurate in- formation. Conclusion Most homeopathic physicians agreed that vaccination is an effective and safe preventive tool, with different rates of acceptance of the individual vaccines. In addition, positive attitude among homeopaths towards vaccines correlatedwith indicators of better integration to mainstream medi-cine. We believe that the results of the present study are rele- vant for primary care doctors. so as to be able to provideaccurate information to parents/patients who also seek ho-meopathic care and thus contribute to reduce the preva- lence of refusal to vaccinate. Similar studies ought to be conducted with homeopathic doctors from other countriesto conrm the results of the present one. More rigorous re-cords of the actually practicing medically qualied homeo-paths are needed to establish the representativeness ofsamples. Conflict ofinterest None.
