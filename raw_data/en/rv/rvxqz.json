The degree typically takes about two years to complete, though programs might offer accelerated formats for professionals already in the field. Students completing their coursework part-time might need longer to graduate. Earning an MPH degree can help professionals land a variety of roles within the public health field. Many graduates become epidemiologists, conducting work as experts in the spread of diseases. In addition to interesting work, the epidemiology career path offers lucrative compensation and promising career growth. Epidemiologists earn a [median annual salary of $70,990](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/epidemiologists.htm), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS also projects the number of jobs for epidemiologists to increase by 5% between 2019 and 2029. MPH students who specialize in education often become community health educators. The BLS reports that these professionals make [median earnings of nearly $47,000](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/health-educators.htm), and the projected job growth from 2019 to 2029 could reach 13%, much faster than the national average for all occupations.
