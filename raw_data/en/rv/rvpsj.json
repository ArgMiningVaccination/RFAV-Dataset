Furthermore, to exclude the negative effect of EOs on the lactic acid bacteria (LABs) (Streptococcus spp.) on cheeses, their influence was monitored. Next, the sensory evaluation of cheese treated by EOs was evaluated. The results show that litsea and clove EOs were the most effective in the vapor phase against both tested strains. These EOs were characterized by the highest amount of - (40.00%) and -Citral (34.35%) in litsea and eugenol (85.23%) in clove. The antitoxicogenic activity of less effective (in growth inhibition) EOs on cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) production by the tested strains was also observed. The growth of Streptococcus spp. (ranging from 8.11 to 9.69 log CFU/g) was not affected by the EOs in treated cheese. Even though the evaluators recognized some EOs in sensory evaluation by the triangle test, they did not have a negative effect on the taste and smell of the treated cheeses and were evaluated as edible. The antifungal activity of EOs against several types of microscopic fungi and their effect on the sensory properties of treated foods needs to be further tested to achieve the most effective protection of foods from their direct contaminants.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-04", "cleaned_text": "The Vapor Phase of Selected Essential Oils and Their Antifungal Activity In Vitro and In Situ against Penicillium commune, a Common Contaminant of Cheese [https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11213517](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11213517) [Food Microbiology](/journal/foods/sections/Food_Microbiology)) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-foods-11-03517)]. Cheese spoilage by fungi is a problem associated with quality reduction due to visible or invisible undesirable changes such as an unpleasant odor or flavor [ [2](#B2-foods-11-03517)]. Some of the microscopic fungi growing on dairy products may also produce secondary metabolites\u2014mycotoxins\u2014hence, constituting a potential risk to food safety and, therefore, to human health [ [3](#B3-foods-11-03517)]. The fungal genus most frequently isolated from spoiled cheese that regularly dominates in many studies is Penicillium, specifically, the Penicillium commune species (42%). P. commune can synthesize cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) [ [4](#B4-foods-11-03517)]. CPA is not considered a potent acute toxin. However, chronic exposure to CPA can cause degenerative effects (nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, etc.), and its occurrence in food should not be underestimated [ [5](#B5-foods-11-03517)]. [6](#B6-foods-11-03517), [7](#B7-foods-11-03517)]. In addition, essential oils (EOs) or their components, as natural antimicrobial agents, could protect against microbial damage to the cheese and thus prolong its storability [ [8](#B8-foods-11-03517)]. The antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of EOs against a wide range of microorganisms have already been confirmed. Due to their hydrophobicity, individual components of EOs easily pass through prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membranes, interfering with molecular transport mechanisms and leading to cell lysis [ [9](#B9-foods-11-03517)]. Some EOs can even inhibit the production of secondary metabolites, mycotoxins [ [10](#B10-foods-11-03517), [11](#B11-foods-11-03517)]. Laird and Phillips [ [12](#B12-foods-11-03517)] compared studies of the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of EOs in the vapor and liquid phases and indicated that the use of the EO vapors seems to be more effective. Inouye et al. [ [13](#B13-foods-11-03517)] indicated that the reason why the vapor phase is more effective could be that the lipophilic components of the EOs react with the aqueous components of the nutrient medium (micelles are formed) and this prevents the attachment of the EOs to the microorganism. EO vapors, on the other hand, can freely attach to the microorganism. Moreover, the vapor phase does not affect the sensory properties of food, accordingly, as the EO liquids do. However, the applied concentration of EOs should be considered carefully because the aromatic properties of these substances are still intense and could have different interactions on various food matrices [ [14](#B14-foods-11-03517)]. Therefore, they are suitable for use in the food industry as preservatives. Their application in food is regulated by The European Commission in Europe and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. EOs are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA, which makes them ideal antimicrobial agents and preservatives [ [15](#B15-foods-11-03517)]. [16](#B16-foods-11-03517)]. EOs and their effects directly on cheeses have already been tested by several authors, for example, by direct addition to the cheese during its preparation [ [17](#B17-foods-11-03517)], encapsulation, and subsequent application to cheeses [ [18](#B18-foods-11-03517)], or by using films or coatings on the surface of cheeses [ [19](#B19-foods-11-03517)]. However, the effect of the vapor phase of EOs on the growth of spoilage fungi, the production of their mycotoxins, and their influence on the organoleptic properties of cheeses directly in the in situ conditions (on the cheese samples) have not been investigated yet. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Essential Oils Samples [11](#B11-foods-11-03517)]. Authentication of the relative proportion of the EO constituents was confirmed by comparing their spectra with authentic standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). 2.1.1. Fungal Strains [20](#B20-foods-11-03517), [21](#B21-foods-11-03517)]. The following accession numbers were generated by the GenBank database, where obtained sequences were deposited: OP439736 (P. commune and HiMedia, Mumbai, India) for antifungal activity testing was used in this study. At the beginning of this experiment, the highest concentration of EOs (500 L/L of air) was tested. The EOs were applied using a micropipette onto the filter paper disks (d = 30 mm) placed on the inner surface of the lids. The Petri dishes (PDs) divided into three sectors were used in independent repetitions (n = 6). Each sector of the PD contained 5 mL of SDA medium. After preparation and inoculation (in the center of each sector of PDs) with fungal strains, the Petri dishes were tightly sealed with parafilm and cultivated. The cultivation of Penicillium strains was performed in two ways. Diameters of fungal colonies and their growth were measured on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 14th day of incubation in two perpendicular directions at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Parallel cultivation of fungal isolates with EOs was done at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C in a refrigerator for 35 days and diameters of fungal colonies were measured on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, 14th, 21st, 28th, and 35th day. The percentage of mycelial growth inhibition after all cultivation days was calculated according to the following formula: 2.1.3. Cyclopiazonic Acid (CPA) Analysis [22](#B22-foods-11-03517), [23](#B23-foods-11-03517)]. The inhibition of CPA by EOs was tested after 14 and 35 days of Penicillium commune cultivation after treatment with EOs only at the highest tested concentration of 500 \u00b5L/L of air. Penicillium strains were cultivated on Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA, HiMedia, Mumbai, India) at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 14 days and at 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 35 days and treated by EOs (500 L/L of air) in the same way as described in [Section 2.1.2](#sec2dot1dot2-foods-11-03517). Only strains that showed visible growth in treatment with EOs and control samples were used for analysis. One or two small pieces (each 5 \u00d7 5 mm) (the number of pieces depended on how large the colony had grown but could not be smaller than 1 cm) were cut from the growing colony on CYA plates and placed into 1.5 mL microtubes. Then, 500 mL of extraction solvent (chloroform:methanol, 2:1, v/v) was added to the microtubes containing the agar plugs and shaken on a vortex for at least 2 min. Subsequently, 30-50 \u00b5L of the obtained extracts were applied as spots on the TLC plate (Silicagel 60, Merck, Munich, Germany) 1 cm apart. Consequently, the spots were dried, and the plates were developed in a toluene:ethylacetate: formic acid (6:3:1, v/v/v) solvent system that gave an average Rf value of 0.65 for CPA. CPA was visualized as a violet tailing spot visible at daylight after applying Ehrlich's reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and heating the chromatographic plate to 130 \u00b0C for 8 min. The authentic standard of CPA (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) as a positive control was used. 2.2. In Situ Antifungal Analysis on Cheese 2.2.1. Cheese Inoculation and Essential Oil Treatment [10](#B10-foods-11-03517)]. The cheese samples (45% Edam cheese obtained from different markets in Slovakia) with no signs of damage on the surface were cut into slices (approximately 50 g). The cheese slices were placed into 0.5 L sterile glass jars with a diameter of 115 mm and height 95 mm with arch cap and rubber seal (Bromioli Rocco, Fidenza, Italy). Fungal spore suspension of both Penicillium strains (final concentration of spores 1 \u00d7 106 spores/mL) was prepared according to Boik et al. [ [24](#B24-foods-11-03517)] by adjusting the density of suspension to 0.8 McFarland units. Subsequently, a 5 L of the inoculum was added on top of the cheese slices at four different places. EOs were selected according to their best activity (where no fungal growth was detected) in evaluation of MIDs. Other ineffective EOs were not forwarded to in situ evaluation. Then, a 100 L of each solution (EOs dissolved in ethyl acetate) was evenly distributed on a sterile paper filter disc (60 mm). The paper filter disc impregnated with EOs was inserted into the cover of the jar. The control group did not receive any EO treatment. Jars were hermetically closed and kept at refrigerator temperature (5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) for 35 days in the dark. After 14 and 35 days of storage, the colonies with visible mycelial growth were counted. 2.2.2. Essential Oil Effect on Lactic Acid Bacterial Vitality 2.2.3. Sensory Evaluation of Treated Cheese [Section 2.2.1](#sec2dot2dot1-foods-11-03517)The control sets were prepared with distilled water. The glasses prepared in this way were stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Sensory evaluation of cheese samples treated with EOs was performed after 14 and 35 days of storage in the cold. Then the triangle tests (two-tail) were used to evaluate differences between sensory characteristics of treated and untreated (control) samples according to ISO Standards 4120 [ [25](#B25-foods-11-03517)]. Fifteen untrained assessors participated in the sensory evaluation. Each assessor received three coded samples each time (two from the same treatment and one without treatment). The assessors had to choose samples that differed from the other two in order to assess the acceptability of the taste and aroma of the treated cheeses. Water was used to neutralize the taste, and roasted coffee beans were used to neutralize the smell of cheese samples. 2.3. Statistical Evaluation [25](#B25-foods-11-03517)]. If the number of correct answers was greater than or equal to the value in the consulting tables (ISO 4120:2004) between the samples, a difference was detected. The obtained data were evaluated using the chi-squared binomial distribution with -risk = 0.05 [ [26](#B26-foods-11-03517)]. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. In Vitro Inhibitory Effect of Essential Oils on P. commune Strain Growth and MID Evaluation [27](#B27-foods-11-03517)]. Moreover, P. commune can produce cyclopiazonic acid. Therefore, it is necessary to look for possible ways to prevent its growth in food [ [28](#B28-foods-11-03517)]. Thus, in this study, the antifungal effect of the 14 EOs was evaluated using the gas diffusion method against two Penicillium commune strains isolated from cheese. Firstly, to verify the antifungal effect of the used EOs, a higher concentration of 500 L/L of air was used. Antifungal activity was tested at two cultivation temperatures of 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (cultivation for 14 days) and 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (cultivation for 35 days). The results ( [Table 1](#foods-11-03517-t001)) show that EOs which were able to inhibit the growth of P. commune strains (KMi-183 and KMi-402) at both cultivation temperatures (5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) [11](#B11-foods-11-03517), the genus Penicillium [ [22](#B22-foods-11-03517), [23](#B23-foods-11-03517), [30](#B30-foods-11-03517)]. The growth of P. commune strain KMi-402 was also entirely inhibited by cumin and marjoram EOs after 14 days of cultivation at 25 \u00b0C and by fennel, anise, cumin, sage, and marjoram after 35 days of cultivation at 5 \u00b0C too. The growth of strain P. commune KMi-183 was inhibited entirely after 35 days of cultivation at 5 \u00b0C by anise, cumin, and marjoram EOs. Therefore, anise, cumin, and marjoram EOs showed 100% growth inhibition of both P. commune strains only at a lower temperature (5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) during the 35 days of cultivation. In this study, P. commune strain KMi-183 was more resistant to the treatment by EOs at both used cultivation temperatures (25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C, cultivation for 14 days and 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C, cultivation for 35 days) compared to control sets and the second strain KMi-403. EOs which were able to inhibit mycelial growth of P. commune strain KMi-183 with a very good inhibitory effect (over 80%) at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C included only cumin (87.46%) and marjoram (81.71%). In addition, other authors confirmed the good, but not better, antifungal activity of cumin EO against fungal species of Aspergillus flavus [ [31](#B31-foods-11-03517), [32](#B32-foods-11-03517)] some species of Penicillium and of marjoram EO against Candida albicans [ [34](#B34-foods-11-03517)]. Eucalyptus and bergamot mint EOs showed the lowest inhibitory effect. In our study, the bergamot mint EO was characterized by the highest proportion of linalool (37.2%) and geraniol (42.1%). Other authors have also reported that EOs with a higher content of these components have a stimulating or no inhibitory effect on fungal growth [ [35](#B35-foods-11-03517), [36](#B36-foods-11-03517)]. The growth of P. commune strains was inhibited by bergamot mint after the 14th day of cultivation only with an MGI of 17.30% (strain KMi-183) and 33.67% (strain Kmi-402) and after the 35th day of cultivation with an MGI of 4.51% (strain KMi-183) and 11.77% (strain KMi-402). Despite the negative results obtained in treating P. commune strains with bergamot mint EO in our study, its antifungal activity has been reported in a study by Jakowienko et al. [ [37](#B37-foods-11-03517)]. However, they used a disc diffusion method for testing the antifungal activity. However, Fazal et al. [ [38](#B38-foods-11-03517)] state that EO from Mentha citrata L. is characterized by excellent antibacterial activity. In treatment with eucalyptus EO, strains of P. commune started to grow already on the third day of cultivation with an MGI after all cultivation periods of 2.80% (25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and 16.08% (5 36.34% (5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) for strain KMi-402. The results are comparable with Davari and Ezazi [ [39](#B39-foods-11-03517)], who tested the antifungal activity of several EOs, including eucalyptus EO, against the growth of important phytopathogenic fungi. They found that eucalyptus EO showed either a moderate or very weak inhibitory effect on the growth of these fungal species. The weak or moderate inhibitory effect of eucalyptus EO has also been demonstrated by Schroder et al. [ [40](#B40-foods-11-03517)]. On the contrary, the very good antifungal activity of eucalyptus EO has been demonstrated in the work of other authors, Umereweneza et al. [ [41](#B41-foods-11-03517)], but against different fungal species: R. nigricans, A. flavus, A. niger, A. parasiticus, F. oxysporum, and P. digitatum. However, in their research, the authors did not use the vapor phase of EOs but tested its antifungal activity in a contact form using the microdilution method. [Table 2](#foods-11-03517-t002). [42](#B42-foods-11-03517), [43](#B43-foods-11-03517)]. 3.2. Analyses of the Essential Oils [Table 3](#foods-11-03517-t003)) of the tested EOs were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The tested EOs used in this study belong to four different plant families (Apiaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, and Laureaceae). All EOs belonging to the Apiaceae family (fennel, anise, and cumin EOs) showed relatively significant antifungal effects, depending on the strain tested and the cultivation temperature. The results of the analysis (GC-MS and GC-MS FID) show that the EOs with the highest representation of trans anethole had the greatest antifungal effect on the growth of both tested strains: fennel (79.92%), anise (93.30%), and cumin (55.06%) EOs. Our results correspond to results of other authors, who found that cumin and anise EOs showed very good inhibitory effects on the growth of tested fungi. These authors also reported a similar composition of the main components in the used EOs [ [33](#B33-foods-11-03517), [44](#B44-foods-11-03517)]. The excellent inhibitory effect of cumin EO (Carum carvi L.) was also found in the study of Romagnoli et al. [ [45](#B45-foods-11-03517)]. At the same time, the authors also analyzed the chemical composition of cumin EO using GS-MS and they found the presence of -cymene as one of the main components in a higher amount (22.70%), similarly to our study (22.70% of p-cymene in cumin EO). EOs belonging to the Lamiaceae family (thyme, red thyme, rosemary, bergamot mint, sage, marjoram, and basil EOs) showed different antifungal effects on the growth of tested strains depending on their chemical composition and the content of the main components. The EOs that showed the best antifungal effect on the growth of both tested strains (100%) contained the highest levels of thymol in thyme (43.10%) and red thyme (51.51%) EOs. The main components of EOs include primarily phenolic compounds (terpenoids and phenylpropanoids), such whose antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antifungal properties have been verified by some authors [ [46](#B46-foods-11-03517), [47](#B47-foods-11-03517)]. The EOs which did not show significant inhibitory effects compared to others from this family were those with the highest amount of estragole (88.60% in basil), geraniol (42.10% in bergamot mint), and eucalyptol (42.90% in rosemary). On the contrary, Da Silva Bomfim et al. [ [48](#B48-foods-11-03517)] reported significant antifungal, antibacterial, or antioxidant effects of rosemary EO with the main component of eucalyptol (52.2%). In our study, EO from bergamot mint showed the lowest inhibitory effect on the growth of both tested strains. Nevertheless, some authors reported that geraniol has a very good inhibitory activity against fungi such as Aspergillus flavus and A. [ Narasimham [51](#B51-foods-11-03517)], geraniol against niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Penicillium digitatum, found that geraniol failed to completely inhibit these fungi and was more active only against Rhizopus stolonifer and Mucor sp., after adding it to liquid medium. From EOs belonging to the Myrtaceae family (clove, eucalyptus, and niaouli EOs), only clove EO with a higher proportion of eugenol (82.30%) showed significant inhibitory effects against the tested strains. Eugenol was also reported as the main component in clove EO in the study of Mulla et al. [ [52](#B52-foods-11-03517)], and at the same time, significant antioxidant, insecticidal, and antifungal properties are attributed to it. The last analyzed EO was litsea, which belongs to the with -citral (32.75%) and -citral (40.00%) as the main compounds showed complete inhibitory effects on the growth of the tested strains. Our results agree with other authors who reported a similar composition and inhibitory effect of this EO [ [42](#B42-foods-11-03517), [53](#B53-foods-11-03517)]. 3.3. In Vitro Inhibitory Effect of Tested Essential Oils on CPA Production [54](#B54-foods-11-03517)]. Due to their thermostability, their content in milk does not change significantly even by heat treatment (pasteurization). However, not all mycotoxins pose a major hazard, such as the production of CPA by Penicillium commune or Penicillium camemberti strains. However, long-term exposure to this mycotoxin present in food or feed can have various adverse effects on human or animal health. For example, Izzo et al. [ [55](#B55-foods-11-03517)] analyzed 68 types of commercial and traditional Slovak cheeses to investigate the occurrence of fungal metabolites. They found the presence of fungal mycotoxin contamination (28 analytes) in all cheese samples, and the most often detected mycotoxin was cyclopiazonic acid (102.9%). The significant antitoxicogenic properties of EOs and their potential use for reducing or eliminating mycotoxins in food were previously confirmed [ [10](#B10-foods-11-03517), [11](#B11-foods-11-03517), [20](#B20-foods-11-03517), [21](#B21-foods-11-03517), [22](#B22-foods-11-03517), [23](#B23-foods-11-03517)]. Therefore, in this study, the antitoxicogenic activity of the tested EOs was also evaluated. For this study, only these EOs were selected which did not show a complete inhibition of P. commune strains growth after 14 days of cultivation at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (eucalyptus, niaouli, fennel, basil, rosemary, sage EOs for both strains and anise and bergamot mint EOs for strain P. commune KMi-183) and after 35 days of cultivation at 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (eucalyptus, niaouli, fennel, basil, rosemary, and sage EOs for strain P. commune KMi-183 and bergamot mint EO for strain P. commune KMi-402). At the same time, the diameter of the grown colony had to be 1 cm in order to obtain the amount needed for TLC analysis. [Table 4](#foods-11-03517-t004)) show that some EOs were not able to inhibit the growth of the tested strains completely, but they were able to suppress the production of cyclopiazonic acid. The obtained results were compared with the control sets and then expressed as the percentage of inhibition or production of mycotoxin (CPA). [21](#B21-foods-11-03517)] tested the in vitro antitoxicogenic effect of some EOs (including sage, eucalyptus, and basil) on the production of secondary metabolites (aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin G1) by thin-layer chromatography under in vitro conditions. Their results show a very good inhibitory effect of these EOs. The similar results with sage EO against CPA production obtained by Foltinov\u00e1 et al. [ [56](#B56-foods-11-03517)] and with basil EO against aflatoxins production was reported by authors Nazzaro et al. [ [57](#B57-foods-11-03517)]. A high inhibitory effect of CPA production in both tested strains of P. commune (more than 50%) in bergamot (83.33% for P. commune KMi-183) and rosemary (66.67% for P. commune Kmi-402) Eos were determined. Kedia et al. [ [31](#B31-foods-11-03517)] reported the antitoxicogenic effect of mint EO (Mentha spicata L.) on the production of aflatoxin B1 at even lower concentrations compared to that which was effective in inhibiting the growth of the Aspergillus flavus strain. Other EOs, such as fennel (33.33% for strain KMi-183 and 50% for strain KMi-402) and anise (50% for both tested strain), had a lower antitoxicogenic effect on CPA production. Nevertheless, Aly et al. [ [58](#B58-foods-11-03517)] found that anise EO was able to completely inhibit the production of aflatoxin B1 produced by A. flavus, A. parasiticus, and fumonisins by Fusarium verticillioides. However, growth of these fungi was inhibited to 85% only. In addition, Prakash et al. [ [59](#B59-foods-11-03517)] observed the differences in the effect of tested EOs on both the growth of microscopic fungi and the production of mycotoxins. [60](#B60-foods-11-03517)] also report that those EOs that contain a high content of limonene (for example, dill, bergamot, lemon, or grapefruit EOs) did not inhibit the growth of the tested fungal strains but had the strongest inhibitory effect on the production of their secondary metabolites. Bergamot mint (66.67% for strain KMi-183 and 83.33% for strain KMi-402) and rosemary EOs (83.33% for strain KMi-183) also showed a very high inhibition effect on the production of CPA. 3.4. In Situ Antifungal Activity of Essential Oils on the Model Food (Cheese Samples) 3.4.1. Determination of MID Values in In Situ Condition [Table 5](#foods-11-03517-t005)). The effect of EOs on the growth of P. commune strain KMi-402 after 14 days of cultivation at 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C is shown in [Figure 1](#foods-11-03517-f001). The sensitive strain P. commune KMi-402 was inhibited by the lowest inhibitory doses (MID50 and MID90) of all tested EOs on both 14th and 35th cultivation days at 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. The lowest MIDs50 after 14 days of cultivation for this strain was found in treatment with litsea (27.68 L/L), MID90 86.06 L/L after 35 days of cultivation) EOs were also the most effective, with a significant growth inhibition of the P. commune KMi-183 strain. Excellent antifungal effects at reduced concentrations in the vapor phase of EOs were confirmed with litsea [ [11](#B11-foods-11-03517), previous studies. [32](#B32-foods-11-03517)], who tested the inhibitory effect of cumin EO through its encapsulation in a nanogel on the growth of some species of fungi. The lowest inhibitory doses of cumin EO for the tested fungi were recorded at a concentration of 350 L/L, in comparison with the effect of cumin EO tested alone (without encapsulation); mycelial growth was inhibited completely only at a concentration of 650 L/L. According to our results, marjoram EO was evaluated as the least effective from all EOs tested in this study. This EO was able to inhibit the growth of P. commune only up to the 14th day of cultivation, with values of MID50 of 292.36 not able to inhibit the growth of both tested strains after 35 days of cultivation and, therefore, it was not possible to determine the MID50 and MID90 of this EO (MID > 250) using probit analysis. Similar results were obtained by Massoud et al. [ [61](#B61-foods-11-03517)], who found that, among all tested EOs, marjoram was the least effective and was able to inhibit the growth of Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium moniliforme by only 18 to 27% at the highest tested concentration (625 L/L). Similarly, Nedorostov\u00e1 et al. [ [62](#B62-foods-11-03517)] evaluated marjoram EO as one of the least effective against tested strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with MID values of 530 L/L at the highest tested concentration (530-8.3 L/L). Our results show that EOs influenced the growth of the tested strains in situ (except litsea and clove) only at higher concentrations. This is related to the food matrix, as the antifungal or antibacterial effect of EOs can affect the composition of the food. A similar conclusion was observed in our previous study, where EOs also inhibited the growth of fungi from Aspergillus species only at the higher concentrations when they were used directly on model bread [ [10](#B10-foods-11-03517)] or coffee beans [ [11](#B11-foods-11-03517)]. This fact was also confirmed by other authors, who state, for example, that the physical structure of cheese can affect the distribution of EOs in the system and thereby prevent their availability to microbial cells [ [14](#B14-foods-11-03517), [63](#B63-foods-11-03517)]. Moreover, our results show that, even though the tested fungi belong to the same species and were isolated from the same commodity (Edam cheese), the tested EOs inhibited their growth with a significant difference in both in vitro and in situ conditions. Therefore, the choice of EOs and their effectiveness in food preservation depends not only on their composition, but also on the species or strain of the microscopic fungus that is inhibited by them. 3.4.2. Vitality of Lactic Acid Bacteria after Application of EOs in In Situ Conditions [14](#B14-foods-11-03517)]. Therefore, the effect of EOs on the growth of LABs in the model food was determined to exclude a negative effect on these microorganisms in this study. The effect of EOs (clove, thyme, red thyme, and litsea) in individual tested concentrations (250, 125, and 62.5 L/L) on the growth of LABs, especially streptococci, in in situ conditions after the 14 and 35 days of cultivation were analyzed. The results are summarized in [Table 6](#foods-11-03517-t006). [64](#B64-foods-11-03517)], who found that EOs used to treat cheeses (buffalo milk mozzarella) (Anethum and Melissa officinalis L.) had no inhibitory effect on the starter cultures of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgarica and Streptococcus thermophilus compared to the untreated control samples. They also found that in all cases the total number of vital bacteria gradually increased until the end of storage. Burt [ [65](#B65-foods-11-03517)] reported that LABs are resistant to the action of EOs. The vitality of Streptococcus spp. bacteria tested on cheeses treated with EOs stored for 35 days showed that all EOs were able to stimulate the growth of bacteria compared to the control (8.46 log CFU/g). Similarly, Marcial et al. [ [66](#B66-foods-11-03517)] the tested oregano EO (Origanum vulgare var. Hirtum) used at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 250 g/g in milk containing S. thermophilus 597) had no effect on cell viability, growth, acidification, and fermentation activity of the bacteria even at the highest concentration. Similarly, Sadeghi et al. [ [67](#B67-foods-11-03517)] applied cumin essential oil (Cuminum cyminum L.) in concentrations of 7.5, 15, and 30 L/mL alone and in combination with the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus (0.5% w/v) to Iranian cheese with the aim to determinate its antibacterial activity against St. aureus after 75 days of storage. They found that EO and probiotic bacteria had synergistic effects in reducing the growth of St. aureus in cheese. The greatest inhibitory activity was detected during the 75th day of storage in samples containing the highest concentration of EO (30 L/mL) and bacteria (0.5%). In addition, cheeses treated with a concentration of 15 L/mL achieved the highest score in the sensory evaluation. Conte et al. [ [68](#B68-foods-11-03517)] also demonstrated that LABs are the most resistant to the effect of EOs among the Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, LABs have antifungal and antibacterial properties and can be used as biopreservatives [ [69](#B69-foods-11-03517)]. Our results agree with the above-mentioned authors, as the tested EOs not only did not inhibit the growth of the lactic bacteria tested (Streptococcus spp.) on the model food (cheese) but were able to stimulate their growth with increasing storage time compared to the control samples. Therefore, they could also be used in combination with EOs to prevent the cheese from contamination by spoilage microorganisms. 3.5. Sensory Analysis of Cheese Samples Treated with Selected EOs [63](#B63-foods-11-03517)]. Some EOs showed less inhibitory activity directly in food than in the culture medium, which is largely influenced by the properties of the food, pH, or salt concentration in the food product [ [14](#B14-foods-11-03517)]. Therefore, it is often necessary to use higher concentrations of EOs to achieve the desired effect, which could negatively affect the sensory properties of the food product, since EOs have strong aromatic properties [ [70](#B70-foods-11-03517)]. [Table 7](#foods-11-03517-t007). [17](#B17-foods-11-03517)] tested the effect of thyme and oregano EOs on some pathogenic microorganisms directly on goat cheeses. The tested EOs were added to goat cheese in concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1%, and they found that both EOs extended their shelf life. Regarding the sensory evaluation, oregano was evaluated as unpleasant in relation to the taste of the cheese. In contrast, the results of cheese treated by thyme were much more acceptable. El-Kholy et al. [ [71](#B71-foods-11-03517)] tested the effect of EOs on the quality and shelf life of cottage cheese. They found that the cheese containing EOs (thyme, rosemary, and caraway) had an extended shelf life and acceptable sensory properties even at the end of the storage period. Nevertheless, some authors state that EOs can have undesirable effects on the taste and smell of cheese during long-term storage. Olmedo et al. [ [72](#B72-foods-11-03517)] reported that cheeses treated with EOs changed their typical flavors the most on the last day of storage and evaluation of the cheeses. Similarly, Pettersen et al. [ [73](#B73-foods-11-03517)] reported that they noted an increase in the bitter and sour taste in cream cheese treated with EOs incorporated in special polyethylene packages, cultured in the dark at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 35 days. However, our results show that these EOs (clove, thyme, red thyme, and litsea) did not interfere with the overall evaluation of the treated cheese samples. On the contrary, cheeses treated with EOs were evaluated as tastier compared to the control. This fact may be related to the used method selected for cheese sample treatments. Our results show that the use of EOs in the vapor phase does not have an undesirable effect on the organoleptic properties of cheeses even after 35 days of storage. 4.
