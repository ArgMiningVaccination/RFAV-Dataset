I wrote No Aging in India,a book on Alzheimer's disease, the body and the voice in time, and the cultural politics of senility. I am now working on two projects. India Tonite examines homoerotic identification and representation in the context of political and market logics in urban north India. The Other Kidney * engages the nature of immunosuppression and its accompanying global traffic in organs for transplant. It is part of a larger collaborative project with my colleague Nancy Scheper-Hughes. These different projects are united in several ways. They all constitute an anthropology of complex objects, working through a variety of meta-epistemological approaches in social theory, philosophical anthropology, science studies, and medical anthropology to linking talk about nature, about political economy, and about the obvious, the ground of culture. They all confront the question of ethnographic form, less as an interpretive or political gesture than as an experimental apparatus for learning something new. And they all operate in intimate relation to a figure of failed sovereignty. Most of my work has been in India. I have studied and had fellowships in Delhi and Simla. My fieldwork has been primarily in urban north India (Banaras, Lucknow, Allahabad), in the metropoli (Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore), and in parts of rural U.P., Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. I have also worked in the United States and most recently in Malaysia. Before undertaking a Ph.D. in anthropology I pursued work in the comparative study of religion (with a focus on Hindu and Jewish thought) and then in medicine (with a focus on geriatrics and psychiatry). At Berkeley, I teach both in Anthropology and in the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. My research, at the intersection of political and medical anthropology, has worked across disparate problem-spaces: On the transnationally variable emergence of dementia as a moral and clinical site and on the enactment of \"family\" as central to decolonizing social sciences over the twentieth century (see for example my book [No Aging in India](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520224629/no-aging-in-india), \" [Toward an Anthropology of Senility](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/maq.1995.9.3.02a00030),\" and \" [Aging in California](http://somatosphere.net/forumpost/aging-in-california/)\"); On the trope of irony as a way to reconceive the possibilities and limits of care, relation, and the narratable self in the context of dementia (see for example \" [Senility and Irony's Age](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23170058)\" or the introduction to my book with Annette Leibing, [Thinking about Dementia](https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/thinking-about-dementia/9780813538037)); On old age as a ground for the figuration of modern biopolitics (see for example \" [Old Woman](https://penguin.co.in/book/the-people-of-india/)\"); On efforts to address United States and white dominance in the transnational imagination of AIDS prevention through \"cultural\" models of sex and of language (see for example \" [The Kothi Wars](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/938/chapter-abstract/145478/The-Kothi-WarsAIDS-Cosmopolitanism-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\"); On the dense male homosociality of in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in north India as a mode of imagining political pasts and futures, through a focus on sexualized violence (see for example \" [Holi in Banaras](https://read.dukeupress.edu/glq/article/2/4/399/69246/Holi-in-Banaras-and-the-Mahaland-of-Modernity),\" Mrs Besahara Politics, Dancing Boys](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13534640802159112),\" and \" [Love and the Little Line](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1360.2011.01121.x)\"); On masculinity and class aspiration, in contemporary north India, with a focus on the dreamworlds of cinema and fashion as sites of pleasure and danger (see for example \" [Style](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/handbook-of-gender-9780198071471?cc=us&lang=en&)\" and \" [Song for Pushkin](https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/136/2/103/26666/Song-for-Pushkin)\"); On the imagination of the clinic in Hindi-Urdu cinema (see for example \" [Foreign Operations](https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Mobilities.html?id=GfzAMgEACAAJ)\"); On the history of medical anthropology as a neocolonial formation (see for example \" [Making Peasants Protestant](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780822395478-005/html)\"); On the intersection of elite and popular identifications with and emergent markets for national medicines and in particular Ayurveda (see for example \" [The Epistemological Carnival](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/knowledge-and-the-scholarly-medical-traditions/epistemological-carnival-meditations-on-disciplinary-intentionality-and-ayurveda/CCC4E59D489DC4F52B0C60E7B92D363C)\"); On the promise of \"selling a kidney\" in projects of imagined repair to family life on the economic and social margin, in urban north India, and on shifting norms and forms of regulating the movement of transplant organs and tissues, nationally and transnationally, in relation to transformations in media, capital, and racialization (see for example \" [Where It Hurts](https://www.amacad.org/publication/where-it-hurts-indian-material-ethics-organ-transplantation),\" \" [The Other Kidney](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1357034X0100700202),\" and \" [Migrant Supplementarity](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1357034X11400766)\"); On the surgical operation as a political form in the context of twentieth-century decolonization and development (see for example \" [Operability](https://sarweb.org/anthropology-in-the-margins-of-the-state/),\" \" [Operability, Bioavailability, and Exception](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470696569.ch5),\" and \" [Accusations of Illiteracy and the Medicine of the Organ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23347206)\"); On the emergence of surveillance and platform capitalism in remaking the grounds of life and politics in contemporary India, with a focus on the Aadhaar biometric identity and what happens in turn when engineers briefly capture the state and then authoritarian ethnonationalism captures the engineers (see for example, \" [The \"The Nation, De-duplicated,\" of Sociology,\" and my (early) blogposts on Follow UIDAI); On the shifting anthropological and biopolitical exploitation of transgendered and non-binary forms of life, struggle, and care (see for example the early essay \" [The Pleasures of Castration](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3643118.html)\" and the more recent \" [A Good Death](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/3193/chapter-abstract/7527419/A-Good-DeathThe-Promise-and-Threat-of-Biometric?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\"); On pandemic worlds, in relation to covid and its governance, in both North America and India (see for example \" [The Culling](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maq.12627),\" \" [The Colors of Rot](https://positionspolitics.org/colors-of-rot-pandemics-fungal-turn/),\" and \" [Superimposition](https://socialtextjournal.org/periscope_article/superimposition-app-based-contact-tracing-in-the-indian-pandemic-and-its-unexpected-intimacies/)\"); On the beauty and political vision of the late Oliver Sacks (see for example \" [Oliver's Body](https://www.publicbooks.org/olivers-body/)\" and \" [The Community, the Clinic, and the Road not Taken](https://science.thewire.in/health/the-community-the-clinic-and-the-road-not-taken/)\"); On the object of religious devotion, divinity not as a person but as a relation, with a focus on god Ganesh and his relation to female divinities (see \" [The Wives of Ganesa](https://sunypress.edu/Books/G/Ganesh2)\"); On law, risk, tort, and their mediation (see \" [Reflections on Risk, Media, and the Reasonable Animated by a Trial by Jury](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315637501-26/reflections-risk-media-reasonable-animated-trial-jury-lawrence-cohen)\"); And on all of these things, entangled, and on the practice and limits of writing, of teaching, and of anthropology as a perverse mode of ethical work in the world (see for example, \" [M's Book](https://www.yodapress.co.in/product-details.html?name=Muslim%20Portraits%3A%20Everyday%20Lives%20in%20India%20Edited%20&filter=books),\" \" [The Gay Guru](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9780203116258-5/gay-guru-lawrence-cohen),\" and \" [Ethical Publicity](https://iupress.org/9780253222435/ethical-life-in-south-asia/)\" ).

On homosexuality and contemporary India The articles I have out on same-sex desire and its figuration include two published in 1995: \"The Pleasures of Castration: the Postoperative Status of Hijras, Jankhas, and Academics,\" in Sexual Nature, Sexual Culture, P. Abramson and S. Pinkerton, eds. pp. 276-304. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, and and the Mahaland of Modernity,\" GLQ 2:399-424.

On transplantation, ethics, and the sale of body parts One article of mine has appeared: \"Where It Hurts: Indian Material for an Ethics of Organ Transplantation,\" Daedelus 128(4):135-165. Nancy Scheper-Hughes has several articles on transplantation: see Organs Watch. On Ayurvedic medicine in India In addition to discussions of modern Ayurveda in my book, see my 1995 essay entitled \"The Epistemological Carnival: Meditations on Disciplinary Intentionality and Ayurveda,\" in Knowledge and the Scholarly Medical Traditions, D. Bates, ed. pp. 320-343. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. My current work is on large genealogical platforms and on the discovery of unknown kin as a mode of relatedness, with attention in particular to how kinship was digitized and monetized before the advent of genetic relatedness platforms. Like my work on Indian surveillance and platform capitalism, the focus is on \"de-duplication\" as an emergent rationality of both relationship and of truth. Much of this work has been centered in urban north and central India, particularly in Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, and Varanasi. I have been fortunate to work with wonderful undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at UC Berkeley, and have held appointments at the University of Zurich and Tokyo University. My primary appointment at Berkeley is in the department of Anthropology, with a secondary appointment in the department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. I was hired sometime in the previous century to teach medical anthropology, and became a part of a terrific group of scholars in the Joint UC Berkeley-UCSF Medical Anthropology Program: I currently co-direct the Berkeley side of this two-campus program. Previously I directed the Institute for South Asia Studies and held the Sarah Kailath Chair in India Studies. | | From the opening sequence, in which mid-nineteenth-century Indian fishermen hear the possibility of redemption in an old woman's madness, No Aging in India captures the reader with its interplay of story and analysis. | | Bringing together essays by nineteen respected scholars, this volume approaches dementia from a variety of angles, exploring its historical, psychological, and philosophical implications. The authors employ a cross-cultural perspective that is based on ethnographic fieldwork and focuses on questions of age, mind, voice, self, loss, temporality, memory, and affect. "}
