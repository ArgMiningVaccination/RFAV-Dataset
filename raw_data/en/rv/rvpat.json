Do you feel tired even after 8 hours of sleep? Waking up with a dry mouth, feeling tired all the time, and having trouble staying asleep at night are all signs that you might have [sleep apnea](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631). Sleep apnea is a sleeping disorder in which normal breathing is interrupted repeatedly. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural way to treat obstructive sleep apnea, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other sleep-related problems. Sleep Apnea (also known as sleep apnoea) is when a person does not breathe normally during sleep. When there is a pause in normal breathing during the night, the body is not getting enough oxygen, and the brain sends an urgent message to start breathing again. The person wakes, so briefly that they usually do not remember it, gasps for air and starts breathing again. Often people do not realize that they are [snoring](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/snoring) or making snorting or choking sounds while they sleep unless another person tells them it's happening. Because of this, many cases of sleep apnea go undiagnosed, and people go on feeling fatigued all the time. While people of any age or gender can experience sleep apnea, it is most common among older men. There are a few different kinds of sleep apnea; the most prevalent type is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which the throat and/or airway is physically obstructed by the positioning of the neck, jaw, and soft tissues of the throat, like the tongue and uvula. [ OSA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836788/) is associated with being overweight or obese, because extra weight can affect the musculature of the upper respiratory system. Women who have already gone through [menopause](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) are more likely to develop sleep apnea because postmenopausal weight gain is more likely to occur in the upper body than it does prior to menopause. Sleep problems and obesity are related in many ways; getting less sleep or poor quality sleep can cause people to gain weight or have trouble losing weight. People with [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or metabolic syndrome are also at higher risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Besides disturbing sleep and causing fatigue, apnea can lead to [other serious health conditions](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-dangers-of-uncontrolled-sleep-apnea), especially cardiovascular problems like [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), [irregular heartbeat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Sleep apnea can increase the heart rate and the production of [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) hormones. Men with OSA are more likely to experience [erectile dysfunction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (ED). Lack of quality sleep can also have a negative impact on mental health, contributing to [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and [cognitive decline](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The typical treatment for snoring involves the use of a sleep apnea machine, called a CPAP machine (continuous positive air pressure machine), which pushes air into the nose while you sleep, ensuring that the airway stays open and continuously active. This treatment can help people breathe easier throughout the night, but some people may find the machine noisy and uncomfortable. TCM methods like acupuncture treatment for snoring and sleep apnea offer a way to address these problems at their source holistically, helping people to [sleep well](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and breathe more freely. Top 3 Types of Sleep Apnea Sleep apnea causes loss of oxygen due to shallow breathing (hypopnea) and/or interrupted breathing while sleeping. Different [types of sleep apnea](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-apnea) are classified by their physiological causes: - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) - this is caused by the improper relaxation of the throat muscles while sleeping. - Central sleep apnea (CSA) - is caused by disordered signalling from the brain to the organs that control breathing. - Complex sleep apnea - (or treatment emergent sleep apnea) is a combination of both of the above. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a condition wherein a person has an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, or sometimes arms or other parts of the body, accompanied by a sensation of itching, burning, crawling or throbbing. This usually happens when the person is lying in bed, trying to fall asleep. [Restless leg syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9497-restless-legs-syndrome) can coexist with OSA, compounding the problem by making it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep during the night. Narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder in which overwhelming sleepiness during the daytime causes people to suddenly and uncontrollably fall asleep. Many people who suffer from [narcolepsy also have sleep apnea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19699146/). In this case, the sleep problem is not related to breathing so much as how the brain and body are moving through sleep cycles, like REM sleep. For people who have narcolepsy, treatment with a CPAP machine is often not very helpful. Sleep apnea or snoring does not seem to be related to other abnormal sleeping behaviors (parasomnia), such as sleepwalking, night terrors, or sleep-related eating. Top 10 Symptoms of Sleep Apnea Many people snore and do not realize it. It is important to pay attention to the subtler sleep apnea symptoms. Signs of sleep apnea include: - Loud snoring - Interrupted breathing - moments during the night when the person's breathing actually stops and then starts again - Gasping for air while sleeping - Waking up with a dry mouth or [sore throat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-sore-throat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Headaches in the morning - Insomnia, difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep during the night - Feeling very sleepy during the daytime (hypersomnia) - Difficulty paying attention - Feeling irritable - Getting up often during the night to [urinate (nocturia)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) What Causes Snoring? Sleep apnea is caused either by a physical obstruction of the throat and airways or by problems with brain signals to the breathing apparatus. Not everyone who has sleep apnea snores loudly. On the other hand, not everyone who snores necessarily has sleep apnea. Other reasons people snore may include: - Congestion of the nose due to a cold or [allergies](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - In late [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/), the growing belly puts upward pressure on the respiratory system - Sleeping pills, medications that work as relaxants, like Ativan or Valium - Alcohol consumption - Anatomy - large tongue or uvula, or swollen tonsils People with sleep apnea are often advised to sleep on their side rather than on their back, as this helps prevent the obstruction, but it can be difficult for people to control their behavior while sleeping. Treatment for Sleep Apnea To firmly establish whether a person has sleep apnea, and what type, doctors will often evaluate the situation in a sleep study session. People will spend the night in a sleep center, where their heart and breathing functions are monitored (polysomnography). CPAP machines are generally considered to be the best care available for sleep apnea. These devices can help stop snoring, allow a person to get more restful sleep, and cut the risks of serious issues like heart disease that are associated with sleep apnea. However, the machine does not actually do anything to improve the weak musculature that causes OSA or the disordered signalling that causes CSA. It is possible to swallow air while breathing with the CPAP machine, which can lead to gas and a [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Some people may find the face mask, which must be strapped to the face, uncomfortable. The noise of the machine may be disturbing to the person using it, as well as to the person's bed partner. It may be difficult for some patients to get used to using the machine, and if they are not using it regularly, they are not getting the health benefits. There are also some oral appliances available, such as [mandibular advancement devices (MAD)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5803051/), which are worn in the mouth to alter the placement of the jaw and tongue in order to keep the airway open during sleep. These can also be effective in terms of helping people breathe better while they sleep. Compared to CPAP, they are quiet, discreet, and cost-effective. Again, the main question is whether a person will be able to tolerate the device; some people may experience [toothache or dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), dry mouth, or too much saliva. Surgery for snoring and sleep apnea is usually only recommended if other methods of treatment have failed. Different procedures involve removing soft tissues (uvula, tonsils, adenoids), or changing the shape of the jaw bones. Small rods may be inserted into the upper palate to help keep the airway open. A device that monitors breathing and stimulates movement of the tongue may be implanted in the chest. Sometimes people may use melatonin as a natural sleep aid. [Melatonin may](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02484300) have a positive impact in terms of helping people fall asleep more easily. It also has strong antioxidant properties, which means it may help with the control of the breathing apparatus and the amount of oxidation a person is getting while sleeping. While it is generally considered safe as a health supplement, [melatonin side effects](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/melatonin-side-effects#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6) can include problems with dizziness, headaches, and nausea, and it can also be contraindicated with other medications. Melatonin can affect blood coagulation, so it may be unsafe to take if a person is also taking blood thinners, for example. Can Acupuncture Help Stop Snoring? According to TCM theory, the spleen and stomach are responsible for transforming nutrients from food and fluids into Qi (life energy), which is then delivered to the heart and lungs. In the TCM view, sleep apnea is often a problem related to phlegm and Qi stagnation, as are many conditions related to fatigue or insomnia. If phlegm builds up and becomes stagnant in the spleen, the lungs cannot get the Qi they need. So, one possible differentiation for sleep apnea is Spleen Deficiency with Qi Stagnation. This condition of dampness and phlegm will often cause people to feel heavy and bloated. In some cases, too much internal heat contributes to the problem. Snoring, combined with sweating, and waking up with a sore throat, is a sign that we need to clear heat and toxicity from the body. Sleep disturbed by nightmares is associated with the gallbladder, while difficulty falling asleep is associated with the liver. An acupuncture practitioner will listen carefully to what specific symptoms of sleep apnea each individual patient is experiencing, and tailor the treatment accordingly. A [meta-analysis](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1674-acupuncture-found-effective-for-sleep-apnea-relief-beats-cpap-for-blood-oxygenation) of over 200 randomized trials involving the use of acupuncture to treat sleep apnea concluded that acupuncture was more effective overall than CPAP treatment, in terms of improving breathing and oxygen levels. Can Chinese herbs help snoring and sleep apnea? Specific herbs [have been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4998001/) to help reduce inflammation and improve oxygen levels in patients with sleep apnea. Chinese [herbal formulations can help](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22298445/) stop snoring and reduce daytime fatigue. Natural Remedies for Snoring Acupressure can help snoring and sleep apnea. Since we are trying to clear heat and phlegm from the stomach, spleen, and large intestine, use acupressure points along the Stomach Meridian, which runs down the leg. On the front of the shin, apply pressure, kneading with your thumb, starting to the side of the shin bone a few inches below the knee, then moving down about 3 inches and doing the same thing. Knead each of the four points about 30 times as your move down the leg. If you are aware that one side of the nose is more blocked than the other while you are breathing during the night, practice the acupressure on the opposite leg. For example, if your left nostril is the one that is more stuffed up, do acupressure on the right leg. Acupuncture Near Me for Snoring As the population ages, and unfortunately, more people suffer from obesity and metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea is a growing health concern all over the world. Snoring can have a seriously negative impact on quality of life, health, and longevity. Conventional methods of treatment for sleep apnea can be effective, but many people find CPAP uncomfortable and inconvenient for long-term use. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, or are worried because your partner snores loudly at night and seems to be gasping for air, do not wait to get help. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can help relieve fatigue due to snoring and reduce the risk of more serious problems related to sleep apnea. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only. The education provided by this article is not approved by FDA to diagnose, prevent, treat and cure human diseases. It should not stop you from consulting with your physician for your medical conditions. Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science. Because science focuses on testing ideas about the natural world with evidence obtained through observation, these aspects of acupuncture can't be studied by science. Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How to Treat Musculoskeletal Pain With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you experience unexplained pain all over the body? Muscle pain and tenderness, along with feeling tired all the time and having mood issues? Widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue or feeling exhausted may be a sign you have fibromyalgia. Alternative medicine methods like Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help ease the [chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658605/), [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and emotional disturbances caused by [fibromyalgia](https://fibroandpain.org/fibromyalgia/what-is-fibromyalgia). Fibromyalgia (sometimes referred to as \"fibro\" or FM) is one of the [most common](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-prevalence/) chronic pain conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated 10 million people in the United States alone. Still, this chronic condition is still not well understood by medical science. There are no definitive tests to show whether or not fibromyalgia is the cause of pain all over the body along with chronic fatigue, so many people go on having musculoskeletal problems and hurting all over without being diagnosed or treated. There are many people who have fibromyalgia who also suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) related to the illness. [Fibromyalgia](https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia) can dramatically impact a person's quality of life. While people of ages and genders can have fibromyalgia, it is much more prevalent among women. Fibromyalgia is considered to be a syndrome: a collection of symptoms that often occur together. Fibromyalgia is associated with other conditions like [lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome (ME/CFS). It may coexist with these other chronic conditions, or sometimes be mistaken for one of them. However, fibromyalgia is now understood by medical professionals to be its own distinct condition with specific manifestations. People who have [RA have been shown](http://blog.arthritis.org/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-side-of-fibromyalgia/) to have an increased risk for also having fibromyalgia. But the quality and location of the musculoskeletal pain differentiates the two conditions. The pain of fibromyalgia shows up in the musculoskeletal system in the areas where there are large muscles, causing pain that may move around throughout the torso, [back, hips, thighs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and arms. Fibromyalgia pain is often described as a kind of \"tenderness,\" or when the body aches all over. \"Tender points\" all over the body are specific to fibromyalgia. This is [different from arthritis](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/fibromyalgia?_ga=2.91328922.1871329779.1619451838-775333886.1619451838), which generally causes swelling and pain in the joints. Both RA and [lupus](https://www.hss.edu/conditions_Lupus-and-Fibromyalgia.asp) are understood to be caused by inflammation, while fibromyalgia is believed to be caused by a problem with the central nervous system (CNS), in which pain signals are amplified, causing extreme sensitivity and pain, even when there is no seeming reason for that area of the body to feel pain. Some of the fibromyalgia symptoms are very similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), which is also known as chronic fatigue (CFS). As with RA and lupus, the two conditions can overlap. The difference is that the overwhelming symptoms of ME/CFS are related to fatigue or post-exertional malaise (PEM), while the predominant symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread muscle pain and tenderness. Fibromyalgia seems to show up in some people due to a traumatic or triggering event. There can then be a fibromyalgia flare up due to the presence of other triggers later. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and other forms of alternative medicine that fall under TCM can approach all of the different symptoms of fibromyalgia holistically. Acupuncture is widely accepted to be effective for helping musculoskeletal conditions of all kinds, as well as neurological problems, rheumatological conditions, sleep issues, and emotional and mental health disorders. Top 10 Symptoms of Musculoskeletal Pain As a syndrome, fibromyalgia may manifest as any combination of a few or several of a variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms of [fibromyalgia](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm) include: - Widespread musculoskeletal pain: pain, tenderness, and/or stiffness in the muscles all over the body that may come and go or migrate from one area to another - Fatigue, exhaustion, extreme tiredness - Emotional and/or mental issues: depression, anxiety, PTSD - Sleep problems, hands and/or feet [TMJ,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)jaw pain - Digestive problems: [irritable [bloating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Bladder pain, interstitial cystitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Other more subtle signs of fibromyalgia can include: [ itching](https://www.prohealth.com/library/fibromyalgia-itching-causes-make-stop-91719) all over, a skin crawling sensation (like bugs crawling on skin), extra sensitivity to smells or temperature, a tendency to shiver, or dry eyes or eye pain. Top 5 Causes Musculoskeletal Pain Flares The [symptoms of fibromyalgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780) tend to come and go. Some days a person might feel almost totally fine, then other days, the fibromyalgia flares, causing more pain, exhaustion, and sometimes other symptoms. What triggers a fibromyalgia flare up? - Hormonal changes during menstrual cycle, [miscarriage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pregnancy, or postpartum - Prolonged [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - A sudden [traumatic event, PTSD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)trigger, [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in weather: temperature, humidity, barometric pressure - Lack of sleep When one of the 18 tender points of fibromyalgia is touched, it can trigger more widespread pain. These points include areas like: the front and sides of the neck, the base of the skull, the elbow, and the backs of the knees. What Is the Treatment for Fibromyalgia? Medical [treatment for fibromyalgia](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-treatment/) typically involves a combination of medicine to alleviate pain with psychological support and lifestyle management. [Drugs](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/living-fibromyalgia-drugs-approved-manage-pain) like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella are approved for prescription for patients with fibromyalgia. Lyrica and Cymbalta are also used to treat conditions that involve nerve damage or nerve pain, like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), neuropathy, [shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), while Savella works in a way that is similar to antidepressants. Other [pain relievers](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help people manage pain of fibromyalgia, help them sleep better, and boost mood. All of these medications can come with unwanted side effects, and they do not help to relieve pain in every case. People with FM pain will often receive counseling on how to manage their condition by being very careful not to exert themselves or become exhausted. Getting quality sleep and reducing stress can help to prevent fibro flare up. It can be hard for people to follow guidelines that ask them to make major lifestyle changes. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and the patient support of a TCM practitioner can offer more help for people with fibromyalgia. Acupuncture for Musculoskeletal Pain Can acupuncture help fibromyalgia? Yes. TCM offers a comprehensive system for managing musculoskeletal pain and chronic pain, helping to heal nerve damage and restore central nervous system function, supporting mental health, relieving anxiety and depression, and addressing sleep problems. Whereas with conventional medicine, a patient might go from one doctor to another to handle all of these issues, the acupuncturist can address them all at once. The TCM point of view always takes into consideration the connection between what is going on physically with what is going on emotionally in each individual, so it is really an excellent way to help patients with fibromyalgia. Like Western medicine, TCM recognizes that sometimes fibromyalgia can be originally caused by a traumatic event or an extremely stressful time in one's life. Emotional upheavals cause stress to the liver, which in turn causes stagnation of blood and Qi. TCM also sees coldness and dampness as pathogenic forces that can have a profound effect on overall health. According to TCM, widespread musculoskeletal pain falls under the category of Bi Syndrome. In Bi Syndromes, cold and damp get into the body and take hold on a deep level, causing pain and stiffness. With [acupuncture treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223771/) for fibromyalgia, we seek to clear cold and damp, and restore good flow of Qi and blood throughout the body. Acupuncture has an analgesic effect, relieving muscle pain without side effects. Moxibustion may be utilized to bring warmth to areas of the body. Cupping is another modality used to draw out damp cold and improve blood flow. Tai Qi and Qi Gong, gentle therapeutic movement practices that have been developed over 1000s of years as part of TCM, also may offer great benefits for people with FM. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6365227/) of over 400 studies of fibromyalgia treatment with TCM, acupuncture treatment was found to be effective for reducing both short term pain and long term pain. Another [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110829/) found that acupuncture and herbs worked better to reduce pain than standard medication therapy. Top 5 Tips for Managing Fibromyalgia Dealing with fibromyalgia and seeing significant improvement in fibro pain will probably involve making some lasting lifestyle changes. Making adjustments to your sleep habits, food choices, and your exercise routine can make a difference in preventing the next FM flare up. - Choose a gentle, enjoyable form of exercise. Start slowly, and gradually increase the amount you can exercise over time. Walking outdoors is a great option, as are Tai Qi and Qi Gong. - Limit or eliminate caffeine and alcohol. These substances can interfere with getting good sleep and exacerbate liver problems. Alcohol is not safe to consume if you are taking medications for fibromyalgia like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella. - Avoid sugar, which may give you a short-lived good feeling, but will lead to a \"sugar crash,\" and feeling more exhausted than before. Any kind of simple carbohydrates, like foods made of white flour, or bottled fruit juices, can cause highs and lows in blood sugar. Avoid sugar substitutes and food additives like MSG, which can trigger reactions in some people. - Focus on eating complex carbohydrates, especially vegetables. These help you have a more sustained energy throughout the day. Nuts and seeds are also good. - Warm baths with Epsom salts can be very soothing. Getting enough sleep at night, and even resting or napping during the day, may be essential to your well-being if you have fibromyalgia. Develop habits that allow for plenty of rest and set yourself up for a good night's sleep. Acupuncture Near Me for Musculoskeletal Pain Many people who have fibromyalgia choose to try alternative medicine as a way of managing FM pain. Physiological conditions that stem from emotional stress are often not resolved through the use of medications. Acupuncture and TCM have a long history of helping people to heal from emotional disturbances that cause physical pain. Acupuncture treatment works to increase the flow of energy through the body and improve the connections between the brain and nerve endings. If you or someone you know suffers with fibro, consider acupuncture as a way to find relief from musculoskeletal pain and constant fatigue. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[Acupuncture](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28642714/) and TCM can be beneficial as both an adjunct or alternative to drug therapy for [paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312232/), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and other types of arrhythmia that cause heart palpitations or a fast heart rate.

The feeling that your heart rhythm is off, or different from your normal pulse rate is called [Arrhythmia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668). The average resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. A fast heart rate-more than 100 beats per minute-is called [tachycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/tachycardia--fast-heart-rate). A slow heart rate-less than 60 beats per minute- is called bradycardia. It is natural to have a slightly high heart rate during or just after exercise, or or a slow heart rate during sleep or times of relaxation, as when meditating. In some cases, a rapid heartbeat is related to [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Sometimes a rapid or irregular heart rate may be related to caffeine consumption or a side effect of some medication. Other times, it may be a sign of heart disease or other chronic condition that needs to be addressed. Other symptoms related to irregular heartbeat include: shortness of breath, chest pain, sweating, and [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The heart is composed of four chambers; the top two chambers are called the atria, into which blood is received, and the two bottom chambers, the ventricles, from which blood is pumped out to the lungs and the rest of the body. Medical science classifies deviations from a normal resting heart rate both according to their rapidity and the chamber of the heart that seems to be problematic. There are different medications available to help restore the regular rhythm of the heart, as well as [therapies](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16751-arrhythmia-treatments) that deliver electrical impulses to the heart through a catheter, and devices, such as pacemakers or defibrillators. In many cases, arrhythmia is not a serious problem. But in other cases, it can increase the risk of blood clots, [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other life-threatening conditions. It is advisable to consult a medical professional if you are having an irregular heartbeat often enough to be concerned. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural way to help restore heart function and a good resting heart rate without the unwanted side effects of medications or invasive procedures. Top 10 Types of Irregular Heartbeat There are many different terms that describe deviations from a regular, healthy heart rate. Some irregular heartbeat issues are due to congenital conditions, while others may occur due to trauma, disease, or aging. - Atrial flutter - an accelerated heart rate that occurs in an organized and rhythmic way due to rapid electric impulses in the atria. [Atrial fibrillation](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af)(AFib or AF) - a rapid heart rate, also caused by increased electrical impulses in the atria that happen in a chaotic, arrhythmic way. Fibrillation refers to the rapid and irregular movement of muscles. In the case of AFib, the upper chambers of the heart quiver quickly. This condition is associated with stroke. [AFib with RVR (rapid ventricular response)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603354/)is a condition that occurs when patients are critically ill, often in the ICU, when the atrial fibrillation causes the ventricles to beat faster. - Ventricular fibrillation - rapid impulses in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) cause ineffective pumping of blood out to the body. - Supraventricular tachycardia - this refers to types of arrhythmia that originate in the atria (above the ventricles) and cause brief episodes of accelerated heart rate. - Ventricular tachycardia - a fast but regular heart rate that does not allow the ventricles to fill with as much blood as usual. - Sick sinus syndrome - more common among older people, this is when the sinus node is malfunctioning and may sometimes cause a fast heart rate, and other times, a slow heart rate. - Long QT Syndrome - a heart disorder found in people with a particular genetic mutation that causes rapid heartbeat and fainting spells. - Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome - some people are born with an extra electrical pathway that can cause extra or irregular signalling to occur. - Conduction Block - a block of the electrical pathways that sometimes results in a slower heart rate. [Premature ventricular contractions](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/p/premature-ventricular-contractions.html)- this is when an extra heartbeat beat originates from the ventricles, rather than the atria. It can feel like a \"skipped\" beat, or your heart pounding or jumping in your chest, but it is actually a kind of extra beat. This can happen occasionally due to drug stimulants like caffeine or nicotine, or other medications like decongestants or antihistamines. It can also be due to heart disease creating scarring in the ventricles or in the structural parts of the heart that hold the pathways for electrical impulses. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots and strokes because blood is not being effectively pushed from the atria into the ventricles, so blood pools or collects in the atria. What Causes Irregular Heartbeat? In general, most types of arrhythmia are caused by some disorder of the electrical conduction system that controls the beating of the heart valves, or weakness of the heart itself, which is known as [cardiomyopathy](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults). Causes of tachycardia include: - Not enough blood nourishing the muscles of the heart. - Dilation or one or more valves of the heart, meaning that the muscle tissue becomes thinner and the chamber becomes enlarged. - Thickening of the walls of the heart chamber makes them stiff; this is known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. - Scar tissue makes the heart tissue more rigid (restrictive cardiomyopathy or dysplasia). This can happen due to inflammation, high levels of iron or protein in the tissues, sometimes as a side effect of cancer treatments (radiation and/or chemotherapy). Arrhythmic right ventricular dysplasia may be an inherited condition. Causes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter include: - High blood pressure - damage to the heart from a heart attack or heart surgery - Coronary artery disease - Congenital heart defects - Hyperthyroidism - Lung disease, infections, or [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Sleep apnea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or overuse of other chemical stimulants Chronic conditions like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), obesity, metabolic syndrome, kidney problems, alcoholism, [Parkinson's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or a family history of heart problems increase a person's risk for developing an arrhythmia. Treatment for Irregular Heartbeat There are several different types of medications to treat irregular heartbeat. Tachycardia may be treated with [antiarrhythmic](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/medications-for-arrhythmia) drugs, which work by suppressing or depressing the electrical impulses that are misfiring or transmitting signals too quickly. Beta blockers slow down the heart rate and reduce blood pressure by reducing the production of adrenaline. AFib treatment often involves anticoagulants or blood thinners, which prevent the formation of blood clots. In some cases, these medications can work to help people maintain a steady heart rate and prevent serious events like strokes. The downside is that they must be taken daily on an ongoing basis, and in some cases, they can actually cause the heartbeat to become even more erratic. Medical [procedures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/arrhythmia-treatment) that are designed to help irregular heartbeat include: electrical cardioversion, in which an electric shock is used to help \"reset\" the heart rate, and ablation, in which the tissues that contain the electric impulse pathways are intentionally scarred in order to reduce their output. Implantable devices such as defibrillators or pacemaker monitor the heart rate and deliver small \"shocks\" to alter the rhythm of the heartbeat. For some people, these methods work to keep the heart functioning. In some cases, though, the surgery to implant the device causes complications or damage to critical tissues around the heart or lungs. Can Acupuncture Help Irregular Heartbeat? In conventional medicine, and indeed, in Western culture, the heart is seen as one of the most important, if not the most important, organ in the body. Not only does it supply the whole body with oxygenated blood, but it also is associated with our deepest emotions. [TCM also views](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/466695) the heart as a central organ that governs the blood and vessels, and also the mind and spirit. The traditional diagnostic methods employed by TCM practitioners can tell us a lot about the health of the heart. The feeling of the pulse gives us detailed information about the strength, quality, and speed of the heart rate. According to TCM theory, the heart \"opens\" out into the face, and so observing the pallor or color of the face, the brightness of the eyes, and the appearance, especially, of the tongue, also gives the acupuncturist vital information about the heart. TCM providers [classify different causes](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Blog/737-palpitationsinsomnia) of irregular heartbeat by looking at the whole concert of presenting symptoms: - Heart Qi deficiency or Blood deficiency: may happen after a long illness or loss of blood and be marked by heart palpitations, dizziness, [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and/or [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/). The pulse will be weak, and the tongue pale pink. - Kidney yin deficiency with Heart Fire: chronic illness can deplete the kidneys so that they can no longer manage the balance of fluids and heat, so heat rises and disturbs the Heart. With this presentation, a person may be experiencing strong feelings of fear or anger, [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [ringing in the ears (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), and stomach problems. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the acupuncturist will choose acupuncture points and [ herbs](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2017/1381732/) to clear heat and dampness, nourish the blood, and calm and strengthen the heart. [Specific herbal formulae](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5282678/) work to activate and maintain blood flow, removing stasis, while also helping to protect the spleen and stomach. A controlled [study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1723-acupuncture-plus-herbs-regulate-heart-arrhythmias) that compared patients with arrhythmias and tachycardias who were treated with medication (Lopressor) versus patients treated with both the medication and acupuncture and Chinese herbal formulations. The patients who received integrative care showed statistically very significant improvement over the patients using medication only. A [systematic review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00358/full) of randomized trials that compared acupuncture treatment versus typical medication treatment found that both types of treatment were equally effective for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, that acupuncture in addition to medication was effective for ventricular premature beat, and that acupuncture was beneficial over no treatment at all for sinus tachycardia. Acupuncture Near Me for Irregular Heartbeat Unfortunately, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Americans. [Over five million](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2019/02/15/14/39/aha-2019-heart-disease-and-stroke-statistics) people in the U.S. experience atrial fibrillation, or heart flutter. The conventional methods of treating heart problems such as AFib and other types of arrhythmia can work, but they require people to become completely dependent upon medications or devices. These methods of treatment are also very expensive. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative or adjunct approach that can help improve heart function and restore a healthy heart rate without side effects. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Hemorrhoids With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hemorrhoids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Bleeding and discomfort when you go to the bathroom? Burning or itching around the anus? [Hemorrhoid pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268) is caused by swollen blood vessels around the rectum. Acupuncture and TCM reduce inflammation and can bring swift hemorrhoid relief. Sometimes called \"piles,\" (from the Latin \"pila,\" meaning \"balls\"), hemorrhoids often do resemble little balls or clusters of grapes. The word \"hemorrhoid\" actually refers to the specific formation of blood vessels and cushioning tissues that surround the anus. Colloquially, though, the term is usually used to describe the [condition of inflammation and irritation](https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/hemorrhoids) that can occur in this area. [Hemorrhoids](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hemorrhoids_and_what_to_do_about_them) are very common; probably more than half the population experiences them at some point in their life. However, the discomfort of talking to a doctor about hemorrhoids can be almost as miserable as the physical discomfort of having them, so many people avoid getting hemorrhoid help. How do you know if you have a hemorrhoid? Sometimes people have a lot of itching, burning and discomfort after a bowel movement, or throughout the day. Sometimes there is no pain, but you may see a little bit of blood in the toilet bowl, or when you wipe with toilet paper. When you touch the area, you may feel a lump, or swollen tissue. Hemorrhoids are generally classified into two categories based on their location: internal hemorrhoid and external hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids form inside the anus and lower rectum and can cause bleeding, usually without pain. In some cases, though, the swollen veins can protrude out from the anal sphincter during or after a bowel movement and then need to be pushed back in. This is called a \"prolapsed internal hemorrhoid.\" The situation can become more serious if the internal hemorrhoid can't be pushed back in, or if a blood clot develops in the vessel (thrombosis); then, it becomes painful to go to the bathroom, or even sit. In some cases, a prolapsed hemorrhoid becomes \"strangulated,\" meaning the blood supply is cut off, which can cause severe pain. [Hemorrhoids](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/hemorrhoids) become [prolapsed](https://www.healthline.com/health/prolapsed-hemorrhoid#causes) because the connective tissues in the area weaken due to intense pressure, usually due to straining during a bowel movement, or because of the extra weight of pregnancy or obesity. [External hemorrhoids](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0415/p1629.html) develop outside the anus, under the skin. These are the kind of hemorrhoids that tend to cause itching and a little bit of bright red bleeding. Again, they are aggravating, but not too serious unless a blood clot forms; then, it is called a \"thrombosed external hemorrhoid.\" This type of hemorrhoid can turn blue or purple in color and become acutely painful. In some cases, surgery will be performed to drain blood from the clot, or remove the hemorrhoid. Most of the time, people suffer quietly with hemorrhoids, waiting for them to go away on their own. Only when they cause severe pain and bleeding are medical treatments considered. However, TCM and acupuncture offer a way to deal with hemorrhoids so that they heal more quickly and reduce the chance to return. Top 10 Hemorrhoid Causes What causes hemorrhoids? The tissues and blood vessels around the anal area can become weak, irritated, and inflamed. The upright posture of our human bodies naturally puts pressure on the elimination organs. Many women get hemorrhoids during [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/) and/or birth because of intense pressure on the perineal area.The major reasons for hemorrhoids include: - Pregnancy [Constipation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-manage-ibs-diet-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Sedentary lifestyle - Straining while on the toilet - Sitting too long on the toilet without progress - Lack of dietary fiber - Obesity - Family history of hemorrhoids - Aging Overall, focusing on eating a diet that includes plenty of fiber, drinking enough water, maintaining good bathroom habits (going when you feel the urge and not waiting) and a healthy weight will go a long way towards preventing hemorrhoids. But what can you do when you already have hemorrhoids? Treatment for Hemorrhoids Often, people will just deal with hemorrhoid itching and pain on their own by using over-the-counter products like creams that contain phenylephrine, which constricts blood vessels (Preparation H), or disposable wipes impregnated with witch hazel and other soothing ingredients (Tucks medicated pads). These treatments may help reduce pain and swelling temporarily, but they do not get rid of hemorrhoids at their root. When people do talk to their [doctor about hemorrhoids](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment), they may be prescribed something stronger, like a steroid cream, or hydrocortisone rectal suppositories. If the situation persists or becomes more severe, there are several types of outpatient procedure to treat hemorrhoids, including rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared photocoagulation, and electrocoagulation. All of these procedures cut off blood supply to the hemorrhoid, so that it will form scar tissue and fall off. Hemorrhoid stapling and hemorrhoidectomy are outpatient procedures in which the hemorrhoids are surgically removed, and/or prolapsed tissues are affixed back inside the anus. While these surgeries may be helpful in some cases, recovery can be painful, and there can be problems with the way things work afterwards, potentially leading to more surgery later on. When hemorrhoids are severe, it is a good idea to consult your doctor, as there are more serious conditions that may produce similar symptoms of pain, itching, or bleeding, including [anal fissure](https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/anal-fissure) (torn tissue or open sore in the anus due to trauma or [Crohn's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crohns-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) complications), [anal abcess (infected cavity in the anus) or anal fistula](https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/abscess-and-fistula-expanded-information) (an opening from the anal or rectal area that drains pus and/or fecal matter). Sometimes skin tags develop around the area where a hemorrhoid has healed. These can be irritating and difficult to keep clean, so they may need to be surgically removed. For the treatment of hemorrhoids, TCM methods can provide relief from symptoms and help to reduce the inflammation that caused them. Can Acupuncture Help Hemorrhoids? According to TCM philosophy, hemorrhoids can often be related to a build-up of heat and/or dampness in the lower abdominal area; it's the heat and dampness that cause the blood vessels to swell. You might be concerned by the idea that acupuncture treatment for hemorrhoids would involve needles being placed in a highly sensitive, private area. Let us reassure you this is not the case. The [Du Mai meridian](https://acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32524), also known as the \"Sea of Yang,\" is the channel which runs from the rectum area up along the spine to the top of head and then down to the mouth, controlling Yang energy throughout the body. We use points along this meridian, on the top of the head, and in other parts of the body to draw excess heat and dampness away from the area where the hemorrhoids are. Other presentations of hemorrhoids include: Top 5 Types of Hemorrhoids Presentation in TCM - Spleen Qi Deficiency - This is when people tend to have poor digestion, bloating, gas, and diarrhea, going to the bathroom very often; the hemorrhoids feel swollen, but not as red. We use moxibustion to work on stomach point 36 meridian point, CV points 6 and 4, and spleen 6 in the middle of the abdomen to help digestion. - Spleen Qi Sinking- This presentation tends to happen to people who are thinner, not only having hemorrhoids, but all the organs tend to be lower than usual; may also have prolapsed bladder or uterus, and poor digestion. Moxibustion applied to the middle of the top of the head will head the Qi rise up. For both types, doing Kegel type exercises regularly can help to strengthen the rectal area, also the uterus and bladder. Do three sets, increasing a bit every time: for example squeeze 30 times, release, do again 35, rest, next 40, then rest. Do this exercise every morning and evening. - Blood Stasis - This type is more and more common because of our modern lifestyle, due to sitting a lot for work, which causes blood circulation to be compromised. In Chinese, we have a proverb: \"for 10 people who sit too long, 9 will have hemorrhoids.\" These manifest more as red, swollen, maybe bleeding. Kegels will also be helpful here, too. - Lower Jiao Fire/Heat - This is when the lower part of the body has too much fire. For this type of hemorrhoids, people tend to have more bleeding, especially triggered by having alcohol, spicy food, crunchy food. These are the kind that may feel very sore with a burning sensation and tend to bleed, especially when wiping. - Intestinal Dryness - especially here in California, where we have hot, dry weather, without a good habit of drinking water, people can tend to constipation, even going only once or twice a week. These types of hemorrhoids are due to dry, uncomfortable bowel movements, and may have itching and bleeding. Adding more water (warm is better) and more moisturizing foods (sesame oil and lots of ripe bananas, flax seeds, chia, sweet potato/yam, prunes) will be helpful. Kegel type exercise is helpful for all of these types, to strengthen the sphincter muscle and bring more circulation to the area. Add more movement overall. At bedtime, leg lifts, bicycle movements in the air, upside down, are a good way to exercise without putting pressure on the lower body. Ideally, when there is good digestion, between 5:00 - 7:00 a.m. is when people should naturally want to go, quickly, without too much need to push. Sitting on the toilet for too long creates the pressure that leads to hemorrhoids. [Moxibustion treatment](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/11/01/soothing-natural-cures-hemorrhoids)-the burning of the herb mugwort near an area-can be very effective for reducing pain quickly. [Chinese herbal formulations](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Hemorrhoids+(Piles)+and+Traditional+Chinese+Medicine+), used both internally and externally, can help relieve inflammation and pain. An herbal tea formula may include herbs to help strengthen the energy of the spleen, and to lubricate the digestive tract. We also recommend sitz baths as a home remedy for hemorrhoids: short, 15-minute baths in warm water, to help soothe the area and keep it clean. Your acupuncturist may give you an herbal bath sachet to use to help reduce inflammation and soother the tissues. [One study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1003525718300333) of acupuncture treatment for internal hemorrhoids showed that, after 24 days, 86% of patients were \"cured,\" while another 8% showed significant improvement. Your acupuncture practitioner will also talk with you about changes you can make in your diet and bathroom habits that will help you get things moving more easily. Acupuncture Near Me for Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are not only irritating; they are a sign that you may need to pay more attention to what you're eating, and that you need to give yourself a little more time for relaxation, in and out of the bathroom. A combination of acupuncture, herbs, and other TCM treatment for hemorrhoids can help get the pain and swelling behind you. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat ADHD With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) child have ADHD? Do I have ADHD? [ADD/ADHD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889) is a mental health disorder that causes children and adults to have problems with concentration, hyperactivity, or both. Trouble in school, problems at work, physical restlessness, mood swings, and frequent feelings of frustration can all be signs of ADHD in children and adult ADHD. Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help symptoms of ADHD holistically, without the side effects caused by ADHD medications. ADD stands for Attention-Deficit Disorder, referring to the poor concentration and problems staying on task that are often experienced by people with this neurodevelopmental disorder. Children and adults with ADD are easily distracted; they may appear to be \"daydreaming\" a lot of the time. ADHD stands for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, in reference to cases in which a person also exhibits impulsiveness, or difficulty sitting still. ADHD usually starts in childhood; often, ADHD symptoms carry over into adulthood and continue to cause problems if not addressed. While ADHD in adolescents and children has been studied widely in recent years, the causes are still unknown. It is generally believed to be due to disordered biological processes occurring in the brain, and considered to be possibly genetic in origin. [ADHD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/adhdadd) may be related to atypically low levels of chemical neurotransmitters like dopamine. Metabolism in the part of the brain that controls attention, movement, and social interaction appears to be different in brain imaging tests of children with ADHD. For children with ADHD, this may lead to problems in school, even learning disabilities. Interrupting, not being able to wait their turn, fidgeting, and being forgetful or seeming \"careless\" are the obvious outward signs of ADHD that can make school challenging for children, and cause them to be considered disruptive in the classroom. Adult attention disorder may show up as reckless behavior (traffic tickets, accidents, etc.), problems in relationships, trouble organizing things like paying bills or missing appointments, losing belongings, not being a \"good listener,\" or anger management issues. According to current conventional medical thought, ADHD is considered a psychiatric condition: a product of chemical imbalance in the brain. ADHD in children is associated with behavioral problems that make it difficult to excel in school. Adults with ADD may have trouble finding success in their daily work and lives. For these reasons, people will consider getting medical treatment for ADHD. As with most psychiatric issues, treatment tends to focus on a combination of behavioral counseling and pharmacological intervention. Medications used to treat ADHD in both children and adults are stimulants that are thought to help boost attention span and a person's ability to focus. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can be used as an adjunct therapy or an alternative to medical treatment with drugs for ADHD in both children and adults. Top 3 Types of ADHD: ADD or [ADHD symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html) manifest in a unique combination in each individual. Presentations of ADHD are divided into three categories: - Inattentive/easily distracted type - Hyperactive, impulsive behavior type - Combined type, exhibits both inattention and hyperactivity While boys are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, this may have something to do with the fact that [ADHD symptoms show up differently in girls](https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-in-girls-symptoms-of-adhd-in-girls-20547) than they do in boys. Parents and teachers may have a stronger tendency to explain girls' behavior as being personality-based (\"talkative\" or \"tomboy-ish\") rather than a serious problem worthy of attention. Girls may also be more likely to compensate for their ADHD, finding coping mechanisms that help them get along with teachers and appear to be OK, even if they are struggling with schoolwork or social problems. [ADHD and ASD](https://chadd.org/about-adhd/adhd-and-autism-spectrum-disorder/) (autism spectrum disorder) can often present in similar ways, and can coexist in some cases. Over half of people who have been diagnosed as autistic also show signs of ADHD, while about a quarter of people with ADHD are also considered to be on the autism spectrum. Some of the key differences between these two neurodevelopmental disorders are that children with ADHD are much more likely to show improvement in their behaviors as they grow up, and that people with ASD are more likely to exhibit \"hyperfocus\" rather than distraction. When symptoms of ADHD are found in children, it is not unusual for parents to recognize that they, too, have faced similar struggles in their lives. [ Research suggests](https://exceptionalindividuals.com/neurodiversity/what-is-adhd/) that about half of the time that a child is diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, at least one of their parents shows signs of the disorder, as well. Top 10 Symptoms of Adult ADHD Because ADD/ADHD is a mental health issue, it can be difficult to clearly identify. Many of the symptoms associated with ADHD are similar to those of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). It is not uncommon for people with adult ADHD to also have anxiety or [depression,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) so the conditions overlap. - Trouble focusing on tasks or multitasking, poor concentration - Impulsive behavior, recklessness - Disorganization - Poor time management skills, difficulty prioritizing or staying on topic - Restlessness, [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Easily frustrated - Frequent mood swings - Lose temper easily - Difficulty articulating thoughts to others - Difficulty coping with [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) Of course, everyone experiences some or all of these behaviors and emotions at some point in their lives. But if these problems began in childhood and continue to cause problems in daily life on an ongoing basis, then it may be due to [adult ADHD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878). Test for ADHD Evaluation for ADHD is usually performed by a mental health professional, pediatrician, or family physician. There is no one specific test to determine if a child or adult has ADHD. [Diagnosis](https://chadd.org/for-adults/diagnosis-of-adhd-in-adults/) is usually based on a comprehensive discussion with the patient and family members to determine whether a person displays 5-6 or more commonly recognized symptoms of ADD or ADHD, according to guidelines set by the American Psychiatric Association. Brain imaging methods such as MRIs are used to conduct research about ADHD, but they are not part of a typical diagnostic process for the average person. Medications for ADHD [Doctors commonly treat](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Determining-ADHD-Medication-Treatments.aspx) ADD or ADHD with stimulant medications that increase levels of dopamine and norepinephrine and are meant to help them focus better. These medications are based in amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, etc.) or methylphenidate (Ritalin, etc.). Some are short-acting and need to be taken in 4-hour intervals; others are longer-acting, or designed to last all day. While these [medications](https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-medication-20882) are considered safe for children, they do not work in every case, and they carry a variety of side effects, including: changes in appetite, stomach problems, and sleep problems. These types of drugs constrict the blood vessels and can cause heart problems like arrhythmia, [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), and even heart attacks in some patients. They can also have a negative impact on mood and mental health, causing a child or adult to become even more irritable and/or anxious. In some cases, stimulant medications have been [linked](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/news/20060323/adhd-drugs-reports-aggressive-behavior) to suicidal ideation and aggressive behavior in children and adolescents. Acupuncture for ADHD TCM philosophy acknowledges the interconnectedness of the mind, spirit, and body. In the TCM view, problems like ADHD are concerned with imbalances of the Heart, the Mind, and the Shen (spirit or emotions). Pathogens like fire, wind, and dampness can invade the head, affecting the mind as well as the physical organs of the body. Problems with concentration and restlessness stem from wind and excess heat in the head. Feelings of anger and frustration are often rooted in Liver Qi stagnation.

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229910000944) to test the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture on preschoolers with ADHD found not only that the majority of children showed improvement of symptoms, but that the improvement was still evident at a six-month follow-up. Auricular acupuncture, in which points on the outer ear are stimulated with very tiny, thin needles or seeds that can be stuck to the ear and gently massaged daily, can be [particularly effective for children](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/07/28/treating-adhd-with-acupuncture), as it is very minimally invasive.
