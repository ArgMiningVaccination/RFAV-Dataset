After they've been sterilized with UV light, the crew's task is to enter the body of a leading miniaturization scientist who has been injured during his defection from the USSR, and save his life by using a laser to re - move a clot in his brain. During the mission, they get rerouted through a fistula, fend off attacks from the scientist's antibodies, and deal with depleted oxygen supplies by stealing some from his lungs. Cheesiness aside, 60 years later there are some striking parallels between the scriptwriter's imagination and today's medical science. We may not be able to shrink people, but scientists are harnessing properties they've observed at the nanoscale to create new devices and materials for medical applications. The shrunken submarine is last century's imagining of this century's nanoparticles, which are being developed to efficiently deliver drugs to precisely the locations where they are needed. Growing insight into the fundamental principles of biology and the underly - ing mechanisms of disease is allowing researchers to create groundbreaking therapies. The natural virus-defense system used by some bacteria has inspired a revolutionary new technique for gene editing. Key antibodies can now be identified, refined and cloned to boost our defenses against infection. And our understanding of the microbial world and its role in health and illness has multi - plied in recent years, offering new pathways for the prevention and treatment of some of the world's most prevalent diseases. Laser surgery is already old news for certain procedures. Thanks to Virtual Reality, students of anatomy can have an interactive 3D view of the human body, if not quite a submarine's-eye view. And there is even a safe form of UV light, these days, which entrepreneurs are employing in devices for the sanitation of hospital wards and nursing homes. In fact, it's not the vision of future health science in Fantastic Voyage that jars with the present so much as the movie's social context, and its focus on East- West hostility. The Cold War is no longer the most likely candidate for our self-destruction. Today, that sad name badge can be slapped on the asthmatic chest of climate change. As we celebrate some life-changing medical advances in the microbial realm, we must not lose sight of the big picture. It's staggering to think what medical miracles may be possible in another 60 years, but to realize them we need to stop treating the planet as an enemy and start regarding its health as synonymous with our own.

ILLUSTRATION BY JOHN DEVOLLEA Picture of HealthFRONTIERS OF MEDICINE / GENE EDITING 4 TREK / ALUMNI UBCTHE LONG AND WINDING CODE\"THE FUTURE IS here,\" the saying goes, \"it's just not evenly distributed yet.\" There's a good chance the last sci-fi movie you watched included an element of the fantastical that is already within our reach. To use the Star Trek yardstick, we may not have transporters and warp drive, but androids are old news, and if you own a Fitbit, you're basically wearing a tricorder. In the field of medical science, technology we associate with future generations is often already in play. Breaking scientific barriers is only half the battle - the real chal- lenge is scaling technology for entire populations. One of the largest gulfs between a technology that's currently available and the ability for the general public to access it can be found in CRISPR applications, which use a revolu - tionary gene-editing technique that allows us to alter the very code of our existence. CRISPR technology (technically called CRISPR-Cas9) is based on a natural virus-defense system used by some bacteria, in which a protein slices into a genome and alters the genetic code of a living organism with tremendous precision. \"Bacteria can be infected with viruses, so they developed a particular machinery that basically cuts the viruses into little pieces,\" explains Josef Penninger, direc - tor of UBC's Life Sciences Institute and the Canada 150 Chair of Functional Genetics. \"This is basically the bacterial immune system, and we use this bacterial machinery to cut into genes, to rapidly engineer genomes, to inactivate genes, to make single- point mutations in genes.\" The DNA sequences that comprise the CRISPR family are known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), and in less time than it takes to decipher that term, a CRISPR platform can combine those sequences with a Cas9 protein to cut into a cell's genome and add or remove genes. \"And it's not just engineering the genome in human cells or mouse cells,\" adds Penninger. \"It can be done essentially to every organism on the planet.\" The scope is almost beyond belief. CRISPR technology has already been used to engineer probiotic cultures in yogurt, to modify yeast for biofuels, to cure malaria in mosquitos, and to create hardier, more nutritious farm crops. The biomedical applications of gene editing are limited only by the imagination. Any malady that has a genetic component - either by birth or by mutation - has the po - tential to benefit from CRISPR gene-editing techniques. While many illnesses have environmental as well as genetic factors, being able to control the genetic contrib - utor to Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, muscular How CRISPR gene-editing technology is changing the future of health sciences. BY CHRIS CANNON ILLUSTRATIONS BY MARINA MUUN TREK / ALUMNI UBC 5 dystrophy, cancer and heart disease, just to name a few, can change the face of public health. Penninger wants to see that change happen at UBC, by building a CRISPR super-platform that will help medical researchers expedite the development of treatments for gene-related medical conditions, and work at the forefront of the rapidly evolving technology. It would be a major advancement in a scientific field that can barely keep up with the string of major advances it's lately enjoyed. Genomic science is barely out of diapers compared to other scientific fields. It's only 150 years since Gregor Mendel found - ed the field of genetics, less than 70 since we identified the structure of DNA, and 25 since the first cloned mammal. If you remember Dolly the sheep, you are older than the modern age of genetics. But these were passive applications - reading a book is one thing, writing a book is something else entirely. \"It's really the first time in our history where we don't have to just sit by and observe nature, to set up the exper - iment to see what happens,\" says Penninger. \"We can actively change the genetic setup of organisms, from flies to worms to mosquitoes to, of course, humans - all with the prom - ise of new human medicines.\" In terms of impact on healthcare, medicines are only the beginning. CRISPR tech has been able to turn adults' cells into stem cells, essen - tially turning back time. Researchers can then use those stem cells to create new tissues, which could eventually lead to the ability to grow entirely new organs genetically tailored for the individual. At the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, which Penninger led as the founding scientific director from 2002-2018, researchers are already growing blood vessels, heart compo - nents, and \"mini-brains\" that help researchers observe and understand how cancers develop. But what matters is where the tech - nology has its true impact - in patient care. The very concept of \"precision medicine\" is rare in healthcare, with the greatest resources generally steered towards the broadest applica - tions. Gene-editing technology opens the door to treatments for a host of rare diseases that might be cured in an afternoon. \"I think the first applications clearly will be in this rare, single-patient scenario,\" says Penninger. \"Because the common diseases - diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's - most of these diseases are multifactorial. It would be nearly impossible just to change one gene and we won't have Alzheimer's anymore or diabetes anymore. So the first people benefit - ing from these new technologies will be people with rare deadly diseases.\" Penninger tells the story of two siblings with a rare anemia that prevents them from making enough red blood cells, which the body needs to transport oxygen to the organs. Because this is caused by a genetic mutation, his team was able to use CRISPR techniques in stem cells to repair the underlying gene mutation and then create new red blood cells to model the disease process and test which genes are responsible.The father of the children has the same mutation, but he is perfectly healthy. So they took cells from the father, brought them back into a stem-cell-like stage, and compared them side-by-side with his children's stem cells. Experiments like this help them to understand the disease on an entirely new level, potentially leading to a solution as simple as turning off a light switch. But who pulls those switches? How do we know when we are crossing a line when that line is microscopic, and the options infinite? Penninger quotes Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov , where he called psychology \"a stick with two ends... it all depends on whose hands it is in.\" That's where we are with genetic science today, and since the genie is out of the bottle, that's a place we're going to have to get comfortable with. \"I think we all have to be aware we are tampering with technology, with nature, and there will be some accidents. But in the grand scale I think this is clearly technology that will advance biomedical research and medicine and advance our life on this planet.\" 6 TREK / ALUMNI UBCCRISPR TECHNOLOGY HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO EN- GINEER PROBIOTIC CULTURES IN YOGURT, TO MODIFY YEAST FOR BIOFUELS, TO CURE MA - LARIA IN MOSQUITOS, AND TO CREATE HARDIER, MORE NU- TRITIOUS FARM CROPS. THE BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF GENE EDITING ARE LIMITED ONLY BY THE IMAGINATION. TREK / ALUMNI UBC 7 It's a question we've struggled with since the dawn of technology - what risks are worth what rewards? Until just a few hundred years ago, this was a local question, affecting only those within the grasp of the decision-maker's reach. Since the industrial revolution, into the nuclear age, and now with the ability to literally program our environment, it's become a global one, where the future of the human race - for better or worse - could hinge on a single strand of modified DNA. How do we maximize the medical benefits of this biotech while preventing its misuse? How do we navigate the impossibly complicated regulations (and lack thereof) across 200-plus nations that can't even agree to stop making disposable plastic? How do we avoid starring roles in Jurassic Planet? \"Much of the challenge that we face in terms of policy, including CRISPR, is that whatever we find out about the magnitude and probability of risks and benefits, the choice about what counts as important and how they weigh against each other is not a scientific choice,\" says Michael Burgess, a biomed - ical ethicist at UBC's School of Population and Public Health who has been studying genetics for more than 25 years. \"Ethical theory doesn't determine that either. These are effectively political choices, and we have to involve an informed public in the discussion.\" And just how far is an informed public willing to take it? Almost universal- ly, Burgess says, people are more risk tolerant for technologies that address human health than they are for advances in environment and food systems. Splitting genes to solve diseases sounds a lot sexier to people than monkeying around with the food supply. So when it comes to our health, not to mention our future genetic lines, how far down that slippery slope are we willing to go before digging in the spikes? It's a tough question to answer if the slope keeps changing shape. \"Science moves incrementally in terms of its accumulation of knowledge,\" says Burgess, \"but it also tends to move social policy incrementally.\" It wasn't long ago that in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures were banned or unavailable in some countries, and, even if available, weren't covered by insurance. But as society more fully embraced having children as a natural right, IVF became a common feature in healthcare coverage. CRISPR applications are likely to be heading down the same slope, from a novelty few can access to a human right under the principle of equitable healthcare for all. Inevitably that means we will be deliberately changing the very nature of our descendants. \"Whenever we're assessing technology, there's the intended consequences, the thing we're designing something to do,\" says Burgess. \"And gene editing is an improvement over other forms of genetic modification, because it's much more precise in replacing a sequence in a certain place. What we don't know is what the effect of that is on the entire organism and over generations. So the question is, how far do we go? And then what do we do when we release that from a laboratory into a situation where the environment acts upon it?\" For the most part, we tend to accept that nature itself is unjust. It doesn't fairly distribute benefits and burdens, and over the course of history we have always intervened to figure out how we can better distribute our resources, the benefits of healthcare, and the risks of the technology we implement. But we are imperfect at assessing our own fallibilities, so often society has to make some guesses and take some chances. And usually the consequences of those guesses and chances are passed down to future generations. Often - as we have been recently reminded - this is for the better. Josef Penninger (centre) with students. He is the Canada 150 Chair in Functional Genetics and director of the Life Sciences Institute at UBC. 8 TREK / ALUMNI UBCNo other organization in Canada contributed to solving the COVID pandemic as much as UBC and the Life Sciences Institute, largely the benefit of work done years before. Pieter Cullis, who served as LSI's director before Penninger, developed the nanoparticles used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines more than a decade ago. UBC adjunct pro - fessor Carl Hansen and colleagues co-founded AbCellera - Canada's most valuable biotechnology compa - ny - and developed the first antibody treatment for the disease based on work done at the university's Michael Smith Laboratories in 2012. And Penninger's own work almost 20 years ago, before he arrived at UBC, established that the ACE2 enzyme found on the surface of most cell walls is the gateway through which viruses - including SARS- CoV - infect humans. Today, he is leading investigations into some promising anti-viral drug therapies targeting SARS-CoV-2, which caus - es COVID-19. \"Developing the vaccines we've got right now was a spectacular triumph of science,\" says Penninger. \"It's quite remarkable. And there would have been no way without Pieter Cullis' work that vaccines would have been developed that fast. You never know what, in 10 or 20 years, might save our planet.\" This is why Penninger thinks the time is ripe to develop in North America the type of organization he grew at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology in Vienna, considered one of the premier research facilities in the world. By transplanting the model to UBC, he envisions building a CRISPR hub available to research - ers from any field of science, offering a skeleton key to crack any genetic puzzle on earth. \"A super-platform will help any researcher working on any organism to get help from a team of expert technicians who are permanently up to date with the latest technol- ogies,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, CRISPR is CRISPR. You can adjust the basic technology to flies or humans to wheat. This really will allow everybody from every field to be faster and better.\" TREK / ALUMNI UBC 9 The Little Discovery Engine that Could UBC spinoff AbCellera's rapid response to COVID-19 has multiplied its capacity for discovering more antibody therapies, targeting everything from autoimmune disease to cancer.FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE / ANTIBODY ENGINEERING BY RICHARD LITTLEMORE ILLUSTRATION BY FERNANDO VOLKEN TOGNITHE ANTIBODY: IT'S a very small thing with a very big poten - tial. The right antibody at the right time can save your life. Or it can turn your fledgling UBC startup into a multi-billion-dollar compa - ny, almost overnight - although the latter possibility applies to a pretty rarified cohort. Either way, a good antibody can be hard to find. While the average per - son might produce a billion antibod - ies in a single day, they are typically versions that are designed to fend off familiar foes. If something new shows up - something like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 - your immune system is running blind. It prints out random antibody variants, working by trial and error to find one that is effective against the new threat and then hustling to make enough copies to have an impact. That can take weeks, during which you are dangerously exposed. So, it's nice to have help. One option is to use a vaccine - containing a \"dead\" virus, or a harmless feature of the pathogen - to safely introduce your immune system to a new threat. That triggers production of effective antibodies, but it still takes time for your system to react. In an emergency (as in, when you are already sick, haven't been vaccinated and are at heightened risk from the virus), it's better to have access to an external supply of the right kind of antibodies. These \"monoclonal\" antibodies are harvested from human (or, sometimes, zoonotic) sources, and cloned - brewed in large vats. The most famous example is the monoclo - nal antibody treatment from the US company Regeneron that was used to rescue then-President Donald Trump last year. But even here, time is the enemy. It's incredibly difficult to find, refine and develop monoclonal antibod - ies. V\u00e9ronique Lecault, the Chief Operating Officer of UBC spinoff AbCellera Biologics Inc., says that if 10 TREK / ALUMNI UBCyou are using conventional technology, which dates to the 1970s, it typically takes 10 years or more to go through the discovery and development process. Yet, from a standing start last March, AbCellera took just over three weeks to find and deliver a monoclonal antibody candidate that they called bamlanivimab (named, one assumes, by scientists, not marketing people). The drug giant Eli Lilly optioned the \"bam\" and quickly brought it to market, winning regulatory approval and finding eager and deep-pock - eted buyers all over the world. In December, when the already prof - itable AbCellera launched its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on NASDAQ, its $20 opening share price more than tripled and the company raised upwards of $555.5 million, ending its first day with a market capitalization of $12.65 billion. It was the largest bio - tech IPO in Canadian history. Again: very small antibody, very big potential. FOUNDATIONS It's tempting to restart this story in the laboratories named for UBC's Nobel laureate Michael Smith. That's where \"V\u00e9ro\" Lecault did some of the groundbreaking work on which AbCellera was founded. But it's worth stepping back even further, to intro - duce AbCellera's CEO, Carl Hansen. Edmonton born and raised, Hansen came to UBC in the 1990s to study engineering physics and honours math. He's still proud to have attained \"one of the most high-powered degrees in the country, maybe in North America.\" But heading to the California Institute of Technology for a doctorate in applied physics, Hansen realized that he had a decision to make. The great challenges in physics and math are \"100-plus-year-old problems\" against which people have been making very little headway. \"It was difficult for me to envision how I was going to contribute anything really fundamental,\" he says - where - as the field of biotechnology was Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to research antibody treatments for pandemics. The company also signed deals with some of the world's biggest drug makers to search for antibodies useful for treating other conditions. One of the key pieces of technology that made this all possible was \"a credit card-sized antibody discovery engine\" that earned V\u00e9ro Lecault her PhD. Originally from Mirabel, north of Montreal, Lecault had gone to the University of Ottawa for a joint degree in engineering and biochemistry, because she loved both disciplines and couldn't decide between them. Coming to UBC for a PhD in chemical and biological engineering, she soon found herself in Hansen's lab - like him, bridging traditional barriers be - tween engineering physics and biology. If \"engine\" gives you an image of some tiny outboard full of complicated moving parts, it's better to think of Lecault's device as the world's smallest test-tube tray - \"a miniaturized fluid handling system,\" as she describes it. It's made of a clear, flexible silicone compound called polydimethylsilox - ane (PDMS), which you might more commonly find in the form of contact lenses or as a shampoo ingredient (ap - parently PDMS makes hair shiny and slippery). In the AbCellera application, a thin layer of PDMS is dimpled with hundreds of thousands of very small chambers - nanolitre small (a nanoli - tre being a billionth of a litre). In classical fashion for someone who studied advanced astrophysics, Hansen begins his description of this device by saying, \"It's not rocket science, really.\" If you're trying to make measurements on a single cell, or trying to detect an antibody that a blood cell is fabricating and sending out into the environment, you'll be overwhelmed in a conventional volume of liquid, he says. \"It would be like trying to detect a drop of orange juice in a swimming pool.\" But if you take the same cell and put it into a volume 100,000 to 300,000 breaking wide open. At Caltech, the brilliant young researcher Dr. Stephen Quake was knocking down barriers in microfluidics and genomics, leading Hansen to believe that he could make a case for joining Quake's lab based on being an engineer - someone who could build devices for biomedical research. \"And by doing that,\" Hansen says, \"I get to work at the interface between engineering and biology and computation.\" And that, clearly, is a critical interface. Hansen finished his PhD in 2005 and returned to UBC as faculty, claiming his own bench in the Michael Smith Laboratories and building a team that was the definition of multidisciplinar - ity. In 2012, he broke out with former students Lecault, Kathleen Lisaingo (experimental medicine and biophys - ics), Kevin Heyries (biochemistry), Daniel Da Costa (engineering physics) and Oleh Petriv (cell biology), and formed AbCellera (think \"Ab,\" as the scientific signifier for \"antibody,\" and \"Cell,\" as in blood cell). The excitement of starting a uni - versity spinoff can wear off quickly. There follow years of scrabbling for financing and learning to manage a complex enterprise, even while re - fining groundbreaking science. Some startups get bought out early, leaving founders to pocket a profit, but mourn as some American pharma swallows yet another homegrown biotech. Less often, stubborn overachievers start grinding out a small profit, but even the biggest successes usually go 10 or 15 years before being ready for launch on a public stock exchange. The AbCellera team made the whole process look easy and quick. They doubled the size of their staff every year and attracted ever-larger grants and investments from foundations, governments and private investors, including Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and a member of AbCellera's board of directors. In 2018, AbCellera got US$30.6 mil- lion from the US Defence Advanced Loading a sample onto a robotic arm to perform high-throughput screening. Photo: AbCellera. TREK / ALUMNI UBC 11 CHOOSE THE BEST ANTIBODIES USING CUSTOM SOFTWARE DAY 23 DAY 6USE TINY TESTS TO SEARCH FOR ANTIBODIES DAY 17 DAY17 DAY 4 UNDERSTAND EACH ANTIBODY BY DECODING & READING ITS DNA DAY 9Within days of receiving the patient sample, AbCellera began screening 5,500,000+ immune cells individually to see which ones make antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. AbCellera used credit card-sized devices embedded with 200,000 tiny chambers to test millions of immune cells to find antibodies that stick to the surface of the virus. Positive hits glowed and machine vision was used to find and capture 2,000+ of these antibodies.By sequencing their DNA, 500+ different antibod - ies that bind to the virus' spike protein were found and analyzed. The virus uses its spike protein to infect healthy cells; antibodies that block the spike protein can prevent the virus from entering cells. Using Celium, and in silico tests, Eli Lilly and Company & AbCellera selected 190 of the most promising antibodies for potency testing with partners at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC).Filtered down 24 antibody frontrunners for drug development with the VRC and Eli Lilly and Company.A race against the virus Antibody treatments are essential during a pandemic, because they can be discovered and deployed much faster than vaccines and can potentially benefit people most at risk. Within 23 days of receiving a sample from one of the first US patients to recover from COVID-19, AbCellera and its partners identified 24 lead antibodies for drug development and clinical testing, which was initiated by Eli Lilly by day 90. This real-time response to COVID-19 shrunk the time it normally takes to develop a potential treatment from years to a few months. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infection and disease. At any given moment, the human body has over a billion immune cells that make antibodies. AbCellera's technology was used to scan, decode and analyze antibodies from the patient sample to find rare antibodies that could potentially block the virus. Data provided by AbCellera 12 TREK / ALUMNI UBCdistribute and sell the ultimate drug or treatment. This is both a nuisance and a good thing. It's a nuisance, Hansen says, because \"no one really believed that was a good way to build a business until it [AbCellera] really started to catch fire last year.\" It's a good thing, though, because of another business principle: it's risky to have too many eggs in one basket. ONE GIANT STEP FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK In March last year, when AbCellera received its first COVID-infected blood sample, it took just 23 days to identify 24 candidates for devel- opment as monoclonal antibodies. Within 90 days, bamlanivimab was in clinical trials, and before the end of the year, 15 countries had authorized its use. The US offered US$1.2 billion for 950,000 doses and promoted the treatment enthusias - tically. Canada paid US$21.3 million for more than 17,000 doses, but most of those continue to sit on the shelf. In circumstances that Hansen describes as both infuriating and heartbreaking, provincial health authorities across the country balked. Despite the international uptake, Canadian officials weren't convinced that the benefits of the treatment were worth committing the resources in an already overburdened system. (Each treatment requires a trans - fusion and must be administered early in the infection to be effective.) This rejection was a particular blow to AbCellera staff, some of whom had family members endure a shattering COVID infection, while being denied access to a treatment that might, at the very least, have reduced the severity and longevity of their sickness. It can't be a coincidence that, as governments concentrated their investment in COVID vaccines, AbCellera's share price slid from over $70 to less than $24, before climbing back (at time of writing) to just over $30. That more than halved the value of Hansen's own $3 billion-plus in AbCellera stock, but if he is annoyed, he is not deterred. Indeed, Hansen, who sports a Jeff Bezos hairstyle, also harbours an Amazon-level of ambition. (Asked if he might forsake management to concentrate on science, Hansen name-checked his exemplars - entrepreneurial founders who have made the jump from science nerd to CEO: \"Zuckerberg, Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos - it's hard to think of a counter example.\") In AbCellera's widening world, Hansen is forever talking in bil- lions and trillions. For example, he says, every individual on Earth has a capacity to fabricate \"somewhere north of a trillion different antibod - ies, different DNA sequences - some small fraction of which may bind in a way that could make it a drug.\" As a class of drugs, antibody-based treatments currently constitute a $240-billion industry. And AbCellera, which Hansen says has \"somewhere between 50 and 70 antibody drug discovery deals with some of the best companies in the world,\" is looking to find therapies for \"cancer, inflammation, autoimmune disease, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, infectious disease, just about every - thing.\" And while drug-company partners narrow their focus - and their potential - by concentrating on proven moneymakers, AbCellera will continue upgrading its investigative stack. It will leverage its COVID windfall and an incredible talent pool (UBC grads comprise more than half of AbCellera's staff) to bolster its discovery engine. So, no longer a very small thing, and the potential is bigger than ever.times smaller, you get a detectable concentration. Even better, if you can crowd hundreds of thousands of these chambers onto a piece of PDMS the size of a credit card, you can then assay hundreds of thousands of samples simultaneously - or you can if the rest of Hansen's team is there to manage microfluidic machine vision, hydrogen microscopy, and artificial intelligence adequate to generate and track enormous quantities of data. FROM SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION TO BUSINESS APPLICATION That, then, gets to the problem and the promise of the AbCellera business model. Conventionally, the simplest road to business success is to pick one thing and do it well, or to make one product and sell it many times. But Hansen and his colleagues don't want to start a medical device company. They want to leverage their multidis - ciplinary capacity to discover new an - tibodies, which, Hansen says, means they have to \"invest along the entire stack,\" bringing together specialties including biochemistry, genomics, sin - gle-cell analysis, microfluidic machine vision, instrument design (\"I probably forgot some\") to come up with a single antibody that can be replicated or formulated into a treatment or drug. With bamlanivimab, they proved that they can do so - and fast. But the AbCellera team isn't satis - fied with that, either. They don't want to find a single drug or treatment and build out a capacity to deliver it directly to market. They want to stay in the intellectually intense (and cap - ital intensive) space where they are discovering all the time - identifying antibodies that they can licence to big pharma companies that manufacture, Every individual on Earth has a capacity to fabricate \"somewhere north of a trillion dif - ferent antibodies, different DNA sequences - some small fraction of which may bind in a way that could make it a drug.\"Data provided by AbCellera TREK / ALUMNI UBC 13 HUMAN ON A CHIP UBC's Hedtrich Lab takes on Canada's other drug crisis.FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE / NEXT-GENERATION DRUGTESTING BY DIANE HAYNES PHOTOGRAPHY BY RAEFF MILES 14 TREK / ALUMNI UBCIT TAKES AT least 15 years and millions of dollars to bring a new drug to market, and most fail in Phase II or III of development.

Combining exper - tise in pharmacology, biomedical engineering and drug delivery, her team of 11 aims to estab - lish next-generation therapies, nanomedicine, and tissue engineering and regeneration with a particular focus on diseases of the human skin and lung. Their highly interdisciplinary work involves close collaboration with experts in chemistry, medicine and genetics. Perhaps most novel of all is the fact that Hedtrich does not use any animals in her research. \"Mice simply don't develop eczema,\" Hedtrich explains. \"[Researchers] trigger ecze - ma artificially and then use this as the model to test the drugs. But they have no idea if what they see in those animals represents what hap - pens in humans. In my field, animal models are not predictive enough. I am trying to develop human-centred methods to reduce, and maybe at some point replace, animal models.\" Hedtrich specializes in 3D tissue models, specifically of skin and lung tissues, that feature all of the important layers, structures and reactivity of human skin. She connects them with other 3D organ models to form a network that begins to resemble and behave with the complexity of a living human organ system. Organs on a chip. Hedtrich holds up a plastic chip approxi - mately 4 centimetres long by 8 centimetres wide by 1 centimetre thick - readily available online, apparently - out of which rise three circular, dished cylinders of different heights and diameters, each meant to hold a different organ tissue model. Each cylinder is connected to the others by a microfluidic channel etched into the plastic, to which a pump is attached that moves the culture medium through the channels to simulate blood flow. The whole thing resembles a cool-looking toy - Lego for lab nerds. \"In our bodies, no tissue is isolated,\" Hedtrich says. \"Everything is connected. When I apply something to the skin, it ends up in the bloodstream and then the liver. In order to predict what a drug will do in the hu - man body, you need complex systems where different tissues are connected.\"In a recent Nature article on how COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need for alternatives to animal models by which to study human viruses, Hedtrich et al state that once scientists are able to engineer a 10-organ system - with circulatory, endocrine, gastrointestinal, im - mune, integumentary, musculoskeletal, nervous, reproductive, respiratory and urinary tissue models - they will have achieved the complex - ity researchers require: human on a chip. Currently, setups are not modular (most chips aren't made to connect with one another), are expensive, require significant and highly specialized expertise to engineer and operate, and can take one to two years to build. Many researchers who need or would prefer to use these setups do not have the financial resourc - es or the expertise of a Hedtrich Lab to create the tissue models. \"If we want more people in biomedical engineering to use these, then we need cheaper systems and we need modular systems,\" Hedtrich says. While Hedtrich cautions that no large stud - ies have yet proven these models' superiority to animal models in predicting drug efficacy, she cites cosmetics and toxicity testing as immediate use cases. In fact, approximately 40 countries worldwide have already banned animal testing of cosmetics. Canada, however, is not one of them. At a policy level, Canada lags well behind the EU, Asian countries, South America and the US. A relatively recent arrival from Germany, Hedtrich expresses surprise over Canada's fail- ure to play a leading role in the global move - ment toward animal alternatives. However, she is unstinting in her praise of Canadian scientists in this field, saying they are at the forefront of this research. And, together with organizations such as the Canadian Centre for Alternatives to Animal Methods (led by UWindsor's Dr. Charu Chandrasekera) and the Canadian Society for Humane Science (led by UBC's Elisabeth Ormandy), she intends to build a national network to foster awareness, education and training, and collaboration. Hedtrich and Ormandy offer an undergradu - ate course at UBC - New Approach Methods in Biomedical Science. Hedtrich's lab-based grad - uate course will resume once in-person work is possible again, and she is committed to training young researchers in these alternative methods. She knows that unless something changes at the policy level, they'll face the same barriers to accessing funding and even to publishing their research findings that she faces now. \"The field is still in its infancy,\" Hedtrich concedes, \"but I'm convinced this is the future.\"US$2.6b Current average cost to develop one new drug 6,013 Number of active clinical trials in Canada in 2020 15 years Average time to market for a successful drug 4,562,522 Number of animals used for scientific purposes in 2019 (self-reported) up to 90 Percentage of drugs that fail in development TREK / ALUMNI UBC 15 The Language of the Eyes BICYCLE, VELVET, CHURCH.

Count backwards from 100 by intervals of seven. Now, what were those three words? The test is known as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the 30-question exam is standard in both clinical and research settings for non-invasive diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementias. My 80-year-old mother, a primary school teacher from 1962 to 2002, attempts to answer questions her students might have aced. She fails. Perhaps worst of all, she knows it. In 2016, her score is 26 out of 30. She is given a diagnosis of MCI, and we leave the clinic shaken but determined to beat this thing. By 2017, it is 17. In 2018, it's 9. According to the geriatrician, at 9 she should not be mobile, or able to feed or toilet herself. But she is. She is also gardening, exercising, lunching with friends. Right now, though, she is crying. Despite having provided no functionally useful information and no change to the course of treatment, this latest test feels like a TKO. *** According to the Alzheimer's Society of Canada, 44 mil- lion people worldwide - including over 747,000 Canadians - are living with Alzheimer's or another dementia. The in - cidence of dementia increases five-fold every year from age 65 onward; one in four seniors aged 85-plus has a dementia diagnosis. Most insidiously, new research shows changes in the brain and body up to 20 years before symptoms appear. Therapies with the potential to slow or alter dementia's progression have failed to date in part because by the time a diagnosis is made, neurological changes are too far advanced for the interventions to be effective. Because of disease stealth and persistent social stigma, drug trials are struggling to find enough appropriate candidates, and screening costs can reach $100,000 per person. Already, up to 90 per cent of all potential therapeutics fail in the development stage. But right now, potentially efficacious dementia drugs are failing for lack of trial participants. In 2018, these numbers drove Pfizer out of the Alzheimer's race altogether. Enter: CANARY. Ever the emblem of the sensitive early warning system, in this case, CANARY is acro - nymic for Clinical Data, Natural Language Processing and Eye Tracking for Dementia Risk Stratification. Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disrupts gaze and language pathways, and signs are detectable before any cognitive symptoms appear. A UBC team was first in the world to determine that by tracking the two behaviours in concert and over time, they can identify and assess risk for MCI and Alzheimer's disease with greater success than by assessing either in isolation. Dr. Thalia Field leads the CANARY team, a group of multidisciplinary researchers working in natural language processing, machine learning, AI, computer science and neurology. A stroke neurologist and clinician-researcher with UBC Medicine, Field champions the use of technolo - gy to improve experiences and outcomes for both clini - cians and patients. Her colleague Dr. Hyeju Jang is a CIHR postdoctoral fellow in Computer Science and the Data Science Institute at UBC and the BC Centre for Disease Control. With a doctorate from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, Jang explores humans' use of language through the lens of computation. They built a machine learning model from a 1980s dataset comprising audio recordings and transcriptions of 257 dementia patients and 242 healthy elderly controls. Using a neural network, a relatively new form of machine learning algorithm, and including age as a factor, the model changes as new volunteers enter the study and the dataset grows. By tracking speech patterns and eye move - ments in concert, the model's predictions as to whether someone is clinically at risk for dementia or a healthy control has improved from 73 to 80 per cent.FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE / ASSESSING DEMENTIA RISK A novel method for assessing dementia risk could help populate critical drug trials.

These five exercises form the core of the CANARY test. Although I'm nervous, Field's research assistants, Caitlin Lewis and Tom Soroski, put me at ease. Now in my mid-50s, I'm apprehensive about what the test might reveal, but since there's no apparent right or wrong, I find myself enjoying it. Then, after a short survey about the experience, Tom and Caitlin administer the MoCA - the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. I quickly recognize most of its content from the MMSE. I repeat sequences of words and numbers after Caitlin. I draw a clock that says 10 minutes after 11, but my 3D cube is all wonky.

Dr. Brett Finlay and colleagues think that many \"non-communica - ble\" diseases - including obesity, heart disease and diabetes - may actually be transmitted through the trillions of microbes in and on the human body.WHAT LINKS HAVE BEEN FOUND BETWEEN MICROBES AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS)? For over a century, since microbiologists Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur showed that microbes caused infectious diseases, our approach to prevention and treatment has been to kill pathogens through sanitation and the use of antibiotics, as well as the use of vaccines. As a result, diseases like scarlet fever and polio are no longer the killers they once were, but this decline in infectious disease has coin - cided with an increase in what are classified as non-communicable diseases, such as diabe - tes and asthma. It was only 10 to 15 years ago - after research into increased rates of child asthma - that we started to realize that in getting rid of all the bad microbes we had also been destroying some of the beneficial ones that we need to have in us and on us. The research proved that if children don't get early exposure to beneficial microbe, they won't develop normally and are at greater risk of developing asthma later on. Since then, most other prev - alent Western diseases - including allergies, obesity, Alzheimer's disease and cardio - vascular disease - have also been linked to a lack of beneficial microbes (or increase in detrimental ones). The best example of a causal role for microbes, mechanistically, is cardiovascular disease. We know people can get atheroscle - rosis because the microbes that break down red meat use an enzyme to do so that leads to a secondary product, which causes harden - ing of the arteries, leading to heart disease and stroke. The exciting part is that in animal models, if you inhibit those microbial enzymes, you can prevent cardiovascular disease - no mat - ter how much red meat is consumed. So the determining factor is not so much cholesterol levels as the presence of certain microbes. We have demonstrated that people with a wide range of conditions, from obesity and inflammatory bowel disease to type 2 diabe - tes and cardiovascular disease, have altered microbiota. Of course, there are probably genetic components to some of these diseases, but for those you can't explain based on ge - netics, it always comes down to the microbes.FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE / HUMAN MICROBIOTA Illustration: Margie and the Moon 18 TREK / ALUMNI UBCBRETT FINLAY, OC, OBC, FRSC Leading microbiologist who holds the Peter Wall Distinguished Professorship at UBC, special izing in the role microbes play in health and disease>> BOOKS As well as publish ing hundreds of academic papers, he has coauthored two books aimed at the public: Let Them Eat Dirt: Saving Your Child from an Oversanitized World and The Whole-Body Microbiome: How to Harness Microbes - Inside and Out - For Lifelong Health>> CURRENT PROJECT Tracking children born during the pandemic to investigate the longterm effects of hygiene and isolation on their health and microbial balanceWHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT MICROBES TRANSMIT THESE DISEASES BETWEEN PEOPLE? Animal experiments involving fecal transfer from diseased humans into healthy mice have shown that the disease phenotype is also transferred. That is pretty stunning. It's like putting a human pathogen into an animal model and seeing it cause disease. It's even been shown to be the case with Parkinson's, which is a brain disease. Of course, you can't try the same experiment with humans to see if they get sick, but the risk of inflammatory bowel disease is much higher in spouses of people with the condition than it should be, for example, because they are sharing the microbes that are involved in this disease. And if you have an obese friend, you have a much higher chance of being obese yourself. There was also an interesting study on an island in the South Pacific, where the researchers figured out who was married to whom just by looking at the microbes in the feces. The Achilles' heel of these experiments is that you can't definitively prove the microbes are transmitted rather than independently picked up from a shared environment and lifestyle. But data shows people do exchange microbes with one another - for example, tens of millions of them with a kiss - and microbes from dogs are picked up in their owners, which can't be accounted for by a shared diet. There are lots of smoking guns. DOES YOUR HYPOTHESIS APPL Y TO ALL NCDS? I think different diseases involve different microbial contributions. I looked closely at cancer. If microbes are involved, spouses of people with cancer should show increased incidence, but that really didn't show up, so I think cancer is a genetic change - usual- ly a particular mutation that causes cells to proliferate. Unless the microbes are gener - ating those mutations, they probably don't have a lot to do with it. IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'RE LEARNING, WHAT NEW TREATMENTS AND PREVENTION ARE BEING DEVELOPED? I'm working with companies to develop live bio-therapeutic products, or LBPs, which are like a probiotic but targeted at specific diseases or their prevention. Most of us in the field believe that, eventually, we should be able to take mixtures of microbes and correct issues that the harmful microbes, or lack of beneficial microbes, are causing. Most of the treatments available today involve fecal transfers. Life-threatening Clostridium difficile infections, for example - which can set in after microbes are killed off by the antibiotics used during surgery - has a 95 per cent cure rate using this method. A form of inflammatory bowel disease, ulcer - ative colitis, has a 40-45 per cent success rate, which is much better than any drug treatment we have. Even in autism, there are some inter - esting fecal transfer studies coming out. WHAT CAN WE DO NOW TO LESSEN OUR CHANCES OF DISEASE? When COVID hit, the only way we had to deal with it was the same way we had in the past, and that's through hygiene measures. The last year has drastically changed our world from a microbial point of view, and we need to pay attention to this, because I think we will see an effect. I can't give you a microbe pill today. But I can tell you to take the kids outside and let them play in the dirt, get a dog in the house, change to a healthier diet - all these things push microbes in a healthier direction to decrease the damage that's been done. Each generation we get cleaner and clean - er, and living in cities means our microbes are getting less and less diverse. I'm really concerned that two or three generations from now, we'll realize that we've killed off microbes that we actually need to survive as a species. There are even researchers who are bio-banking microbes from various isolated communities around the world, such as Papua New Guinea, because they have very different microbes than the rest of society. Just realizing that microbes are intrinsically involved in the evolution of our species, and that they themselves evolve, changes how you think about diseases and what you can do to prevent them. It used to be that you eat a healthy diet because it gives you the right vitamins and nutrients. And now that book has been rewritten: you eat a healthy diet, because it makes your microbes healthier - and they then have a beneficial effect on you. It always comes down to the microbes.Illustration: Margie and the Moon TREK / ALUMNI UBC 19 COVID-19 HAS EXPOSED major gaps in our ability to prevent and respond to infec - tious disease outbreaks. As many epidemics including SARS, HIV/AIDS and Ebola have shown, we must include animal and envi - ronmental health factors in our discussions. In fact, there is increasing awareness that managing the overlapping health threats we currently face means shifting the overall frame within which we consider wellbeing to what is called \"Planetary Health,\" defined by the Lancet as \"the health of human civiliza - tion and the state of the natural systems upon which it depends.\" One of the most urgent imperatives for this shift is the need to generate a healthy response to climate change, which is rec - ognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the biggest threat to global health in the 21st century. And that threat is in - creasing. The Vancouver I grew up in is now bathed in smoke most summers. People with allergies on the Prairies are sneezing through longer and more severe pollen seasons. And Lyme disease is impacting an ever-larger part of Canada. As an emergency physician in Yellowknives Dene Territory, I serve a patient population extending up to the high Arctic, where Inuvialuit, Dene, and Gwitch'in peo - ples are already coping with the unstable ice, food insecurity, and mental health challenges that come with living in a place that is 3 \u00b0C warmer than when their octogenarian Elders were born.My UBC training prepared me for many health emergencies, but not this one. How should we respond? The Lancet tells us that tackling climate change is our biggest health opportunity. Many of the measures needed to stabilize our ecological foundations would have corre - sponding health benefits. A recent Harvard study showed that in 2012, 34,000 Canadians died as a result of fossil fuel-related air pollution. Dirty air contributes not only to new asthma cases in children, but also to the top five chronic diseases that kill Canadians: cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, and diabetes. The poten - tial to save lives by decreasing air pollution, along with greenhouse gas emissions, is tremendous. Climate policy is health policy. Progress in low-carbon technology provides us with new options. As with tobacco, we need to stop facilitating unhealthy choices and make healthy ones cheaper and easier to access. It is a step in the right direction that the federal carbon pricing backstop was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada. It is a shameful step backwards that, as of May 26, $31.68 billion in public money ($842.72 per capita) has been spent since the start of the pandemic to support fossil fuel energy in Canada (according to the Energy Policy Tracker out of the International Institute for Sustainable Development and Columbia University).

Far better to spend that money on retraining and early pensions for fossil fuel workers to help them transition to work in a clean economy. We can save lives with health-conscious decisions on energy, transportation and the built environment. The entire world now has increased access to low-pollution energy; we need to stop telling ourselves that fracking for gas in Northern BC and exporting it as LNG to other countries is a net benefit to the globe. It's not. It also risks marring Beautiful British Columbia for generations to come. We need zero-emissions vehicle mandates, support for energy-efficient home retrofits, and continuing upgrades to active transport infrastructure. Walking and cycling both have tremendous health benefits. The National Health System in the UK recent - ly committed to achieving Net Zero by 2040, telling suppliers that within the decade they will purchase only from companies with equal or greater sustainability commitments. VGH- based surgeon Andrea MacNeill has founded a Planetary Healthcare Lab, and connections and energy are building across the country. In a Yellowknife study done in partnership with UBC's Dr. Caren Rose, we found that two and a half months of wildfire smoke in 2014 was associated with double the normal number of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department. The qualitative part of our study demonstrated that this prolonged smoky period made people feel isolated, anx - ious, disconnected from the land and physical activity, and worried about what the future may bring for their children. In almost every media interview I've done since then, the reporter has asked, \"Doctor, is this a new normal?\" And every time I've had to say, \"No. It is going to get worse. We need to prepare.\" Due to greenhouse gas emissions already built up in the atmosphere, by the time a child born today in Canada is in their early twen - ties, the country will be 1.8 \u00b0C warmer than it was at a new baseline drawn by Environment and Climate Change Canada between 1986 and 2005. If we continue along our current high-emissions pathway, that same child will be living in a country 6.3 \u00b0C warmer by their early sixties. Encouragingly, the final theme we picked up on in our qualitative study on wildfires was the pride and feeling of empowerment expressed by people who had taken an active role in responding to the threat - fire-smart - ing their homes, organizing indoor activities for children in clean air shelters, or readying boats in case of highway blockage by fire. Preparation not only does good, it feels good. Action feels better than anxiety. Awareness of the need to co-manage climate change and the recovery from COVID-19 is increasing. As the head of advocacy for the WHO Civil Society Working Group on Climate Change and Health, I helped to launch a healthy recovery initiative asking G20 leaders to prioritize low-carbon invest - ments. That letter was signed by organiza - tions representing two thirds of healthcare workers worldwide. To our knowledge, this is the greatest ever show of consensus amongst healthcare professionals. As we emerge from this pandemic, we must begin by thanking the children who have stayed at home, mostly to protect their adults, by building a world coming out of it that will protect them. TREK / ALUMNI UBC 21 WHAT IS THE THEORY BEHIND VR'S ABILITY TO RE- LIEVE PAIN? We know the brain can suppress pain by modifying sen - sory input. A good illustration of this is that if you have more than one type of pain - both knee and hip pain, for example - you tend to only focus on one of them at a time, as neural pain attenuation tends to work in a prioritizing manner. Virtual Reality is a deeply immersive experience and essentially works as a very powerful form of distrac - tion. It transports you to a computer-generated beach or forest - anywhere we want - and the immersion is so complete you can hear a bird tweeting, look in its direc - tion, and see it as you move around. Although the graphics may not be as high fidelity as in real life, they are convinc - ing enough to make you perceive you are actually there. Having the patient perform therapeutically designed activities in a VR environment forces their brain to focus on something other than the pain and allows them to get some relief from it. HOW HAS IT PROVEN EFFECTIVE? There is far more research on acute pain than on chron - ic pain. It's been shown to work well for burn patients having dressings changed, for example, immersing them in cold or snowy virtual environments that psychological- ly reduce the heat and pain. It's also been shown to help when giving kids injections, and I imagine in five years' time most pediatric clinics will have a VR headset they can use to distract kids during those sorts of procedures. For chronic pain, the results are still mixed, but it does seem to work well for some things, such as phantom limb pain. In fact, VR is becoming a standard therapy for this, providing experiences where the patient sees both limbs working. This seems to have a profound effect on the brain and a person's experience of pain.Mind Games Virtual Reality has the power to transport a user's mind to an infinite number of places and scenarios, but is it powerful enough to block out external pain? Nursing prof Bernie Garrett discusses the technology's potential. FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE / PAIN RELIEF ILLUSTRATION BY GRACIA LAM 22 TREK / ALUMNI UBCDESCRIBE YOUR CURRENT RESEARCH Chronic pain is a huge issue in Canada affecting millions of people, and it's not well managed in the health system. As nurses, we're very interested in practical applications of technologies in healthcare, so we are using VR in the homes of cancer patients with chronic pain who have been on opioids long term to see if we can help alleviate their pain in other ways. We're giving them VR headsets to use for a month and measuring their pain scores, sleep index and functional ability. A control group is viewing the same ap - plications, but on a computer screen instead of in VR. Most pain-related VR research tends to occur in clinics and ad- dress acute pain. We're the first to conduct trials in people's homes and explore VR's use as a daily pain reduction tool. WHAT ARE THE CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCING IN VR TO HELP ALLEVIATE THEIR PAIN? We have four VR applications. Two are cognitive, requir - ing patients to problem-solve. For example, one involves navigating a three-dimensional light maze by manoeu - vring mirrors to move light beams. Such spatial prob - lem-solving involves a lot of high-level cognitive activity. The other two applications offer more introspective ex - periences - for example, a guided meditation experience while walking through a forest. WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED SO FAR? COVID-19 restrictions mean the trials are on hold, but, as soon as we are able to recruit enough participants, we will have a good sense of whether the VR is making a difference in terms of their pain. So far, electroencepha - logram (EEG) studies have shown some distinct patterns. These include changes in the brain's alpha-theta band - widths, areas usually associated with more inward-atten - tive and reflective activity.RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS NEEDED The researchers are recruiting cancer outpa tients who are over 16 and experiencing moderate to severe daily pain. For more information, contact Crystal Sun, UBC School of Nursing, 604 822 7679 / crystal.sun@ubc.ca COULD VR THERAPY REPLACE PHARMACEUTICAL PAIN RELIEF? At the moment, we're exploring it as an adjunctive ther - apy. Many patients with chronic pain are taking opioids, which are powerful narcotics with side effects, so any - thing we can do to reduce the amount they need is helpful. Also, patients can only tolerate VR for about 30 minutes, after which they can get eye strain and neck ache. So, people get a pain holiday for half an hour, but in terms of continual use we're not at the stage where we can use VR to supplant drugs. New technologies being developed that use projected VR environments instead of a headset could eliminate these limits. They would also permit more de - tailed neurological studies, such as MRI scans of the brain during a VR experience - currently impossible because of the metal in headsets.

Transfusion patients must receive either their own blood type or type O to avoid an immune response. The ability to convert any type of donated blood into type O, then, would be a game changer, and UBC researchers are inching closer to that lifesaving alchemy. By removing the antigens that distinguish A and B blood types from O, scien - tists have demonstrated that conversion is possible, but it has never been achieved at sufficient scale. The antigens are removed using enzymes that feed on sugars with a similar structure, and in 2018 the UBC researchers achieved a breakthrough when they identified a group of enzymes found in the human gut that are 30 times more efficient at the process. The following year, they succeeded in turning a unit of type A blood into type O using enzymes they had isolated and cloned. They are now testing the process for safety before moving on to clinical trials and, with help from the entrepreneurship@UBC program, have formed a company called ABOzymes Biomedical to facilitate this process.

They have developed what could be the bone implant material of the future, and it's derived from plant cellulose. The airy, foam-like substance can be injected into the body to provide scaffolding for new bone growth. It's made by treating nanocrystals derived from plant cellulose so that they link up and form a strong but lightweight sponge - technically speaking, an aerogel - that can compress or expand as needed to completely fill out a bone cavity. When there are gaps, implant failure can occur, as is sometimes the case with current (mostly ceramic) implants. The aerogel implants are expected to break down into non-toxic components in the body as the bone starts to heal. More testing is required before clinical trials can begin, but the material's future applications include dental implants, and spinal and joint replacement surgery.

Although effective drugs already exist for treating glaucoma - which is the number one cause of irreversible blindness in the world - the challenge lies in delivering them to where they're needed. Medicated drops have a tendency to roll off the eye instead of being absorbed, and don't always reach the back of the eye where the drug is needed to repair neurons and relieve pressure on the optic nerve, which can progress to glaucoma. And although cannabinoids like CBGA (cannabigerolic acid) are effective at relieving symptoms, they don't easily dissolve in water - a barrier to their medicinal application. The team's solution was to develop a hydrogel and fill it with thousands of nanoparticles containing CBGA. Applied at bedtime, the substance responds to blinking and conditions within the eye to mould itself into a lens-like coating. The nanoparticles slowly dissolve overnight and penetrate the cornea. The drops are now undergoing clinical testing by industry partner, InMed Pharmaceu - ticals, and the researchers are exploring if the hydrogel can be used to deliver drugs for other eye disorders, such as macular degeneration.

In remote situations with no access to healthcare, sterilized soil could potentially be used to stem bleeding and save lives. And it doesn't get much more remote than the Moon. The researchers are now testing silicates from the lunar surface to see if they can trigger a similar clotting reaction. If so, they might have hit on a useful first aid strategy for future colonizers of the Moon.

He is one of six finalists. Read his story on the next page. >> TREK / ALUMNI UBC 31 CHANGE/ MAKERS Mozart, Brahms and Stravinsky spend a lot of time shut in at the Orpheum, but Jaelem Bhate, a rising star in Vancouver's classical scene, is literally and metaphorically taking classical music to new places. With his own symphony orchestra, Symphony 21, he's liberating the music from its concert hall confines and releas- ing it into the vibrant cityscape. Symphony 21 played their first concert in September 2019 against a backdrop of exposed brick in a heritage building between Gastown and Railtown. There were cocktail bars and craft beer taps at the back of the room. And although COVID-19 has made in-person performance impossible for the last year, it hasn't prevented the orchestra from exploring other novel venues. For their 2020 digital season, they performed and filmed one of their pieces - Kirsten Ewart's \"Warmth\" - from the deck of the St. Roch , a schooner that travelled the Northwest Passage, circumnavigated North America, and now rests at the Vancouver Maritime Museum on English Bay. This does not mean Bhate is averse to a traditional setting. He's conducted in some of Canada's grandest concert halls, including the Orpheum, where he conducted the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra in 2019. A few months earlier, he'd gained national recognition for his work when he was named one of CBC's \"30 Hot Classical Musicians Under 30.\" Bhate composes music with an understanding that all genres are intimately connected to one another. In high school, he was a drummer for a rock band called Negative Attraction - classi - cal and jazz initially paling in comparison to rock and roll. But Bhate came to love music in all its forms. Soon after he entered Could non-traditional venues give classical music a boost? BY ERIC DAVENPORT UBC as a science student, his old high school concert band performed at the Chan Centre. Bhate was asked to fill in as a conductor because of the BC teachers' strike. He describes it as a \"lightning-bolt\" moment that convinced him to drop science and join the UBC School of Music. Today, Bhate writes exhilarating pieces for jazz orchestra as well as classical. His inspirations stretch from Leonard Bernstein to the Beatles, and he created Symphony 21 in part so that people who don't think of themselves as classical listeners would give the music a fair shot. \"It's a way to introduce a new idea, so that people don't think they hate it before they even try it,\" he says. Part of the allure is the atmosphere Bhate creates. Ultimately, though, the music is the centre of his project. \"Everything else can sometimes get in the way of the art, and it should always be the other way around,\" he says. In the end, a compos - er's devotion is to the music. Everything else in the business is secondary.LIBERATING MOZART 32 TREK / ALUMNI UBCEngineer Kunal Sethi is secretive about what, exactly, his revolutionary germ-zap - per will look like. But it will be small, he says: a programmable, ceiling-mounted device roughly the size of a Wi-Fi router that quietly bathes entire rooms in ultra - violet light - potentially saving tens of thousands of lives each year. But wait - isn't UV light dangerous? Normally, yes, when the body is exposed to it in large amounts. So why is Sethi's Vancouver-based startup UVX trying to put ultraviolet emitters in operating rooms and hospital corridors? The secret lies in \"far-UVC,\" a type of UV light with a specific, tiny wavelength window (200-230 nanometers) that is harmless to humans but deadly to most germs. \"It's kind of a sweet spot,\" Sethi explains. \"Our outer layer of dead skin cells absorbs it, but it penetrates the cell nuclei of pathogens to inactivate them.\" UVX, which is part of the entrepreneur - ship@UBC program, plans to release its first device, the Zener, this fall. Sethi and UVX co-founder Saimir Sulaj - a native Albanian whom he met at a Vancouver hackathon - believe far-UVC technology could be the next major step in dis - ease prevention. \"At first, we'll focus on hospitals, long-term care homes, and COVID-19 testing clinics,\" Sethi explains. Now 26, he studied engineering but has had an interest in healthcare development since a botched surgery in his native Tanzania left him with chronic knee issues. When he came to UBC (with an International Leader of Tomorrow award), he co-founded the Kunal Sethi's tech startup UVX aims to mass-cleanse hospitals and care homes with a safe form of ultraviolet light. BY JARED DOWNING LIFE-SAVING LIGHT Kunal Sethi, BASc'17<< Co-founder of Randhawa Photography Tanzania Heart Babies Project to raise funds and awareness for children with congenital heart disease. His career shifted to health technologies after a pandemic-era call with a friend, a hospital nurse, who casually mentioned having to scrub down surfaces two or three times. \"We ended that conversation joking about an automatic robot disinfec - tor,\" Sethi says. But the more Sethi researched, the less of a joke it seemed. He learned that even before the pandemic, around 100,000 people died in the United States each year of infections contracted at hospitals, which are breeding grounds for drug-resis - tant superbugs. When Sethi learned about far-UVC technology, it had already been well-researched and was even undergoing clinical trials. Yet other than a few early experiments (including a self-cleaning plane lavatory by Boeing), it had not really hit the market. \"I guess there wasn't enough traction, enough interest before COVID-19,\" Sethi says. \"People often ask us, 'Is this only applicable to COVID-19?' And no, it's not, because you'll always have C. diff. , H1N1, Salmonella, other infectious pathogens beyond SARS-CoV-2.\" Sethi believes the pandemic will leave us, if nothing else, with a new appreciation for health and hygiene - and a new awareness of the microscopic killers that prey on the sick and elderly. He can see a future in which germ-killing lights shine in every bathroom, subway car and restaurant kitchen, quietly zapping our germs into oblivion. TREK / ALUMNI UBC 33 CHANGE/ MAKERS How many people can say that they've founded a business, led a major protest movement, delivered a keynote address at UBC graduation and published a book - all before the age of 30? Well, Cicely Belle Blain can, for one. Blain is an activist and educator who found their passion for social justice early, securing an $8-million grant to build a youth community centre when they were just a teenager. Blain credits the \"fearless\" women in their family for teaching them that \"activism is essential.\" Their grandmother, who protested against nuclear weapons in the 1970s and founded her hometown's antiracism task force, \"has always been a feminist, even before it was cool.\" After graduating from UBC, where they received the prestigious International Leader of Tomorrow Award, Blain co-founded the Black Lives Matter (BLM) Vancouver chapter. The intersection - ality at the heart of the movement was life-changing for them. As a Black, queer non-binary femme, Blain remembers their experience with BLM as \"the first time in my life I didn't have to hide or sacrifice any part of myself.\" That freedom to celebrate and share all aspects of their identity has shaped Blain's art as much as their activism. Last year, they published an intimate book of poems, Burning Sugar , described by the publisher as \"a poetic exploration of Black identity, history, and lived experience.\" Burning Sugar is for Blain a natural - though more personal - extension of their activism, using poetry to educate and to resist oppression. Blain also leverages their business chops to create change: they are the founder and CEO of Bakau Consulting, an equity, inclusion and anti-racism consulting com - pany. Blain has trained over 1,000 clients, transforming corporate spaces where their affiliation with BLM was once \"seen as too The co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Vancouver chapter uses poetry and education to resist oppression.

But Bakau's website reminds clients that, like protests, anti-racism work is not a single event but a continuous process that is \"always timely.\" Blain may be young, but they have been an activist long enough to witness several moments of cultural reckoning and massive media attention on anti-blackness and police brutality. Yet the violence continues. Today, is Blain hopeful? \"I'm exhausted,\" they say. \"Just because we are talking more about injustice doesn't mean automatic change.\" But their weari - ness is only rivalled by their optimism. Blain says they find hope in millennials' and Gen Z's fearlessness in discussing uncom - fortable truths, and remain committed to doing the daily work - whether in business, poetry or protest - that transforms communities.

The son of an admired UBC French professor, he might have been expected to excel at univer - sity. And he did, though not in the classroom, where one might expect, but on the playing fields. He became a star athlete when he arrived on campus in 1930, playing both basketball and \"Canadian rugby,\" which was not rugby at all, but the newer game of North American football. He was good at throwing forward passes and kicking converts and field goals. His offhand remarks were treated as witticisms, and he was soon to display a strong streak of loyalty, though not in a way that endeared him to Student Council. It was in his second year that he ran into difficulties. He hadn't completed his first year's studies, and so began to be declared ineligible for certain games. This was treated in a light-hearted way at first in a basketball game between \"Eligibles\" and \"Ineligibles,\" but things got more serious in the spring of 1932 when Council discovered that young Louis was playing for non-UBC teams. It seems his heart was much more in athletics than academics, and if he wasn't going to be allowed to compete as a UBC player, well then he would sign up for teams at the YMCA or the Vancouver Athletic Club or Ryerson United Church. No, no, no, said Council. It's against Alma Mater Society policy for UBC students to play for outside teams. Long before this The Ubyssey had railed against UBC athletes who played for outside teams, especially if they played against UBC. It is \"childish and petty,\" the paper said in 1924, \"and, further, it is disloyal.\" Council in 1932 took the BY SHELDON GOLDFARBWhen an overzealous 1930s student administration treated him unfairly, Louis Chodat claimed the moral victory, and then some. The men's senior basketball team, pictured in UBC's 1933 yearbook, likely suffered defeat at the hands of former UBC star player Louis Chodat, who played for an opposing team after being banned.same approach, warning Chodat to stop playing for the Y. Chodat said he would have to consult his teammates at the Y: a sign of loyalty, one might think, but the wrong sort of loyalty. Council fined him $5 (about $95 in today's money). Chodat refused to pay. Council took the case to the uni - versity administration, which agreed to issue a one-day suspension. The Ubyssey declared this a glorious moment. True, the bulk of the student body were on the side of the \"delinquent\" - and who wouldn't be? He was not being allowed to play for UBC, and then was fined for playing for others. But The Ubyssey thought there was an import - ant principle to uphold: the power of Student Council, the right of the Alma Mater Society to enforce its own rules, even if it created a little hardship for an individu - al student. The case made the papers outside UBC. The Vancouver Sun made him out to be a hero and said he came out the winner because he paid the fine and then was allowed to play for the Y. Not sure that really made him the winner. In any case, in the next few years Chodat continued to appear in the sports pages of The Ubyssey as a star player, but for outside teams playing against UBC. This raised no new issues because by that time he had left the university. He went on to join the air force and in 1940 married Stella Brinham. He died in 1978. He never finished his degree, the academic side of the Chodat inheritance being left to his sister Isabelle, who did complete a degree (in nursing) and even won a $15 prize on graduating in 1936. She went on to marry William Petrie, a physicist who also wrote a book on orchids. As to the rule against playing for outside teams, that was finally abolished in 1949 by a general meeting of the student body after Student Council once again tried to fine a \"delinquent\" athlete for playing for an outside team. Louis Chodat would have been pleased, one likes to think. Sheldon Goldfarb, PhD'92, MAS'96, is the archivist for the Alma Mater Society.

The 5G network recently installed on campus has a much higher bandwidth than the normal radio frequencies usually used for unmanned flight, allowing for smooth and accurate manoeuvring and the ability to share video and data with multiple remote users. Among many other potential uses, 5G drones may soon be employed for monitoring forest fires or transporting medical supplies to remote locations. The new 5G network is one of the most exciting technological developments on campus, and will allow researchers to explore many more innovative applications of the technology.

As we all know, those frontiers have been pushed back at an un - precedented speed in recent months, as researchers around the world - including at UBC - have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. This response has been complex and wide-ranging, addressing acute medical concerns and public health delivery, as well as broader social and mental health impacts. In collaboration with my colleague, Dr. Gail Murphy, UBC's Vice- President of Research and Innovation, I recently wrote an article for The Hill Times on this topic. It noted that UBC researchers have been working in collaboration with others around the world to develop treatments and vaccines for COVID. In fact, I'm proud to say that UBC labs - along with BC-based life sciences companies - have played an outsized role in the global efforts to address COVID-19. As a hub for nanomedicine and precision med - icine, BC's life sciences sector was well prepared to contribute, with three Vancouver-based companies in particular leading the way - all with UBC connections. One notable success, Acuitas Therapeutics, has developed critical drug delivery systems and contributes the lipid formulations needed for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to enter human cells. AbCellera - which has pioneered an artificial intelligence- and micro - fluidics-powered antibody discovery platform - partnered with phar - maceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. to develop an antibody treat - ment for COVID-19 authorized by Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration. AbCellera went on to post the largest-ever IPO for a Canadian biotechnology company, becoming the country's most valuable biotechnology company with a market capitalization of more than $8 billion at the time of writing. (See page 10.) Vancouver's Precision NanoSystems has multiple clients working on COVID-19 vaccines and recently announced that, with federal support, they will leverage their cutting-edge biomanufacturing PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE BC's response to COVID19 reveals the potency of its life sciences sector. UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono platform to build one of Canada's first large-scale manufacturing facilities capable of producing mRNA vaccines and other genetic medicines. Each of these companies has been celebrated as a success story of Canadian science and in - novation, not only in response to COVID-19, but in an increasingly competitive and global biotechnology industry. They exemplify what it means to operate on the frontiers of science and medicine. Each is a spinoff from UBC, formed initially around research at university laboratories and fostered on campus. This ongoing connection to the university's scientific enterprise remains vital to their success today. Their success has been enabled by fun - damental research, with UBC scientists advancing our understanding of natural processes over many years - in some cases, decades - to a point where it was possible to develop breakthrough platform technologies. In the case of Acuitas, the foundation was laid in the 1980s by a team of UBC researchers who started with a desire to understand the roles of lipids in biological membranes and realized the applications for precision drug delivery technologies. I'm proud of the role that UBC - its faculty, its students, its staff and its facilities - has played in these COVID-19 success stories. And it gives me confidence that we can face future challenges in the same way. 40 TREK / ALUMNI UBCWe are invested in your future success.

The researchers examined people's preconceptions about misshapen food and found that consumers expected imperfect pro - duce to be less tasty and even less nutritious than standard, even though there was no rational basis for this. \"People attach a beauty premium to attractive objects, and believe they have all kinds of positive attributes,\" explains UBC Sauder PhD student Sid - dhanth Mookerjee, who co-authored the study THE RESEARCH: \"Misshapen\" fruit and veg are often discarded by farmers and retailers in the US, or avoided by consumers, leading to the wastage of more than 65 millions of tons of edible food a year, along with the land and water used to grow it. In 2014, a French supermarket chain started selling imper - fect-looking produce by marketing it as \"ugly,\" and others soon followed suit using a variety of marketing strategies. Some of these worked, others didn't - so profs from the Sauder School of Business dug into the factors that make consumers embrace or turn up their noses at misshap - en vegetables. THE BOTTOM LINE: More consumers buy misshapen produce when it is de ugliness penalty effect, which negatively impacts perceptions of objects.\" But when the researchers tested the efficacy of \"ugly\" labeling through multiple field studies - including one at a local farmers market where they sold both attrac - tive and unattractive toma - toes, carrots and potatoes - they found customers spent more on the misshapen produce when it was labeled \"ugly,\" even spending more on it than on the standard produce. And click-through data from online food ads showed the term \"ugly\" to be more effective than terms like \"imperfect.\" \"Ugly\" signals to consum - ers that the only difference between items is aesthetic, says Mookerjee, which makes them aware of their bias and significantly increases their willingness to buy the less attrac - tive produce. Although the \"ugly\" pro - duce was sold at a 25 per cent discount, it turned out to be more profitable for sellers, as the cost of acquiring it was lower. But if the discount is too high, caution the researchers, consumers begin to suspect the quality of the produce. IMPAIRED DRIVING THE RESEARCH: UBC researchers studied prescription records and ve - hicle collision reports to find out if the use of common prescription drugs, such as opioids and medication for treating anxiety and depres - sion, increased the risk of road accidents.\u00a9 AB-7272 / Adobe Stock Ugly potatoes Millions of tons of edible produce is being discarded because of the way it looks. Could food labelling stop the rot? 44 TREK / ALUMNI UBCTHE BOTTOM LINE: British Columbia drivers prescribed sedating an - ti-psychotics have a 35 per cent increased risk of causing a road collision, while people on commonly prescribed benzodiazepines (like Valium or Xanax) increase their risk by 25 to 30 per cent. In the case of high-potency opioids such as morphine, the study showed a 24 per cent in - creased risk of collisions. Researchers including Dr. Jeff Brubacher, an associate professor at UBC's faculty of medicine, studied prescrip - tion records and motor vehi - cle collisions from a 20-year period in BC. This included almost five million drivers, over 131 million prescrip - tions, and over 600,000 collisions from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2016. The team analyzed police reports to determine which drivers were responsible for crashes, and then compared the risk between drivers with active prescriptions and those without any pre - scriptions. They also assessed whether tolerance might play a factor. People with a new prescription (less than 30 days) and people with an established prescription (more than 30 days) turned out to have similar risk. Brubacher stresses that even if people don't feel any symptoms, such as drowsiness, they are still at greater risk of causing an accident, especially if taking several medications at the same time. He says the results indicate a need for more caution on the part of drivers and specific advice from prescribing physicians. They could also help inform warnings on medication labels and public education campaigns. \"[It] shows us how com - plicated the economic activity and the environment relationship is,\" says Noack. \"There needs to be more nuance when it comes to addressing environmen - tal issues. \"If we were to save the en - vironment by only focusing on one sector [like limiting manufacturing, industry and transportation], it might give advantage to pollution in a different sector like ag - riculture.\" Noack suggests that more industrialized countries like Canada could learn from the pandemic by maintaining flexible work-from-home policies beyond the crisis, in order to reduce the im - pacts of industry and trans - portation on air quality. The study also encourages the use of a mix of targeted policies that include all economic activities, and underlines the importance of market-based environ - mental instruments like pollution taxes or cap-and- trade systems.POLLUTION AND THE PANDEMIC THE RESEARCH: Lockdown measures have slowed economies. Researchers assessed the effect this has had on levels of air pollution, and whether the effect has been compa - rable around the globe. THE BOTTOM LINE: On average, air pollution has dropped 45 per cent do - mestically and 35 per cent internationally during the first wave of lockdowns. But some world regions expe - rienced an increase, based on their economic activity. The study linked detailed data on lockdown timelines with satellite pollution data from 162 countries, factor - ing in times where lockdown restrictions eased. Although it focused on global urban centres, the researchers found significant differenc - es in air pollution trends from country to country. Most of North and South America, Europe, southern Africa, eastern Asia and the Pacific saw improved air quality during lockdown, \u00a9 OlgaKorica / Adobe StockIndustrialized countries like Canada could learn from the pandemic by maintaining flexible work-from-home policies beyond the crisis, in order to reduce the impacts of industry and transporta - tion on air quality.but some parts of South America and Asia saw air quality worsen. \"It's really about the source of the pollution here,\" says Dr. Frederik Noack of UBC's Faculty of Land and Food Systems. \"Lockdowns don't automatically mean air quality improves, be - cause in less industrialized countries you might see more biomass burnings, [and] increased agricultural activities and residential energy use.\" Indeed, some countries saw air pollution increase by as much as 25 per cent.

She was referring not to the transit hub, but to the campus caf\u00e9 (situated beside UBC's original bus stop, now occupied by a Triple O's). The caf\u00e9 was noteworthy both for the cozy solace it gave homesick students like Fieguth, and for its quirky layout. Servers bustled about with coffee and cinnamon buns in several sunken pits, placing them at face-level with the customers perching at the sur - rounding counters. The impression from a distance, according to one former patron, was that the staff all appeared to be incredibly short. Those seemingly tiny waitresses, many of whom had worked there for REWIND decades, made up a large part of the caf\u00e9's charm. Alumni remember the servers as motherly figures whose sound advice and good humour buoyed up many a floundering student. The servers' legendary kindness made them campus \"celebrities in their own right,\" recalls Andy Shaw, BCom'84. When Shaw ran into a former Bus Stop waitress in Kits thirty years after he'd graduated, he recognized her instantly. Alas, there is an end to everything. In 1990, despite students' petitions and mournful letters to The Ubyssey , the caf\u00e9 served its last cup of coffee and the David Lam Management Research Library sprouted up in its stead. Announcing the library's open - ing, The Ubyssey grumbled, \"Those of us who remember the Bus Stop Caf\u00e9 are thinking this building better have a damn good snack bar.\"BY RACHEL GLASSMANA home away from home Last day of service at the Bus Stop Caf\u00e9.

And yet when people are hired into a new workplace, they are often expected to assimilate to its cultural norms. The challenge is that while the creation of a diverse workforce is a positive step, it takes more to create a workplace culture in which all employees can thrive. Going beyond representational diversity to promote authentic inclusion requires intentional practices that include shifting the culture to make room for new perspectives and experiences; creating intentional processes for working through conflict; and being clear and transparent about deci - sion-making, as well as thoughtful about how colleagues are recognized and valued. When an organization is not prepared to support a diverse workforce beyond the hiring of one, harmful consequences for both individuals and businesses can result. Low retention rates and the need to rehire for the same position can reduce an organization's stability and contribute to rep - utational damage that may reduce the number of highly qualified applicants keen to join it. This in turn can generate doubt about the value or legitimacy of hiring from diverse candidate pools. Without a plan to interrupt it, the cycle continues. The following guidelines offer a helpful starting point for establishing a welcoming culture that values all employees. Assess your current status Before developing new hiring strategies, begin with a critical reflection on the motivations and outcomes of your practices so far. Are they reflective of an organization that really wants to change, and is ready to support and benefit from new ways of thinking about its operations? Assessing your cur - rent status can help you find and address any barriers to building a diverse and thriving workforce. One way is to identify any patterns in terms of who has left the organi - zation over the last three years. This can uncover areas of tension, which can then be addressed to ensure a more supportive environment for new members. It can also reveal areas of improvement, where practices have paid off. Another way is to consider how diversity is extended throughout the organization's hierarchy. Are all of the women being promoted to leadership positions white, or are BIPOC women and gender-diverse employees also represented? While a workforce might collectively represent different genders, races, and abilities, diversity is much more than the percentage of an organization's employees who are not able-bodied white males. BEYOND DIVERSITY BY ASMIN CHEN, GREG LOCKWOOD, RACHAEL E. SULLIVAN, HANAE TSUKADA, AND MAI YASUE (facilitators and strategists, Equity and Inclusion Office, UBC)A welcoming and inclusive workplace requires a willing - ness to change the status quo 50 TREK / ALUMNI UBCwill be open to accommodating the differing needs of employees, in - cluding those with disabilities, cul - tural and religious practices they wish to observe, or family needs they are responsible for attending to. Full inclusion means that all employees can bring their whole selves to work, without having to take on the burden of pushing for the right to do so. The disruption to life caused by COVID-19 means many people have adjusted their personal working arrangements. In fact, we are pre - sented with a prime opportunity for a fresh look at the context of work, and how it might be improved to enhance inclusion for everyone. Turn conflict into a positive Even when an organization has worked to put in place inclusive practices, conflict will still happen and needs to be addressed. Does your organization have a process in place to engage with conflict in ways that are respectful to all concerned? Are there resources to help employees resolve differenc - es and seek support? Establishing clear, fair, and accessible methods for engaging in conflict can turn it into an opportunity for learning and growth. Treating a diverse set of insights and experiences as an asset is a foundation for organizational cohesiveness and success. More organizations are starting to reap the benefits of inclusivity, but it requires thought and effort to es - tablish. Before hiring for diversity, think about your current workplace culture; are there systems and structures in place to support all employees? If yes, your organi - zation has the ingredients to set up new employees for success. If not, go back to the drawing board, reassess what changes need to be made, and map a new path for - ward together.THE MORE AWARE AND INCLUSIVE A WORKFORCE IS, THE HIGHER ITS EXPECTATION OF LEADERSHIP TO SUPPORT, LEAD, AND BE REPRE - SENTATIVE OF THIS DIVERSITY AS WELL. Examine your hiring strategies Are your organization's recruit - ment and hiring strategies a way of \"performing\" diversity, or is there a genuine aspiration to benefit from diverse perspectives and experiences? Establishing thoughtful hiring pol - icies, and being transparent about the motivations behind them, will help organizations demonstrate their commitment to recognizing and retaining a diversity of talent. This approach is underpinned by equitable hiring practices - such as removing biased language from job descriptions, creating a rubric for assessing all the candidates according to the same criteria, and being mindful of power dynamics to ensure that the application and interview process is sensitive to the inclusion of marginal - ized groups. Clarity and transparency not only help to increase the candidate pool, but also to counter the perception that diversity is being prioritized over merit. Provide learning opportunities Another aspect to consider is how informed your workforce is on the issues and opportunities around equity, diversity and inclusion. Creating an inclusive culture de - pends on building awareness and genuine buy-in for related prac - tices. Providing all staff members with professional development opportunities in these areas encourages collective involve - ment and personal investment in building an inclusive work envi - ronment. And the more aware and inclusive a workforce is, the higher its expectation of leadership to support, lead, and be representa - tive of this diversity as well. Walk the talk How open is leadership to shifting the ways things are currently done? A truly inclusive workplace TREK / ALUMNI UBC 51 United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent Brit - ons Googling this past fall when he said \"a stitch in time saves nine\" to describe actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The phrase means it's better to spend a little time solving a little problem now to prevent spending more time on a bigger problem later. As the BBC reported, it's a sewing reference that can be traced back to 1723. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought sewing and craft and their practical uses into the news. Some sewing machine manufacturers saw a shortage as both big-box retailers and small shops experienced a pandemic sewing rush. Many sewists and crafters dusted off their sewing machines or purchased new ones to begin sewing masks, whether for personal use, for front-line workers or for sale. Some fashion designers and large brands also ramped up mask production. As a curriculum researcher and a retired home eco - nomics teacher, pandemic sewing is a chance for me to revisit the value of education in the practical arts. Sustainability closer to home \"A stitch in time saves nine\" was a favourite proverb of my grandmother, along with \"waste not, want not.\" She \"turned coats,\" painstakingly taking apart threadbare coats, so that she could turn the fabric inside out and re-stitch the coat to make it look new. As her standard of living improved, she continued to mend, repair, conserve and remake textiles. Before the mass rise of garment industries, wealthier peo - ple hired seamstresses or tailors for custom-made clothing. Households relied on making and recycling clothes, as well as buying them either new or secondhand, while relying on skills in the household or local domestic self-employment. \"Repair, reuse, make do and don't throw anything away\" was a motto in the Great Depression. The notions of \"use it up, wear it out, make do or do without\" were responses to First and Second World War textile restrictions. By the turn of the 20th century, with industrialization and globalization \"ready to wear\" garments became available. Home sewing continued, but mass-produced and industrially manufactured garments, promoted by advertising and easily available in stores and via cata - logues, gradually reduced home-sewn wear. By the end of the century, fast fashion dominated. Ten million tons of clothing waste go to landfills every year in North America, and 95 per cent of it could be re-used or recycled. We only need to consider this or see the unfair and dangerous working conditions for garment industry A STITCH IN TIME BY MARY GALE SMITH Sessional lecturer, UBC Faculty of Education ILLUSTRATION BY MARGIE AND THE MOONThe pandemic has spawned a sewing surge and a chance to rediscover the practical arts. 52 TREK / ALUMNI UBClabourers to realize our current cloth - ing consumption is not sustainable. Education theorist Madhu Suri Prakash, who writes about critical conversations related to envi - ronmental education, notes that addressing the ecological crisis is connected to our many daily deci - sions and the basic items we use. Demise of learning hands on skills Sometimes buried in the stories of pandemic sewing is a comment to the effect that at one time such handicraft was typically taught in schools in home economics classes. But in some places, home econom - ics (albeit with a variety of labels) is still taught in many schools, although it is somewhat diminished due to the general devaluation of practical education. Sometimes it's called family studies, family and consumer science, or human ecology. In the past half-century, home economics in higher education has been downsized, dismantled, and in some cases met its demise. UBC's School of Family and Consumer Science was discontin - ued at UBC, along with the home economics degree, in 1999. There are a variety of reasons behind this trend. New arenas of work opportunity and concern were available following the second wave of feminism, and in the post- war years marketers capitalized on consumerism as a new patriotic duty. Home economics had long connected local consumption and production and global ecology, but as education scholar Maresi Nerad argues, post-secondary uni - versity departments traditionally dominated by women, including home economics, \"were gradually eliminated when administrators no longer found them useful.\" The mantra \"bring back home eco - nomics education\" is sometimes seen in the popular press, following nutrition researchers Alice H. Lichtenstein and David S. Ludwig's 2010 article of the same name. Where home economics still exists, it is often at the margins. Some have argued this is because the knowledge gained is not con - sidered valid. But that premise of epistemological superiority needs to be questioned. It is in the practical arts where students learn to meet the ordinary and material demands of everyday life and to become, as the American Family and Consumer Science curriculum notes, empowered to \"solve the perennial and emerging practical problems of their families, work - places and community...\" When one has the necessary resources, time and support, there can also be emotional wellness benefits to making and doing with one's hands. Intelligent consumerism The values of earlier adages like \"a stitch in time\" were the foun - dation of home economics. Home economist Abby Marlatt, one of the presenters at the Lake Placid Conferences that were the gen - esis of home economics, argued that sewing, millinery and dress - making contributed to intelligent consumerism and social justice. Early founders of the field chose \"home economics\" from the Greek oikos meaning home or family (a word also at the root of \"ecology\"), and oikonomikos meaning man - agement of a household, frugality and thrift. Lately, home economic scholars such as Eleanore Vaines (an associate professor emeritus from UBC's now defunct School of Family and Consumer Science) have highlighted ecology as an enduring theme, explaining that the \"home\" is our Earth and \"economics\" is the judicious use of resources. The International Federation of Home Economics identifies its ultimate goal as achieving sustainable living for all. Once out of the closet, sewing and all the other practical home- based activities of pandemic times have the potential for utilitarian, psychological and environmen - tal benefits. That is why some designers, makers and consumers are imploring us not to stop sewing after the pandemic and why home economics still matters.Ten million tons of clothing waste go to landfills every year in North America, and 95 per cent of it could be re- used or recycled.

PITMAN, BASC'47 Duncan Pitman grew up in Prince George. Following his release from army duty in 1945, he returned to UBC and completed his bachelor's degree in engineering physics. After graduating, he was awarded a fel- lowship to Purdue University, where he completed his master's degree in mathematics. In 1949, he accepted a job in Southern California in the blossom - ing aerospace industry, where his Control Theory led to advancements in missile systems' guidance and control. In 1957, Duncan was selected by Douglas Aircraft to represent the company on the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, which was responsible for advising President Eisenhower on advances in aircraft and space-related technolo - gies. He was selected to give seminars on Deep Space Navigation at Cal Tech University. In 2016, at the age of 96, he passed away. He often reflected on how his contributions to cold war missile systems ultimately found purpose in launching weather and communica - tion satellites that today save lives and advance our understanding of our universe. JAM ES P. PAT TISO N , BA'49, MA'52 James Parker Pattison, proud graduate of UBC, quietly passed away on April 29, 2019, at the age of 91. Born August 25, 1927, in Richmond, BC, Jim moved to Toronto not long after his graduation to take on a position as chemist at CIL paint. This is where he met his wife of over 65 years, Marion Ruth Lindsey. Later in life, he joined the Ontario Public Service, where he moved up the ranks to become a director. The job had little to do with chemistry, but his work was always technical. For example, he redesigned the Ontario Provincial Police uniforms and assigned government buildings based on analyzing asset usage. Jim was a lifelong learner with an ever-expanding list of hobbies, including piloting planes and gliders, travelling, playing the piano, being part of a math society, and day trad - ing. He was a classic: he had a warm personality, and he was good-natured and always polite. Jim was predeceased by his daugh - ter, Marianne. He left behind his wife, Marion (who passed away soon after on September 25, 2019), his sons, Bruce (Chantale), Robert and Glenn (Gita), and his granddaughter, Taryn Pattison. ARTHUR M. PATTERSON, BASC'49 Art Patterson of Calgary passed away on December 26, 2018, at the age of 94 years. Art was devoted to his family and dearly loved his children, grandchildren and great-grandchil- dren. He loved his wife of 60 years, Margaret, more than anyone or any - thing and missed her immensely over the 10 years since her passing. Art was born in Calgary and grew up in what became known as the \"Hart House\" above Sarcee Trail. He trained as a navigator during WWII. Following the war, he graduated as a geological engineer from UBC. This led to a long and successful career as an exploration geologist in the oil business in Calgary. Art travelled thousands of miles with Margie, either on skis, on foot, in a kayak or in their motorhome. Art was a skilled woodworker and in his later years built seven beautiful grandfather clocks for Margie, their children and their grandchildren. Despite several major medical prob - lems over his 94 years, he kept his humour and optimistic attitude. Art was predeceased by his firstborn son, James Arthur, and his wife, Margaret Helen. He was also prede - ceased by his dear friend and com - panion Donna Riback. He is survived by his children: Harry (Sarah), Mary (Paj), Susan and Joan; grandchildren Luke (Chelsea), Nigel (Lynnea), Amelie (Brayden), Angela, Krista (Kam), Tessa MUNDELL, CC, BA'53, LLD'00 Professor Robert Mundell, who died on April 4 at the age of 88, was one of the preeminent economists of his era, receiving the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics. His ideas - often controversial - helped to estab - lish a European currency and to pro - mulgate the \"supply-side\" economic theories that the US implemented under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He remains an important figure for modern macroeconomics, and his influence underlies the very language of our political discourse. Mundell was born in Kingston, ON, on October 24, 1932, to William Mundell, OBE, and Lila Teresa Hamilton. After World War II, his fam - ily moved to BC, and Mundell began his studies at UBC a few years later. At the time, UBC was unusual among economics departments for teaching older economic theories that predat - ed John Maynard Keynes. Mundell attributed his unorthodox ideas in part to the classical, pre-Keynesian grounding in economic theory that he received as an undergraduate student. After UBC, Mundell studied at the University of Washington, earned his PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and became a postdoctor - al fellow at the University of Chicago, where he had fiery debates with Milton Friedman, another iconoclastic Nobel laureate. Mundell returned to UBC to teach before he moved perma - nently to Columbia University in 1974. When they awarded him the Nobel Prize in 1999, the Swedish Academy wrote that Mundell's predictions about the international economy were chosen with \"uncommon - almost prophetic - accuracy.\" He is remem - bered as a luminous, challenging, and foundational thinker. 56 TREK / ALUMNI UBCJennifer (Alex); and six great-grand - children Dr. Tim Hollick- Kenyon Sr. died peacefully on November 8, 2019.
