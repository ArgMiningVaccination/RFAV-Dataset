MacDougall, PhD, RN St. Francis Xavier University, PO Box Introduction In first immunization update in 2003,1 we briefly de- scribed the clinical and epidemiological features of vac-cine-preventable diseases and outlined the routine, pub-licly funded immunization programs in Canada. At that time, children were immunized with vaccines to prevent 9 infectious diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B). Vaccination was also recommended to prevent pneumococcal infection (7-valent pneumococ - cal conjugate), meningococcal infection (meningococcal C conjugate vaccine), pertussis in adolescents, and vari-cella, but publicly funded programs were not available in most provinces/territories. Publicly funded vaccination programs were also available for older adults to prevent influenza and pneumococcal infection (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine). In that commentary, we also dis-cussed the risk-benefit of vaccination and described the safety surveillance system in place in Canada that mon-itors the safety of our publicly funded vaccination pro-grams. In our 2009/2010 update,2 we described the seven new vaccines that had been introduced into the Canadian immunization schedule. The four vaccines that were previously recommended but not funded (varicella vac-cine, Tdap for been incorpor - ated into the publicly funded programs in all provinces/territories. Influenza vaccine was also recommended and funded for all children 6-23 months of age and for pregnant women. Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine was available as an option where its use was sup-ported by local epidemiology; three provinces had incor - porated it into their publicly funded programs. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was also recommended and funded for all pre-adolescent girls in Canada. In the 2009/2010 commentary we also described the new Can-adian Immunization Committee (CIC), its relationship to the longstanding National Advisory Committee on Im-munization (NACI), and CIC's use of the Erickson-De Wals framework 3 for assessing whether a new vaccine should be incorporated into the publicly funded vaccine programs in Canada. In this 2015 immunization update, we will review new immunization recommendations that have been intro-duced in the last 5-6 years. We will group these into new uses of \"old vaccines\" and new vaccines that have been introduced into Canada. We will also look at new vac-cines that are on the horizon in the next 5-6 years. Finally, we will review some recent changes to the immunization infrastructure in Canada, emphasizing Canadian capabil - ities for research and evaluation of existing and new vac-cination programs. Old Vaccines, New Uses A number of programmatic changes have been imple-mented by provinces/territories to vaccine programs that are already funded publicly. 4,5 Based on the proven effectiveness of a two-dose priming regimen in the first year of life with a booster in the second year, 6 pneumo- coccal conjugate vaccine is now being given at 2, 4, and 12 months of age rather than at 2, 4, 6, and 12-18 months of age in all provinces/territories except the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, thereby saving substantially on vaccine purchase and administrative costs. High-risk in-dividuals are still provided with the six-month dose. Sim-ilarly, some provinces/territories have moved to a two-dose HPV vaccination schedule based on satisfactory immunogenicity compared to the three-dose regimen. 7 An increasing number of jurisdictions have substituted the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine for the pre-ado-lescent/adolescent booster dose. 4 A single dose of Tdap vaccine is now recommended and publicly funded for all adults not previously immunized with Tdap. 5 The annual influenza vaccine is now recommended more broadly; NACI now recommends universal influenza vaccination for the entire population, and many provinces/territories have joined Ontario in implementing this recommenda - tion. 4 Because of ongoing outbreaks of varicella,8 near - ly all provinces/territories have moved to a two-dose varicella vaccine schedule. 4 Finally, in keeping with the NACI recommendation for a universal HPV vaccination program for pre-adolescents using a quadrivalent HPV vaccine, Alberta, PEI, and Nova Scotia have extended their programs to include pre-adolescent boys. 4 New Vaccines, New RecommendationsNew vaccines that have entered the Canadian market and are recommended by NACI since the last immunization update include rotavirus vaccine, a combination MMRV vaccine, 13-valent and adjuvanted and high-dose influenza vaccines. NACI and CIC recommend universal infant immunization against rotavirus, the major cause of hos-pitalization for diarrhea and dehydration among Canadian infants. 9 Two vaccines are available in Canada for pre- vention of severe disease caused by rotavirus: RotaTeq\u00ae (Merck Canada Inc.) and Rotarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Inc.). Both vaccines are live virus oral vaccines given at 2 and 4 months (Rotarix \u00ae) or 2, 4, and 6 months (Ro- taTeq\u00ae). Both have been demonstrated to be highly effi- cacious against severe diarrhea causing hospitalization in studies done in low and middle income countries which have substantial morbidity and mortality related to rota-virus infection. 10,11 While deaths caused by rotavirus infection are uncommon in Canada, rotavirus gastro-enteritis severe enough to require hospitalization is not. Rotavirus vaccine has been shown to be cost effective in the Canadian context 12 and effective when implemented in universal vaccination programs.13 Presently, universal rotavirus vaccination is provided in all provinces/territor - ies except Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. A combination MMRV vaccine is now available in Can- ada which facilitates the implementation of the two-dose varicella recommendation discussed previously. MMRV is associated with higher rates of fever and subsequent febrile seizures when used at 12-18 months of age than MMR and varicella vaccine given separately; 14 therefore, individual risk factors and preferences can be considered when deciding whether or not to use the combination vac-cine product or the MMR and varicella vaccine given as separate injections. 15 All Canadia n provinces and territories are now using the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for im-munization of infants in the first year of life with a booster dose at 12 months of age. 4 The 13-valent vaccine contains all of the pneumococcal serotypes in the 7-valent vaccine with the addition of serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. This is particularly important given several outbreaks of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by serotype 5 in Canada and the frequency of penicillin resistance in sero-type 19A. 16,17 A meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB) is now avail - able in Canada for use in infants, children, and adoles-cents. Based on cost-effectiveness data, the vaccine has not been recommended for universal use but rather dur -ing outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease. The vaccine has been used for universal immunization in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec which was experiencing high rates of invasive meningococcal B dis-ease and at Acadia University in Nova Scotia to control a meningococcal B outbreak. Since the last immunization update, there have also been several advances in the immunization of adults. In addition to the universal recommendation for Tdap in adults discussed previously, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been demonstrated to be effective in the prevention of community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae in adults 50 years of age and older. 18 As a result, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is now rec-ommended in some provinces/territories for the immun-ization of adults with immunocompromising conditions; 5 no recommendation has been made yet for universal im-munization of adults with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. With increasing age, as a result of immunose - nescence, antibody response to the seasonal influenza vaccine diminishes. Indeed, immunogenicity is severely compromised in those older than 85 years of age. 19 New influenza vaccines with greater immunogenicity and ef-ficacy in the elderly are now available in Canada; 20 one vaccine uses an adjuvant to boost immunogenicity while the other uses higher antigen content. In some provinces, these vaccines are being used selectively for older adults who are at the highest risk of influenza mortality. 21 Final- ly, zoster vaccine is now recommended by NACI for all adults 60 years of age or older. 22 The incidence of zos- ter increases substantially with age, again as a result of increasing immunosenescence. Zoster vaccine has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the incidence of zoster and its most debilitating complication, postherpetic neuralgia. 23 Although recommended by NACI, no prov- ince/territory has included zoster vaccine in its publicly funded immunization program yet. While some private insurance companies cover the cost of zoster vaccine, many Canadians must purchase the vaccine themselves in order to protect themselves. The lack of uniform access to these recommended but unfunded vaccines across the country is problematic. 24 The Vaccine Pipeline: What Does the Future Hold?Although predicting the future is always fraught with un-certainty, there may be a number of new vaccines and new J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 9DM MacDougall, SA Halperin recommendations in the next 5-6 years. Although there is currently a permissive NACI recommendation to ad-minister Tdap during pregnancy in periods of increased pertussis activity, routine administration of Tdap during pregnancy may need to be considered. 25 Currently, the US and the UK recommend that Tdap be given to all preg-nant women to prevent pertussis in the first months of life, 26,27 and the UK has reported on the effectiveness of the policy.28 Other vaccines that are under development to be part of a maternal immunization strategy to protect the newborn and young infant include vaccines against group B streptococcus, 29 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),30 and cytomegalovirus (CMV).31 All of these pathogens adversely affect the fetus or newborn, and immunization during pregnancy may provide benefit to the woman, the fetus, and the newborn, similar to what is achieved through maternal immunization with influenza vaccine. 32 A vaccine to prevent diarrhea and dehydration from noro-virus infection is also in clinical trials 33 and could provide an additional benefit to that achieved by rotavirus vaccine in the prevention of severe gastroenteritis. A new zoster vaccine with higher reported efficacy and duration of pro-tection is undergoing clinical trials. 34 Finally, although not of direct benefit to Canadians but with substantial \"Canadian content,\" a vaccine to prevent Ebola virus may be available within the next few years to prevent future devastating outbreaks of this deadly virus. A vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored Ebola virus vaccine was developed at the Canadian National Microbiology Lab-oratory, 35 underwent phase 1 clinical trials in Canada and elsewhere,36,37 and looks promising in phase 3 studies in West Africa.38 Changes to the Canadian Immunization Research InfrastructureIn the last six years, there has been a concerted effort by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to coordin-ate and fund evaluative research to support public health decision making. 39 This effort was catalyzed by pandemic influenza planning, when PHAC and the Canadian Insti- Figure 1. Subnetworks that comprise the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN).10 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Commentary tutes of (CIHR) funded the PHAC/CIHR Influenza Research Network (PCIRN) in 2009. Although initially intended to be part of the pandemic planning ex-ercise, PCIRN was created and funded just after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was declared. Over six years, PCIRN undertook a broad range of research of high public health priority, addressing issues such as rapid clinical trials to inform vaccine utilization and issues related to vaccine coverage, effectiveness, safety, and delivery in the face of outbreaks. PCIRN was created as a network of net-works, linking academic-institution-based and public-health-based investigators across Canada and ensuring that multidirectional communication between decision makers, front-line public health staff, and researchers was established and maintained so that research findings could be translated into practice rapidly. The PCIRN model was felt to be sufficiently successful in meeting public health goals that, in 2015, PCIRN was transitioned to a new network named the Canadian Immunization Network (CIRN) which would have as its mandate all vaccine re-search of public health importance, not just research re-lated to influenza. CIRN is also designed as a network of networks (Figure 1) and includes a Clinical Trials Net-work, an ambulatory Canadian National Vaccine Safety Network, the Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network (SOS) which is an adult inpatient, hospital-based net-work, the Provincial Collaborative Network which brings together research expertise located in provincial public health agencies and Departments of Health, a Research Laboratory Network, a Social Sciences and Humanities Network, a Special Immunization Clinics Network for evaluation of serious adverse events following immuniz - ation, and the Modeling and Economic Research Network (ModERN). These networks will increasingly be used to provide the data needed for program implementation de-cisions and for evaluating the effectiveness of Canada's immunization programs. Conclusion Given the nature of infectious diseases, what we describe in this update can only be viewed as a snapshot in time in an ever-changing environment. Canada's immunization programs continue to evolve in response to the changing epidemiology of infectious diseases and the availability of new vaccines. Decisions to implement new programs and evaluations of existing and new programs are increas-ingly becoming evidence-based. In an era of competing demands for shrinking health care funding, vaccines con-tinue to be one of the most cost-effective health interven - tions and compare favorably with any other preventive or therapeutic intervention.

Methods: A secondary data analysis of a 2015 survey of chiropractors from Ontario, Canada was performed. The questionnaire included 14 items concerning chiropractors' knowledge and attitudes toward drug prescription including demographics. Results: 960 of 2,677 deliverable questionnair es were completed (36% response rate). The majority of respondents favoured limited prescribing rights for chiropractors regardless of college of graduation. Respondents who graduated from Canadian institutions were significantly more in favour of these privileges compared to graduates from non-Canadian schools. Over three-quarters of all respondents opposed the idea of chiropractors having full prescribing rights. No significant association was found between respondents' philosophical orientation and school attended.

Plus de 60(1)Relationship between Ontario chiropractors' attitudes toward drug prescription rights and Canadian versus non-Canadian Introduction The right to prescribe drugs continues to be a contentious issue for the chiropractic profession. 1-3 Regardless, recent reports indicate that a growing number of chiropractors in various jurisdictions may be interested in expanding their scopes of practice to include limited drug prescrip-tion for treating spine-related and other musculoskeletal conditions. 4-8 Limited prescribing rights have already been incorporated into the chiropractic scopes of practice in Switzerland 9 and New Mexico, USA10. Swiss chiro- practors indicate that these privileges are an advantage for the profession in Switzerland; 9,11 and they are also one of only two groups of medical professionals (including phy-sicians) with primary care status for managing patients with musculoskeletal disorders in that country 12. Some research suggests that the ongoing contention over prescribing rights in chiropractic may be related to philosophical divisions within the profession. 8,13 For ex- ample, in a recent survey of chiropractors from Ontario, Canada 8 over 90% of respondents who aligned themselves with a \"broad\" (or the often described 'mixer') scope of chiropractic practice favoured the idea of gaining limited prescriptive authority for prescribing over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription-based musculoskeletal medica - tions. Conversely very few of those who classified them - selves as practising within a \"focused\" (or the often de-scribed 'straight') scope of chiropractic practice felt the same. Interestingly, the majority (approximately 60%) of \"middle scope\" respondents in this study also favoured musculoskeletal prescribing rights, indicating that there is potential for unity among the majority of chiropractors regarding limited drug prescription for the profession. Similar results regarding the association between philo-sophical ideologies and prescribing rights in chiropractic have also been shown by others. 13 There is further evidence to suggest that dif ferences in philosophical orientation among doctors of chiro-practic may be reflective of graduation from particular chiropractic teaching institutions. 14-16 For instance, in the United States (US) there are currently 15 chiropractic colleges that span the chiropractic ideological spectrum, from \"conservative\" (i.e. 'straight' colleges that believe in continuing the traditions of chiropractic as espoused by either D.D. or B.J. Palmer) to \"liberal\" (i.e. colleges that promote an evidence-based approach to the practice of chiropractic, focusing on the treatment of spine-relat - ed/musculoskeletal disorders). 17,18 In Canada there are only two chiropractic educational institutions, the Can-adian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) and the Universit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e9res (UQTR), both of which fall on the liberal/evidence-based end of the chiropractic spectrum. 19,20 In 2010, Puhl and colleagues16 surveyed chiropractors across Canada and found that re-spondents who aligned themselves with an \"unorthodox\" (or 'straight') style of chiropractic were most likely to have graduated from one of the conservative chiropractic schools in the US. Chiropractors in this group were also more likely to exhibit professional attitudes and practice behaviours concerning treatment efficacy, use of radio-graphic imaging, and views toward vaccination, that were incongruent with current evidence-based practice. 15,16 Several clinical guidelines endorse the use of mild anal - Conclusion: Ontario chir opractors who graduated from Canadian chiropractic institutions were most interested in obtaining limited drug prescription rights for the profession compared to non-Canadian chiropractic institution graduates.

The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference between attitudes toward drug prescription rights among a sample of chiropractors from Ontario, Canada 8 based on chiropractic college of graduation. The relationship between educational programs and re-spondents' philosophical orientation / preferred style of practice was also explored. Methods The methods of this study have been described in detail elsewhere. 8 Briefly, a 14-item online questionnaire was developed by the authors based on previous research on this topic and pilot tested on a random sample of 20 chiro-practors registered with the Waterloo Regional Chiro-practic Society. Twelve respondents completed the pilot testing, agreed on the face validity of the instrument, and provided feedback that led to revisions and creation of the final study instrument. All active members of the College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO) who had a valid e-mail address listed in the CCO's electronic directory (n = 2,847) were invited to complete the questionnaire. Retired or inactive chiro-practors and/or those who did not have an e-mail address listed on the CCO's electronic directory were ineligible to participate in the study. Potential participants were contacted up to six times over six weeks including a pre-notification message, fol-lowed weekly for five weeks by a message including a cover letter and link to the survey instrument. The sur - vey was distributed and administered online from Febru-ary 2, 2015 to February 27, 2015 using SurveyMonkey \u00ae. Ethics approval for this study was obtained through the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic Research Ethics Sub-Committee (approval number E67/05/15). All data was collected anonymously and stored securely in a pass-word protected electronic database. The questionnaire was divided into four sections: Sec- tion 1 consisted of four questions asking about chiro-practors' attitudes to drug prescription rights, Section 2 had two questions about OTC drug recommendations in chiropractic practice, Section 3 contained three questions about chiropractors' knowledge of drug prescription, while Section 4 asked demographic questions including chiropractic educational institution of graduation and chiropractic philosophical orientation / preferred scope of practice. Summary responses to all questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and presented previously.8 In the current analysis inferential statistics were used to in-vestigate differences between chiropractors who graduat - ed from different chiropractic educational institutions in terms of their attitudes toward drug prescription rights. Differences between respondents' philosophical orienta - tion and educational institution of graduation were also explored. Chiropractic institutions were divided into two categories: (i) 'Canadian' (graduates from the CMCC and the UQTR) and (ii) 'non-Canadian' (including graduates from programs within and outside the USA). It was hy-pothesized that graduates from non-Canadian chiroprac - tic educational programs would hold more negative views toward drug prescription rights and be more frequently as-sociated with a focused (or 'straight') chiropractic scope of practice compared to those who graduated from Can-adian chiropractic educational institutions. Relationships between the educational program grouping variable and the various attitudinal response variables from Section 1 of the questionnaire including the scope of practice vari-able from Section 4 were explored using the chi-square test of independence. 24 Logistic regression was not per - formed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, and all data analysis was carried out using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics \u00a9, Version 20). Results Deliverable questionnaires were sent to 2,677 chiroprac-tors in Ontario and 960 were completed for a 35.9% re-sponse rate. The mean age of the respondents was 44.1 (SD [standard deviation] 10.5) years, 70.4% were male, and the average time in practice for all respondents was 16.6 (SD 10.6) years. With respect to chiropractic col-lege of graduation, nearly three-quarters (72.7%) of re-spondents just over one-quarter (25.7%) graduated from US colleges, and the remaining 1.6% (15/952) of respondents graduated from chiropractic schools outside North Amer - ica. A demographic comparison between the study sample 16 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Relationship between Ontario chiropractors' attitudes toward drug prescription rights and Canadian versus non-Canadian and the general population of Ontario chiropractors has been previously presented by the authors.8 Comparisons between Ontario chiropractors' attitudes to drug prescription rights and chiropractic college of graduation are displayed in Table 1. The majority of re-spondents were in favour of incorporating limited drug prescription rights into their scope of practice regardless of their college of graduation. However, a statistically sig-nificant greater proportion of respondents who graduated from the two Canadian chiropractic schools agreed that Ontario chiropractors should be able to prescribe OTC and prescription-based medications for musculoskeletal conditions (i.e. 68.3% for OTC medications and 64.3% for prescription-based medications) compared to those who graduated from schools within and outside the USA (i.e. 56.5% and 54.7% respectively). Respondents from the Canadian colleges also agreed significantly more so than those from the non-Canadian college graduates (71.7% versus 59.1%) with the idea that chiropractors with limited prescriptive authority could counsel patients on medication use for musculoskeletal conditions. With respect to the issue of full prescribing rights, no statis-tically significant difference in opinion was found be-tween chiropractors who graduated from different chiro-practic colleges. Comparisons between Ontario chiropractors' philo- sophical orientation / preferred scope of practice and edu-cational institution of graduation are displayed in Table 2. Table 1.

Discussion This study found that Ontario chiropractors who re-sponded to this survey and graduated from a Canadian chiropractic institution were significantly more in favour of incorporating limited drug prescription rights into their scope of practice compared to respondents who graduat - ed from US colleges including schools outside the USA. Two-thirds of Canadian institution graduates agreed that chiropractors should be permitted to prescribe OTC and prescription-based anti-inflammatories, analgesics, and muscle relaxants, whereas just over half (approximately 56%) of graduates from schools outside of Canada felt the same way. Nearly three-quarters of respondents from the Canadian schools also felt that with limited prescriptive authority chiropractors could help counsel patients against overuse and over-reliance on musculoskeletal medica - tions while less than 60% from non-Canadian chiroprac - tic colleges similarly agreed. This difference in opinion between the two groups (Canadian graduates versus non-Canadian) is comparable to the findings of previous surveys of Canadian chiropractors 14-16 in which various professional attitudes and practice characteristics differed between respondents matriculating from US chiropractic schools compared to graduates of the CMCC. Chiroprac - tors who graduated from institutions outside of Canada in the present study may have been less favourable to-wards drug prescription than Canadian institution gradu-ates partly because of the longstanding history of division over chiropractic prescribing rights among the profession in the USA. 1 The difference between these two groups could be a reflection of CMCC's curriculum which is evidence-based 19 and includes a greater number of hours in pharmacology education25 compared to that typically required of other chiropractic institutions26. Regardless, results from previous surveys14-16 together with the find- ings of the current study reiterate that the chiropractic educational system may be contributing to multiple iden-tities among chiropractors within the profession 16. Unlike the methodology used by Puhl and colleagues15,16 how- ever, the current study did not differentiate between in-dividual US colleges. It is unclear whether respondents who held more negative views toward prescribing rights graduated from so-called \"conservative\" 17 (versus \"liber - al\") programs in the US. In spite of this, the majority of respondents from both the Canadian and non-Canadian educated groups still favoured the idea of limited pre-scribing rights for chiropractors regardless of their col-lege of graduation. Concerning the issue of limited chiropractic prescrib- ing rights, there is evidence from several surveys includ - ing that in the present study to indicate that there may be a growing interest among Canadian chiropractors to-wards gaining limited drug prescription privileges for the profession. For instance, in surveys involving Canadian chiropractors from 2004 13, 20076, 20116, and 20158, in- creasing majorities of respondents (i.e. 54%, 55%, 61%, and 68% respectively) indicated at least some level of support for chiropractic prescribing rights for OTC and/or prescription-based musculoskeletal medications. An even greater majority among Ontario chiropractors graduating from Canadian chiropractic institutions favouring these privileges in the current study suggests that chiropractors may not be as divided on this topic in Canada as previous-ly thought. 1-3 Arguably a nationwide survey of chiroprac - tors from all Canadian provinces is warranted in order to confirm these findings. If obtained by the profession limited drug prescrip- tion rights would have the potential to change the present role of chiropractors and to positively influence public health. For instance, with a limited formulary chiroprac - tors would gain access to an additional evidence-based modality for managing patients with spine-related and other musculoskeletal complaints. 21-23 These privileges would also give chiropractors the authority to counsel pa-tients against overusing anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications (e.g. opioids). This notion is supported by evidence from Switzerland where chiropractors tend to prescribe medications significantly less frequently than asked for by their patients. 11 In the present study the ma- jority of respondents, including almost three-quarters of graduates from the two Canadian chiropractic institutions, expressed interest in limited prescription rights because of this potential role for the profession. Musculoskel-etal prescribing rights could also help pave the way for 18 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Relationship between Ontario chiropractors' attitudes toward drug prescription rights and Canadian versus non-Canadian chiropractors to become 'first-contact' (or primary) spine care providers within the healthcare system;7,27,28 however other implications would first need to be considered29 in- cluding changes to chiropractic education and legislation. Another finding of the present study was that a large majority of respondents, regardless of college affiliation, were opposed to the idea of chiropractors having full pre-scribing rights. For instance, more than three-quarters of Canadian and non-Canadian chiropractic institution graduates disagreed with chiropractors being able to gain an expanded scope of practice to allow for the prescription of any and all medications, including controlled substan-ces. This finding is consistent with previous chiropractic surveys 8,13,30,31 where respondents were generally opposed to chiropractors writing drug prescriptions for non-mus-culoskeletal conditions. Although Canadian chiropractic institution graduates in the current study were less frequently associated with a focused (or 'straight') chiropractic scope of practice com-pared to those graduating from schools within and outside the USA, this difference was not statistically significant. Over 12% of Canadian (most of which were CMCC) graduates identified themselves as 'straight' chiroprac - tors while less than 17% of those who graduated from non-Canadian (mostly American) chiropractic institu - tions did the same. These results are inconsistent with the findings of previous studies 14,16 where significant associ- ations were found between chiropractors' philosophical orientation and affiliation with non-CMCC / \"conserva-tive\" chiropractic colleges in the US. A possible explana - tion for this difference is that no differentiation was made in the present study between \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" US chiropractic colleges among the non-Canadian gradu-ates. It is possible that a significant association may have been found regarding ideology and academic affiliation among these respondents had these two sub-groupings of US chiropractic colleges been investigated. Regardless, this study's findings indicate that despite matriculating from an evidence-based curriculum 19 more than one out of every 10 graduates from the CMCC currently practising in Ontario align themselves with a focused (or 'straight') style of chiropractic. It is plausible that clinicians' philo-sophical views may be preconceived prior to entering chiropractic college (and never change) or are influenced sometime after graduation. Whatever the reason(s), this ideology continues to create negative physician attitudes toward the profession as well as barriers to medical-chiro - practic collaboration both locally and internationally. 32-34 LimitationsThe main limitations of this study were that it had a rela - tively low response rate (36%) and it excluded retired chiropractors and those who did not have an e-mail ad-dress listed with the CCO. When comparing demographic characteristics however, the study sample was shown to be representative of the general population of practising chiropractors in Ontario. 8 Nevertheless, a 64% non-re- sponse rate suggests that these survey results should be interpreted with caution as respondents' views toward drug prescription rights obtained may not be generaliz - able to those of all Ontario chiropractors. Conclusion This study found that Ontario chiropractors who graduat-ed from Canadian chiropractic educational institutions fa-voured the idea of gaining limited prescribing rights more so than chiropractors who graduated from schools within and outside the USA. Over three-quarters of respondents were opposed to chiropractors having full prescribing rights regardless of college affiliation. No statistically significant differences were found between respondents' philosophical orientation and educational institution of graduation. A nationwide survey is warranted to further explore Canadian chiropractors' attitudes toward gaining limited drug prescription rights for the profession. References: 1. Emary PC, Stuber KJ.

They are well known for their diverse anatomic locations and can occur anywhere from the brain to the gonads, however they occur most commonly along the midline (mid-axial). 1 In children, as in our case presentation, these tumors are often extra-ovarian, in contrast to an ovarian predilection in adults. 2 Mature teratomas are the commonest germ cell tumor, and are often incidental find-ings. 5 Incidental discovery on radiographic evaluation for routine chiropractic investigations would therefore not be considered an isolated or rare event, although their inci - dence appears to be underreported in the literature. The purpose of this report is to describe the imaging character - istics of an incidental sacrococcygeal teratoma found on routine surveillance scoliosis radiographs and to review appropriate diagnostic evaluations and management. Methods & Results A literature search was performed using PubMed with the search terms, \"teratoma\" AND \"case report\" AND \"radiograph\" as dermoid\" AND \"incidental\" AND \"case report\". No similar case reports were found. Images were obtained from the institutional picturing archiving and communication system (PACS). The patient's electronic medical record was reviewed for details on patient demographics, clinical history, opera-tive report and pathology results. Case Presentation Routine spine radiographs were obtained on a 12-year-old, otherwise healthy, asymptomatic girl for follow-up of scoliosis. Incidental note was made of a large, well-de - fined, heterogeneous mass within the pelvis containing calcified and likely ossified densities (Figures 1A, 1B). Radiographs from one-year prior did not include the pel-vis so chronicity could not be determined. Given the un-clear etiology of this density and suspicion for an under - lying mass, further evaluation was performed. An unenhanced MR of the pelvis was obtained, using axial and coronal T1 spin echo, and axial and fast spin echo sequences (Figures 2A, 2B). MRI demonstrated a large (11.0 x 12.1 x 14.6 cm), com-plex, pre-sacral mass, which contained fat, calcium, and J Can Assoc 2016; 60(1) 23KM Cunningham, GB 2: A. Axial T1 Spin Echo, B.

These findings were felt to be most consistent with a non-ovarian, mature pre-sacral teratoma. Gyneco-logic consultation was recommended for clinical evalua - tion and management. Further evaluation with CT was performed to better characterize the calcifications and for pre-operative plan-ning. CT confirmed the presence of a large heterogeneous mass with macroscopic fat (asterisk), calcific foci and a central, ossified bony component (arrowhead) (Figure 3). A reasonable adjunct in work-up could include pelvic ultrasound, although this was not performed in this par - ticular case. The patient was taken to surgery and the mass was ex- cised. There was no involvement of the bony sacrum or soft tissue extension beyond the pelvic cavity. The mass contained a central bony core which had to be divided and removed in piecemeal. Both ovaries were visualized and deemed to be preserved and uninvolved. Pathologic assessment of fresh gross surgical specimen revealed a large fragmented mass, composed primarily of fibroadipose tissue and bone. Hemorrhagic compon-ents and hair were visualized within the specimen. The mass had a maximal dimension of 20cm, with the bony fragment measuring 7.5cm in length. The final diagnosis was a mature sacrococcygeal teratoma with degenerative changes. Discussion Incidentally discovered teratomas in various clinical set-tings have been described 3, however no cases have been described related to incidental discovery on routine scoli-osis radiographs. Given the gravity of potential compli - cations, such as bowel obstruction, ovarian torsion, hem-orrhage and rupture, and consequently, peritonitis, it is important for the chiropractic community to familiarize themselves with the typical radiographic appearance and epidemiology of mature pelvic teratomas. Figure 3: Sagittal unenhanced CT image of the pelvis the presacral mass (arrows) containing fat (asterisk), calcification (arrowhead) and soft tissue. The calcified components show hyperdense attenuation on CT image. In a lar ge study of childhood teratomas conducted at an exclusively pediatric medical centre, Bale et al. de-scribe and classify 107 teratomas over a 40-year period. 2 There was a significant female predilection (63%) which is consistent with the general literature. Sacrococcygeal teratomas accounted for 48% of cases. 2 They further sub- divided the sacrococcygeal masses into posterior (with no intra-pelvic component), pelvic and dumbbell (tumor straddles pelvic and posterior compartments). The ma-jority (67%) were situated posteriorly. The diagnosis of the pelvic subtype is usually delayed (diagnosed after 2 years of age). 2,4 Using Bale's criteria our case would be further characterized as a pelvic (or pre-sacral) teratoma as there was no extra-pelvic extension. Teratomas can be benign (mature) or malignant. The malignant potential (roughly 20% of lesions) increases with the internaliza - tion of tumor such that the risk of malignancy is greater in the pelvic subtype. 2,4 Malignant tumors were almost J Can 60(1) 25KM Cunningham, GB Chavhan, KE Ainsworth, et al exclusively carcinomatous. Conversely, the incidence of malignancy fell with posterior/external location. Benign teratomas are predominantly cystic, and contain mature tissue including fat, calcification and a small volume of solid soft tissue. 4 The larger the volume of solid, immature elements increases the risk of malignant potential4 and the size of immature teratomas was larger than that of mature teratomas 5. Histologic maturity did not vary by age of the patient.5 T apper and Lack further described 254 benign ter - atomas assessed at a pediatric medical centre over a 54-year period. 1 Similarly, most were detected in the new- born period, had a strong female predilection (84%) and the majority were sacrococcygeal in location (40%). T eratomas are commonly found within the pelvis and typically contain a variety of tissues such as hair, calcium and fat. Their classic radiographic appearance is that of a pelvic mass containing tissue of fatty density, often with calcification (and/or ossification), though it can be quite variable. 7 CT often confirms the presence of cystic, fatty and bony components. MR will again demonstrate fat signal within the lesion and drop out on fat saturation sequences. Cystic components will frequently contain a fluid-fluid level, specifically fat-fluid, primarily from li-quid sebum. 7 While the differential of a fat and calcium containing pelvic mass is quite limited, one could consid-er the possibility of malignant degeneration of a teratoma, or an atypical liposarcoma. However, given the classic imaging features in our case, the radiologic diagnosis was most consistent with that of a mature cystic teratoma. The size of the mass in our case presentation (20 cm) may have been underestimated by imaging which was reported as 14.6 cm in maximal dimension. Unfortu-nately, the true size of the mass may have been difficult to confirm as it had to be removed in piecemeal during the surgery. The gross specimen size was larger than meas-urements reported in the literature 1, which describe an average diameter of 7.5 cm in mature teratomas of the sacrococcygeal region. Our report describes a large, mature pelvic-subtype sacrococcygeal teratoma which was found incidentally in an asymptomatic 12-year-old girl. The epidemiologic fea-tures are considered classic, with patient age and tumor size at presentation both being greater than that of the general literature. Significant risks associated with pelvic teratomas in-clude ovarian torsion, spontaneous rupture, hemorrhage, bowel obstruction, infertility, pregnancy complications, and malignant transformation. 5 Although the malignant potential is low, given this, as well as the other serious po-tential complications, and to prevent local recurrence, de-finitive and complete surgical excision of the lesion using minimally invasive and fertility-preserving techniques, remains best practice at all ages. 1,5,6 For this reason, fur - ther evaluation with CT or MRI and referral to a gyne-cologist or general surgeon for definitive management is indicated once the diagnosis of teratoma is suspected. Conclusion Mature, cystic teratomas are the most common type of germ cell tumor. Location depends on age, occurring primarily in the sacrococcygeal region in children and in the ovary in adolescents and young women. While they are typically benign they do demonstrate a small malig-nant potential and can cause severe complications such as bowel obstruction, ovarian torsion and peritonitis. Identification and intervention is therefore important for optimal management. Given their location, young age at presentation, as well as their indolent and often asymp-tomatic course, this presents a unique opportunity for the chiropractic community to recognize these lesions during routine skeletal evaluations such as scoliosis radiographs.

We surveyed senior students and DC employees at one chiropractic college regarding 1) which analysis tools should be used and 2) factors that influence their choices. Methods: The survey queried which tools should be used on a routine patient encounter. Clinical evaluation tools included palpation, skin temperature analysis, leg length analysis, and radiographs. Results: Surveys were collected from 58 doctors of chiropractic (DCs) and 74 students. Respondents from both groups reported to most commonly use static palpation, followed by motion palpation and leg length analysis. DC respondents ranked evidence and personal experience high for rationale; student respondents frequently chose patient preference. Introduction : La fiabilit\u00e9 et la validit\u00e9 de nombr eux outils d'\u00e9valuation menant l'analyse \u00e9tudiants ont r\u00e9pondu chiropractic (DCs) use information from mul-tiple sources to render clinical decisions regarding where, when, and how to perform spinal manipulative proced-ures. 1,2 Information is obtained from static and motion palpatory findings, skin temperature analysis, postural and leg length analysis, radiographic assessment, symp-toms, the primary diagnosis of the condition being treat - ed, and other physical examination findings. 3 Additional information derived from the patient interview includes prior response(s) to care, patient preferences, co-morbid conditions, and goals. Incorporating multi-faceted infor - mation into clinical decision-making is therefore, a com-plex process. 4,5 Evidence-based practice suggests skillfully incorpor - ating research evidence, patient values, and practitioner experience when determining which clinical evaluation tools to use and how to appropriately weigh the clinical information gleaned from them when rendering clinical decisions. 6 However, the reliability and validity of many evaluation tools leading to clinical decision-making for spinal manipulation (SM) have not been robustly estab-lished, 7-17 leaving evidence-based practitioners to depend more on clinical experience, patient values, and other aspects of the clinical presentation. Despite limited reli-ability and the lack of research studying the validity of some analysis procedures, patients with a range of mus-culoskeletal conditions often improve following SM per - formed by doctors of chiropractic using a variety of an-alysis tools and technique methods. 18 Evaluation tools are learned in educational settings, where students are chal - lenged to develop appropriate patient assessment habits and decision-making skills. The purpose of this study is to survey chiropractic stu- dents and DC employees at a United States chiropractic college regarding 1) which clinical analysis tools should be used during routine patient encounters when evaluat - ing patients for SM, and 2) what factors most influence respondent choices. Methods The Human Protections Administrator determined this study exempt from full IRB review, IRB Assurance # X2013-7-12-M. The study was conducted in 2013. Participants The survey was administered both to chiropractic stu-dents in the ninth term (final year) and all DC employees (faculty, staff and administrators) at the Davenport cam - pus of Palmer College of Chiropractic. Respondents were not compensated in any way for participating. Students in ninth term were surveyed as a convenience sample of interns who had previously completed course- work covering spinal analysis protocols, taught in 2nd Conclusion: DC and student r espondents reported use of clinical evaluation tools consistently. However, some variations in rationale were noted. It is important for educators to provide a balanced presentation of the strengths and limitations of clinical analysis procedures to support the development of well-justified evidence-based clinical decision-making skills.

On how many encounters should this procedure be performed? Which best describe your rationale for employees (93 faculty , staff, and administrators) were sent a paper survey (11\" x 17\") via campus mail in a hand-addressed envelope one month following the student survey in 2013, which included a signed descrip-tive cover letter from the principal investigator and an informed consent disclaimer. Respondents were asked to return the completed survey (re-folded as an anonymous self-mailer) to the principal investigator (BM), thus main - taining confidentiality and blinding investigators. All DC employees received follow-up e-mail reminders during three consecutive weeks including a reminder that they could request an electronic copy for anonymous submis-sion directly to the data manager. Survey Instrument This survey queried respondents on which clinical evalu - ation tools (including palpation, paraspinal skin temper - ature measurement, leg length inequality, and/or radio-graphic analysis) should be used during patient encounters when evaluating a patient prior to delivering chiropractic SM. The survey instrument was designed in consultation with chiropractic college faculty with expertise in teach - ing SM techniques. Clinical evaluation tools queried are taught in the core curriculum. Response choices includ-ed \"all,\" \"most,\" \"some,\" or \"no\" patient encounters and were not further defined. Respondents were asked to rate which of the following reasons best describes the ration - ale for the Figure 1. Data Analysis and confidentiality The Data Manager collected and secured hardcopy data collection forms. The Data Manager prepared form keys and data entry formats with validation schemes. Data entry clerks entered and verified data through a Win-dows-based application for double key-entry verification. Data entry formats and electronic data files in a secured server environment. Hardcopy data form packets were stored in a locked cabinet during key-entry process. Final project datasets were assembled by transferring data from flat data entry files to SAS System for Windows (Release 9.2). The Data Manager wrote and tested SAS programs to create datasets as requested by the Principal Investiga - tor. The analyzable dataset was imported into SPSS (Ver -sion 17.0.0, SPSS, Inc. Somers, NY). Survey results are reported with descriptive statistics. ResultsResponse rate Surveys were completed for 74 of 111 students for a re-sponse rate of 67%. All students anticipated graduating by the end of the following (10 th) term. Fifty-eight of 93 DC employees returned surveys for a response rate of 61%, representing 10 department affiliations; 55(95%) held a current license to practice chiropractic, and 29(50%) re-ported actively rendering care to patients. See Table 1. Chiropractic analysis tools favored by ninth term student respondents Eighty-three percent reported that static palpation should be performed on all routine patient encounters. Prone leg length inequality (LLI) assessment ranked next, ranging from 38-55% depending upon type and variation of leg length analysis. Supine LLI assessment faired much low-er at 20%. Nearly 55% of respondents rated motion pal-pation should be performed on all patient encounters for supine cervical assessment while only 27% for seated pa-tient positioning. While 28% of respondents reported that radiographic assessment for general biomechanical align - ment and patterns should be used on all routine encounters; approximately 15% responded that radiographic vertebral segment analysis should be used on all encounters. Only 16% reported that a paraspinal dual temperature analysis should be used on all routine encounters, while 5-10% reported Tytron\u00ae infrared thermography (for paraspinal skin temperature readings, as a skin temperature pattern assessment, or for bilateral mastoid fossa temperature measurements) should be used on all encounters. T wenty-two and 45% of respondents reported bio- mechanical segmental analysis of radiographs should be used on most and some patient encounters, respectively; the range of those reporting that radiographic assess-ment should be used as a visual aid to further inform the practitioner about abnormal curvatures or degenerative changes on most/some patient encounters was 33/38%. Between 10 and 31% responded that prone LLI should be used on some/most encounters. Supine LLI was rated for use on most encounters by 10%, on some encounters by 32 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Clinical evaluation tools: a survey of doctors of chiropractic and students at one chiropractic college 50%. While 28-45% of student respondents reported vari- ous forms of paraspinal thermographic instrumentation should be performed on some patient encounters, only 3-6% reported some form of this measure should be used on most routine encounters. Fifty percent of student respondents reported that Ty- tron\u00ae infrared thermography should never be used dur - ing patient encounters, and 37% reported that galvanic/dual probe should never be used. Less than 10% reported prone LLI should never be used while 36% reported su-pine LLI should never be used. Eighteen percent con-veyed that segmental radiographic analysis should never be used. Zero percent of student respondents reported that static palpation should never be used. Chiropractic analysis tools used by DC employee respondentsEighty five percent of DC employee respondents reported that static palpation should be performed on all encoun-ters. Next frequent, they reported motion palpation (seat-ed) 54% and motion palpation (supine) 44%. While 27% reported prone LLI should be performed on all encoun-ters, other LLI analyses responses ranged from 11-19%. Less than 20% of DC employee respondents indicated radiographic biomechanical segmental analysis or other radiographic findings should be used on all patient en-counters. Eighteen percent reported that paraspinal dual probe temperature analysis should be used on all patient encounters, while 4-5% reported Tytron\u00ae or paraspinal infrared thermographic measurements should be used all of the time. Fifty percent of DC employee respondents stated that radiographs should be performed on some encoun-ters; 32% reported most encounters. Ten to 17% of re-spondents considered some component of prone LLI as-sessment as an evaluation that should be performed on some/most encounters; 4% rated supine LLI for most en-counters, while 50% related supine for LLI some encoun-ters. Respondents reported 4/26% for most/some patient encounters regarding all types of paraspinal temperature measurement. Motion palpation was chosen by about \u00bc of respondents for most/some, while static palpation was chosen most by 12% and some by 4%. Sixty-two percent of respondents reported that Ty- tron\u00ae infrared thermography should never be performed, while 53% reported that galvanic or dual probe paraspinal temperature analysis should never be performed. LLI was reported as should never be performed by 28-36% of re-spondents, except for LLI prone, extension only, which was reported \"never\" by 18% of respondents. Eighteen percent reported that biomechanical segmental analysis of radiographs should never be performed. Rationale for use of chiropractic analysis tools by ninth term studentsThirty-six to 43% of student respondents reported per - sonal experience as their rationale for their use of LLI and motion palpation. Nearly 35% used personal experi - ence as their rationale for responses to using radiographic analysis. Less than 15% of student respondents reported personal experience as rationale for use of paraspinal temperature measurements. The use of static palpation originated from personal philosophy for 28% of student respondents. Student re-spondents chose personal philosophy less than 15% of the time for all other categories. Ranking close with personal experience, nearly one half of student respondents chose patient preference at their rationale for reporting various analysis tools. Forty-two percent of student respondents chose re - search evidence as their rationale for their use of radio-graphs to assess abnormal curvatures and degenerative changes, which most responded should be used or ref-erenced on most or some encounters. This rationale was chosen by less than 15% for static and motion palpation as well as LLI assessments. Further, between 23-28% of respondents chose research evidence as rationale for their use of various thermographic assessment methods, con-sidered by most respondents to be used some or never during patient encounters. Rationale for use of chiropractic analysis tools by DC employeesThirty-three to 80% of DC employee respondents chose personal experience as their rationale when recom - mending frequency of use of chiropractic analysis tools. Personal experience was also chosen as a frequent ration - ale (60-80%) regarding palpation and LLI assessment. Personal experience was chosen infrequently as rationale for instrumentation use (33%). Only 20% of DC respondents chose personal philoso - phy rationale, as recorded in ies. The highest percentage of DC employee respondents chose patient preference (only 6%) for seated motion pal-pation. Forty-three and 53% of respondents research evi- dence use of radiographs (biomechanical segmental analysis) and (abnormal curvatures), both recommended by nearly half of respondents for use on some patient en-counters. Research evidence was ranked as rationale for thermography, chosen by 39-45% of responders, most of which ranked thermographic measurements to be used \"never\" for patient encounters. Technique systems used by senior students Seventy-three percent of students responded with \"Palmer Package\" as a technique used. Palmer Package is com-prised of components from Diversified, Gonstead, and Thompson or drop table SM techniques. Closely follow-ing is Activator, chosen by 20% of respondents. Technique systems used by DC employees Over 70% of DC employees responded with Palmer Package or Diversified for technique used, with Gon-stead, Thompson, Drop, following. Activator was ranked by 32% of respondents, flexion/distraction by 30%, Tog-gle-Recoil by 25%. See Table 2. Discussion This survey quantifies perceptions of DC employees and senior students at a single chiropractic college regard-ing the use of clinical analysis procedures used prior to performing SM. Static palpation was rated most con-sistently as a necessary procedure. This result may not be surprising given a manually delivered treatment often requires some palpation component to identify anatomic - al landmarks, local tissue characteristics and tenderness. Segmental motion palpation was not rated as highly by survey respondents in both groups. In a recent compre - hensive review of methods that can inform providers about treatment localization for SM, static palpation, motion palpation, and LLI assessment (pelvic only) were favorably recommended with limitations; radiographic imaging, paraspinal skin temperature, and galvanic skin response were unfavorably recommended. 3 While this re- view was published in the same year that the current was performed, it is unlikely that survey respondents were in-timately familiar with its recommendations due to a lag in dissemination. Further, a challenge to change practice behavior may occur if \"new\" recommendations are differ - ent from an individual's clinical experience. Over half of DCs rated research evidence as a ration- ale for their opinion regarding radiographic analysis, al-though the preponderance of rationale reported for other procedures is personal experience. Note that most DC employees reported the use of radiographic interpretation on some, but not most or all, patient encounters. DC re-spondents more commonly reported personal experience as rationale for clinical decision-making than students. It is logical to expect practitioners with a larger reservoir of clinical experience to use personal experience as a ration-ale more often than students. Research evidence was rated slightly higher than per - sonal experien ce among DC respondents for their ration- ale regarding the use of thermography; most (over half) recommended it never be used and over 20% suggested only on some encounters. Over 80% of students reported that paraspinal temperature measurements should never be used or only on some encounters. These responses are likely influenced by the lack of available evidence dem-onstrating validity as an assessment measure, a lack of personal experience with this type of assessment tool, or both. Similarly, research evidence ranked slightly above personal experience in rationale for recommending the frequency of use of radiographic analysis, even though research evidence is unfavorable for using radiography to determining the site of routine spinal manipulative care. 3 However, it is unclear whether respondents who indicated radiographic analysis was important on routine encoun-ters considered it as necessary for determining the site of care or as additional clinical information that should be reviewed at each encounter when available. It appears that the research evidence rationale increases as the fre-quency and specificity of the recommendation decreas-es, e.g., research evidence rationale increases by 10% from segmental analysis to overall curvature and degen-erative changes. A similar trend may be observed when advancing from a simple prone LLI evaluation to more elaborate (and less reliable) leg length procedures. This could suggest that respondents used research evidence in a negative rather than a supportive manner. DC respondents commonly chose research evidence second highest to those procedures rated as useful for \"some\" or \"no\" patient encounters. This suggests that re-34 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Clinical evaluation tools: a survey of doctors of chiropractic and students at one chiropractic college spondents answered this question in 2 ways, 1) to justify use of a clinical evaluation tool; and 2) to justify why they rarely or never use it because they believe research evi-dence does not support regular use. Students rarely chose research evidence as rationale, which may represent a lack of awareness of, experience with, or confidence in-terpreting scientific evidence regarding procedures in-cluded in the survey. It may also represent the general lack of high-quality research evidence available for many diagnostic procedures, an area noted by Haas et al. as a research priority for the chiropractic profession. 20 T echnique systems reported were similar between fac-ulty and students, which may be expected when most re-spondents were educated at the same institution, although DCs did report greater use of Activator\u00ae and Flexion/dis - traction techniques. It could be surmised that attitudes of students will similarly follow faculty attitudes. This phe-nomenon does seem to exist, with some exceptions. The lack of research evide nce informing the appropri- ate use of some clinical analysis procedures included in this survey may have led respondents to rely more on per - sonal experience and patient preference to influence their clinical decision-making. Survey responses indicating the use of clinical assessments unsupported by research evidence or considered to be fair, poor, or unknown sug-gests the following question. What is the most appropri-ate way to incorporate the practitioners' art and experi-ence into an educational curriculum dedicated to teaching evidence-based principles, skills, and decision-making? For procedures that have demonstrated poor reliability or validity, it seems clear that further use in educational settings is not well justified. Because evidence-based care includes what has been learned from experience, we do not suggest that chiropractic educators refrain from shar - ing their unique beliefs, as long as those unsupported by research are clearly stipulated as such. We suggest that it is vital for educators to provide balanced presentations of available literature describing both strengths and limita - tions of existing clinical analysis procedures and to con-sider the negative ramifications of directly or indirectly supporting the use of procedures no longer considered valid. Limitations This was the initial application of this survey, which has not been validated. The questionnaire asked respondents to consider a routine patient encounter, which was not fur - ther defined. Also, the terms \"most\" and \"some\" were not defined for participants. Therefore individual respondents likely defined this differently. While the entire faculty was surveyed, only one term of current students were surveyed. It cannot be generalizable to the entire student body during that period. Respondents cited research evidence as the reason for and against using certain procedures, and the survey was conducted using a convenience sample at a single chiro-practic college campus. This survey gathered data regard-ing the use of clinical tools and reasons that primarily in-fluenced their use. Future Recommendations It is beyond the scope of this survey to speculate how stu-dents and faculty are using assessment procedures includ-ed in this survey to make decisions based on evidence-in - formed principles. Major categories could be consolidat - ed and the more defined rationale collected to identify how research evidence (or other motivation) is driving respondent's decisions for or against clinical use. De-scriptions of specific clinical scenarios could also be more clearly defined. We suggest that it is important to assess faculty and students opinions regarding applicability and interpretation of research in daily clinical decision-mak - ing. Subsequent research seeking to further understand how diagnostic information informs care decisions is ne-cessary to inform both the teaching of and the practice of skilled evidence-based clinical decision-making. Conclusions The majority of respondents from both students and DC employees reported that static palpation should be used on all patient encounters. Survey responses were varied for other clinical evaluation methods, perhaps due to the lack of available research on many procedures. Re-spondents reported often relying primarily on experience and provider and patient preferences for evaluation pro-cedures used. An evidence-based educational and clinical setting requires a balanced presentation of practitioner experience and available literature for clinical analysis procedures.J de Vet JJM, Schuller W, de Zoete A, Bouter LM.

Support:This study was conducted with no funding beyond the internal support provided by the two chiropractic colleges that employ the authors.Introduction: Among pelvic landmarks routinely palpated by manual therapists, the posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs) are particularly important. In addition to serving as landmarks for identifying possible pelvic torsion, contacting the PSISs is integral to many other static and dynamic pelvic palpatory procedures. The primary study goal was to systematically review the literature on the intra- and interexaminer reliability of PSIS palpation. Methods: Electronic databases and secondary searches led to the retrieval of articles that satisfied inclusion criteria. Two investigators rated the quality of included articles using the QAREL instrument. Results: The search identified 13 articles, one judged high quality, satisfying the inclusion criteria. Intraexaminer exceeded interexaminer reliability. Among 8 studies that reported interexaminer agreement using kappa, mean =0.27 (adjusted for sample size). Introduction : En ce qui donn\u00e9es : La recherche Hickey Introduction Manual therapists draw upon a number of physical exam - ination procedures to establish indications for sacroiliac interventions. 1 Broadly speaking these procedures fall into four categories: palpation for positional asymmetry of bony landmarks, tests for joint hypomobility or hyper - mobility, assessment of changes in tissue texture, and tests for pain provocation and/or amelioration. The anatomic - al landmarks that are commonly located and contacted to perform these tests include the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), the posterior superior iliac sacral sulcus, the sacral apex, and the inferior lateral angle of the sacrum (SILA). Among the pelvic landmarks routinely palpated, the posterior superi-or iliac spines (PSISs) may be singled out as particularly important, in that identifying them is the starting point for a variety of patient assessment procedures (see Table 1). As the most posterior projection of the iliac crest, it serves for the attachment of the long posterior sacroiliac liga - ment, which blends with the sacrotuberous ligament, as well as the multifidus and gluteus maximus muscles. Fig-ure 1 depicts the muscular and ligamentous attachments to the PSIS. Given the importance of PSIS palpation, the authors elected to conduct a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the intra and interexaminer reliability of identifying the location of a single PSIS, or the bilateral positional asymmetry of the left and right PSISs. The pri-mary goals of this study were to both identify such arti - cles and summarize their data; and to assess their meth - odological quality. Figure 1. Muscular and ligamentous attachments to the PSIS (Permission to reprint from http://www.thelowback.com/ granted by Richard DonTigny) MethodsInclusion criterion for an article to be included in this review was that it concerned the intraexaminer or in-terexaminer reliability of static palpation of the PSIS(s) and was published in an English language peer reviewed Discussion and Conclusion: Curr ent methods of palpating for PSIS asymmetry do not result in levels of interexaminer reliability supporting clinical utility. Improved methods should be sought. (JCCA. 2016;60(1):36-46) key words: chiropractic, mentionn\u00e9 utilisant (ajust\u00e9 \u00e0 de l'\u00e9chantillon). Discussion conclusion Les m\u00e9thodes actuelles de palpation pour l'asym\u00e9trie de posterior spine: a systematic review journal. Reliability could pertain to assessing the location of a single PSIS, or to assessing the bilateral symmetry of the PSISs on the superior-inferior axis (i.e., assessing whether one PSIS was caudal to the other). Review arti-cles and validity studies related to PSIS palpation were excluded, as were articles concerned with pelvic land-marks other than the PSIS. Theses written in connection with obtaining a degree in an academic program were also excluded. Databases consulted included PubMed, ICL, CINAHL, AMED, Osteopathic Research Web, OstMed, and MANTIS. After searching these biomedical databases, we supplemented our search using the global Google search engine. Searches were conducted using the following terms and combinations of them: reliability, agreement, PSIS, palpation, physical examination, pos-terior superior iliac spine, pelvis, pelvic, sacroiliac, and landmark. It was not necessary to construct complicated Boolean phrases to limit the number of returned citations, because even very inclusive search terms returned rela - tively few citations; e.g., \"posterior superior iliac spine + reliability\" returned only 11 citations in the PubMed database, and sacroiliac + palpation only 70 citations. The \"related citations\" function was deployed when articles were retrieved which fit the inclusion criteria. In one case, an email was sent to an author to clarify the methodology used. The bibliographies for included articles were also inspected for additional candidates for inclusion. Each of the included articles was rated for quality using the The Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) in-strument. 14 These articles were rated for quality by two reviewers using the QAREL instrument14; disagreements between reviewers were resolved by coming to consen-sus following discussion. QAREL index quality scores ranged from 2 to 10, average 5.1. Table 2 summarizes the search strategy used in this study. Results The original search retrieved 215 citations. Another 5 arti-cles were included based on a secondary search of the in-cluded articles, or because the first author was personally familiar with them. After removing duplicates, there were 195 citations remaining. After inspecting their titles, 153 Table 1.

This resulted in the retrieval of 17 full text articles. Three of the retrieved full text articles were excluded because they did not involve PSIS palpation 13,15,16 and one because it involved radiological rather than manual assessment17.

Electronic PubMed, ICL, CINAHL, posterior superior systematic review Three studies utilized seated PSIS palpation only10,18,19; 6 utilized prone palpation only4,20-24; 3 used standing palpation only25-27; and one include seated and standing palpation8. Ten of the included studies8,10.18,19,21-25,27 asked assessors to examine the PSISs bilaterally to determine if they were symmetric or displaced on the superior-in-ferior axis; 2 studies 20,28 asked examiners to locate one of the PSISs, reporting their agreement in terms of the dis-tance between the sites identified by the assessors, mak-ing no attempt to analyze their continuous data by calcu - lating their Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC); and 1 study 4 assessed agreement as the midline distance be- tween lines examiners drew between the bilateral PSISs. Of the 10 studies that involved bilateral palpation, all but one used inferential statistics to report their data, the ex-ception being Potter et al. 8 who reported percent agree - ment only. Only 1 study reported data using an inferential statistic other than kappa: Kim 4 used the Wilcoxon signed rank test statistic as a surrogate measure of reliability4, basing calculations on the distance between lines that 2 examiners drew between the PSISs, as measured where these lines intersected a midline ruler. (The Wilcoxon test may be used to assess reliability when paired data are not normally distributed, in order to test the hypothesis that the median difference between the pairs is significantly different from zero.) None of the studies included in this review attained kappa levels for interexaminer reliability that would be considered to reflect \"substantial\" agree-ment according to the widely accepted Landis and Koch scale. 29 The 5 studies10,20,22-24 that included intraexaminer reliability modules found intraexaminer reliability to exceed interexaminer reliability. In the 8 studies that re-ported interexaminer agreement using the kappa statistic, the mean value, weighted by sample size, was =0.27. One study 25 did not provide exact kappa results, reporting only that <0.40, and thus could not be included in this mean calculation. The data are abstracted in Table 3, and the QAREL ratings in Table 4. There was a non-signifi-cant trend for moderate correlation between the reported kappa values and study quality (Pearson's product mo-ment correlation r = 0.43, p = 0.28), suggesting that the higher quality studies demonstrated higher interexaminer reliability. An established categorical hierarchy of scores has not been established for the QAREL instrument. That stated, the authors established the following arbitrary categorical hierarchy of scores to interpret the QAREL quality as-sessments (1-4: low; 5-8: The results were: =0.03 for the 2 low quality studies, =0.33 for the 5 moderate quality studies, and =0.37 for the 1 high quality study. An intra-exa miner reliability study was conducted in which 3 final year osteopathic students served as exam - iners attempting to reliably identify the location of a sin-gle PSIS on repeated examinations. 30 Although the full text of the thesis was not available to us, precluding in-cluding it in our review, we may point out that the inves-tigators reported \"low to moderate intra-rater reliability\" and recommended \"cautious presentation of palpation in osteopathic curricula.\" Discussion Most manual therapists perform tests for both joint fix-ation and misalignment. The term \"joint fixation\" may refer either to an examiner's sense of a hard endfeel on palpatory digital pressure, or restriction in or a specific direction during palpation for joint excursion. 31 The au- thors are not aware of evidence supporting the view that either type of finding is more important than the other, nor definitive evidence that the information supplied by either test has an important impact upon the outcome of care. Beyond the interexaminer reliability being demonstrably wanting, the validity has hardly been studied. Kmita 24 calls attention to the fact that \"the field of diagnostic ac-curacy has been labelled in the British Medical Journal as the 'new frontier'\" 32. Despite the lack of evidentiary support, a typical manual therapy examination involves finding asymmetry (e.g., pelvic torsion), then determining the clinically relevant side through motion palpation and other examination procedures. 33 The sequence could be reversed, so the clinician would identify a fixated or re-stricted joint, then determine via static palpation if there is positional asymmetry that might inform the vector of cor - rection. Asymmetric PSIS locations may imply opposed rotations of the innominate bones, wherein the bone on the side of the inferior PSIS has rotated posteriorly in re-lation to the other side, which in turn is judged to have rotated anteriorly. 34 There are basic science threats to the feasibility of using PSIS palpation to derive clinically useful informa - tion, beyond the demonstrable low reliability of the pro-cedure.

That stated, there is evidence that although there may be substantial left-right asymmetry of the in-nominate bones in any one individual, on average such differences are usually small and average only 2mm. 35-37 Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) poses another challenge to the clinical utility of PSIS palpa-tion. RSA technology, which involves 3-D digitizing of metallic markers implanted in the skeleton, is generally considered the most accurate method for measuring 3-D motions of the sacroiliac joints. 38 Motions of the sacro- iliac joint in stressed positions, such as one-legged stance and straddle position, have been found to be much small - er than those reported by most other measuring technol - ogies; Goode 38 concludes that \"the limited movements may not support a clinician's ability to palpate selected movements.\" Small sacroiliac movements notwithstand - ing, it must be emphasized that RSA measures movement, not position. Therefore this technology does not refute the possibility of asymmetric positions, if not movements, of the innominate bones, in principle detectable by means of manual palpation. Likewise, RSA technology does not rule out that findings of asymmetry could suggest vec-tors for manual therapy that are more optimal than con-trary vectors, even were it found that such vectors had not resulted in measurable repositioning of the innominate bones. Although the interexaminer reliability of most pal- patory pelvic positional tests (PSIS levels, ASIS levels, has been poor 39, instrumented meas- urements of innominate positions suggest these do in fact occur 2.

It remains to be seen whether interventions using vectors contrary to those intended to improve symmetry would get equivalent results, but there is some evidence that they may not. Long et al. 40 showed that the direction of prescribed McKenzie exercises did make a clinical differ - ence, while another author showed that patients preferred being blocked in positions that reversed their palpable pelvic torsion pattern 41. Manipulative strategies for pelvic structures should in- volve reliable and valid assessment procedures. However, none of the studies included in this review that reported their data using kappa calculations obtained the . 60 level that is considered to reflect \"substantial\" agreement and identify a clinically useful procedure. 42 In fact, none achieved the .40 level that defines \"moderate\" agree-ment.

Since palpation of the PSISs is the starting point for other pelvic examination procedures, examiner inabil - ity to agree on the location of the PSIS may negatively impact their ability to perform, interpret, and agree upon the results of other manual pelvic examination proced-ures. 23 The articles in this review that specified the aspect of the PSIS with which the examiners made contact speci-fied either the inferior aspect or the most posterior point. Since the PSIS in some individuals has a rather blade-like (rather than protuberant) anatomy, it is unlikely that at-tempting to locate the most posterior aspect would result in consistent findings - in effect, there would be no \"most posterior\" aspect. Palpating the inferior aspect of the PSIS, on the other hand, is not likely to yield consistent results because this method precludes easily using the index fin-gers to serve as stabilizing anchors on an adjacent ana-tomical structure. The first author of this study routinely anchors his index fingers on the lateral iliac crests while using his thumbs to probe an area somewhat superolateral to the superior aspect of the PSISs, in order to make better use of tactile sense. Figure 3 illustrates seated PSIS palpa - tion using this method. 45 The authors are unaware of any published evidence regarding the reproducibility of this method, contacting the superior aspect of the PSISs. Figure 3. PSIS palpation at superior aspect The fact that examiners may not agree with each other on the location of landmarks, but may manifest internal consistency in their individual palpatory efforts, may ex-plain why intraexaminer generally exceeds interexam -iner reliability in the included studies, as in many other manual therapy studies. One of the authors included in this review wrote: \"No attempt was made to rigidly stan-dardize each test as this would have interfered with each therapist's normal assessments\". 21 Although we recognize this author's effort to increase the external validity of the study, the resulting lack of methodological standardiza - tion may have contributed to poor examiner agreement. The present authors think it more appropriate that exam - iners develop reproducible patient examination methods, refining and standardizing methods as required. Demon-strating reliability alone does not establish an examina - tion method as clinically useful; but without reliability, there would be no point in proceeding to validity studies, nor reason to think the method may remain clinically use-ful. Limitations of the study By excluding studies not in the English language, and also studies written to fulfill a thesis requirement, relevant information may not have been included. None of the au-thors who reported kappa values for interexaminer reli-ability provided the standard deviation, thus precluding meta-analysis using the method described by Goldman. 46 Among the included studies, the data were reported using dissimilar methods, although most did use the kappa sta-tistic. Given there were some differences in the aspect of the PSIS that was palpated among the included studies, it should not be assumed that the palpatory methods gath-ered entirely equivalent data, which warrants caution in interpreting the mean kappa levels reported. Combining data from studies with very different quality scores also warrants cautious interpretation, especially given the sta-tistical tendency for the higher quality studies to show more reliability. None of the included studies reported a palpatory method involving the superior aspect of the PSIS, the first author's preferred method. The authors are unaware of any published evidence regarding the repro-ducibility of this method. Unless and until this method undergoes reliability assessment, it would be premature to entirely reject the possible clinical utility of PSIS pal-pation. Conclusion Although claims have been made that palpatory proced-ures can detect subtle misalignments, Assoc 2016; 60(1) M Hickey tissue changes in patients with neuromusculoskeletal dis- orders, and that the requisite skills take a considerable amount of time to acquire, there is little evidence at this time in support of these contentions with regard to PSIS palpation. Although the evidence available at the present time does not support clinical utility of manual PSIS pal-pation as a self-contained assessment nor as a compon-ent of other pelvic examination methods, it remains to be seen whether an alternative method or improvements in standardizing the methods can increase examiner reliabil - ity and thus clinical utility.

Extra-articular hip impingement (EHI) is an emerging group of conditions that have been associated with intra-articular causes of impingement and may be an unrecognized source of pain. EHI is caused by abnormal contact between the extra-articular regions of the proximal femur and pelvis. This review discusses the most common EHI including: central impingement. The clinical presentation of each pathology will be discussed since EHI conditions share similar clinical features as the intra-articular pathology but also contain some unique characteristics.

Arthroscopic and open surgical procedures are often indicated and have shown good outcomes with returning individuals back to pre-injury levels of function and sports activity. 1-3 How- ever, there is growing subgroup of patients with poor out-comes after surgery suggesting unrecognized cause(s) of impingement may exist. 4-6 More recently, an emerging body of literature has identified extra-articular causes of hip impingement that are associated with patients who have poor outcomes to intra-articular surgical procedures. 5,6 Extra-articular hip impingement (EHI) is caused by abnormal contact be-tween the extra-articular regions of the proximal femur and pelvis and may coexist with intra-articular FAI. 7 Re- gions of abnormal contact may exist between the greater trochanter, lesser trochanter, extracapsular femoral neck and the ilium or ischium. 4,5 The causes of EHI have been further classified into specific conditions: central iliop ment. 3,8 The research on these specific conditions is still emer - ging. A recent systematic review by de Sa et al5 appraised the literature on surgical interventions for these condi-tions. The authors found only 14 qualifying studies that varied in methodology and overall quality. The authors concluded that a small amount of evidence does exist sup-porting the surgical interventions for these conditions and that further research is necessary. The lack of evidence leaves a gap in our understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions and how they relate to intra-articular pathology. Moreover, there is a need to determine the best diagnostic criteria for identifying these conditions and de-termining which interventions influence recovery. Extra-articular conditions share similar clinical fea- tures as the intra-articular pathologies but also contain some unique characteristics. Clinicians must have a work-ing knowledge of the clinical presentation of these condi-tions in order to enhance accuracy during the examination and differential diagnosis process. This manuscript will review common extra-articular conditions with a focus on clinical presentation.PrevalenceThe epidemiological data on EHI is still emerging and the available research has revealed some preliminary trends in patient demographics. Riccardi et al 4 conducted a retrospective review of 1765 patients (2075 hips) who underwent hip preservation surgery (hip arthroscopy, periacetabular osteotomy, femoral osteotomy, and sur - gical hip dislocation) between 2010 and 2013. The au-thors analyzed two cohort groups: (1) EHI group and (2) intra-articular FAI group. The diagnosis of EHI was made preoperatively based on history, clinical examination, and radiographic studies. Seventy-five patients (86 hips) met the criteria for the EHI group and 1690 (1989 hips) pa-tients for the FAI group. Patients in the EHI group were younger than the FAI group (24 \u00b17 years versus 30\u00b111 years). The EHI group had an increased proportion of fe-males than the FAI group (85% to 49%). The right hip was the most commonly affected side in both groups (57% in each group). EHI patients were more likely to have under - gone prior hip surgery than the FAI group (44% to 10%) which consisted of hip arthroscopy (N = 24) and pelvic osteotomy (N = 6). The EHI group had lower preoperative outcome scores for the modified Harris hip score (mHHS) and Hip Outcome Scores activities of daily living (HOS ADL) (55 \u00b1 15 versus 63 \u00b1 15) after adjustments for age, sex, and type of revision surgery. Sixteen percent of the EHI patients were diagnosed with previous hip pathology which included: Leg Legg-Calve\u00b4-Perthes (N = 7), de-velopmental dysplasia of the hip (N = 2), slipped capital femoral epiphysis (N = 1), Ehlers-Danlos (N = 1), and postinfectious deformity (N = 1). 4 The research by Riccardi et al4 suggested that EHI pa- tients tend to be younger, female, and have undergone previous FAI surgery. Also, the presence of EHI was about 4% (75 of 1765) which is infrequent compared to the intra-articular pathology. The authors suspect that the diagnosis of EHI pathology may have been missed during the initial diagnosis. This hypothesis has been supported by other clinical trials investigating the outcomes of FAI revision surgery. 9-11 Central Iliopsoas ImpingementCentral iliopsoas impingement (CII) is an emerging diag-nosis of anterior hip pain that has been linked to acetabu - lar labral tears. 12,13 This type of impingement causes a distinct pattern of anterior labral damage that does not J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 49SW Cheatham extend into the anterosuperior portion of the labrum (e.g. 1 to 2 o'clock position). The damage often occurs direct - ly adjacent to the iliopsoas tendon at the 2 to 3 o'clock position of the anterior labrum and is often confirmed via magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) (Figure 1). 5,12,13 It is postulated that the impingement is caused by a repeti - tive traction injury by the iliopsoas tendon that is scarred and adherent to the capsule-labrum complex of the hip or by a tight or inflamed iliopsoas tendon that causes im-pingement during hip extension. 5,8 Iliopsoas impingement has also been reported after total hip resurfacing and total hip arthroplasty when a larger femoral head component is used. 14-17 The strongest available evidence on CII consists of retrospective case series from the United States with no randomized controlled trials. 5 The current research sug- gests that this condition may be more common in younger females (pooled age range 19 to 35 years) and individuals involved in regular sports activities. 5,12,18 Patients often re- port anterior hip pain with active flexion and may report a snapping sensation. The clinical examination may reveal non-specific focal tenderness over the iliopsoas tendon at the anterior joint line, positive hip impingement test (e.g. Flexion, Adduction, Internal Rotation (FADIR) test) (Fig-ure 2), and pain or apprehension with resisted straight leg raise (Table 1). 12,18 Patients may report little or no relief after intraarticular injection of a local anesthetic. MRA is often ordered to further diagnose the condition. MRA has shown good diagnostic properties with strong intra-ob-server agreement. 13 A labral tear at the 3-o'clock position (immediately below the iliopsoas tendon) suggests the diagnosis of iliopsoas impingement; especially if it does not extend above the 2-o'clock position. 13 Non-sur gical intervention such as activity modifica - tion, rehabilitation, and therapeutic injections may be pre-scribed first. However; the efficacy of these interventions have not been investigated. 5 If conservative measures fail, then surgery may be an option. Often, patients will have concomitant labral injury with the iliopsoas pathology requiring arthroscopic resection or repair of the acetabu - Figure 1. a) Region of subspine impingement, b) Region of central psoas impingement Figure 2.

To date, the clinical trials have primarily reported post-surgical outcomes and briefly described post-opera-tive rehabilitation or did not mention if it was prescribed for these patients. 5,18,20 Lindner et al.21 briefly outlined a post-surgical program. After surgery, the patient is partial weight bearing (e.g. 9.7kg (20lbs) flat-foot weight bear - ing) with crutches and a hip brace locked at 0 to 90 de-grees for the first 2-weeks. Two weeks post-surgical, the brace and crutches are discontinued and the patient con-tinues rehabilitation with an emphasis on regaining joint ROM, strengthening the gluteus medius and core mus-cles. The available details regarding the role of post-sur - gical rehabilitation is under reported. Further studies are needed to objectively assess the effects of post-operative rehabilitation for these individuals. Figure 3. The Subspine Impingement Test. The patient is lying supine. The affected hip is passively moved into maximum hip flexion (neutral adduction and internal rotation). A positive test is reproduction of the patient' s concordant anterior hip pain.Subspine ImpingementSubspine impingement (SSI) is caused by a prominent anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) abnormally contacting the distal femoral neck during hip flexion (Figure 1). 5 SSI is thought to be caused by excessive muscular activity of the rectus femoris during repetitive knee flexion with hip extension resulting in an avulsion injury of the AIIS. Upon healing, the apophysis may be inferiorly displaced leading to a malunion which often results in an enlarged bony protrusion at AIIS that abnormally abuts the 8,22 Avulsion injuries are common in ado- lescent athletes. This repetitive traction injury is common in running sports and sports involving rapid high energy kicking such as soccer. 5,22 Avulsion injuries to the AIIS are reported to be the second most common with ischial avulsions being the most common. 10 SSI has been related to CAM-type FAI and may be corrected with surgery.8 The strongest available evidence on SSI consists of case reports and series from the United States, United Kingdom, and China with no randomized controlled trials. 5 The current research suggests that this condition is more common in younger active males (age range 14 to 30 years). 5,8 Patients often report anterior hip or groin pain that is aggravated by active hip flexion and activities such as running or kicking. The clinical exam may reveal palpable AIIS pain and limited passive hip flexion with end range anterior hip pain. The patient may or may not have a positive hip impingement test (Table 1). 22 Poult- sides et al23 described the subspine impingement test that includes passively flexing the hip into maximum flexion (neutral adduction and internal rotation) (Figure 3). Re-production of the patient's anterior pain is considered a positive test. 23 Currently, there are no studies that have as- sessed the clinimetric properties of this test. Patients may report little or no relief with hip flexion after intraarticular injection of a local anesthetic. Radiographs may reveal a prominent AIIS deformity that extends distally to the level of the anterior-superior acetabular rim. 22 The radiographs may also reveal sclerosis at the AIIS (inferior) and dis-tal femoral neck junction. Computed tomographic (CT) scans have also been used with a classification system to categorize the type of SSI. 24 Researchers have also asso- ciated the ROM limits with each SSI classification (Table 3). 24 To date, the diagnostic properties of this imaging has not been reported in the literature. Non-sur gical intervention such and therapeutic injections may be prescribed first but their efficacy have not been investi - gated.5 Some patients may be recalcitrant to conservative treatment and require surgical interventions. An open AIIS decompression is commonly performed through the standard anterolateral and mid-anterior hip arthroscopy portals. At times, a concomitant arthroscopic procedure is conducted to address any intra-articular pathology. 22 Studies have shown good short-term outcomes at up to 2 years post-surgical follow-up for return to sports activity, Table 1. Common types of extra-articular hip impingement Extra-Articular ConditionPatient 19-35 years Gender: Females more than malesThe pathology may be caused by: (1) a repetitive traction injury by the iliopsoas tendon that is scarred and adherent to the capsule-labrum complex of the hip, (2) a tight or inflamed iliopsoas tendon that causes impingement during hip extensionPatients often report anterior hip pain with active hip flexion and may report a snapping sensation. Clinical findings include non-specific focal tenderness over the iliopsoas tendon at the anterior joint line, positive hip impingement test (e.g. FADIR test), and pain or apprehension with resisted straight leg raise. MRA is often used to further diagnose the condition. Subspine impingementPooled age range: 14-30 years Gender: Males more than femalesThe pathology is caused by a prominent AIIS abnormally contacting the distal femoral neck during hip flexion. This may be due to an avulsion injury to the AIIS due to excessive muscular activity of the rectus femoris during repetitive knee flexion and hip extension.Patients typically report anterior hip or groin pain that is aggravated by active hip flexion and activities such as running or kicking. Clinical findings include palpable AIIS pain and limited passive hip flexion with end range anterior hip pain. The patient may or may not have a positive subspine hip impingement test. Plain radiographs and computed tomography are commonly used to further diagnose the condition. Ischiofemoral impingementPooled age range: 14-30 years Gender: Females more than malesThe pathology is caused by a narrowed space between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter resulting in repetitive impingement of the quadratus femoris muscle. Patients often report non-specific pain in the hip, groin, and buttocks with active adduction and external rotation. Pain is often increased with sports related activity such as gymnastics or dance or activities of daily living such as long-stride walking. Referral pain may occur down the lower extremity due to possible irritation of the adjacent sciatic nerve. Clinical findings include pain with active or passive hip extension, external rotation, and adduction. In some cases, snapping may occur during hip flexion or extension during weight bearing activities. Magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs are commonly used to further diagnose the condition. Greater trochanteric-pelvic impingementPooled age range: 5 to 41 years Gender: No predilectionThe pathology is caused by a painful and pathological contact between the greater trochanter and ilium when the hip is actively or passively moved into abduction and extension. Patients typically report both lateral hip and groin pain that is reproduced with active hip abduction and extension. A blocking of the joint may be felt at the end range of these combined motions. Clinical findings include limited and painful active or passive hip abduction and extension, a shortening of the involved leg, and a Trendelenburg gait pattern. Plain radiographs are commonly used to further diagnose the condition. flexion-adduction-internal 60(1)Extra-articular hip impingement: a narrative review of the literature increased ROM, scores on the HHS, visual analog scale, and short form 12.9,22,25 The post-surgical rehabilitation for SSI is poorly reported among the published surgical in-vestigations. Hestroni et al 12 do recommend 2 to 4 weeks of protected weight bearing with crutches and ROM exercises until basic muscle strength is regained. Further strengthening and proprioception exercise should be pre-scribed as tolerated. Anti-inflammatory medications are also recommend for the first 3 to 4 weeks after surgery to help decrease the risk of heterotrophic ossification. 22 To date, post-surgical rehabilitation has not been objectively studied and its role in the post-operative period is poorly detailed in the literature. 5Ischiofemoral ImpingementIschiofemoral impingement (IFI) is characterized by a narrowed space between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter resulting in repetitive impingement of the quadratus femoris muscle (Figure 4). 5,7 The condition has been reported as primarily congenital but may also be acquired from a hip fracture, superior medial migration of the hip joint with osteoarthritis, or total hip arthroplasty when offset is not fully restored. 7,8 The strongest available evidence consists of case re- ports and series outside the United States with no ran-domized controlled trials. 5 The research suggests that ischiofemoral impingement is more prevalent in females Table 2.

There is an increased risk of IFI in patients who have suffered prior proximal hamstring avulsion fractures or multiple hereditary exos-toses. 7 Patients often report non-specific pain in the hip, groin, and buttocks with active adduction and external ro-tation. Pain is often increased with sports related activity such as gymnastics or dance or activities of daily living such as long-stride walking. 7 Referral pain may occur down the lower extremity due to possible irritation of the adjacent sciatic nerve. 7,8 The clinical examination may reveal pain with active or passive hip extension, external rotation, and adduction. In some cases, snapping may occur during hip flexion or ex-tension during weight bearing activities (Table 1). 7 There are no specific special tests for IFI which is often mistaken for intra-articular pathology and is largely dependent on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 8 On MRI, decreased space between the ischium and lesser trochanter is often identified as a risk for IFI. Singer et al 26 conducted a me- ta-analysis of MRI studies (2005 to 2014) and determined that a cut-off threshold of 15 mm (ischio-femoral space) showed a sensitivity of 77%, specificity of 81%, and over - all accuracy of 78.3% for diagnosing IFI (defined as the presence of quadratus femoris edema and/or atrophy, and ipsilateral pain). Edema of the quadratus femoris muscle may be visible in patients with IFI and some patients may present with fatty infiltration of the quadratus femoris muscle which is sometimes combined with muscle atro-phy. 7,8 Plain radiographs are often negative but may reveal sclerosis or cystic changes within the lesser trochanter or ischium, decreased femoral offset, or bony prominences from ischial avulsion injury or multiple hereditary exos- Figure 4.

Region Greater Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Extra-articular hip impingement: a narrative review of the literature toses.7 Patients may report relief after intraarticular injec- tion of a local anesthetic.27 Non-sur gical management is often prescribed first with a focus on avoiding activities that involve combined hip adduction and external rotation. Rehabilitation should be directed towards strengthening the hip external rotators and abdominal core. Stretching of the hip adductors and external rotators should also be done in the presence of decreased muscle length. 7 Nonsteroidal anti-inflamma - tory (NSAID's) medication and therapeutic corticosteroid injections may also be beneficial. Investigations have re-ported good outcomes with the combination of activity modification, rehabilitation, NSAIDS, and therapeutic in-jections. 7,28,29 If non-sur gical interventions fail, then surgical management may be suggested. The objective of surgery is to widen the space by resecting the bone from the lesser trochanter or ischium or releasing the quadratus femoris muscle. The surgery is commonly done through the stan-dard anterolateral arthroscopy portal. Psoas weakness is a potential complication. Resection of the lesser trochanter and release of the quadratus femoris creates a risk for dis-rupting the lateral circumflex artery and avascular necro-sis of the femoral head. 7 The studies reporting outcomes from this surgery have mainly been case reports which make intra-study comparisons difficult due to the low level of evidence. 5 However; the published case reports have shown good outcomes up to a 3.5 year follow-up for decreased symptoms, increased ROM, and return to func-tion. 5 To date, post-surgical rehabilitation for IFI has not been objectively studied and its role in the post-operative period is poorly detailed in the literature. Greater Trochanteric-Pelvic Impingement Greater trochanteric-pelvic impingement (GTPI) is de-scribed as pathological contact between the greater trochanter and ilium when the hip is actively or passively moved into abduction and extension (Figure 5). 7 During development an elongation of the great- er trochanter occurs due to partial or complete arrest of the proximal femoral physis. With a complete arrest of the proximal femoral physis, the femoral neck becomes varus deformity. The trochanteric epiphysis be to GTPI. GTPI is commonly as-sociated with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease but also may be related to the ischemia that occurs with the treatment of congenital hip dislocation, hip infection, traumatic in-jury, and infantile coxa vara. 5,7 The strongest available evidence for GTPI consists of case series from the United States and Scotland with no randomized controlled trials. 5 The research suggests that GTPI is more prevalent in younger individuals (pooled age range 5 to 41 years) with no gender predilection. 5,7,30 GTPI alters the morphology of the proximal femur which may predispose individuals to intra-ar - ticular pathology. 7 Patients commonly report both lateral hip and groin pain that is reproduced with active hip ab-duction and extension. A blocking of the joint may be felt at the end range of these combined motions. Patients may report pain with exercise and limping due to hip abductor weakness. 7 The examination may reveal limited and pain- ful active or passive hip abduction and extension, a short-ening of the involved leg, and a Trendelenburg gait pattern (Table 1). Macnicol and Makris 31 describe a special test called the \"gear-stick\" sign which helps to differentiate between GTPI and other causes of hip impingement. The patient is side-lying with the affected side up. The hip is passively abducted in extension without excessive move-ment for the lumbopelvis (Figure 6). ROM restriction and reproduction of the patient's symptoms is a positive sign. The hip can also be passively abducted in flexion to fur - ther assess ROM. The hip should have more abduction ROM in flexion since the greater trochanter avoids con-tact with the ilium in this position. 31 To date, the clinimet - ric properties of this test have not been studied. This must be considered prior to integrating this test into clinical practice. Plain radiographs seem to be the \"gold\" standard for further diagnosing GTPI. The radiographs often reveal abnormal proximal femoral morphology and a prominent greater trochanter. 7 To date, the diagnostic properties of this imaging has not been reported in the literature. Non-sur gical intervention such as activity modifica - tion, rehabilitation, and therapeutic injections may be prescribed first but the efficacy of these interventions have not been investigated. 5 If conservative measures fail, then surgical interventions may be indicated. The surgical procedure is an open procedure which may include distal transfer of the greater trochanter and various reduction osteotomy procedures. The case studies reported favor - able outcomes up to a 3 year follow-up with decreased pain, increase hip abduction and extension Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; No osteonecrosis events were reported.5 Despite the favorable results, the weakness in the evidence must be considered when inter - preting these findings. To date, post-surgical rehabilita - tion for GTPI has not been objectively studied and its role in the post-operative period is also poorly detailed in the case reports. Conclusion Understanding the clinical presentation of common EHI conditions is vital to the hip differential diagnosis process. Currently, the evidence on EHI is weak but does present some preliminary insight into the clinical presentation of these conditions. The one related characteristic among all EHI pathologies is that they may co-exist with intra-articu-lar causes of impingement and may be overlooked during the examination process. This must be considered during the examination and differential diagnosis process in order to accurately diagnosis all causes of hip impingement.References: 1. Kemp JL, Collins NJ, Makdissi M, et al.

Without timely diagnosis, non-mechanical complaints could result in surgery or loss of limb. This case describes the discovery of a Giant Cell Tumor of Bone (GCTB) following the re-evaluation of an athlete who had undergone five years of conservative management for patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Knee injuries account for 32.6% of sports injuries with PFPS being the most common and most likely diagnosis for anterior knee pain. GCTB is a benign aggressive bone tumor with a predilection for the juxta-articular region of the knee, comprising up to 23% of all benign bone tumors, and commonly occurs in the second to fourth decades. This case report illustrates the difficulty in accurately diagnosing healthy athletes, reviews common differentials for knee complaints and explores helpful diagnostic procedures.

Mechanism of injury, associated symptoms, red flags and risk factors picked up in the medical history can lead clinicians toward potential non-mechanical origins of a complaint. However, aspects of the history can also distract clinicians initially. Once management begins, poor compliance and re-aggravation can also skew prog-nosis for the working diagnosis. We present the case of a recreational soccer player who was originally diagnosed and treated for mechanical knee pain. Re-evaluation of the case resulted in a potentially limb sparing discovery of a locally aggressive benign bone tumor. This case stresses the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion, even when faced with seemingly healthy athletes. The following report will highlight how athletic injuries may mask pathology, while discussing common sources of an-terior knee pain and detailing tumors of the knee. Case Presentation An otherwise healthy 30-year-old female presented to a chiropractor with a complaint of right knee pain. She re-ported that this condition began approximately five years ago and attributes it to playing soccer. Past impressions have included an irritated meniscus and patellofemoral pain syndrome. The symptoms have recently become pro-gressive, although she did get relief from icing. Examination of the patellofemoral joint and muscles of the knee were unremarkable. There was positive med-ial joint line tenderness on palpation. Orthopedic tests for ligamentous stability were negative for excessive mo-tion; however, Slocum test, anterior-posterior glide with external rotation of the shin reproduced the knee pain. Functional examination found single leg standing and squat aggravated the chief complaint and McMurray's test produced pain, without click. Duck walk was found to be non-painful at the hip, but reproduced medial joint line tenderness of the right knee. The patient was referred to her family doctor for a second opinion and imaging. A plain film series and MRI scan of the knee were then requisitioned to rule out meniscal injury and the patient was referred to physiotherapy for assessment and treat - ment. When assessed by the physiotherapist, the patient re- iterated her history of chronic, intermittent right medial knee pain with recent increase in intensity and frequency. A recreational soccer and ultimate Frisbee participant, she had discontinued playing due to an abdominal muscle pull. Aggravating activities for her knee pain included ascending and descending stairs, running, playing sports, sit to stand movements and prolonged sitting or jumping. Her knee pain was eased by ice only. Her pain intensity, as rated by a Numeric Pain Rating Scale, varied between 0-5/10. She did not report symptoms of inflammation. She denied any locking or giving way of the knee. Her history included a red flag of previous melanoma, which was removed surgically several years prior. No medica - tions were prescribed or being taken for her knee pain. On physical examination, dynamic valgus of the right knee was noted with single and double leg squatting while reproducing medial joint line pain. This pain could be modified with correction of the dynamic valgus pattern. J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) Carr, D et al Thessely's test was negative, while McMurray's test was painful without click. Manual muscle testing was rated using the Oxford scale with left gluteus medius rated 4, 4- on the right, hamstrings 4+ bilaterally, and gluteus max-imus 4 bilaterally. She was diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) with a differential diagnosis of right medial meniscal injury. Plain radiographs were taken 1). Differentials suggested by the radiol-ogist included giant cell tumor (GCTB), aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), osteoblastoma, or chronic osteomyelitis and advanced imaging was recommended. The MRI scan pro-vided a more detailed description of the nature and size of the lesion and helped rule out malignancy (Figures 2 Figure 2. Right knee magnetic resonance imaging (T2 weighted fat-saturated) axial view.

This pre-surgical image radiologist included giant cell tumor (GCTB), aneurysmal bone cyst or well-circumscribed multi-septated lesion with a sclerotic border measuring 4.5 x 2.9 cm with several fluid-fluid levels was visualized. There was no cortical disruption, periosteal reaction or expansion of the medial femoral condyle; also no soft tissue mass was visualized and there was no bone marrow edema. The patient was referred to an orthopedic oncologist for assessment. Due to patient symptomatology and the locally aggressive but benign behavior of the lesion on imaging, surgical management was the best option for this patient. During the surgical procedure, first a biopsy was perform which revealed benign multinucleated giant 60 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Differentiating giant cell tumor of bone from patellofemoral syndrome: a case study cells in a mononuclear stroma, while the mononuclear cells showed moderate atypia and extensive hemosiderin deposition, suggestive of GCTB. Based on this benign diagnoisis, aggressive curettage and high speed burring were performed to remove the tumor. During surgery both solid tumor and blood filled cystic areas were identified. The final pathology revealed a GCTB with a secondary ABC. A portion of the distal femoral medial condyle was removed until only normal appearing bone remained. A periarticular plate and screws were used to support the morcellized cancellous allograft bone (Figure 4 and 5). Discussion This case highlights an example where an underlying pathological condition went clinically unnoticed for a number of years. Considering the good health of the pa-tient and the fact that the only symptom was knee pain, this should not be a surprise. In fact, we are trained know-ing that serious pathology comprises a very small per - centage of complaints presenting to a musculoskeletal practitioner. Therefore, the point of this case presenta-tion is to emphasize the importance of the re-evaluation, a thorough work up and a second opinion in cases with persistent symptoms. Further, it is an excellent starting point for a review of the differential diagnosis of persis-tent knee pain (Table 1). In retrospect, the patient could have been asked more pointed questions regarding red flags (in this case the re-evaluation history only included general questions about health status and whether or not there were any changes in the health history). Red flag symptoms includ - ing night sweats, weight loss, malaise etc. could be present in tumours of metastatic origin, but none were present in this case aside from history of melanoma and unremit-ting pain. The reproduction of pain during the orthopaedic tests could have been due to compressive forces on the Figure 3. Right knee magnetic resonance imaging (T2 weighted fat-saturated) coronal view.

This post-surgical image demonstrates the side view of the periarticular plate and screws used to cover and support the allograft reconstruction post-curettage. bone itself. Regardless of the exact mechanism of pain, the decision to refer the patient for a second opinion and imaging was largely based on a lack of specific findings from the physical examination and the history of un-resolved symptoms with no past imaging. Differential Diagnosis of Knee Pain Roughly 33% of all sports injuries involve the knee (Table 1). 1 PFPS is the most commonly diagnosed clinical con- dition in athletes with non-traumatic anterior knee pain.1-2 In a military population, with comparable incidence rates, females were found to suffer from PFPS 2.23 times more frequently than males. 3-4 At a specialty center dealing with musculoskeletal trauma, meniscal injury was the most common knee injury with an incidence of 23.8/100,000 per year. 5 Recent investigations found strong evidence that participation in soccer, rugby, downhill skiing and squash were strong risk factors for acute meniscal tears. 6 It is difficult to truly estimate the incidence of meniscal injuries. Incidental findings of meniscal tears on MRI and during arthroscopic procedures have been widely docu-mented, with some reports observing meniscal tears on MRI in 61% of asymptomatic subjects. 7 However, it can still be considered a highly probable differential diagnosis for traumatic mechanical knee pain in active individuals. The earlier popular, but controversial, rationales for the mechanism of PFPS is that of mal-alignment of patellar tracking. It is with more recent kinematic research that 62 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Differentiating giant cell tumor of bone from patellofemoral syndrome: a case study the proximal links in the lower extremity are more sig- nificantly associated with the dysfunction noted in PFPS.8 Positive risk factors for the development of PFPS identi - fied in the literature include: muscular weakness around the knee and/or hip; single leg stance strength de fi cits; oblique/vastus lateralis reflex timing has also been considered; however this is proving to be less significant than first theorized ac-cording to recent systematic reviews. 11 The female athlete is in a high risk category due to relatively larger Q-an-gles, potential ligamentous laxity, differences in muscular girth, and even effects of hormone fluctuations through-out the menstrual cycle. 3,12-13 One weakness to the patellar tracking theory is the poor correlation with expected lat - eral tilt or displacement of the patella on radiographs and symptomatology. 14 More recent observational trials have demonstrated significantly lower cross-sectional girth and diameter of the quadriceps musculature as measured Table 1.

Asterisks (*) indicate tumors commonly affecting the femur or tibia around the knee. Age De Carvalho, et al on MRI; however a significant difference in the ratio of vastus lateralis and vastus medialis was not demonstrat - ed.14 Further research using MRI paired with kinematic analysis revealed that what is more important is abnormal femur motion and not that of the patella. 15 This abnor - mal femur motion in PFPS is suggested to be the result of reduced hip torque into abduction and external rotation noted on a step down task. 16 Similarly, decreased hip ab- duction force and associated increased hip adduction an-gle at the end of a run of variable distances was measured in PFPS subjects. 17 Investigations on the natural history of PFPS have been poor, making it difficult to know when to consider alterna - tive differential diagnoses. Two studies have attempted long-term follow-up of patients with PFPS. The group found that 27% of athletes recovered within an average of 8 months, while the remaining patients continued to have pain at 5 years. 4 Of the unrecovered population, half re- ported being able to cope with the pain, and only 20% of athletes were forced to completely cease sport participa - tion, and 6% reporting time off work. 4 Variables strongly associated with poorer prognosis include: female gender, pain severity on visual analog scale, Anterior Knee Pain score, patellar hypermobility, and a sedentary lifestyle. 4, 18 Misdiagnosis in AthletesMisdiagnosis, specifically tumors about the knee in ath-letes is an important issue looked at in the literature. 19 One report from a large orthopedic hospital helped illustrate the incidence of misdiagnosed knee pathology in athletic populations. 20 The investigators reviewed 667 cases and found 25 tumor patients which were originally misdiag - nosed as an athletic injury, and resulted in inappropriate invasive procedures. 20 The authors concluded that 15 pa- tients had suffered significant detrimental effects to their final clinical outcomes due to misdiagnosis, 3 of which resulted in limb amputation. 20 While the incidence of these cases was found to be relatively low, the results are potentially devastating to the patient. The most common cause for misdiagnosis reported by the authors was poor quality radiographs and refusal to consider alternative diagnoses in the absence of clinical improvement. 20 Tumors Around the KneeAlthough GCTB is an uncommon cause of knee pain, it has been reported to accounts for 13.7% (8-23%) of all benign primary bone tumors. 21 GCTB is considered to be \"quasi-malignant\" or a \"borderline\" malignancy making up a 5-8% of all primary malignant bone tumors. 21-22 It is associated with a very low risk of lung metastasis, even in the absence of histologic malignancy, although it is treated locally as a benign tumor. 21 The vast majority of patients with GCTB are between 20-50 years of age.22-23 GCTB has a predilection for juxta-articular locations (i.e. metaphysis and epiphysis) and is located most commonly around the knee. 23 ABC is also an uncommon cause of knee pain, 6% of benign bone tumors, which occurs typically in the first two decades of life. 22 ABC frequently causes bone de- struction and cortical expansion prior to their discovery.23 In adults ABC can also form secondary to an underlying GCTB or other benign bone tumor. 21, 25-25 In the case pre- sented above, pathological analysis of the excised tissue found evidence of both GCTB and secondary ABC. There are other bone tumors that fit this case presentation based on location and demographic information (Table 2). Patients with benign aggressive bone tumors usual- ly present with rapid onset of symptoms and functional disability, unlike the patient in this case report who had persistent, but slowly worsening symptoms over a course of 5 years. The typical management of benign aggressive lesions including GCTB and ABC is tumor resection by aggressive curettage and high speed burring followed by reconstruction with either bone graft or cement, or less commonly by en bloc resection. 26-27 A retrospective re- view of 621 patients at a Chinese hospital specializing in musculoskeletal oncology reported a local recurrence rate of 8.6% after extensive curettage and burring. 20 ImagingMost guidelines prefer a conservative approach to im-aging; however, when considering athletes imaging util - ization tends to increase. Indications for knee imaging includes traumatic injury with inability to fully extend the knee, severe ecchymosis with anterior cruciate ligament tear suspected, and persistent unexplained knee pain, to rule out surgical pathology and neoplasms. 28 To evaluate these structures, MRI is preferable, however, it is up to the clinician to know if the structures are just as easily demonstrated on US. Plain radiographs or MRI can iden-tify previously undiagnosed bone tumors prior to any surgical intervention including arthroscopy, thus avoid-64 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Differentiating giant cell tumor of bone from patellofemoral syndrome: a case study ing inadvertent tumor rupture, spread of lesion and some- times amputation.20 SummaryWe have presented a case of underlying knee pathology that had remained undiagnosed for a number of years. The important feature to note during the evolution of this case was the re-evaluating clinician's willingness to en-gage in collaborative care when faced with progressive or unresolving symptoms. On a subsequent evaluation, the patient's presentation still appeared mechanical on physical exam; however, symptoms were increasing in severity making the clinical progression appear more ur - gent, warranting imaging. While MRI remains a sensitive imaging modality for early diagnosis, radiographs may be a logical first step. One challenge with this case is the self-limiting na- ture of PFPS in the absence of ligamentous instability or intra-articular injury. This allows patient to continue to access pain management over a period of time, often seek-ing out various health care providers due to frustration, while allowing serious pathology to go unsuspected. This case illustrates the importance of a thorough re-evalua - tion, consideration of differentials and follow-up for per - sistent self-limiting complaints. Maintaining a high level of suspicion in athletic or active populations should be exercised early so as to avoid delayed diagnosis and hast-en recovery. References: 1. Steinbr\u00fcck K.

Clinical Features: A tall thin 25-year-old male anxiously presented to a chiropractic clinic with six days of sudden unexplained left thorax pain. His breathing was laboured and his dry cough aggravating. After assessment a high clinical suspicion of primary spontaneous pneumothorax prevailed. Intervention and Outcome: The patient was r eferred to hospital for further investigation and primary spontaneous pneumothorax was confirmed on chest radiograph. He underwent immediate tube thoracostomy to drain the air from his pleural space and to re-inflate his lung. After three days the tube was removed. By two weeks the lung had returned to full size. No recurrences have occurred to date. Conclusions : Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is a medical emergency in the presence of shortness of breath. The focus of treatment is to drain air from the pleural linings and to prevent recurrences. In less severe cases, patients may believe they have thoracic spine pain and seek manual therapy care.

(JCCA. words: remains a significant health problem. 1,2 It ranks high on the list of common medical conditions, especially in the emergency depart - ment. A pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the pleural cavity which leads to a collapsed lung. There are several types of pneumothoraces. Over half pneumothoraces are traumatic, either accidental or iatro - genic; the remaining occur without any preceding trauma and are labelled spontaneous pneumothorax (SP). SP can be divided into two types - primary and secondary. Pri-mary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) is the idiopathic variety which occurs in the otherwise healthy person. In Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (SSP) an under - lying disease state responsible for the pneumothorax can be identified. SSP is associated with underlying lung dis-eases such as cystic fibrosis, Chronic Obstructive Pul-monary Disease, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and tuberculosis, with peak incidence with those aged >55 yrs. 1 The consequences of pneumothorax in patients with pre-existing lung disease are significantly greater and management is potentially more difficult. The develop - ment of a one-way air valve leads to tension pneumothor - ax and can occur in either traumatic or spontaneous cases. Unless reversed by effective treatment, this situation can progress and cause death. 3 The most likely pneumothorax presenting to chiroprac - tic clinic is SP. SP remains a significant health problem, with an annual incidence of 18-28 per 100,000 population in males and 1.2-6.0 per 100,000 population in females. 2 Mortality rates of 1.26/million for men and 0.62/million for women per annum have been reported. 1 The mortality of SP can be high, especially in older subjects and those with SSP.4 The course of SP remains unpredictable, with a recurrence rate ranging from 25-54%.5 Smoking is an important risk factor for PSP. The lifetime risk of devel-oping pneumothorax in smoking males is 12%, compared with 0.1% in non-smoking males. 6,7 Patients with PSP tend to be taller than control patients.5,8 The gradient of negative pleural pressure increases from the lung base to the apex, so that alveoli at the lung apex in tall individ - uals are subject to significantly greater distending pres-sure than those at the base of the lung, and the vectors in theory, predispose to the development of apical subpleur-al blebs. 9 Although it is to some extent counterintuitive, there is no evidence that a relationship exists between the onset of pneumothorax and physical activity, the onset being as likely to occur during sedentary activity. 10 Clin- ical signs and symptoms of SP include sudden sharp chest pain worse with breathing and coughing, chest tightness, dyspnea, easily fatigued, nasal flaring, anxiety, reduced lung expansion, hyper-resonance and diminished breath sounds on the side of the pneumothorax, cyanosis, sweat-ing, sever Spine Spain (TSP) is a common presentation in both clinical practice and in the general population with a high prevalence among healthy individuals, thus contributing to a significant per - sonal and community burden. 12-14 Thoracic facet15 and costotransverse joint pain patterns are well demonstrat - ed as contributing to TSP16. Thoracic spinal manipulative therapy in the care of TSP is often utilized by many pro-fessional health disciplines and is demonstrated to have a reasonable degree of efficacy verses placebo in prelim - inary studies. 17 Although patients may present clinically with what they believe is TSP the following case dem-68 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Primary spontaneous pneumothorax a chiropractic as undifferentiated thoracic spine pain: a case report onstrates the importance of thorough history taking and assessment. Case Presentation Believing that he had spine pain and that chiropractic ma-nipulation would be helpful, a 25-year-old active male cabinetmaker, presented with sudden sharp progressing chest and rib pain of 6 days duration. This gentleman was very tall and thin (6'9\"/205.7 cm and 180lbs/81.6 kg). Onset was insidious and his symptoms were localized to the left chest, rib cage, thoracolumbar spine and posterior shoulder. His breathing was laboured, painful and short. A dry cough was present and aggravated his symptoms. Over-the-counter ibuprofen was not helping. He reported smoking one pack per week. Due to his symptoms, he was unusually anxious. His sleep was significantly dis-turbed and limited. Auscultation did not reveal obvious abnormality; the clinician admits to limited experience with lung auscultation and therefore considered this as a possible false negative. Global chest compression and thoracic joint palpation were aggravating. Global active/passive/resisted thoracic ranges of motion were severe-ly limited and painful. Based on the history and physical findings a high clinical suspicion of primary spontaneous pneumothorax prevailed and the patient was referred to hospital for chest radiography and further investigation. At the hospital, chest radiographs were performed and a 40% spontaneous pneumothorax was confirmed in the left lung (Figure 1A). Immediate tube thoracostomy was performed to drain the trapped air in the pleural linings and to allow for the lung to re-inflate. Shortly after tube insertion, additional radiographs were taken demonstrat - ing an immediate decrease in the size of the pneumothor - ax to 15% (Figure 1B). The patient remained in hospital one day under supervision and then was released with chest tube still inserted. The tube was removed on the third day and follow up radiographs were taken, which still demonstrated the presence of a small pneumothorax. Figure 1.

Subpleural blebs and bullae are found at the lung apices at thoracoscopy and on CT scan in up to 90% of cases of PSP, and are thought to play a role. 18,19 Pulmonary blebs are small subpleural thin walled air containing spaces, not larger than 1-2cm in diameter; their walls being less than 1 mm think. It's thought if a bleb ruptures it can allow air to escape into the pleural space. Blebs are also observed in cell apoptosis 20 which is a cells self-execution plan to guided rupture. It is theorized that the pleural lining cells are committing apoptosis leading to the creation of spon-taneous pneumothorax. Pulmonary bullae are focal re-gions of emphysema measuring more than 1cm in diam - eter with very thin cell walls. 21 The location of the unique or diffuse sites of air leakage leading to PSP is usually unknown. Distal airway inflammation due to cigarette smoking seems to play a key role. No clinician should miss the opportunity, especially in young people, to en-courage smoking cessation. Most young patients continue to smoke after their first episode of PSP, showing that clinical strategies need to be improved in order to better address the needs of this particular age group. 22 T ension pneumothorax can develop in any type of pneumothorax, traumatic, PSP, or SSP. The development of a tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency re-quiring heightened awareness in a specific range of clin - ical situations. Patients are to be referred immediately for emergency care. Treatment is with oxygen and emer - gency decompression. A tension pneumothorax arises as a result of the development of a one-way valve system at the site of the breach in the pleural membrane, permitting air to enter the pleural cavity during inspiration but pre-venting egress of air during expiration, with consequent 70 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Primary spontaneous pneumothorax presenting to a chiropractic clinic as undifferentiated thoracic spine pain: a case report increase in the intrapleural pressure such that it exceeds atmospheric pressure for much of the respiratory cycle. As a result, impaired venous return and reduced cardiac output results in the typical features of hypoxaema and haemodynamic compromise. 23,24 Any clinica l suspicion of pneumothorax must be as- sessed with a stethoscope specifically listening for de-creased or absent breathing sounds on the affected side. A diagnosis of PSP is usually made by expiration chest radi-ography. Standing erect PA and lateral chest radiographs are the mainstay. CT scan is the gold standard in the de-tection of small pneumothoraces and in size estimation. 25 It is important to always check for associated rib fracture in all cases of pneumothorax. It is not unusual for patients with PSP to present several days after onset of symptoms because of the relatively minor severity. 26 There are two main aims when treating pneumothor - ax; first, insure the trapped air is evacuated and that the lung is re-expanded; secondly, prevent recurrence. In first episodes of PSP observation and simple needle aspiration are established first-line therapies. 27 If the PSP is small without significant breathlessness, observation is the treatment of choice. Adequate analgesia and high concentration oxygen therapy without any interventional therapy are usually enough to relieve the patients' symp-toms. 11 Observation is the guideline recommendation from the British Thoracic Society for first line treatment of patients with small closed PSP (<15% of lung size) with minimal symptoms. A 70-80% resolution rate can be achieved in these patients in about 7 weeks. 29 Obser - vation alone is inappropriate for breathless patients who require active intervention, needle aspiration or chest tube drainage. If observation is unwarranted, needle aspiration is a more conservative second choice. How-ever, in the case of failed aspiration, a chest tube should be inserted. Within 24hrs of admission patients should be referred to a respiratory specialist since intercostal tube placement can lead to serious complications, even death. 30 Patients should be hospitalized while a tube is in chest, at least until stable. Video-assisted Thoracosop-ic Surgery (V ATS) is a newer alternative to chest tube drainage and has been shown to be more cost-effective 31 with similar result. Recurrences are common and prevention is thera - peutically challenging.32 The risk of recurrence of PSP is as high as 54% within the first four years, with iso-lated risk factors including smoking, height and age >60 years. 5,9,33 After a first recurrence, the likelihood of subse- quent recurrences increases progressively, up to 62% for a second recurrence and 83% for a third. 34 Patients should avoid air travel until full resolution of pneumothorax has been confirmed by chest radiograph. The consequence of a recurrence during air travel may be serious. 35 After a pneumothorax scuba diving should be permanently avoided. 36 There is no evidence to link recurrence with physical exertion.10 The patient can be advised to return to work and resume normal physical activities once all symptoms have resolved, although it is reasonable to ad-vise that sports that involve extreme exertion and physical contact should be avoided until full resolution. 11 T o prevent recurrences of SP pleurodesis should be con-sidered. 18 Pleurodesis is a medical procedure performed surgically or chemically in which the space between the parietal and visceral pleural is artificially obliterated. It involves the of the two pleurae producing a dif-fuse pleural symphysis. If the PSP is small without significant breathlessness, the patients' chief complaint can be misrepresented as unspecific Thoracic Spine Pain (TSP). This presentation can lead patients to seek chiropractic care for non-specif-ic mechanical TSP as this is a common presentation in clinical chiropractic practice. It is necessary to be clin-ically aware of differentials when an undifferentiated thoracic spine condition is present, as serious cases, such as pneumothorax, cancer and heart and lung disease may require emergency medical care. In summary , a young tall and thin male who was a smoker, presented to a chiropractor with insidious left sided thorax pain thinking he required manual therapy for a thoracic spine complaint. He was experiencing Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax. It is imperative that when pneumothorax is suspected that immediate referral be made to the hospital for further investigation and possibly acute emergency management. This case highlights an example of an emergency care situation of thoracic pain presenting to a chiropractic clin - ician. Chiropractors are primary contact health care pro-viders, and future research on the their role and involve - ment in emergency care encounters is warranted in order to demonstrate the value of integrating chiropractors into interdisciplinary collaborative models such as hospital or multidisciplinary health teams. There is a growth in chiro-J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 71R Larson practic researchers focusing on less traditional chiroprac - tic research pursuits, including innovative collaborative research efforts in undifferentiated chest pain.37 There- fore, it appears that an initiative of this nature would be in align with the efforts to move beyond simply the spine and into other primary contact musculoskeletal areas that benefit both the patient and the profession. Successful management of emergency care cases can only emphasize the role the chiropractic profession has in the health care system. References: 1. Gupta DJ, et al.

Email: Pierre.B.Boucher@uqtr.ca\u00a9 JCCA 2015 Declaration There is no funding source or conflict of interest for this study .The objective of this jurisdictional review is to provide summary information pertaining to the regulation of chiropractors in Canadian provinces and territories on the topic of informed consent. Our review shows that two provinces have legislated for all healthcare professions: Ontario and Prince Edward Island. Two chiropractic regulatory bodies (New Brunswick and, Newfoundland and Labrador) have adopted the Canadian Chiropractic Association Code of Conduct. All chiropractic regulatory bodies of the other provinces and Yukon have adopted their own specific dispositions regarding informed consent. Chiropractors in Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan and Qu\u00e9bec must obtain informed consent in writing. (JCCA. 2016;60(1):73-80) key words: chiropractic, informed consent, et ont l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 sur toutes les professions r\u00e9glementation chiropratique (le Nouveau-Brunswick 60(1)A review of the legislation governing informed consent by chiropractors across Canada Introduction In a large telephone survey, Caspi1 found that only 57% of U.S.-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) organizations have any informed consent (IC) policy and that only 16% mandate their members to obtain IC from their patients. They also found \"no con-sistent standards with respect to the IC process across a broad range of CAM practices.\" In a more recent study, the same authors 2 reported \"CAM practitioners seem to represent their own opinions or preferences and not pro-fession-based standards, perhaps because there are none.\" It is a truism that levels of training and regulation of CAM practices vary greatly but contrary to the opinion of the above mentioned authors, established CAM practi - ces such as chiropractic are well regulated and implement profession-based standards. The objective of this jurisdic-tional review is to provide summary information relative to the regulation of chiropractors in Canadian provinces and territories on the topic of informed consent. Methods A review of current legislations and regulations per - taining to chiropractors in all Canadian provinces and ter - ritories was conducted. Research was conducted through the CANLII database and websites for each jurisdiction's regulatory body and professional association. Missing in-formation was completed by telephone interviews with representatives of regulatory bodies and associations. Results Chiropractors are regulated in all Canadian provinces and in the Territory of Yukon. There is no regulation of chiro-practic in the North West Territories and in the Territory of Nunavut. W e present here the key findings of our review: British-Columbia: Authority comes from the Health Professions Act3 which authorizes a board to make bylaws that may include standards of professional practice. 4 Provision and information on informed consent is provided in The Professional Conduct Handbook adopted by the College of Chiropractors of British-Columbia. 5 Alberta: Authority comes from the Health Profes- sions Act6 which lays down that a regulated profes- sion must establish, maintain and enforce a Code of Ethics. Provision and information on informed consent is provided in The Standards of Practice 8 and in The Code of Ethics adopted by the Alberta College and Association of Chiropractors.9 Saskatchewan: Authority comes from the Chiro- practic Act10, which authorizes the Chiropractors' Association of Saskatchewan (CAS) to make stan-dards of practice and professional ethics. The CAS requires its members to use the Canadian Chiro-practic Protective Association patient informed consent form. 11 Manitoba: Authority comes from The Chiropractic Act12, which authorizes the Manitoba Chiropractors Association \"to make regulations to develop, estab-lish and maintain standards for the practice of chiro-practic\". Provision and information on informed consent are provided in the Code of Ethics adopted by the Manitoba Chiropractors Association. 13 Ontario: Authority comes from the Regulated Health Professions Act14 where the College has to \"develop, establish and maintain\" standards of practice and professional ethics and where members must fol-low a uniform set of rules for consent to treatment created by the Health Care Consent Act. 15 Provision and information on informed consent are provided in the Standards of Practice S-002 (Record Keeping), S-005 (Manipulation/Adjustment), S-008 (Diagno-sis/Clinical Impression) and S-013 (Consent) adopt-ed by the College of Chiropractors of Ontario. 17 Also, the Ontario Chiropractic Association, the lar - gest advocacy group in the province, recommends its members to practice in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Province of Ontario. 18 Qu\u00e9bec: Authority comes from the Professional Code 20 where the Qu\u00e9bec Board of Chiroprac - tors must make, by regulation, a code of ethics. Provision and information on informed consent is provided in the Code of ethics of chiropractors. 22 In Qu\u00e9bec, the Qu\u00e9bec Chiropractors Association published the Chiropractor's Manual 23, adopted by the Qu\u00e9bec Board of Chiropractors. This Manual is a summary of accepted standards of practice, and procedures and services performed in the daily practice of clinical chiropractic. Authority also comes from the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec 19 in harmony with the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and the general principles of law.J Can Chiropr Chahine New-Brunswick: Authority comes from An Act to Incorporate the New- Brunswick Chiropractors As- sociation24 which authorizes the Association \"to es- tablish, maintain, develop and enforce standards of professional ethics.\" Provision and information on informed consent are provided in the Code of Eth- ics adopted by the New-Brunswick Chiropractors Association. 26 The Association has also adopted through its bylaws the Code of Ethics and the Clin-ical Guidelines for Chiropractic Practice In Can-ada by the Canadian Chiropractic Association. 25 Nova Scotia: Authority comes from the Chiroprac- tic Act.27 The Act authorizes the College to \"estab - lish, maintain and develop\" standards of profession-al ethics and practice. Provision and information on informed consent are provided in The Standards of Practice on Informed Consent 29 and in The Code of Ethics adopted by the Nova Scotia College of Chiropractors28. Prince-Edward-Island: Authority comes from to the Consent to Treatment and Health Care Direc- tives Act30 which creates a uniform set of rules for consent to treatment for all health care providers. Besides, the Prince Edward Island Chiropractic As-sociation, which is the regulatory body in Prince Edward Island, requires Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association (CCPA) membership for lia-bility coverage. 32 CCPA strongly recommends use of their informed consent form. Newfoundland and Labrador: Authority comes from the Chiropractors Act 2009.33 By regulation34, improper professional conduct includes conduct contrary to the Code of Ethics set by the Canadian Chiropractic Association (CCA). 35 This Code of Ethics recommends that CCA members \"share the responsibility of the health care decision making process with a patient.\" Furthermore, the CCA has a specific position statement on informed consent. 36 Y ukon: Authority comes from the Chiropractors Act.37 Provision and information on informed con- sent are those published by the Canadian Chiro-practic Association. T wo provinces have enacted omnibus legislation with respect to informed consent: Ontario (Health Care Con-sent Act 15) and Prince Edward Island (Consent to Treat - ment and Health Care Directives Act30). Two provinces (New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador) have adopted the Canadian Chiropractic Association Code of Conduct. 25,34 All other provinces and Yukon have adopted their own specific dispositions regarding informed con-sent (see Table). T wo provinces have made it mandatory to obtain con- sent in writing and chiropractors in Saskatchewan must use the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association form. 11 In Qu\u00e9bec, chiropractors must obtain consent in writing but do not have the obligation to follow any specif-ic format although the regulatory board recommends to its members to use either the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association form or a provincial form (which itself has information, based on the CCPA form), that is made available to the members of the Qu\u00e9bec Board of Chiropractors. Details are provided in the Table below.a a Modifications to legislation, standards/codes, and guidelines are often ongoing. Chiropractors are encouraged to consult their regulatory bodies to keep current with the most recent information .76 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)A jurisdictional review of the legislation governing informed consent by chiropractors across Canada Table 1.

Second, all chiropractic licensing bodies have adopted regulations and codes of ethics that specifically address the issue of informed consent in the health care context. Generally speaking, all of these statutes have an object-ive to organize the common law rules regarding informed consent as enunciated in Reibl v. Hughes. 38 This decision of the Supreme Court of Canada is of considerable import - ance because it recognizes that informed consent requires health care practitioners to inform their patients of risks that the \"reasonable person in the position of the patient\" would want to know and to ensure that their patients have understood the information that has been disclosed. This J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 79PB Boucher, D Brousseau, S Chahine a significant change from a paternalistic per - spective to informed consent toward a more patient-cen - tered approach. Chiropractic licensing bodies ensure the patients' right to be informed and the need for the health practitioner to know how to fully comply with his or her duty of disclo-sure. In sum, the basic principles of Canadian chiropractic informed consent procedures and policies do not differ from allopathy and cover the essentials of the Supreme Court of Canada decision. 38 However , with 13 different jurisdictions (10 provinces and 3 territories), the format of those statutes may vary greatly from one region to another since health regulation is a provincial/territorial responsibility. This heterogen - eity in statutes may lead to large variations in the day-to-day implementation of sound informed consent pro-cedures. In Canada, approximately 87% b of chiropractors have professional liability protection from the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association, a mutual defence as-sociation which is governed by a council of chiropractors. For the benefit of its members, this association has pub-lished in October 2015 a revised version of its informed consent form. This form reflects actual knowledge regarding chiro- practic informed consent and represents what patients should know regarding their chiropractic care. The most significant change from the last version is a statement that patients should not sign the consent form before they have had an opportunity to speak to their chiropractor first. In other words, the consent form should never be signed during patient intake since obtaining informed consent requires that the patient understands the diagnosis, pro-posed treatment, alternatives and plan management. It is important to remember that informed consent is a process and not just a one-time event. W e suggest that chiropractic regulatory bodies and as- sociations encourage chiropractors to use the documen - tation created by the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association (CCPA) whether or not they get their pro-fessional liability coverage from this provider. However, Canadian chiropractors must ensure that the documenta - b Estimation of percentage. CCP A membership = 7 300 (CCPA website, members section, as of July 2015). Total number of Canadian chiropractors = 8 400 (Canadian Chiropractic Association website as of July 2015, http://www.chiropractic.ca/blog/social-media/)tion complies with the nuances of their province/territory regulations. Also, they must ensure the understanding of these documents by their patients and cannot be content to provide information without explanation. Chiropractic care remains unregulated in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. According to our respondents, only a handful of chiropractors are practicing in those areas but patients receiving chiropractic care in those two regions are entitled to the same protection as those in the rest of Canada. We suggest that the Canadian chiropractic profession makes an in-depth analysis of this issue in or - der to ensure that patients in those regions are covered by the same standards of care than in the rest of Canada. Conclusion Chiropractic is a well-organized profession in Canada. In terms of informed consent, provincial and territorial regulations and profession-based standards ensure that chiropractic patients receive and understand all pertin-ent information related to their care. However little data exists on how chiropractors implement those procedures. Studies should be conducted to measure the compliance of chiropractors to informed consent standards. References: 1.

Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this manuscript.There was no financial support provided for this document.Objective: To report on a case of a pathological burst fracture in the cervical spine where typical core red flag tests failed to identify a significant lesion, and to remind chiropractors to be vigilant in the recognition of subtle signs and symptoms of disease processes. Clinical Features: A 61-year-old man presented to a chiropractic clinic with neck pain that began earlier that morning. After a physical exam that was relatively unremarkable, imaging identified a burst fracture in the cervical spine. Intervention & Outcomes: The patient was sent by ambulance to the hospital wher e he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. No medical intervention was performed on the fracture. Summary: The patient' s initial physical examination was largely unremarkable, with an absence of clinical red flags. The screening tools were non-diagnostic.

This identified a pathological burst fracture in the C4 vertebrae. (JCCA. 2016;60(1):81-87) key words: chiropractic, burst fracture, red flags Introduction Chiropractors are manual therapists trained in the diag-nosis and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. In or - der to elicit an appropriate diagnosis, chiropractors rely heavily on the history the patient provides. This includes the mechanism of injury, temporal onset, aggravating and relieving factors, and psychosocial influences. The pres-ence of serious pathology includes, but is not limited to: (1) pain that is worse during rest versus activity, (2) pain that is worsened at night or not relieved by any position, (3) a poor response to conservative care including a lack of pain relief with prescribed bed rest, or (4) poor success with comparable treatments. 1 It is well documented2,3 that in chronic conditions patient self-reporting is accurate, as care is a habitual part of their daily lives. The history ac-counts for 82% of the diagnosis, with the physical exam used to help verify the anticipated diagnosis. 3 A physical exam that follows an adequate history is usually confirm-atory rather than exploratory. 4 Specific historical considerations should include the patient's history, the report of the present complaint, and additional work-up such as imaging and blood work. 1 When the physical exam does not confirm the suspected diagnosis, further investigation is required. For chiroprac - tors, radiological plain film imaging is used to assess bone health and to screen for underlying pathology. If there is any indication for further work-up, such as blood work or advanced imaging, inter-professional collaboration with other health care professionals is crucial. The objective of this case report is two-fold. The first is to highlight the need to be vigilant in recognizing and responding to subtle signs and symptoms of disease pro-cesses. The second is to remind clinicians to rely on all of their assessment tools, including radiographic imaging, if orthopaedic tests are of limited value. Case Presentation A 61-year-old retired male presented to a chiropractic clinic in the mid-morning, complaining of dull, achy cer - vicothoracic discomfort in the left upper scapular area. He came to the clinic wearing a soft cervical collar. The pain began early that morning when the patient sat up in bed from a supine position, turned to step out and heard what he described as a \"crunch-like\" sound. There was an immediate reaction including sweating and dizziness, lasting five minutes. Slight pain relief was achieved by taking two Tylenol 3s and pressing his occiput against the edge of the bed. The patient described an inability to find a comfortable position for his neck, and rated his pain at 7/10 on the V AS that was constant. Coughing aggravated the pain in the mid-cervical spine. Slight weakness was reported when picking up a glass of water with his left hand; however, this was not consistent throughout the morning. Otherwise, there were no neurological symp-toms described in the upper limb, lower limb, or cranium. His past health history was unremarkable. The patient described having a cold for approximately three weeks in advance of the date of presentation, but felt well on that day. Approximately fifteen years previously, he had a mole removed from his nose that was determined to be pre-cancerous. The patient had an active lifestyle includ - ing a healthy diet, regular exercise, no smoking, and so-cial alcohol consumption. He was pre-diabetic and over - weight. This was his first chiropractic visit. A post-history differential list included compression fracture, grade two mechanical neck pain, and strain of d\u00e9pistage n'ont pas pu diagnostiquer. La douleur Klein the cervicothoracic musculature. Prior to the physical examination, the patient removed the collar himself and went through active ranges of motion that was painless with only a mild limitation at end range globally. A full neurological examination of the upper and lower limb was intact, and bilaterally symmetrical. Plantar reflexes were down going, and Hoffman's test was negative. Valsalva and spinal percussion tests were negative. There was mild muscle spasm in the trapezius and cervical paraspinals bi-laterally. Axial compression of 2-3 lbs of pressure did not contribute to or alleviate his symptoms. Cervical traction was painful. The examination was tiring for the patient, however, no motor weakness was found. The physical exam was unable to rule out compression fracture. The patient replaced his collar and was sent for cer - vical spine films to a chiropractic radiologist. While the anterior-posterior open mouth image (Figure 1) was read as normal except for general osteopenia, a burst fracture of C4 vertebrae was visualized on the remaining images (Figures 2 & 3). The chiropractic radiologist conferred with the referring chiropractor, and emergency measures were taken including re-collaring the patient and having him transferred by ambulance to the hospi-tal. The chiropractic radiologist then con-ferred with the radiologist at the hospital and was able to provide collaborated evalu - ation. Following advanced imaging it was de- termined the patient had multiple myeloma in his cervical spine, thoracic spine and ribs. At the hospital he was put into a hard col-lar and developed hard radicular signs and pneumonia by nightfall. Due to the com-plexity of the lesion and the pneumonia, the burst vertebra was unable to be managed operatively at that time. Discussion This patient presented with acute neck pain without radiation after waking up that mor - ning. The physical exam was surprisingly non-conducive, given the diagnosis. The significant physical exam findings were in-creased pain with traction despite painless range of motion, negative spinous percus-sion test, and a normal neurological exam. It is pertinent to recognize there is limited strength in many of the tests that are presented, including differentiating a fracture of the cervical spine. Hof fman's sign is an indication of an upper motor neuron lesion. However, Hoffman's sign may be posi-tive in patients who have hyperthyroidism, anxiety, and patients who have had previous cervical spine surgery. 5 Further studies have indicated that Hoffman's sign, in absence of other clinical signs and indications, is not a reliable test 6, with a sensitivity range of 33-58% and a specificity of 59-78%7. Spinal percussion has no evi- dence for use in the cervical spine. In the lumbar spine, there are mixed reviews as to whether spinal percussion has diagnostic significance. In one study by Langdon in 2010, spinal percussion was found to be diagnostic for upper lumbar osteoporotic compression fractures with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 90%. 8 Another study, however, suggested spinal percussion may not be diagnostic as previously thought. 9 Downie et al.9 in 2013 found it is more likely that a fracture will be present if the patient is older than 65 years, has a history of prolonged corticosteroid use, had significant trauma or visible con- Figure 1.

Additional tests used in this case were valsalva, axial distraction, and axial compression. These tests are used primarily to differentiate radiculopathy from a cen-tral cord pressure (whether from space occupying lesion or disc herniation). The valsalva test has been found to have 22% sensitivity and 95% specificity. 7 Axial sensitivity, and specificity7, and axial compression has a sensitivity of 25-50% and a specificity Figure 2.

Overall, the tests applied in this case tend to have low sensitivity, and moderate to high specificity when testing for cord compression to the cervical spine. A burst fracture is a specific form of compression frac-ture that requires considerable forces of axial compres-sion and flexion in healthy bone. 11 Due to the amount of force required, a comminution of the vertebral body occurs with fragments migrating centrifugally. 11 Poster -Figure 3.

In some cases with variable history or unclear mech- anisms of injury, it is difficult to discern whether or not imaging is indicated for the patient. Screening tools and guidelines have been developed to determine whether or not radiographic imaging is required. The Canadian C-Spine Rules (CCSR) and the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Group (NEXUS) have been designed to help establish whether or not low-risk patients require cervical spine imaging. 12 The CCSR has been found to be superior to the NEXUS Guideline in a popu-lation of over 8000 patients. 13 It had a higher sensitivity and specificity, and only missed one patient when used by physicians compared to sixteen patients missed when using the NEXUS. The CCSR is an algorithm that asks three 'yes/no' questions (See Figure 4). One study indi-cated that doctors were able to effectively use this screen 83% of the time, and were able to reduce emergency room cervical spine imaging by 13% without adverse event. 13 Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common primary malignant spinal tumour in adults.14 It is twice as com- mon in males and typically onsets in the sixth decade.15 MM makes up 15-20% of all haematological cancers with an average 5-year survival rate of 15-20%. 16 The classic presentation of a patient with MM is severe bone pain that is aggravated by activity and relieved by rest, though according to one study, this is only seen in 67%. 17 Other symptoms, though less common, include dyspnea, fa-tigue, asthenia, and weight loss. 17 This patient's presenta- tion did not indicate how advanced the disease was. Blood work tends to have a serum M-protein spike of IgG, Bence Jones proteinuria, hypercalcemia and hyper - uricemia.18 On imaging, a classic case of multiple my- eloma would have multiple, permeative lesions, osteo-penia, and sharply circumscribed osteolytic defects. 11 In the spine, multiple myeloma will affect any region of the spine appearing as osteopenic vertebrae early in the pro-cess, with inevitable progression to pathological vertebral collapse. 11 Multiple myeloma can be identified from an insufficiency fracture by the loss of posterior vertebral body height. 11 The prognosis of MM was very poor ten Figure 4. The Canadian C-Spine Rules Algorithm (Stiell, 2009)13 years ago, with <10% surviving past 3 years11 however, recent advances have improved survival rates to a median value of 10 years 19. T wo additional case reports in the last decade describe the presence of cervical spine pathological burst fracture in a medical setting by specialists. 20,21 However, the au- thors of this paper believe the presented case to be the first description of an initial presentation of a pathological burst fracture to a primary-contact conservative care fa-cility. This should affect the decision making of all manu-al therapy practitioners when considering differentials of rare but serious pathology as they may not possess trad-itional history red flags, nor possible signs on examina - tion. Summary A 61-year-old male presented to a chiropractic clinic for management of acute neck pain. The history revealed a J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 87J Cox, C DeGraauw, E Klein 'crunch' sound when getting out of bed that morning. There were no red flags in the history. The physical exam identified traction was aggravating, but was otherwise non-conducive. This case should serve as a reminder that in some circumstances, orthopaedic tests may be of limited clinical value. Practitioners need to be diligent in their clinical assessment of patients to be aware of subtle signs of disease processes. It also serves as a reminder to clinicians that these rare cases do present to our offices and radiographic intervention is still the diagnostic tool of choice to confirm a pathological fracture diagnosis.

The current paucity of research results also precludes the thoughtful design of a controlled, prospective clinical study. Hence, the purpose of the current study was to test the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of the acute effects of spinal manipulation on visual acuity. Methods: New adult patients presenting to a community based chiropractic clinic were recruited into a single cohort prospective trial to determine the immediate effects of cervical spinal manipulation on visual acuity. Results: The experimental protocol was well accepted by patients and caused minimal or no disruption of the clinic routine. By some measures, chiropractic treatment was accompanied by statistically significant improvements in visual acuity. Introduction : Il n'y a pas de pr euves sur l'acuit\u00e9 De nouveaux bien par les patients et n'a pas du tout perturb\u00e9 la routine de la certaines The results of this study indicate that it is quite feasible to conduct a prospective, community based clinical study of the acute effects of spinal manipulation on visual acuity. (JCCA. 2016;60(1):88-92) key words: chiropractic; feasibility; r\u00e9sultats de cette \u00e9tude montrent qu'il est tout de une communaut\u00e9 une \u00e9tude clinique prospective case studies have reported instan-ces of visual disorders which apparently commenced at the time of a spinal injury and/or were relieved following manual treatment of a spinal disorder. The particular dis-orders have been diverse and include glaucoma or other - wise restricted visual fields 1-8, scotoma9,10, diminished vis- ual acuity6,11 and diplopia12. In some instances it is unclear whether recovery was promoted by or merely coincident with treatment. In other cases, the temporality of events strongly suggests that the treatment contributed to relief of the visual complaint. 1,2,5,8,12 Nonetheless, it is uncertain whether the lessons learned from these interesting cases are generalizable to the wider population. Are respond-ers to spinal manipulation highly prevalent in the general population or are they quite rare? The generalizability of treatment effects is best de- termined by prospective studies employing relatively large sample sizes. 13 To date, there has been only one prospective cohort study examining the effects of spin-al manipulation on visual acuity. 14 While that study did report some improvement with spinal manipulation, the outcome measure which the authors used was novel and did not take into account the logarithmic scaling of the Snellen eye chart used to measure acuity. Additionally, there was no statistical correction for the multiple com-parisons that the authors used, and there was no control cohort. Thus, to date, there is little clinical evidence on which to advocate the consideration of spinal manipula - tion as an intervention in patients with visual disorders. The most convincing primary research design in sup- port of a therapeutic intervention is, of course, a random-ized controlled trial. Randomization to treatment and control cohorts substantially reduces the influence of bias, and corrects for non-specific effects and natural variabil - ity. 13,15 However, randomized controlled clinical trials are complex to manage and expensive to conduct. It would be challenging to justify this expense on the basis of the meager clinical evidence currently available, and without estimates of treatment effects it would be difficult to de-termine appropriate cohort sizes. 16 Hence, the purpose of the current study was to test the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of the acute effects of spinal manipulation on visual acuity, to obtain estimates of treatment effect size, and to determine the effects of small changes in methods of data analysis. MethodsPatient recruitment This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College. Between September 2012 and February 2013, consecutive new pa-tients presenting to a community based chiropractic clinic in Toronto, Canada were recruited by the clinic reception - ist into a single cohort prospective trial to determine the immediate effects of cervical spinal manipulation on vis-ual acuity. Patients were required to be 18 years of age or older, and to have not received cervical spinal manipula - tion in the previous 3 months. Patients with frank eye dis-ease, other than diminished visual acuity, were excluded. No other exclusion criteria were applied. Twenty-three patients who elected to participate in the study provided written informed consent. Experimental procedure Immediately prior to chiropractic examination and treat-ment, visual acuity was assessed by one of two investiga -90 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)A single cohort prospective trial of the immediate effects of spinal manipulation on visual acuity tors, both chiropractic interns, using a Snellen eye chart. Patients were requested to remove eye glasses before test-ing, and to stand 20 feet away from a wall-mounted eye chart. With one eye covered, they were then instructed to read the letters on the Snellen chart beginning from the top and largest letter and proceeding to the smallest line they could read. This process was then repeated for the other eye. The visual acuity and Snellen line values for each eye were recorded as the smallest line for which more than half of the letters were read correctly. Patients were then escorted to the treatment room where they received chiropractic treatment according to their individualized treatment plans and including, but not limited to, cervical spinal manipulation. The treating doctor was unaware of the results of the visual exam. Im-mediately following treatment, visual acuity was meas-ured again and the patients were released. Data analysis Two analyses of the data were performed. First, visual acuity scores for the left and right eyes prior to and fol-lowing treatment, were compared using the paired, two-tailed t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test, where a p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically sig-nificant. Subsequently, data for patients with an initial Snellen fraction of 20/20 or better were deleted, and the remaining pooled data for the two eyes were compared, pre- and post-treatment, with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Cohen's d was calculated as a measure of treatment effect size. Results Within the recruitment period, 23 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. There were no drop-outs. The process of vision testing apparently caused minimal or no disruption of the normal clinic routine and was well accepted by patients. In this study, there was no attempt to record adverse events, and none were spontaneously reported by patients. The subjects consisted of 6 males and 17 females aged 22- to 71-years old (mean 43 years, S.D. 17 years). Thirteen subjects routinely wore eyeglass-es which were removed prior to testing. One subject wore contact lenses which were not removed. Fifteen of the subjects were na\u00efve to spinal manipulation. Raw visual acuity data are attached as supplementary file #1.

For the (3.) pooled results of right and left eyes with pre-treatment EDTRS score of 80 or less, data were analyzed only with the Wilcoxon signed rank Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) scores. There were no statistically significant changes in any measure of visual acuity in the left eye using either the paired, two-tailed t-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test (Cohen's d = -0.10). For the right eye, there were statis-tically significant changes in the Snellen line score and the ETDRS score (Cohen's d = 0.21), but not in the Snel-len fraction score. When data were removed for eyes with an initial Snel- len fraction score of 20/20 or better, and the remaining data for the 2 eyes were pooled ('Pooled results,' Table 1), there was a significant improvement (p=0.018 per Wilcoxon signed rank test) in visual acuity for the ET - DRS score (Cohen's d = 0.11). There were insufficient remaining data for separate statistical analyses of the left and right eyes. Discussion This study measured immediate changes in visual acuity following chiropractic treatment which included cervic - al manipulation. Perhaps due to the convenience of the testing process and the fact that pre- and post-treatment measures were taken in a single visit, there were no drop-outs and no incomplete data sets. By some measures, with the caveats discussed below, there were immediate improvements in visual acuity following treatment. A number of previous studies of spinal manipulation and visual acuity have employed eye charts as evaluation tools. 6,11,14 However, caution must be exercised when in- terpreting the data.17 The Snellen fraction represents acu- ity based on the distance at which the subject can resolve a symbol. On the other hand, the physiological basis for acuity is the ability to resolve two points within the visual field (or more precisely on the spherically shaped retina) and hence could more properly be described in terms of angles rather than distance. Thus, Snellen fractions and line scores are logarithmic and cannot be directly inter - preted using conventional statistical methods, so that our apparent finding of an improvement in Snellen line score for the right eye (Table 1) is in fact spurious. The same considerations would affect the conclusions of the previ-ous study by Kessinger and Boneva 14 and those case stud- ies which reported raw eye chart data. In order to apply conventional statistical analyses, such as a t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test, Snellen data must first be converted to values on a scale which reflects the arc subtended by a line joining two points in the visual field. One such scale is the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. 18 In the current study, when Snellen data were converted to ET - DRS scores, there remained a convincing improvement in visual acuity in the right eye according to the paired, two-tailed t-test (p=0.005) or the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p=0.013). Based on a Cohen's d = 0.21, this would be considered a small effect. Given the small number of subjects in this pilot study, it is not possible to determine whether or not the data were truly normally distributed, and so the Wilcoxon test, which is more parsimonious, provides a more rigorous test of statistical significance. Analyzing the data from the two eyes separately is also appealing in terms of statistical rigour, as it allows for a laterality to the clinical phenomena. This would occur in the unlikely event that all left eyes were, on average, inherently different in some regard from right eyes. Ana-lyzing the eyes separately also allows for the less unlikely possibility that eyes respond differently to contralateral versus ipsilateral adjustment and the clinician had a bias (in the scientific sense) for adjusting on one side versus the other. In our second statistical analysis, we pooled data for the two eyes as if the response of one eye would be in-dependent of the response of its contralateral mate. This may or may not be true in any given patient depending in part upon the cause of their visual deficit. It may, nonethe - less, be the preferred practical approach since in everyday life functional visual acuity is essentially determined by the acuity of the 'best' eye. 19 In the second analysis, we used only ETDRS values, and we removed data for eyes with an initial Snellen fraction of 20/20 or better. This step was taken in order to minimize any 'ceiling effect' - if visual acuity was already very good, then there would not be much room for it to improve following any treat - ment. This selective removal of data necessarily creates a non-Gaussian distribution which requires non-parametric analysis - the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The analysis was based on 30 eyes with pre-treatment ETDRS scores (mean + S.D.) of 62 + 16 and post-treatment scores of 64 + 18. Thus in our second analysis, which we believe to be both more rigorous and realistic, treatment was associated with a statistically significant improvement in visual acu-ity (p=0.024) which was quite small in terms of treatment effect size (Cohen's d =0.11).92 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)A single cohort prospective trial of the immediate effects of spinal manipulation on visual acuity Conclusions In summary, this study suggests that it is feasible to measure acute responses to chiropractic treatment in a community-based clinic. Furthermore, a small but statis-tically significant treatment effect may be achieved with a relatively small number of subjects. In this instance, the treatment effect was quite small, and is of uncertain clin - ical significance. These results do not speak to long term effects. Additionally, there was no control group in this study and so it is not possible to determine the contribu - tion of a non-specific treatment effect. Overall, however, given the promising pilot data, it would appear reason-able to conduct a larger controlled study of the effects of spinal manipulation on visual acuity and to anticipate convincing acute results, either negative or positive, with a manageable number of subjects. The outcome measure should be a linear measure of visual acuity, such as the ETDRS score, and consideration should be given to the influence of a ceiling effect and to the appropriateness of a non-parametric statistical analysis.

We developed and tested the feasibility of using software to enable online collection of patient data within a chiropractic PBRN to support clinical decision making and research in participating clinics. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of using online software to collect quality patient information. Methods: The study consisted of two phases: 1) Assessment of the quality of information provided, using a standardized form; and 2) Exploration of patients' perspectives and experiences regarding online information provision through semi-structured interviews.

Thirty-six completed online forms, which were submitted by an appropriate person 100% of the time, with an error rate of less than 1%, and submitted in a timely manner 83% of the time. Twenty-one participants were interviewed. Overall, online forms were preferred given perceived security, ease of use, and enabling provision of more accurate information. Conclusions: Use of online software is feasible, provides high quality information, and is preferred by most participants. A pen-and-paper format should be available for patients with this preference and in case of technical difficulties. (JCCA. 2016;60(1):93-105) key words: chiropractic, practice-based research network, feasibility, upper cervical Introduction Chiropractors are regulated health professionals in Canada with expertise in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of dysfunctions in the structures or functions of the spine, nervous system, and joints. 1 Chiropractors are increasingly playing an important role in the health of Canadians as primary health care providers and are accessed by approximately 11% of the Canadian popu-lation annually. 2 As such, provision of evidence based care is of great importance. Practice based research net-works (PBRNs) are increasingly recognized as a useful approach in promoting health care quality 3-5 and enabling an evidence-based approach within clinical settings. A PBRN is a group of independent health care clin - icians providing care in community settings that are net-worked for the purpose of examining and evaluating the health care processes and outcomes that occur within these clinics. 5-7 A PBRN therefore provides a \"real world\" setting where patients are the study participants, patient outcomes are directly applicable to patient concerns and can be explored and/or measured within the context of their lived experiences. The development of the one chiropractic PBRN in Canada was initiated in 2009. Founded by two chiro-practors, JS and MR (co-authors) based in Alberta and Quebec, respectively, its primary purpose is to facilitate evidence-based practice within participating clinics. The patient information collected through the PBRN will be used to inform clinical decision-making and conduct practice-based research. To date, several clinics have ex-pressed interest in joining the PBRN, indicating its sig-nificant potential to collect large amounts of data and create an evidence base directly from practices where it would then be applied. In order to produce meaningful and useful results, a PBRN requires several key components, including but not limited to: data collection, analysis and management infrastructure; membership of clinics or practices; com-munication strategies; support staff; and, establishment of collaborative relations between practitioners and re-searchers. 5,8-10 One of the first steps in establishing this PBRN has been the development and testing of a custom-ized online data collection software to facilitate system-atic collection of patient information that is effectively R\u00e9sultats : Quarante-cinq nouveaux patients comp\u00e9tente % du temps), avec un taux d'erreur de moins de 1 %, et soumis dans les d\u00e9lais (83 % du temps).

Un stylo et une feuille de papier doivent \u00eatre mis disposition des patients qui pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent cette forme d'interaction ou en J Scholten, et al streamlined into clinical operations. It therefore allows data collected to simultaneously inform clinical deci - sion-making as well as specific analyses aimed at gener - ating a higher level evaluation of clinical outcomes of a practice or group of practices. Electronic methods of collecting and storing patient data/information are applied in and recommended spe-cifically for PBRNs 11-13 and are increasingly widespread within the health care system14-17. Several advantages of electronic data collection are reported in the literature, such as improved data quality, convenience of data col-lection, potential real time data collection, efficiency of data entry, and expedient transmission and/or access to data across multiple sites. 4,11,13,14,18 Further, the equiva- lence of computer and pen-and-paper administration of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures has also been demonstrated in context of clinical trials. 17,19,20 Despite the advantages, there are also potential negative impacts of computerization on data quality. For example, small de-vices may result in the data entry process being slow. 14 There is also potential for measurement error due to fac-tors such poor visibility due to screen size or low contrast, not scrolling down and missing questions, and fast read-ing or scanning more likely used by internet users . 14,18 Technical challenges may also impede data collection or analysis processes. 4,11 While research supports the potential usefulness of using electronic devices for data collection, we deter - mined it necessary to assess the quality of the patient in-formation collected with the online software as it was cus-tom built specifically for this PBRN. Information quality is a multi-dimensional construct and directly related to the perceived utility of information for the intended users and for their intended purposes. 14,21 Those aspects of in- formation quality that relate to how the data collection software was coded (i.e., comprehensive, relevant, se-cure, accessible, reliable, valid and value-added) 22 were accounted for during software development; what has not been determined is whether those aspects of information quality that relate to how information is provided by pa-tients using the software (i.e., complete, timely, provided by an appropriate source and free of error) 22 are sufficient. As such, for clinical and research purposes, there was a need to assess whether it is feasible to use the online soft-ware to collect data that is complete, timely, provided by an appropriate source and error free. Another important aspect that also requires consider - ation is the patient perspective, specifically, whether pa-tients perceive provision of their own health and personal information through the online software to be appropriate and acceptable. Clinicians and researchers generally per - ceive electronic modes of data collection as an enabler of PBRN activity 3,4,23, yet there is limited evidence on this issue from the perspective of the patient in the context of PBRNs. While studies in the broader health context suggest that patients are satisfied with an internet-based approach and find it acceptable in completing self-report questionnaires using electronic or online devices 18,24,25, given broader concerns regarding internet security, the accuracy of the information provided is unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using the online software to collect patient information for clinical decision-making and practice-based research. The objectives were to: 1) Assess whether information provided by new pa- tients of a PBRN clinic using the online data collec - tion software is timely, provided by an appropriate source, and free of error. 2) Explore and describe experiences and perspectives of new patients of a PBRN clinic using the online data collection software to provide their health in-formation. Methods Study design We conducted a descriptive feasibility study consisting of two phases. In Phase 1, we aimed to assess in a standard-ized manner the quality of information provided using the online software. In Phase 2 we aimed to qualitatively de-scribe the perspectives and experiences of patients regard-ing provision of personal and health information through the online software. Ethics approval was obtained from the Conjoint Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary (Ethics ID: E24885). Setting The study was conducted at one clinic (study site), which is also a launch sites for the PBRN. The study site is a pri-vate clinic in Calgary AB, with a team of three chiroprac - tors supported by an administrative team of five - practic assistants.96 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Evaluating the feasibility of using online software to collect patient information in a chiropractic practice-based research network The online software The online software was created by a professional de-veloper based in Quebec, Canada, using Wordpress (ver - sion 4.2.4) and Gravity Forms (version 1.9). The software functionality, layout, and content was developed in con-sultation with MR and JS. Two versions of the software were beta tested internally within the private practices of the PBRN founders prior to this study to assess applic - ability within the practices. The software programming allows for secure collection of demographic, health hist-ory, and initial assessment information (i.e. primary com-plaints, symptoms). There is also built in functionality that allows for the administration of PRO measures, en-abling prospective collection of treatment outcomes data. The security of the website is based on password protec - tion for the interface and database and includes HTTPS protocol with encryption. The content was developed by completing a critical review of the type of information, forms, and question-naires used in the two clinics. Patient charts were audited to identify response categories to certain questions (for example, reason for seeking care). Through an iterative process engaging the developers, clinicians, and admin - istrative staff, information relevant to practice and useful outcomes measures were determined for inclusion. A list of the forms included in the online software is provided in Table 1. Table 1. Forms and questionnaires collected using the online software Personal information questionnaire (ex. Name, address) General health history questionnaire (current and past) Specific health history OPQRST (onset, provocation, quality, radiation, severity and time) - neck, headaches, hips, jaw, lower extremities, low back shoulders, mid-back, upper extremities RAND SF-36 Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire Neck Disability Index Recruitment Using a convenience sampling strategy, all new patients were approached regarding study participation over five consecutive months (Dec 2013 to May 2014). In Phase 1, our recruitment strategy targeted new patients who used the online forms, were 18 years of age or older, and com-pleted the full initial 8-week course of care. In Phase 2, we expanded our inclusion criteria to also include new patients who completed paper forms. Data collection and analysis - Phase 1 Data collection for the study was integrated into the es-tablished treatment protocol for new patients and clin-ical data collection time points. The treatment protocol for new patients involves an initial assessment followed by 10 clinic visits over an eight-week period. Baseline data are collected prior to the first visit and follow up data (outcomes measures only) are collected prior to visit 2, 4 and 10 (see Figure 1). For each study participant, research data was gathered at these 4 time points. As such, there were a total of 144 time points when information was sub-mitted by all participants. Patients who opted to complete their forms using the pen-and-paper method did so at the office prior to their consultations. Patients who chose to complete their forms online were requested by office administrative staff to do so before a visit (up to 24 hours prior). Administrative staff provided written instructions as to where the online forms could be accessed (website) and how to set up a user account to login. Brief verbal communication was used to provide additional information or answer patients' questions. Patients could use a personal computer device of their choice to access the online forms (e.g. home/work desk top, laptop, tablet etc.). Although preference was for patients to complete the online forms prior to arriving at the office, for those who did not, a tablet with access to the forms was available at the office. Patients did not receive any training to use the online forms. It was determined training was not necessary for several reasons. First, the content of the on-line forms was based on information previously collected successfully using paper forms. As such the comprehension level was considered acceptable. Further, the forms were based on a basic format of clicking with a mouse to select the most suitable response to a given question. As such, the level of computer literacy was minimal and not beyond what the average user would need to use email. W e assessed three aspects of information quality for data collected using the online forms: timeliness, provi-sion by an appropriate source, and whether it was error J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 97A Kania-Richmond, L Weeks, J Scholten, et al free. We initially included completeness as a fourth criter - ion; however, as all of the fields in the online form were programmed to be required, assessment of this aspect was not useful. We did not assess information quality for the pen-and-paper forms, as our goal was not to compare information quality across the two methods, but rather asses the quality of information using the online method, in line with the intentions for the PBRN. Timeliness and whether the information source was appropriate (i.e. was the patient the source?) were assessed by administrative staff before a patient visit. Identification of any errors was completed by a treating clinician during the patient visit, by asking the patient random questions to deter - mine whether there were any discrepancies or mistakes between what was indicated on the forms and what the patient reported during the office visit.

Data analysis was descrip-tive, reporting on the means and ranges, as indicated. Data collection and analysis - Phase 2 In the second phase, we iteratively conducted and ana-lyzed semi-structured telephone interviews with the goal to explore patients' perceptions and experiences of pro-viding personal and health information using the online software. In the sample of patients who agreed to study participation, we aimed for a purposive sample with max-imum variation in characteristics related to user experi-ences with the software (to include those who did and did not use the software), internet use, and with a range in age, sex and conditions or symptoms for which treat - ment was being sought. Each was contacted up to three times by the researcher conducting the interviews (AKR) to schedule a telephone interview.

For people who completed the forms online, we asked whether they experienced any difficulty, whether they perceived instructions and questions as clear, and what people liked and did not like about completing the forms online. For people who did not complete the forms online, we asked about their reasons and/or preferences for using paper forms and what, if anything, would make them comfortable to use online forms. Interviews lasted between 5 to 15 minutes, and were digitally recorded with participant consent. A descriptive content analysis approach was used to analyze the interview data. This involved independent reading of interview transcripts by two researchers (LW and AKR) and initiating coding with a pre-conceptualized list of topics derived from the study objective. Through an iterative process, transcripts were read and re-read, and categories emerged that captured issues, concerns, suggestions and experiences of the participants.

RESULTS During the recruitment period, 161 new patients were registered at the clinic. Online forms were selected by 137 patients and 101 of these patients completed the initial 8-weeks of care. Pen-and-paper forms were selected by 24 patients, 17 of whom completed the initial 8-weeks of care. Of all new patients who completed the full course of initial care (n=118), 45 consented to participate in the study (overall response rate: 38%). Twenty-eight (62%) of the participants were female. The age range was be-tween 19 and 85 years, with an average age of 42 years for female and 49 years for male participants. Participants were receiving care to address various health related issues, including but not limited to: headaches, jaw pain or dysfunction, neck pain and stiffness, low back pain. Descriptive characteristics of participants are presented in Table 2. Of the 45 participants, 36 selected to completed the on- line forms and agreed to study participation (Phase 1 and Phase 2). Nine completed the pen-and-paper forms and agreed to study participation (Phase 2 only). Phase I The following provides a descriptive summary of the quality of information collected online from 36 partici - pants who completed the online forms. Appropriateness Information was submitted online by an appropriate source-the patient who was capable of providing such in-formation 100% of the time. Free of error A total of 18 errors were identified, which results in an error rate of less than 1% (each participant answered 144 questions during the four data collection points). Three errors were specific to patient's personal information (e.g. birth date, address). Five errors were identified specific Table 2.

Ten errors were identified in PROs. Clarification comments by the assessing clinician indicate that errors resulted from unintentional mistakes or omissions made by the participant during entry. Timeliness Timely submission of online forms occurred 83% of the time. Of the 36 participants, 16 submitted forms late 25 times (17%). Late submissions were highest (10 partici - pants) at visit 5, midway through the 8-week treatment protocol. For the other three data collection time points, forms were submitted late by five participants. Of the 16 participants, 11 did not complete the forms in a timely fashion once and one participant was late every time. Phase 2 The following describes the main themes that emerged through the qualitative analysis of the semi-structured interviews with 21 participants; 17 used the online forms and four used paper forms. A summary of the qualitative findings is provided in Table 3. Preference for online forms Most participants interviewed expressed a preference for the online format. Reasons provided included being able to complete the forms on their own time and not wasting time at their appointment filling out forms. Participants also note that this was conducive to providing more reli-able responses as at home they had access to information such as medications, contact details for other health care providers, and medical reports. Interestingly, of the four participants who used paper forms, two also expressed a preference for the online format but experienced technical difficulties (i.e. inability to login for access) that precluded them from completing the forms online.

Comfort providing information online With few exceptions, all who completed the forms online were comfortable providing the information requested through the online format. Most felt the information re-quested was not of a sensitive nature. Information that was identified as sensitive and would not be provided on-line included: social insurance number, banking informa-tion, and health conditions considered to be highly sensi-tive (mental health, cancer). The context for questions appeared to guide most participants' overall comfort in providing personal information online. If the request for information appears relevant to the situation (e.g. receiv - ing chiropractic care), most stated they would not hesitate to provide that information. Participants' overall comfort levels with the online forms was reinforced by their trust in the clinic and perceived security of the website (pass-word protected access) where the online forms were ac-cessed. Lastly, several participants commented that their comfort with using the online forms was linked to an overall preference for using the internet for conducting various types of personal activities online such as banking and shopping. Understanding and Ease of Completion All participants described the process as easy and straight - forward. Most described the questions and instructions as clear and easy to understand and were satisfied with the format and layout. The forms took between five and 30 minutes to complete, which everyone felt was an appro-priate duration. The first time completing the forms took the longest, but once familiar with the process of complet - ing the forms, subsequent times were faster. Two partici - pants expressed discontent with the volume of forms and information requested. The majority also identified no difficulty with access- ing the forms or transitioning between web pages and forms. However, a few problems in completing the online forms were identified. Three participants were unable to access specific forms due to technical difficulties (with the forms or the browser used), which elicited frustration. Specific to the forms, the issues appeared to be related to question and answer formats rather than the online process itself. A key issues perceived by participants as a problem was the lack of fit between questions and/or re-sponse options and participants' situation in standardized questionnaires or patient reported outcomes (PROs). The challenge in answering the questions was exacerbated by the fact that a response was required due to all being set as mandatory fields. As such these participants felt they had to make a response selection even if they perceived it to be inaccurate. One participant found the lack of ability to access previous questionnaires problematic. Suggestions for Change Overall, participants reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with their experience of completing the online forms; however, a few suggestions or recommendations to further improve online data collection were provided. The most frequent suggestions related to enabling an in-dividualized response through a text or comment box. Other suggestions included: ensure requested forms be-ing completed are relevant to the patient; allow access to the next form without having to return to the home page; and provision of a statement on the home page to describe the security features of the website and forms, and who is able to access the information. Discussion In this study we aimed to assess the feasibility of using an online software developed for the purpose of collecting patient health and personal information to support the clinical and research activities of a chiropractic PBRN. We sought to assess the quality of information collected using this online software and to investigate patients' ex-perience and perceptions of the online forms and provi-sion of personal and health through an online format. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to report on patient perspectives regarding online data collection in the context of a PBRN. Overall, the information provided using the online forms was assessed to be provided in a timely manner, submitted by an appropriate individual (representative of the patient) and the error rate was low. The accuracy of information provided was considered acceptable for the purposes of research and clinical decision-making. Al-though relatively infrequent, potential sources and types of errors require attention. Anticipating errors and incor -J Can al porating processes that will allow for cross-referencing of the information provided online to ensure accuracy is recommended. From the patient perspective, an important factor im- pacting the accuracy of information provided was linked to the restricted fields in the questionnaires and PROs. Al-though this approach was used to prevent occurrence of missing data, this forced a response choice even if none of the options were suitable. The perception that less ac-curate information was provided was also linked to the difficulty of personalizing responses and providing addi-tional information that may better capture the individual's situation or context within the structure of standardized questionnaires. It is important to stress that the potential for less accurate information is related to the standardized nature of the questionnaires rather than the online format. Yet, the results of our assessment resulted in recogni - tion that other response options need to be incorporated into the online forms, for example a \"not applicable\" or \"other\" option. Our findings of a clear preference for online forms by most patients are supported by results of prior stud-ies reporting on patient preferences for online or elec-tronic methods for providing information in the con-text of health care. For example, Richter et al. (2008) 26 report that 62.1% of study participants who completed self-administered questionnaires as part of routine patient management expressed preference for remote data entry, using devices such as PC or MAC, tablet PCs, and smart phones. Similarly, in assessing the acceptability, feasibil-ity, reliability and score agreement of PROs using a touch screen computer system, Salaffi et al (2009) 27 found that the majority of study subjects (86%) expressed preference for the computer format compared to the pen-and-paper format. However, as patients' continue to adapt to online functions and processes for providing their personal in-formation online, due diligence in developing and man-aging online or web-based methods of collecting such data in the health care context to ensure the security of the information and safety of the person is protected is imperative. This study was an important experience that benefited the clinicians, founders of the PBRN, and administrative staff, as it was their first direct involvement in research within this PBRN. Engagement of the clinical and admin - istrative staff resulted in a better understanding of expect -ations related to the PBRN. A number of discussions took place, formally and informally, working out how to inte-grate research processes into established procedures and routines at the clinic. There are limitations of this study that require con- sideration in the interpretation of the results. We did not gather data on previous computer experience, computer skills, education or vocation, although such data may be informative to our understanding of how the online forms and software were used and perceived. Another potential limitation is the relatively low response rate to the study (38%). We did not gather data to determine reasons why patients declined participation, however, this is some-thing useful to explore in the context of the developing PBRN where research recruitment will be important. The number of participants interviewed who opted to com-plete paper forms was low (n=4). Although the number of patients eligible for the study who opted to use paper forms was low (14%), it is difficult to ascertain if a greater number of interviews with these patients may have pro-vided additional insights regarding a preference (or lack thereof) for paper forms and their potential consideration as a data collection method for the PBRN. Conclusion In conclusion, the online software tested is feasible for collecting quality information from patients for the pur - poses of the PBRN. The findings also indicate that the collection of personal and health information using this software is the preferred approach and considered to be appropriate from the patient perspective. However, the pen-and-paper method should remain as a possible option to accommodate for patient preference and to ensure for timely data collection when technical issues arise.

Among them was Dr. Allan Gotlib, who was subsequently installed as a Member of the Order of Canada, in recognition of his contributions to advancing research in the chiropractic profession and its inter-professional integration. This paper attempts an objective view of his career, to substantiate the accomplishments that led to Dr. Gotlib receiving Canada' s highest civilian honour. (JCCA. 2016;60(1):106-122) key words: chiropractic, history, Allan GotlibLe 29 juin 2012, Son Excellence le tr\u00e8s honorable David Johnston, gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, a annonc\u00e9 70 nouvelles nominations \u00e0 l'Ordre du Canada. Parmi eux, Dr Gotlib qui a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 membre de l'Ordre du Canada en reconnaissance de sa contribution au d\u00e9veloppement des recherches dans la profession chiropratique et de sa grande collaboration interprofessionnelle. Cet article essaie de pr\u00e9senter une vue objective de sa carri\u00e8re et d'\u00e9tayer les r\u00e9alisations qui ont permis \u00e0 Dr Gotlib de m\u00e9riter la plus haute distinction Gotlib ScholasticsAllan Gotlib was born October 5, 1949, in Toronto, ON. He attended Wilmington Avenue Public School, Dufferin Heights Junior High School and obtained a Senior Ma-triculation diploma from William Lyon MacKenzie Col-legiate Institute, before entering the University of Toronto (U of T) Scarborough Campus and earning an Honours Bachelor of Science degree (BSc) in 1972. Allan's family wanted him to be a dentist or medical doctor. Allan de-sired neither so approached Queens University's Faculty of Medicine, knowing it only accepted 35 students and as a B+ applicant he would not be chosen. Then he ap-plied to the U of T Faculty of Dentistry where one of the admission tests was to carve a piece of chalk to certain J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 107DM Brown specifications. Allan deliberately broke his chalk in half, ensuring he would fail to qualify. Gotlib' s parents had close friends whose son, Mar - shall Ross, was in his senior year at the Canadian Me-morial Chiropractic College (CMCC). Marshall gave Al-lan a tour of CMCC and he was accepted for the Septem-ber 1972 class without being interviewed. On opening day, Allan was pleased to see Irving Pisarek and Charles Goldman, two friends from his studies at high school, in the freshman class. Allan had a number of univer - sity credits and a lot of spare periods. He sat at the back of the room and dozed, but maintained a B+ average. By his junior year, he and Rena, nee Eisenberg, whom he had married in August that first year, began raising their family in a small, one bedroom apartment on Bath-urst Street, where the parents slept on the floor. In due course, Rena and Allan produced three bright, well-edu-cated offspring: two daughters and a son; Erin, Lesley and Stephen. Professional Practice and Pedagogy Graduating in May 1976, Dr. Gotlib attempted twice to join with other chiropractors before opening his own of- fice in 1980, on Mount Pleasant Road at Eglinton Avenue. Here he stayed until 1985 when he joined a busy, multi-disciplinary clinic in Thornhill. This 8,000 sq ft facility accommodated six partners, 10 associates and 30,000 patient files. In 1997 Gotlib left this location and retired from private practise. [Interview, Gotlib by the author, Feb 21, 2012] In 1977, Terry Watkins (CMCC 1969) hired Allan as a College tutor in technique. Two years later he was a clinical supervisor, spending a lot of hours with Zoltan Szaraz (CMCC 1974). Over the next decade he rose to the level of Associate Clinical Professor and his duties were limited to clinical research. By1997, Dr. Gotlib was list- Figure 1.

The \"official\" Journal, edited by Donald Sutherland (CMCC 1950), commenced in 1957. It was a vehicle for transmitting current events throughout the land along with voluminous documen - tation regarding the \"Decade of Royal Commissions,\" which occurred in the 1960s and 70s. 2 In 1980 the CCA formed a Publications Committee headed by Dr. Watkins to revamp the JCCA. Its primary goal was to have the Journal accepted as part of the international indexing system. With that in mind, Allan Gotlib was picked as Associate Editor, Scientific Af-fairs. 3 Dr. Gotlib had been connected to the JCCA since 1979. By 1981 it had started to mature into the \"peer reviewed, quarterly research publication of the CCA,\" although when Gotlib became Chief Editor in 1984, in some respects it could be described as a profession-al trade magazine. Allan was innovative. Choosing the five leading medical journals (British Medical Journal, The Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Associ-ation, New England Journal of Medicine and Canadian Medical Association Journal) as templates, he raised the JCCA's standards to a higher level. As well, he used the Editor's Page as a pulpit to discuss issues such as: The importance of gaining acceptance for our Journal with-in a database system such as Index Medicus; 4 accessing biomedical literature;5 the economics of a scientific jour - nal;6 the manuscript review process;7 and Guidelines for referees.8 It took several years for the Journal to evolve into a publication whose purposes are: To publish scien-tific articles and papers...To cultivate professional dia-logue and awareness...To enhance the continuing edu-cation of the practising chiropractor.\" By 2007, its 50 th anniversary, the Journal was finally part of the PubMed database system, digitally archived in the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and available in the libraries of 120 leading health sciences universities. \"This brought tremendous credibility to our profession. The Journal had become the vehicle to document the clinical evidence we as clinicians experience everyday in our practice, facilitating a true research culture in the profession.\" 9 Granted its core is research, but the JCCA's editorials, commentaries, correspondence and obituaries make it a rich source of anecdotal lore, while \"Historical Reviews\" help preserve and disseminate our chiropractic heritage. As of the March 2012 issue, the JCCA has gone online and no longer produces hard copies, making it affordable and universally accessible. 10 Chiropractic Research Journal Editors Council (CRJEC)The idea of a number of editors in similar disciplines meeting to discuss issues and set policy came from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors who met in Vancouver, BC, in January 1978 and formatted \"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals. 11 In May 1989, the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER) organized a roundtable discussion by a group of chiropractic journal editors, subsequently approved its concept and offered financial support. In May 1990, Silvano Mior (CMCC 1980) represented the JCCA when the CRJEC convened its first annual meeting. The itinerary included: Consider - ation of uniform requirements for manuscripts; standards for peer review; standardized chiropractic indexing terms; responsibilities of a chiropractic journal editor; and ap-plying for indexing status. In May 1992, Dr . Mior chaired the third meeting where the Council began wrestling with the ethics of fraudu-lent advertising in the journals, versus the urgent need for money to keep them afloat. By September 1997 Dr. Gotlib was attending on behalf of the JCCA and was named Chair for 1998-99. In July 1999, at the 10 th An- nual Meeting, Gotlib was happy to report that Dr. Paul Carey (CMCC 1967) had arranged for the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association (CCPA) to supply a $10,000 grant for travel expenses so the members could continue to meet annually and administrate the CRJEC's mandate. \"The CCPA has taken a leadership role in sup-porting the chiropractic milieu, by promoting the aware- ness of scholarship, as well as safe, effective, competent practice through responsible journalism. This cannot be accomplished any other way than through peer reviewed J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) gener - osity did not revive the Editors Council. In 1991, membership in the Council was limited to editors from \"primary source, peer-reviewed journals, publishing scientific information that contributes new knowledge\" and there were 14 periodicals that met those standards. No CRJEC minutes are available after 2001 and by then just eight of those journals were still in print, reinforcing Gotlib's contention that \"Science literature is very fragile and along with clinical and historical litera - ture it must be documented before it disappears.\" College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO) Prior to 1925, no effective regulation of chiropractic existed in Ontario. That year umbrella legislation was passed under the Drugless Practitioners Act (DPA) and a Board of Regents chosen, with jurisdiction over chiro-practors, osteopaths, drugless therapists, masseurs and chiropodists. 13 In 1952, chiropractors got new legislation when the Ontario Government replaced the Board of Re-gents with separate boards for the various drugless disci-plines. This provided chiropractors with an independ-ent regulatory board but the five members of the Board of Directors of Chiropractic (BDC) remained political designates, the DPA regulations were unchanged and the profession resented having little control over its destiny. 14 In1966 the Committee on the Healing Arts (CHA) to study all Ontario health care was formed and in 1974, the first six parts of the Health Disciplines Act (HDA) cover - ing dentistry, medicine, nursing, optometry and pharmacy, were passed into law. The Ministry of Health (MOH) then struck a committee to make recommendations for profes-sions not yet included: chiropractors, optometrists, chi-ropodists and osteopaths. In 1975 a chiropractic liaison committee, consisting of BDC, Ontario Chiropractic Association (OCA), and CMCC representatives, worked long and hard with senior MOH authorities to discuss the chiropractic portion of the HDA. Negotiations were diffi-cult, because the chiropractors were determined that their scope of practice would embrace diagnosis, the right to use x-ray and treatment of the nervous system. They were complex because in 1982 the MOH had established the Health Professions Legislative Review (HPLR) to exam - ine all 21 of the health professions not within the HDA legislation of 1974, rather than the original four. And they were protracted. By 1988, Stephen E. West (CMCC 1950), who was a major force within the BDC for two decades \"believed passage of the Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA) was imminent.\" 15 However, it was not until November 25, 1991, that the portion of the RHPA con-taining the new Chiropractic Act gained Royal Assent and 1994 became the inaugural year of the CCO. At its initial meeting on March 24, the BDC as it existed was replaced by the CCO. 1988 was the year of Allan Gotlib's first assignment to the BDC. By 1994 he had been elected as a CCO Council Member and moved on to positions as Secretary-Treas-urer and Chair of the Discipline Committee. In 1999 he assumed the role of President for two years, followed by Vice-Chair for one year and in 2002 he took on a second two year term as President, before retiring from the CCO in 2005. The CCO is more complicated, pervasive and demand - ing than the BDC. As the body established by the prov-incial government to regulate chiropractors in Ontario, its statutory mandate is to protect the public interest. 16 This privilege of self-governance, as determined by the RHPA, 1991, allows for the enforcement of various statu-tory duties by the CCO. 17 Its main responsibilities are: Developing standards of admission; establishing rules for members' conduct; developing means of improving members' skills and knowledge; examining complaints; and disciplining members whose behaviour is deemed below acceptable standards. The CCO's policy-making Council consists of nine chiropractors elected by their peers and seven public members chosen by the govern-ment, who serve on seven statutory and one non-statu-tory committee. The largest of these is the Discipline Committee, comprising seven individuals and for which all Council members are potential members of a Disci-pline panel. Unfortunate members who find themselves embroiled in disciplinary matters soon discover dispute resolution is expensive. Should allegations of professional misconduct or incompetence come before a panel of the Discipline Committee and the panel finds for the prosecution, it may direct the Registrar to impose sanctions, fine the miscre - ant up to $35,000 and pay part or all of the College's legal expenses. In addition, the price of defending oneself is huge. Costs at the investigative and complaints levels can be $10,000; lengthy hearings can exceed $50,000 for each party involved. 18110 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Allan C. Gotlib, DC, CM: A worthy Member of the Order of Canada The time to disposition of a disciplinary matter before the CCO can be onerous. The review referred to here was conducted by Gotlib. It consists of a retrospective analy - sis of 27 case files that met the criteria of being referred by the Complaints or Executive Committee and disposed of by the Discipline Committee from 1994 through 2001, excluding time related to the penalty phase or appeals process of any proceeding. The starting point for most of these files was defined as the date of approval of the inquiry, whereas the end point was the day the defend-ant was informed of the Discipline Committee's decision. Over the eight years since the RHPA was proclaimed, the average period for a case to complete the disciplinary pro-cess and be disposed, was 19.5 months, with a range of 6 to 45 months. This study sought to quantify the time it took for a discipline matter to be disposed. In exercising statutory authority, administrative tribunals must clearly understand due process and procedural fairness. Parties to discipline proceedings have their respective rights including the right to natural justice and these rights must be weighed fairly, and balanced with respect to societal rights. Delayed proceedings may challenge an individual' s Charter rights and may also offend the administrative legal duties imposed by statute . 19 Judicially Related Activities Member, Deputy Judges Council of Ontario From 2002 to 2003 Dr. Gotlib was appointed by the Lieu - tenant Governor in Council on the Attorney General's rec-ommendation, as one of three lay persons, to serve along with the Chief Justice of the Ontario Superior Court, the Honourable Heather Forster Smith, and other justices, on the Ontario Deputy Judges Council. Its mandate is to review and approve plans for the continuing educa - tion of deputy judges. 20 Four hundred of these part-time magistrates ease congestion in Ontario courts by handling things such as bail hearings. To obtain such a post you must apply, and meet eligibility requirements. Bencher, Law Society of Upper Canada Benchers are governors of the Law Society of Upper Canada, the members of its board of directors. There are two main categories; elected and appointed. At the time, there were 40 benchers elected by the Society's members, every four years. Appointed benchers are also known as \"lay\" members because they are not lawyers. Eight in number, they are chosen \"by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the Ontario Government, to represent the public interest.\" 21 Gotlib was an appointed bencher from 2003 to 2007. He got this job because his 18 years on the BDC and CCO had given him the skills needed to conduct discipline inquiries. Gotlib sat on a very large number of hearings regarding lawyer disciplinary proceedings. Transitional Council College of Naturopaths of OntarioIn September, 2009, Ontario spawned a transitional coun-cil of Ontario naturopaths to establish rules governing the registration of qualified practitioners. All 17 members were appointed by the Lieutenant Governor In Council, charged with the specific duty of protecting the public in-terest and made responsible to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. 22 This marked a major step toward the regulation of naturopathy within the RHPA, 1991 and the Naturopathic Act, 2007. As the sole chiropractor, Dr. Got-lib was chosen for a two year term, primarily for his back-ground in professional regulation and experience with the DPA, the HPLR and the RHPA. Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (CCRF)The CCRF, Canada's oldest and most established chiro-practic funding body, was initiated in 1976. Its found-ers were Drs. Ron Collett (CMCC 1958), Al Hawkins (CMCC 1965), Terry Watkins, John Bloomer (PSC 1957) and Walter Savickey (PSC 1959). Terry Watkins chaired the CCRF Organizing Committee in Winnipeg, MB, before moving to Toronto, to become CMCC's Academic Dean in 1978. 23 Dr. Watkins left the College, returning to Winnipeg in 1980. This was the year Dr. Collett succeeded in obtaining letters patent from the Federal Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, and a charitable registration number for the Foundation, from Revenue Canada. Now the CCRF was able to issue tax-deductible receipts which helped in raising money to bolster a variety of projects. Watkins resumed his role as chair until 1990, when he and Collette resigned. Soon \"the CCRF became too difficult to manage and control J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 1 11DM Brown for those who were left in charge.\" [Email, Watkins to the author, Oct 20, 2013] Gotlib remembers it as endur - ing a long struggle. \"In its best year it was worth about $30,000 before moving its head office from Winnipeg to Toronto in 1998. It now has $1.3 million in assets and recently received an anonymous donation of $500,000. This is all restricted money which must be used for specific purposes.\" [Interview, Gotlib by the author, Feb 21, 2012] CCRF AlliesCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) In 1997 Dr. Gotlib became the CCA's Director of Research Programs and in 1999 was named Executive Vice-Presi - dent, Research and University Affairs of the CCRF. Once more he was self-reliant, teaching himself the university system, developing relationships with univer - sity officials and affiliations with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Announced by the Govern-ment in 1998, the CIHR became operational in April 2000, giving Gotlib an early start within Canada's independent health research agency. Its mission is to contrive new scientific knowledge which is translated into a strength-ened Canadian health care system. Its research is integrat - ed through 13 \"virtual\" institutes, bringing networks of researchers together to focus on important health prob-lems. Some of these are: Aging, genetics, health services, musculoskeletal (MSK) health, addiction and nutrition. 24 Gotlib has found the CIHR Small Health Organizations Partnership Program (SHOPP) tremendously successful in providing extraordinary opportunities to small, histor - ically under-represented professions such as chiropractic to foster true research cultures and furnishes a mechan - ism for new knowledge to be integrated into the health research and health care systems. In 2003, Alan Bernstein, PhD, President of the CIHR, invited Gotlib to sit on his President's V oluntary Health Sector Committee until 2007. The Committee's first meet - ing was in Ottawa, November 3, 2004. Members included the Canadian Cancer Society, Heart and Stroke, Health Charities Council of Canada, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the CIHR Vice-President and four Scientific Directors. 25 Allan recognized that the V oluntary Sector Committee was \"an important venue to strengthen and build relation - ships between the CIHR and voluntary sector partner -ships, including the Health Charities Coalition of Canada (HCCC) to address issues of common interest.\" In 2009-2010 the CIHR's budget was slightly over $1 billion and it was supporting more than 11,000 researchers and re-searchers in training. Cochrane Collaboration Established in the United Kingdom in 1993, \"The Coch-rane Collaboration is an international network of more than 28,000 individuals from over 100 countries that aim to help people make well-informed decisions about health care by preparing, maintaining and promoting the access-ibility of systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions. 26 The CCA is an affiliate member of Coch- rane Canada and from 2001 to 2010 Dr. Gotlib was on its Executive Committee, encouraging the formation of strong ties between Cochrane and the chiropractic pro-fession. Gotlib explains that among this global sphere are 10,000 to 12,000 researchers who extract, coordinate and synthesize investigative studies into systemized reviews. There are 5,000 reviews in their library that Cochrane is constantly updating. If a politician wants information on a condition such as back pain, he can get evidence about the best care from the scanning of thousands of journals, creating reliability for us. Fifty groups of researchers exist around the world. Six of these are in Canada; the two most important for chiro- practors are in Ontario. The group for back pain is located at the U of T; the one for MSK problems is at the Uni-versity of Ottawa. The Federal Government relies heavily on these databases for making health care policy deci-sions. All trials are subject to bio-statistical analysis and research protocols. This requires knowledge of research and trial methodology, biostatistics and epidemiology. Al-lan has organized a lot of workshops to train chiropractors how to extract fair, valid and unbiased conclusions and he has a good relationship with the Director of Cochrane Canada. In fact, we are the only health profession that supports Cochrane in this country. Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College CMCC is a fully accredited, degree granting institution, recognized as one of the most rigorous and innovative chiropractic programs in North America. The College's focus is on education, research and patient satisfaction re-lated to neuromusculoskeletal (NMSK) interactions and 112 2016; 60(1)Allan C. Gotlib, DC, CM: A worthy Member of the Order of Canada the study of chiropractic's role in an integrated system. Its research agenda includes three on- site centres. First is the Centre for the Study of Mechanobiology, Injury and Health, exploring the mechanics of treatment and their end results. Second is our Centre for Interprofessional Health Dynamics, regarding the profession's role in inte - grated care and its promotion. Third is the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) - CMCC Centre for the Study of Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation. Opened in July 2012, the latest acquisition has enhanced scientific exchange between our institutions and brought physical therapists, psychologists, orthopaedic surgeons and general practitioners along with chiropractors, into the mix. Resources for the centre include a $2.8 million grant from the Ontario Ministry of Finance, Financial Services Commission, to develop a Minor Injury Treat-ment Protocol. 27 CMCC' s research agenda is geared toward contributing to the body of chiropractic knowledge, thereby elevating the quality of education and improving patient outcomes. A variety of campus laboratories support this research cul-ture exploring: Biomechanics and elastography; materi biology; and histology. In 2010, CMCC established the McMorland Family Research Chair in Mechanobiology, a first for any chiropractic institution and in 2013 the prom-ise of more groundbreaking research was made possible by successfully applying for a grant through the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), to support a study of spinal manipulation. This endowment, which is slightly less than $1 million, is the highest level of award made by the NIH. Developing a Research Agenda for Chiropractic in CanadaIn 1995 the CCA framed a Task Force on Chiropractic Research in Canada 28 and in March 1997, the CCA com- missioned the construction of a Consortium of Canadian Chiropractic Research Centres (CCCRC). 29 Its purpose is to develop new chiropractic knowledge through multi - disciplinary collaboration and integrate that knowledge into the Canadian health care system. The original consortium consisted of CMCC, the CIHR, L' Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res (UQTR), and the Universities of Calgary, Saskatchewan and Wat-erloo. The first CCA/CCRF supported Canadian Chiro-practic Scientific Symposium (CCSS) was formed in Cal-gary, November 14-15, 1998. Over 150 registrants heard presentations by member institutions and Heritage Lec - tures from leading chiropractic researchers of the 1980s. October 21-22, 2000, 200 people attended the second CCSS in Toronto. During this symposium Workshop I was conducted. Its purpose was for chiropractic and bio-medical researchers to integrate their individual agendas into a comprehensive framework related to spinal pain and disability. W orkshop II was convened in October 2002, immedi - ately prior to the third CCSS in Montr\u00e9al, PQ. Sponsored by the CIHR, it was designed to assist chiropractors set an agenda congruent with CIHR goals. Gotlib was present at both meetings to help identify and prioritize questions to be addressed by CCCRC members. Although sympo-sia have been held biannually since their inception, it was not until 2009 that Workshop III occurred in Montr\u00e9al. In 2008, Drs. Gotlib, Andr\u00e9 Bussi\u00e8res and Kent Stuber, won a non-renewable grant of $25,000 from the CIHR. This was first prize in the MSK Health and Arthritis Compe-tition and was delivered in Montr\u00e8al, during the CIHR/CCRF Research Consortium Workshop III to advance the Chiropractic Research Agenda. 30 This year, 23 members representing CMCC and universities across Canada, met with five invited Topic Speakers, to identify priority areas and gaps for future research activities. CCRF Goals Allan Gotlib was added to the CCA Task Force in 1996 and impacted the CCRF's strategy of \"investing in people\" and fashioning its goals. CCRF Goal 1: T o establish and fund university- based Chiropractic Research Chairs for each province in Canada Dr. Gotlib envisioned these chairs as portals of entry into the university system and saw them coalescing into a net-work of chiropractic research activity across the country. The reality of spawning them was another matter. Allan quickly learned the procedure was \"burdened with satis-fying committee after committee, by-law approvals, fac-ulty union collective agreements, senate and board of governors acceptance, and on and on. The process easily stretches beyond four years; the avalanche of expecta - tions and crushing disappointments can be overwhelm Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 1 13DM Brown ing.\" After due diligence, the final decision was made by a university search committee that chose the best candidate for both the university and faculty. 31 Gotlib began his bold journey into this vast, unknown territory in the mid 1990s. As of December 31, 2013, Al-lan and the CCRF had sparked 15 Chiropractic Research Chair/Professorships and another was in the works for Memorial University of Newfoundland/Labrador. The remaining provincial jurisdictions were the University of New Brunswick (Canada's oldest English speaking Uni-versity) and the University of Prince Edward Island. CCRF Goal 2: T o increase the profession's research capacity Although by 2008 the CCRF strategy of \"investing in people\" had produced some trans Canada momentum, Dr. Gotlib sensed we lacked enough researchers to meet the profession's needs and set out with Drs. Kent Stuber and Andr\u00e9 Bussi\u00e8res to answer two key questions: What per - centage of the chiropractic profession is engaged in full-time research; and what strategies should be employed to increase the profession's capacity to undertake research in Canada? 32 This investigation was divided into three phases. Phase I involved mailing a twelve question survey to all prov-incial associations, regulatory colleges and the CCA, for distribution to their membership. Of the over 6,000 chiro-practors who were invited to complete the analysis, little more than ten percent responded. Of these, 94 had or were in the process of obtaining master's degrees while 30 possessed or were completing PhDs. The majority were located in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. Phase II comprised mail - ing a 19 question survey to 198 individuals, made up of those with post graduate training who answered the first questionnaire, or who indicated they were currently con-ducting research. One hundred and twenty-three (62%) completed the second survey. Forty-eight said they did no research, 20 were full-time and 55 part-time. The \"key message\" is that 0.3% of the profession has been conducting most of the research to substantiate what the rest of us do clinically. \"To achieve a level of 1% of the profession doing research on a full-time basis would require an additional 40 chiropractors.\" 33 Three major ap- proaches for consideration are: Supporting and expanding the University Based Research Chair /Professorship pro-gram; increasing opportunities for our part-time research-ers; and augmenting inter-disciplinary research through alternative disciplines. CCRF Goal 3: To access the millions of federal and provincial Canadian dollars available for health researchGoal 3 ties into Phase III of the Stuber, Busssi\u00e8res, Gotlib surveys. 34 Their final assessment focussed on \"financial aspects,\" to determine the amount of funding which supports chiro-practic research in Canada. The Phase III sample popu-lation consisted of Phase II respondents plus known re-searchers and graduate students who had not replied to Phases I and II. Professors and chiropractors in research training positions were asked to name all external sources of income. Ninety individuals received this survey and 88 (98%) replied. Of these, 32 were not involved with research in 2008, 18 researchers including 12 of the 35 graduate students had no external funding, while 38 had some funding. 35 In 2008 it was reported that Canadian chiropractic re - search activity was supported by approximately $4 million in competitive funding. While this sounds promising, 75% of those grants were controlled by just four researchers. Canadian researchers as a whole are poorly paid and many are self-funded. \"Finding new ways to secure funding for chiropractic researchers is imperative and an urgent need to continue to build chiropractic research capacity.\" In 2008, Stuber , Bussi\u00e8res and Gotlib determined that CMCC and UQTR were producing capable researchers and quality research. A majority of the faculty members who responded to their surveys were alumni of those two institutions and most were engaged in part- time research. 36 CMCC still qualifies. January 20, 2014, Col- lege faculty and clinicians, including adjunct faculty and excluding graduate students, totalled 154 employees. Of these 130 had DC degrees, 22 Masters and 17 PhDs. Just three of the DCs came from schools other than CMCC. Out of the 24 who were not chiropractors, 20 had Masters, Medical and/or PhD diplomas. 37 During the two year per - iod, 2012-13, CMCC's three research centres presented and published over 100 articles in an array of journals. \"The global community has recognized these efforts and in the past 24 months alone, 14 awards and honours were presented to CMCC researchers, students and 60(1)Allan C. Gotlib, DC, CM: A worthy Member of the Order of Canada Progress CCRF Research Consortia As noted earlier, in 1998 the first Consortium of Chiro-practic Research Centres consisted of six institutions. September 27-28, 2013, the CCA hosted its biennial Re-search Consortium in Toronto. This gathering attracted 50 world-class chiropractic researchers from 16 Canadian universities and was funded by 15 sponsors, including every provincial CCA division. Its aim was to \"facilitate trans-disciplinary chiropractic research,\" and its partici - pants agreed that, \"This research is essential to leading our profession to the next chapter of its evolution as an integrated member of the health care team, caring for all Canadians.\" 39 Allan Gotlib promises that, \"Plans are already underway for the next Research Symposium in 2015 and it will be riveting!\" Research Capacity Although by the end of 2013 there were approximately 50 active full-time chiropractic researchers, this was merely 0.7% of our professional population because now there were 7,000 chiropractors serving 35 million Canadians. Don't despair; help is on the way. By February 2014, there were 30 Masters and 20 PhD candidates in the sys-tem. Within a couple of years we should be up to 1.4% and on our way to a respectable 2%. CCRF Research Chair/ Professorships In December 1999, Greg Kawchuk (CMCC 1990) re-ceived his PhD from the University of Calgary and Sep-tember 1, 2001, Dr. Gotlib facilitated Dr. Kawchuk's in-stallation as Canada's first Chiropractic Research Chair, in Spinal Function, within the university's Faculty of Civil Engineering. It was for a three year period with capital of $430,000 to start. In 2004 this became a 10 year Canada Research Chair and Kawchuk received competitive fund-ing of several million dollars from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), University of Alberta, CIHR, Natur - al Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), College of Chiropractors of Alberta, OCA and CCRF. In 2009 the Canadian Government renewed Kaw-chuk's Chair for $500,000 at the University of Alberta and in June 2012, he initiated the International Chiro-practic Research Network (ICRN). Hosted by Linkedin, it aims to develop a global resource for those interested in research related to our profession. In September 2013, Greg was one of three Principal Investigators (PIs) on a team that won $750,000 in a Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Health Care System (PRIHS) competi - tion, in the Bone & Joint category. When Mark Erwin (CMCC 1984), PhD, assumed the second Research Chair in June 2005, his co-funding by the OCA, CIHR and CCRF, amounted to $300,000. In 2007 his designation became CCRF/University of Toron-to, Scientist in Disc Biology and monies from the pro-fession, the University Health Network and corporations totalled $510,000. March 2012 he was supplied with an independent laboratory by the Toronto General Hospital, to support his quest to unravel a leading cause of spine-re-lated neurological disability and in December, the CCRF entered into a direct agreement with the U of T to con-ceive and fund the position of CCRF Professorship in Disc Biology. Dr. Erwin is the recipient of this new, three year appointment, supported by the CCRF, U of T, OCA and University Health Network, in Toronto. This arrangement provides another $300,000 investment in the plausibility of our profession and follows earlier transactions with the Universities of BC and Alberta. At the CCA Chair Affair, November 29, 2013, Mark received the Medal of Merit, the CCA's highest honour, for outstanding, long-term ser - vice to the Association. April 1, 2006, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Blouin's (UQTR 1999), PhD, five year CCRF/University of BC Professorship in Spine Mechanics and Human Neurophysiology began with an investment of $500,000 from the CCRF, UBC, BC Chiropractic Association (BCCA) and BC College of Chiropractors (BCCC). The following year he won an operating grant of $320,000. Paid by the Canada Founda-tion for Innovation (CFI), UBC and BC Knowledge and Development Fund, the project is titled: Neurophysiology of the Cervical Spine: Application of Robotics and Elec - troencephalography to Injury Prevention, Assessment and Rehabilitation. By 2011, Dr. Blouin had been promoted to Associated Professor and was tenured at the UBC School of Kinesiology. Martin Descarreaux's (UQTR 1998), PhD, August 2006 Chair at the UQTR came with a $250,000 operat - ing grant and $230,000 for equipment. In 2007 the FCER and National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) granted him $33,000 for a comparative study of spinal manipulation and his research team at UQTR achieved J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 1 15DM Brown \"Groupe de Recherche\" status, ensuring recurrent inter - nal funding of $17,000 to $25,000 per year. In 2010, the Fonds de Recherche en Sant\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec Descarreaux a Scholar Award, pro-viding $60,000 a year for the 2010-2014 period. In 2011 Martin's $150,000 stipend was renewed for a three year term by the Fondation de Recherche Chiropratique du Qu\u00e9bec (FRCQ) and in 2013 he obtained $175,000 from the Research Institute of Robert Sauv\u00e9, for his efforts in workplace health and safety. Now his team collaborates with other disciplines and universities in Qu\u00e9bec as well as chiropractic colleges in Canada, the United States and Europe. In 2007, Jill Hayden (CMCC 1996), successfully de - fended her PhD in Clinical Epidemiology at the U of T and July 1, she became the CCRF/CIHR Chair at the To-ronto Western Research Institute, received the New In-vestigator five year Award of $525,000 and worked on a pair of ventures funded with $130,000. 2010 was the year Dr. Hayden relocated to Canada's east coast where she and her colleagues established the Nova Scotia Cochrane Resource Centre and acquired two new research grants totalling $207,000. On July 1, 2011, Dalhousie Univer - sity, NS, declared that the CCRF Professorship in Epi-demiology had been presented to Hayden and in 2012 the Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation (NCHRF) donated an Establishment Grant of $150,000 to assist in building its research capacity. Jill has also earned several training and achievement awards and in 2013 the CIHR contributed $94,000 to explore the relationship between individual recovery expectations and outcomes, in adults experiencing low back pain. September 1, 2008, it was declared that John Srbely (CMCC 1992), PhD, had been handed a five year CCRF/University of Guelph Professorship in Spine Mechanics and Human Neurophysiology. Financed by the OCA, University of Guelph and the CCRF, the professorship is housed in the College of Biological Sciences, with access to modern lab facilities in neurophysiology and spine bio-mechanics. Dr. Srbely is the only chiropractic researcher holding the distinction of \"Canadian Arthritis Network Investigator.\" Supported by the OCA, CCRF and Univer - sity of Guelph, he was given $48,000 to investigate mech - anisms of pain in osteoarthritis. Jason Busse (CMCC 1999), PhD, became the CCRF/ CIHR McMaster University Research Chair for five years on March 1, 2009. He is involved with projects through the CCRF, CIHR, McMaster University and the Institute for Work and Health, worth approximately $5 million and in March 2012, the CIHR handed Dr. Busse two addition - al operating grants totalling $193,000. Jason has authored over 80 peer-reviewed articles focusing on medically un-explained syndromes, orthopaedic trauma and the inte - gration of chiropractic into mainstream health care. July 1, 2010, the University of Manitoba granted Ste - ven Passmore (NYCC 2006), PhD, the CCRF Profes-sorship in Spine Biomechanics and Neurophysiology for five years. This demonstrated the Manitoba Govern-ment's commitment to supporting chiropractic research within its system of higher education. In 2012 the Mani-toba Medical Service Foundation rewarded Dr. Passmore with a $20,000 bursary. The same year, he and Bernadette Murphy (CMCC 1989), PhD, received a $199,000 grant from the Manitoba Workers Compensation Board. Steven is also an Adjunct Professor in the research department at the New York Chiropractic College. From 2004 to 2010, Paul Bruno (CMCC 2004), PhD, was a research fellow and lecturer at the Anglo-Euro- pean College of Chiropractic in the UK, earning his PhD from the University of Portsmouth (2008) and winning post graduate research prizes. July 1, 2010, Dr. Bruno acquired a five year term as CCRF Research Chair in NMSK Health in the Faculty of Health Studies at the Uni-versity of Regina, SK. He was awarded an Establishment Grant of $95,000 from the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation (SHRF), which is funded 50:50 by the SHRF and CCRF. Paul's research concentrates on rehab exercise to target the specific needs of individual patients with low back pain. In 2012 he obtained an operating grant to pur - chase a \"Vicon Motion Capture System\" to calculate the relative motion of multiple spine segments. Mathieu Pich\u00e9 (UQTR 2002), secured his PhD in Neurological Sciences from L' Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 2009. January 1, 2011, Dr. Pich\u00e9 was named to a five year position as Research Chair in Pain Neurophysiology at the UQTR and is a co-researcher for the FRCQ Research Chair held by Dr. Descarreaux. He also collaborates with the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology and the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Dr. Pich\u00e9's interests include the physiology and pathology of endogenous pain modula - tion and the impact of pain on the autonomic nervous sys-tem.116 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Allan C. Gotlib, DC, CM: A worthy Member of the Order of Canada Sam Howarth, PhD, was named holder of the Mc - Morland Family Research Chair in Mechanobiology at CMCC, June 20, 2011. A graduate of the University of Waterloo, ON, the hub of his former research was identi-fying mechanisms of injury within the vertebral joint. At the College, Dr. Howarth has been exploring methods of controlling spinal movements and low back rehabilitation programs to improve motion patterns. His perspective on stability stems from his expertise in biomechanics, which he applies to mechanobiology. This is a field at the inter - section of biology and engineering which looks at the mechanism through which cells communicate, thereby enabling a useful paradigm for the study of chiropractic. Endowed with a partnered investment of $500,000 be- tween the U of T and CCRF, on July 1, 2012, the U of T bestowed the Professorship in Spine upon Carlo Ammen-dolia (CMCC 1982), PhD. Although occupied within the Faculty of Medicine at the U of T, Dr. Ammendolia also directs the Spinal Stenosis Program at the Toronto Mount Sinai Hospital. For 2013-2016, Ammendolia was awarded a $1.7 million grant from the Patient-Centred Outcomes Research Institute and $23,000, by the National Chiro-practic Insurance Mutual Company (NCIMC) Founda-tion, Supporting Research and Education for 2013-2014. For the same period, he was named PI of a $360,000 award from the Arthritis Society, in the Strategic Oper - ating Grant Competition. Carlo has incorporated clinical practice with research in applying non-operative treat - ments for mechanical, degenerative and inflammatory spinal disorders. In July 2012, Pierre C\u00f4t\u00e9 (CMCC 1989), PhD, reaped the benefits of the previously mentioned $2.8 million grant issued by the Ontario Ministry of Finance, to de-velop treatment protocol for minor injuries based on best scientific and medical practices. Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 also received the new Tier 2 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in Disabil-ity Prevention and Rehabilitation at the UOIT. The CRC is valued at $500,000 over five years. Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 says its \"primary objective is to develop and test interventions aimed at reducing MSK pain in Canadians...MSK con-ditions are responsible for nearly half of all disabilities in Canada and related health-care costs continue to sky-rocket.\" 40 He also holds appointments at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and at the Institute of Health Policy Management and Evaluation, at the U of T. On Septem ber 26, 2012, Andr\u00e9 Bussi\u00e8res (CMCC 1991), PhD, earned CCRF tation Epidemiology, at McGill University, Montr\u00e8al, PQ. Capitalized by a joint $500,000 investment between the CCRF and McGill, this established a university-based re-search position that converged on a scientifically sound approach to the development of Clinical Practice Guide-lines. Dr. Bussi\u00e8res serves on the JCCA editorial board and has written over 20 scientific and clinical articles and three book chapters. 2013 was another year of firsts for the CCRF. Septem - ber 12, there was a Recognition Event at Queen's Univer - sity, Kingston, ON, to declare that it had assigned Simon French, BAppSc (Chiropractic), PhD, to the CCRF Profes-sorship in Rehabilitation Therapy. Dr. French hails from the University of Melbourne, Australia, where he was a Senior Research Fellow in the School of Heath Sciences. At Queen's he concentrates on knowledge translation in primary care with an emphasis on MSK conditions. He also conducts randomized trials of interventions relevant to primary care settings and is an Associate Editor of the Journal, \"Chiropractic & Manual Therapies.\" Drew Potter (CMCC 1970), CCRF President, was present on this occasion and was \"struck by the manner in which we were received at the University. Their Dean and Vice-Dean welcomed us as colleagues, expressing their genuine respect for Dr. French and our profession.\" 41 This reception was in stark contrast to some Allan Gotlib en-dured back in the 1990s, when cap in hand, he pioneered knocking on doors of academia. Continuing Education and Publications Dr. Gotlib is a proponent of life-long learning. The per - iod of 2000 through 2011 was one of intense activity for Allan, yet he was an energetic participant in 32 separate events, lasting two to three days and was a prime mov-er in fathering at least 20 of these conferences. Besides stimulating (and occasionally exhausting) our leader, these conventions, symposia, workshops, colloquia, train-ing sessions and congresses broadened the perspectives of thousands of our peers concerning the advantages of systematized research and inter-professional collegiality. During his career, Dr. Gotlib has authored or co-auth - ored 27 scholarly papers in peer-reviewed journals. Elev - en of them have been referenced in this paper. Many of the others address controversial issues facing our voca-tion. For instance: In 1984 Gotlib wrote chiropractors to obtain informed consent42 and third party access to confidential patient records;43 in 1985 Gotlib and Haymo Thiel (CMCC 1985), selected an an- notated bibliography of core medical literature pertaining to stroke and cervical spine manipulation; 44 in 1997 Got- lib, Stephen Injeyan (CMCC 1984) and John Crawford (CMCC 1975), recorded the need for reform relative to the use of lab diagnosis by chiropractors in Ontario; 45 and in 2005, Gotlib and Ronald Rupert (Research Director, Parker University), assessed the evidence for chiropractic manipulation in pediatric health conditions. 46 Between March 1998 and December 2013, the CCA distributed 38 Research Bulletins to its members, running from 12 to 20 pages. Ninety percent of the information they contain was collected and collated by Dr. Gotlib. Accolades The CMCC \"Cornerstone\" yearbooks, 1973-76, offer no clues as to the heights Dr. Gotlib would reach, however shortly after graduation, his talents began to emerge.Dr. Terry Watkins' interaction with our champion stretch - es back 37 years. Fr om my experience dealing with Dr. Gotlib, it is amazing how much one dedicated individual can contribute to the development of our profession in ways most others could not envision. From my time spent discussing our profession at our CMCC Fri-day afternoon faculty sessions, to the development of the JCCA and the extraordinary vision to provide an opportunity for suitable chiropractic research candidates to occupy funded research chairs at ma-jor universities. What a remarkable and determined colleague Dr. Allan Gotlib has been. I have great respect for him and am privileged to have watched his growth.[Email, T. Watkins to the author, Oct 1, 2013] Dr. Igor Steiman (CMCC 1981), was accepted into the College in 1977, right after completing his MSc program at the U of T. His first encounter with Dr. Gotlib was as a second year technique instructor in 1978. He gave them an assignment to photograph vertebrae placed on grid paper to measure anatomical irregularities. \"The objective was to have us realize that just because we might palpate or ob-serve segmental asymmetries in a patient's spine, it didn't necessarily mean we had detected a subluxation.\" Dr. Steiman's second encounter was in a third year technique lab, where he describes himself as \"quite incompetent and lacking confidence.\" Allan observed to adjust a classmate's C2 sublux-ation and told him to repeat the move \"with more speed and force.\" This produced a \"loud crack\" that startled Igor but pleased both Allan and the classmate. Steiman credits Gotlib with sparking his evolution into a competent ad-juster and says, \"Allan always struck me as being calm, reasonable, but perseverant in driving towards his goals.\" [Email, I. Steiman to the author, Oct 15, 2013]. Dr . Keith Thomson (CMCC 1978), served on the CCO in a variety of capacities from 1994 to 2007 and still acts as a Peer Assessor. One of the first things I noticed about Allan was his encyclopaedic knowledge of the CCO Regula-tions and Standards, which he could recite at will. When Allan felt strongly about an issue, he was forceful, eloquent and did not back down. What impressed me most were the two years (1994-96) we spent together on the Discipline Committee. No matter the subject before us, Allan was the fairest, most compassionate person on the panel. I never saw him want a 'pound of flesh' from members who made poor professional choices. A humorous bit of advice Allan gave me was to take a brief case into discipline hearings. He said, 'There may be times you need it to open up and laugh behind - on other occasions to cry behind.' Allan was a great mentor to me. I will always appreciate his thoughtfulness and kindness. [Email, K. Thomson to the author, Oct 15, 2013] Dr. Brian Budgell (CMCC 1986), PhD, has been Director of the Neurophysiology Laboratory at the College since 2009. Among Dr . Gotlib' s feats, the one that impressed me most was the erection and fortification of our re-search chairs. This strategy benefits the individual and provides the entire profession with a research base which illuminates the discipline of chiroprac-tic. In the past, chiropractic was essentially a 'folk practice,' meaning techniques were passed down 118 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1)Allan C. Gotlib, DC, CM: A worthy Member of the Order of Canada from one generation to the next, but there was scant understanding of how they worked and no thought-ful strategy for improvement. Current research vindicates certain practices, allowing us to dissect what we do, so as to identify those components of total care which are either more or less effective. This way, we can discard the ineffective and build on our strengths. Beyond research findings from specific projects, the presence of chiropractors in the university system enables us to interact with the 'thought leaders' of other health professions. Our researchers are wonderful ambassadors for chiro-practic and will open doors for us in other arenas. [Email, B. Budgell to the author, Feb 12, 2014] Dr. Chris Martin (CMCC 1978), worked in several execu- tive capacities for the CCA and CCRF between 1998 and 2013. When I began my relationship with the CCRF many years ago, we were on the doorstep, entering into our first Chiropractic Research Chair at the Uni-versity of Calgary. Today, we have chairs in almost every province. Our researchers are world class, building strong, collaborative relations with lead-ing scientists throughout Canada and around the world. We are fortunate to have been lead by dedi-cated boards but more importantly, we have bene-fitted from the skill, expertise and devotion of Dr. Allan Gotlib. Our achievements lie squarely with this individual' s never-say-quit approach and for that we are most grateful. 47 TrophiesBetween 1984 and 2013, Dr. Gotlib has received 18 laur - els. Several of them: The OCA Chiropractor of the Year; CCA Medal of Merit; and CMCC Homewood Professor- ships, are the highest awards given by these chiropractic institutions. Among his highly-prized citations is one he received from the Government of Canada in 2012, when it was announced that Allan Gotlib had been appointment to the Order of Canada. Prior to that, Gotlib's name was familiar to members of the Canadian chiropractic com-munity in general and its scientists in particular. After the notice appeared in the newspapers, Gotlib became an overnight research celebrity. CMCC' s President, Dr. Jean Moss, was tremendously proud to see one of her graduates recognized for such a prestigious honour as the Order of Canada. Dr . Gotlib has created a heightened interest in re- search which plays a pivotal role in the develop - ment of the chiropractic profession. This is an in-spiration to our students and assists in fostering an interest in scientific inquiry among them. In fact, Dr. Gotlib' s work stimulated CMCC to create its own Research Chair in Mechanobiology...The re-search being conducted in Canada is the envy of the world and has the potential to create advances in the care and quality of life for patients everywhere. Dr. Gotlib is fundamental to this success and is to be congratulated. 48 Drs. Jill Hayden and Greg Kawchuk agree they owe their status within the university health care system to Dr. Got-lib's diligence and devotion. By identifying areas where one could \"do a lot with a little\" and applying effort and intellect, Allan brought these opportunities to fruition. \"His idea of constructing a critical mass of chiropractic Figure 3. Dr. Gotlib receiving the OCA Chiropractor of the Year AwardJ Can Chiropr Assoc 2016; 60(1) 1 19DM Brown scientists touched the careers of almost every Canadian chiropractic investigator.\"49 Allan M. Freedman, LLB, first met Allan Gotlib in 1963, while attending junior high school. \" In the early years, Allan appeared polite, studious and reserved to the outside world, although he had a mischievous streak that fell short of getting him into real trouble.\" One of Got-lib's harmless pranks was skipping class with a group of his chums to have their photo taken with Santa Claus, at Yorkdale Plaza. After their senior matriculations, Gotlib and Freedman's academic paths parted with Gotlib end-ing up at CMCC and Freedman studying law at the Uni-versity of Western Ontario, in London. In 1975-76, Gotlib was in his clinical year at the Col- Figure 4. Dr. Allan Gotlib was invested Member of the Order of Canada by His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, at a ceremony at Rideau Hall on May 3, 2013. Photo credit: Sgt DC, CM: A worthy Member of the Order of Canada lege and Freedman was articling in Toronto. Because he was taking Valium for \"neck pain which medical doctors had diagnosed as tension,\" Freedman consulted Gotlib at the CMCC clinic who told him he had a subluxation that \"could be managed by spinal manipulation and would take nine treatments.\" Freedman asked if he \"could get all nine treatments at once, to which the reply was a brusque no.\" Almost four decades later , Freedman still requires maintenance care and the two remain close companions as they deal with the vicissitudes of life. \"Allan Gotlib is an unique human being with an unusual amount of com-mon sense and quiet determination. His level of patience when dealing with issues is remarkable. Above all, his commitment to the validity of the chiropractic profession is above repute and ultimately led to his being rewarded with the Order of Canada.\" [Email, Freedman to the auth-or, March 24, 2014] Naturally , Dr. Gotlib has expressed his own viewpoint. June 29, 2012, Toronto Star columnist Jim Coyle wrote: \"Along with the identification, this week's recipients had to deal with the trying circumstances of being thrilled with the news from Rideau Hall but sworn to secrecy until after the announcement.\" When Gotlib, who is known for a \"quiet and diligent manner,\" was invited to a Star photo shoot, \"there was pride and playfulness in him\" when he replied he would be there. \"I'll be the old guy with a gor - geous lady on my arm. It will be my bride of 40 years.\" Allan is both gracious and grateful in expressing his \"heartfelt thanks to Canada,\" for giving \"its citizens one of the world's most precious gifts, freedom.\" Allan finds this freedom inspirational and \"fires\" his passion. \"To be recognized in this special way for contributions made not only to my profession but to Canadian society, is beyond belief.\" It also puts chiropractors in the spotlight and affords them \"a wonderful opportunity to grow arm in arm with Canada and to engage all Canadians in the future.\" May 3, 2013, Allan Gotlib was among 44 worthy civilians who gathered in the Ballroom of Rideau Hall for their Investiture by the Right Honourable David John-ston, Governor General of Canada. I am so pleased to invest you into the Order of Canada, the centerpiece of our country' s honours system. DESIDERANTES MELIOREM P ATRIAM. They desire a better country. That is why you are here today, and why I am so grateful for your contributions that shape our ongoing experiment called Canada. Congratulations on your achieve - ments and on behalf of all Canadians, thank you. On October 1, 2013, Dr. Gotlib had to be surprised, if not shocked to receive another letter, from our Governor General of Canada. On behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, I am pleased to award you the Queen Elizabeth II Dia-mond Jubilee Medal, created to mark the 60 th anni- versary of Her Majesty' s accession to the Throne. In granting you this honour, I thank you for your dedicated service to your peers, to your community and to Canada. The contributions you have made to our nation are most commendable and deserve our praise and admiration. Allan Gotlib's DreamsWhen asked by the press in 2012, what piece of advice he had for young Canadians, Dr. Gotlib's response was, \"Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. Dream to suc-ceed - then work hard!\" Dr. Gotlib is still dreaming and says he cannot visualize where we would be today with-out the Research Chair/Professorship program.Figure 5. Dr. 2016; 60(1) 121DM Brown This pr ogram has a catalyst for our profes- sion and brought believability and trust but it is limited by the funding available, which is small compared to other professions. The current Chairs and Professorships give our researchers and clin - icians access to millions and millions of dollars in infrastructure which the profession could never af-ford. Creating the evidence our profession needs to satisfy the public and policy makers requires highly sophisticated technologies and equipment. In order for our profession to grow, this program must grow. [Email, A. Gotlib to the author, Mar 19, 2014] Lately Dr. Gotlib's dreams have become even more vivid and expansive. The futur e is evidence-based! We have a growing research culture and collective intellectual cap-acity. Our foot is in the door and we are courting university integration, but most important to our continued success is the current strength of our mo-mentum. There are unprecedented pressures now, but building on the critical relationships estab-lished with university officials will bring tremen-dous credibility and expertise to our profession...Canada has 100 world-class universities. Imagine a chiropractic research chair in each one of those universities. Just imagine!!! 50 References: 1. CMCC Calendars 1978-2010. CMCC Archives. 2. DC. Decade of the 70s.

In his book, Fascia in Sport and Movement, he, co-author Amanda Baker and twenty-six contributing authors provide a sound evidence-based framework for fascial therapy by applying the current histological research to clinical practice. The book con-tains contributions from a wide-variety of health profes-sions, who all provide refreshing and diverse positions on this newly emerging topic. Fascia in Sport and Movement is divided into two well laid out sections. The first section discusses the research and theories of fascia as they pertain to force transmission, biochemistry, elastic storage, recoil dynamics, stretching, etc. The second section addresses the clinical applications of fascia training. This section is broad and covers num-erous movement practices, assessment technologies and manual techniques. The book does an exceptional job fitting fascial training principles into already established movement practices such as Pilates, Gyrotronics and mar - tial arts. Though the book fails to apply fascial training principles and methods to a large number of mainstream sports, it is something the authors may consider expand-ing upon in future editions. The information cited within the text is current and well referenced. Many chapters within and between the two sections also reference each other, providing a fluid read with easy navigation of the text. Fascia in Sport and Movement is an excellent addition to the bookshelf of any manual health care practitioner or student. It is the first book of its kind and I believe it is a resource that will be referenced for many years. Matt drwentzell@mountainhp.ca Manual Therapy Approaches Leon Chaitow, Editor Handspring Publishing, Scotland, UK, 2014, 266 pp., Paperback Price: $62.50 ISBN: 978-1-909141-10-0 Fascia is a trending topic of discussion among many health disciplines. Many professions are beginning to understand and acknowledge fascia's contribution to dys-function as the body of research on fascia continues to grow. Leon Chaitow is a renowned Osteopath and Nat-uropath who has authored numerous papers and books on various manual medicine topics. He and nineteen others have put together an exceptional book called Fascial Dysfunction - Manual Therapy Approaches. The book is a great resource for fascia research and provides infor - mation on various methods to clinically assess and treat fascial dysfunction. Fascial Dysfunction - Manual Therapy Approaches is divided into two sections. The first section provides a de-tailed groundwork for understanding the many roles fa-scia plays in the body. It also provides valuable informa - tion on what can happen when the fascial tissues are not performing as they should. Section two provides the reader with various tech - niques used to treat fascial dysfunction. This section is particularly worthwhile for those interested in exploring and practicing different fascial treatment methods. The largely European contribution in section two suggests that that the fascial treatment techniques provided may not be representative of the treatment methods practitioners are using in other parts of the world and is therefore some-thing that the authors may consider expanding upon in a future edition. The contributors in this section provide a treatment rationale based on both anecdotal evidence and scientific research and acknowledge limitations when necessary. I would recommend Fascial Dysfunction - Manual Therapy Appr oaches to all manual medicine practitioners who are interested in expanding their knowledge of fascia and fascia treatment techniques. Faster, Higher, Stronger - How Sports Science is Creat- ing a New Generation of Superathletes - and What We Can Learn from Them Mark McClusky Hudson Street Press, New York, 2014, 274 pp., Hardcover Price: $18.14 ISBN: 978-1-59463-153-5 Competitive and elite sport is a multi-billion dollar indus- try, which has seen numerous advancements in sport tech - nology, training principles and nutrition over the last few decades. These improvements have created a new gener - ation of athletes that are stronger, faster and more skilled than ever before. Mark McClusky is a veteran journal - ist, editor and author of the book Faster, Higher, Strong-er - How Sport Science is Creating a New Generation of Superathletes - and What We Can Learn from Them. In his book, McClusky dives into the world of elite sports to find out what it really takes to become a top athlete in the 21 st century. Faster , Higher, Stronger - How Sport Science is Cre- ating a New Generation of Superathletes - and What We Can Learn from Them details how athletes and coaches are using science and technology to achieve new levels of human performance. McClusky explains that raw tal-ent; hard work and good coaching are no longer enough to achieve elite level status because these advancements are changing the way that athletes eat, train and recover. Improvements that have been made in the fields of sport supplements, sport analysis, recovery, and exercise physi-ology are detailed in the book and McClusky emphasizes that it is the synergistic interplay between them that pro-vides top athletes with a competitive edge.Through a combination of scientific literature, interviews, and occasional reflection of personal experience, Mc-Clusky has put together a strong and convincing basis for how teams of coaches, trainers, nutritionist, and sci-entists, influence an athlete's performance in their sport. The scientific literature that is referenced appears to come from credible sources and the conversations that he nar - rates come from top product engineers, athletes, coaches, and sport analysts from a wide variety of sports. I would recommend Faster , Higher, Stronger - How Sport Science is Creating a New Generation of Superath-letes - and What We Can Learn from Them to any sport and performance enthusiast. It is both an entertaining and educational read and compliments books such as The Sport Gene and The Talent Code, which also provide in-sight into the evolution of elite sport and athletics. Matt B.Kin, Sport and Exercise Shaun Phillips Routledge, New York, 2015, 288 pp., Hardcover Price: $179.55 ISBN: 978-0-415-74222-1 Fatigue in sport has become a topic of interest among ath- letes, coaches and sport scientists because it affects ath-letic performance across a wide range of sports. Shaun Phillips is a sport physiology professor at the University of Edinburgh and has studied how peripheral and central mechanisms may impact fatigue. His text; Fatigue in Sport and Exercise, is the first book of its kind. Shaun synthesized a great deal of fatigue research into a go-to resource for those in the sport and exercise physiology field. Though his book does not provide \"all the answers\", he presents the information and research in a way that's easy to read and understand. Fatigue in Sport and Exercise is broken into four parts. Part 1 sheds light on the difficulty in defining fatigue and some of the ways in which fatigue is measured. Part 2 discusses many potential mechanisms of fatigue includ - ing metabolic acidosis, dehydration and hyperthermia, etc. Part 3 complements Part 2 by pulling together the information across all previously discussed fatigue mech - anisms based on different types of exercise (i.e. short distance vs. middle distance sports). The book concludes in Part 4 with some thoughts on the direction of fatigue research, the interpretation of this research, and some rec-ommendations with respect to keeping abreast the fatigue literature. Shaded \"Key Point\" boxes are littered throughout the test, which summarize the most important concepts of each chapter. This provides the reader with a great review and easy reference in the future. Although this book is the first of its kind, the current list price may be a barrier for some interested in the material. Irrespective of the price, I would recommend Fatigue in Sport and Exercise to all those working with an athletic population.
