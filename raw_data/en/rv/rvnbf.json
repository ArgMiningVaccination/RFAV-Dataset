To heal issues within yourself, place healing crystals on the body near one of the seven chakras. It is also effective to put healing crystals near your pulse. Wearing crystals in jewelry as a bracelet or necklace are great ways to experience the positive energy of crystals at all times. To dispel negative energy from your home: - Place black tourmaline in the corners of each room. - If you want to protect the entire house, create a grid and put healing crystals in all of the critical areas of your home. - Connect these areas by uniting the crystals through mediation and intention setting.

How do you charge the energy in a crystal? Charging crystals is vital to access the full power of the stone's energy. Since crystals get their energy from Nature, it is best to recharge them from natural sources like water, sunlight, or moonlight. Each crystal has a preferred recharging method, so make sure to do your research. For example, some stones cannot be submerged and would therefore require the moon or sunlight for cleansing and energy charging. "}
