Spirit Medicines is a Folk Healing Center/Centro de Sanaci\u00f3n focused on helping heal mind, body, & spirit with ancestral medicine. Here we offer Native American/Indigenous based Healings, Classes, Art & Ceremonies. Healings & Classes are donation based or sliding scale, honoring these traditions and making healing accessible to all the community and community ceremonies are always free. We are a small growing collective of traditional healers , spiritual guides, and Ajq'ijab . Ajq'ijab translates to counter of the days or counter of time, yet we are referred to as spiritual guides. We are keepers of the sacred calendars and various divinatory systems, Healers and Diviners, watching the signs and spirits speak messages. We are those who translate the ancient wisdom. We offer from our hearts , al corazon del cielo y corazon de tierra a space for Indigenous Art, Healings, Ceremonies, & Classes. CENTRO DE sanacion At Spirit Medicines we believe all healing begins outdoors and with ones re-connection to nature, our mother earth, Tonantzin Tlalli . Our sacred space is mostly outdoors one with the elements. It also consists of a healing yurt studio, tiny home office, and ceremonial tipi. Classes & Healings are led inside a tipi or yurt, as these indigenous round structures hold power and maintain a connection to the outdoors. Limpias are held outside, as are all community ceremonies. Ancestral MedicinE Curanderismo is holistic medicine, where one acknowledges healing must occur in all 3 plans; the physical, spiritual, & emotional. We look to the root of illness using indigenous teachings, medicine tools, plants, and wisdom. The foundation of Curanderismo is to not to just treat an illness, but also to look at how and from where it manifested in the emotional body. For all illnesses, problems, disease, conditions form physically in the body from a directly related illness in the soul. 2023 Upcoming Classes & Special Events "}
