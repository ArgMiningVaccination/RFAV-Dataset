The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:10 p.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Morella, counsel and parliamentarian; Mark Corallo, director of communica-tions; S. Elizabeth Clay and Nicole Petrosino, professional staffmembers; Lisa Smith Arafune, chief clerk; Robert A. Briggs, assist-ant clerk; Robin Butler, manager; Ellen Rayner, minority chief clerk; and JeanGosa and Earley Green, minority assistant clerks. Mr. B URTON . Good afternoon. A quorum being present, the Com- mittee on Government Reform will come to order. The ranking Democrat, Mr. Waxman, is on his way. He said he would be a little bit late. We thought we would go ahead and getstarted. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' writ- ten opening statements be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered.I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits and extra- neous and tabular material referred to be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered.Today, the Committee on Government Reform begins the first of 2 days of cancer hearings. During the 2 days of our hearings, over3,200 lives will be lost to cancer and 6,575 individuals will be toldthat they have cancer. This hearing will address four issues. Pediatric cancers and the challenges parents face in making treatment decisions, racial disparity in cancer treatments, reim-bursement issues related to complementary therapies in an oncol-ogy setting, and anti-tumor drug development from natural prod-ucts. Probably the only thing more difficult than personally being diag- nosed with cancer is the diagnosis of cancer for your child. A recentNew England Journal of Medicine article stated that one out of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul with cancer will die from the disease \u2014one out of four. Unfortunately, many of them will die without a referralto a hospice and with poor pain management. The referral to a hos-pice can reduce the pain and fear of children who are terminallyill. In 1999, it was estimated that 7,800 children in the United States would be diagnosed with cancer. Forty-two families inUnited States will be told their child has cancer during the 2 daysof our hearings. They will have to make care and treatment deci-sions based on what their physicians and oncologists tell them andwhat they can learn on their own from their family and friends andon the Internet. Fortunately, the recent addition of the ClinicalTrials data base on the National Institutes of Health 's Web site makes it easier for families to learn about clinical trials. Today, my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce, will share with us her experience about losing a child to neuro-blastoma this past fall. Neuroblastoma is a rare nerve cancer thatstrikes 500 children in this country each year. Michael and Raphaele Horwin lost their only child, 2-year-old Al- exander \u2014that is a picture of him up there \u2014to medulloblastoma last year. Medulloblastoma is a brain cancer. They have done anexcellent job of putting together a chronology of quotes drawn frompeer-reviewed medical journal articles on cancer research. Thestatements show that, as parents, they were justified in their con-cern about the effects of the drugs offered as ''state-of-the-art. '' We will also hear from James Navarro, the father of Thomas. Last summer, when Thomas was barely 4 years old, he was diag-nosed with medulloblastoma. That is a picture of him. After re-searching their options, the family decided that the best course ofaction for Thomas was a non-toxic treatment available through aFood and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial. Unfortu-nately, the Food and Drug Administration denied Thomas access tothis clinical trial because he had not first gone through and failedchemotherapy and radiation. Many of you may recall a hearing 2 years ago when Dustin Kunnari \u2014that is a picture of Dustin \u2014testified. Dustin, who was the last child that the Food and Drug Administration allowed to re-ceive this treatment as a first choice, is healthy and without havingsuffered the life-altering side effects of chemotherapy and radi-ation. He is not alone in surviving cancer through the use ofantineoplastons and not suffering the irreversible side effects ofother more toxic treatments. You might take a look at him and hisfamily. I think we have some other slides. These are children that sur- vived. Thomas ' story struck a chord with many Americans who feel strongly that the decision to access another treatment protocol out-side the ''standard '' cancer protocols of chemotherapy and radiation should be the patient 's choice and not the decision of a government agency. In fact, I have introduced, and many of my colleagues havecosponsored, H.R. 3677, the Thomas Navarro Patient 's Rights Act as a remedy for this situation. This bill would assure that patients would have the option to make an informed decision to participate in clinical trials after VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul informed of all of their options, rather than being forced to accept a treatment with known toxic side effects. Unfortunately, right now, the FDA can put a clinical trial on hold for a treatment that is safe and has no serious side effects be-cause the FDA is satisfied with existing treatments, even treat-ments that can cause serious adverse events including sterility,stunted growth, hormone disorders, blindness, hearing loss, mentalretardation and secondary cancers. H.R. 3677 is a first step in assuring medical freedom in the United States. There is something inherently wrong with a system when doctors threaten to have a child with cancer taken away from parents andput in State custody when they refuse to subject their child tochemotherapy as a means of forcing treatment. How can it be thatin the United States of America a doctor can and will have theState 's Child Protective Services take a child with cancer away from his or her parents, with charges of child neglect and abuse,when those parents love their child enough to question administer-ing drugs that can do severe and irreparable harm? These childrenare then placed in foster care so that the child can be subjected tochemotherapy and radiation. This is exactly how the Navarros andother families have been threatened by government agencies. These threatening tactics by the medical profession on families must stop, and they must stop now. In his State of the Union address on January 22, 1971, President Richard Nixon declared a war on cancer. The thought was that ifwe took the same approach with curing cancer as we did with put-ting a man on the moon, pouring lots of funding into the issue,then we could beat cancer. In 1984, the National Cancer Institute 's director predicted that cancer deaths would be reduced 50 percentby the year 2000. There is a slide showing what the actual situa-tion is. The American taxpayer has invested over $43 billion in the Na- tional Cancer Institute, the primary government cancer researchagency, during the past 29 years. What has that taxpayer invest-ment accomplished? Dr. Robert Wittes will be updating the com-mittee on the activities of the National Cancer Institute, focusingon the areas of complementary and alternative medicine and natu-ral product drug development. Dr. Steven Straus, the new Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, is appearing before thecommittee for the first time. Surveys indicate that the majority ofcancer patients will use some form of a complementary or alter-native medicine treatment during the course of their disease, somewill integrate complementary therapies with conventional ap-proaches, and others will choose a treatment as an alternative toconventional medicine. What has the Center accomplished to dateand what are the Center 's research plans for the future? Earlier this year, Dr. Straus announced his intentions to develop a frontier sciences research program. Frontier sciences can be de-fined as areas of science and medicine outside the mainstream, in-cluding consciousness studies, subtle energies in biology, the sci-entific basis of alternative and complementary medicine, and theinterface of science and spirituality. Research in this area of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul offer significant advances in how we treat and prevent cancer in this new millennium. At some point in the future, we willhave a hearing looking specifically at this field. We have asked Dr. Jeffrey Kang of the Health Care Financing Administration to outline the current and planned activities in re-imbursement of complementary and alternative therapies for can-cer patients under Medicare. Dr. Robert Pazdur will present testimony about clinical trials in alternative cancer treatments on behalf of the Food and Drug Ad-ministration. He has been asked to provide information about thenumber and types of calls received regarding these types of clinicaltrials. We have received complaints from families who, when call-ing the FDA to gain information about possible inclusion in theantineoplaston clinical trials, were offered negative informationabout Dr. Burzynski 's clinical trials. These individuals felt that the FDA staff was attempting to dissuade patient participation. We will also hear from Dr. Jeremy Geffen, who we asked to re- turn and specifically address reimbursement challenges from theperspective of an oncologist in private practice who integrates com-plementary therapies in his treatment. Mr. Roger Cary, the chief operating officer of Cancer Treatment Centers of America, has learned that patients fare better when al-lowed to select an integrated treatment approach, including thera-peutic nutrition, spiritual care, exercise and massage therapy pro-grams, and naturopathic medicine. Unfortunately, as long as mostcomplementary therapies are not reimbursed, the best approach totreating cancer, an integrated approach, remains available only tothose who have the means to pay out of pocket. The poor peoplejust do not have a chance to be involved in that. Dr. George Devries, president and chief executive officer of Amer- ican Specialty Health Plans, will share with us how 25 millionAmericans have been able to access companies ' complementary and alternative therapies through complementary and alternative bene-fits programs, network programs and discount network programs,have been beneficial. The challenges of cancer are immense and complex and at times very emotional. Anybody who has had anybody in their family thathas had cancer knows what I am talking about. Last year, withina 2-year span, I lost both of my parents to lung cancer. My wifeis a 6-year survivor of breast cancer, in large part, I believe, dueto her participation in a clinical trial to test an alternative cancerprotocol. As a committee and a Congress, we must remain vigilantin our oversight of the war on cancer and look for ways to improveresearch, access and care. The hearing record will remain open until June 21 for those who would like to submit a statement for the hearing record. Mr. Waxman is not year here. Ms. Schakowsky, would you like to make an opening statement in place of Mr. Waxman? Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Not speaking on behalf of Mr. Waxman, but if I could just say a few words, Mr. Chairman. There was a fascinating story in yesterday 's Wall Street Journal about a treatment for a kind of leukemia and clinical trials thatwere being used in a limited way. This information got out over theInternet where patients now are engaging much more in their own VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul their own discovery of alternatives. Suddenly, there was this vast number of people who wanted to participate in thisclinical trial which presents new opportunities but also a lot of newchallenges. The manufacturer, how are they going to produce inquantity, what is the role of government in regulating that? On the other hand, I completely understand why, as a cancer vic- tim or a family member, I would certainly want this option avail-able. So I think your legislation and this discussion and this hearing about what is the balance of protecting health and safety and mak-ing sure that life-saving options are available to people and that weare not interfering with that in an unreasonable way is most im-portant. So I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the witnessestoday for this important hearing. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Do any other Members have statements they would like to make at the beginning here? If not, I would like to welcome our dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce, one of the leaders here in Con-gress, to come forth and testify. We welcome you. This is the sec-ond time I have seen you today, with our good friend Dave Thomas,and I am glad to have you. You are recognized to make an openingstatement. STATEMENT OF HON. DEBORAH PRYCE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Ms. P RYCE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My statement is some- what lengthy, and I will do my very best to cut it down and staywithin the committee 's timeframe. Mr. Chairman, we have been together twice today, once to cele- brate the unveiling of the adoption stamp, which we both workedvery hard on, and now to talk about cancer. Adoption and cancer. Those are two issues that have profoundly touched my life, one in a very happy and joyous way and the otherin the most heartbreaking. As many of you know, my family re-cently waged a battle against cancer that eventually claimed thelife of my adopted daughter Caroline. Today, I would like to sharewith you my own experience navigating our health care system inan effort to provide Caroline with the best care possible. After three trips to the pediatrician 's office to determine the cause of pain in her left leg, Caroline was finally diagnosed withcancer in September 1998. I cannot begin to describe the horrorand confusion that a parent faces. Unfortunately, the initial diag-nosis of the cancer was incorrect. But, based on this misdiagnosis,we brought Caroline to the National Institutes of Health, wherethere was a study under way focused on Ewing 's sarcoma, which we were told was the disease with which she suffered. After a couple of weeks of testing at NIH, the doctors began to doubt Caroline 's diagnosis. We then learned an even worse fate was in store for us. Caroline had neuroblastoma, a very rare nervecancer with a survival rate of less than 20 percent of children likeCaroline. Once again we had to start over and make decisions about where to seek treatment, what treatment, who to believe and who to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul a list of neuroblastoma programs across the country, but the doctors were reluctant to make a decision, and ev-erybody had their own way of treating it, and we had to decidewhich was the best course. After much research, phone calls and networking, we seized on what we thought was our best opportunity at Memorial Sloan Ket-tering in New York City. Caroline bravely endured months ofchemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and even a brief clinical remis-sion before the cancer claimed her life. So, in my view, there are a number of improvements that need to be made in the manner in which our current health care systemtreats pediatric cancer. First of all, I believe that pediatricians and parents need a wake- up call. Cancer strikes over 10,000 children in this country everyyear. It is the leading cause of death by disease in children. It isthe leading cause of death by disease in children. Parents have tobe aware of this fact, and pediatricians should be trained to lookfor even the most subtle signs of cancer and improve screening ofchildren for the disease. Children are much more likely to have their symptoms dis- missed. We were told at first it was shin splints, and then we weretold that it was growing pains. They are much more likely to havetheir symptoms dismissed, and that delays treatment, and it cer-tainly delays diagnosis. In children, this is especially detrimental,because pediatric cancers spread rapidly. Pediatricians must resisttendencies to offer a perfunctory examination of children withseemingly innocuous symptoms and just dismiss them. A simple xray or blood test would only add a small cost to our health care sys-tem and could have the invaluable benefits of timely and successfultreatment. Of course, once cancer is diagnosed, it is crucial that the type of cancer be correctly identified so the appropriate course of treat-ment may be initiated as soon as possible. Through my interactionswith other parents, I have discovered we were not alone in our mis-diagnosis. In fact, Memorial Sloan Kettering confirmed thatmisdiagnoses of small round cell tumors at an atypical age is notuncommon and perhaps is as high as 20 percent. Now, I know that this committee is looking at alternative and complementary therapies, so let me just address that very briefly.In our own experience, these therapies were not overtly presentedat all. Chairman Burton, I think you were the only person in thewhole course of our treatment to even suggest we look into it, andI appreciate that. But we did not seek them out. We had our handsand heads full enough just wading through the many options thattraditional therapies offered. However, therapies such as exposureto music and art and play, medical play especially, and other dis-tractions to keep the patients focused on something other thantreatment and/or pain were available through the institutionswhere Caroline was treated, and I view them as very positive influ- ences in her care. Beyond treatment decisions, knowledge is crucial to parents, be- cause they are the ones who must be the advocates for their chil-dren in the cancer system. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 judicial system, which I am more familiar with, we are making more and better use of court-appointed special advocates[CASAs], to help coordinate and protect the interests of children.There is no such animal in the health care system. If we had notmade it our business to know and understand every step of everyprocedure, many irreversible mistakes would have been made, I be-lieve, some of which were as serious as having the wrong kind ofcatheter inserted into our daughter surgically, to as minor butevery bit as significant to a little child as having a nurse have tostop placing an IV that wasn 't necessary, because she could have drawn blood from the catheter. Every step of the way you have tobe vigilant. Unfortunately, palliative care is also a very real part of cancer treatment that has, to a certain extent, been neglected. As a parentwatching my child suffer, I could not understand why more reliefcould not be provided in the hospital setting at the end of careCaroline 's life compared to what was available in hospice care. In my mind, there is absolutely no reason that there has to be sucha bright line between pain relief offered at the last stage of aggres-sive treatment in a hospital and that offered when alleviating painthrough the hospice system. Sadly, studies based on parental re-ports show that 89 percent of children experience substantial suf-fering in the last month of life. This study also shows a discrepancy between what parents and physicians perceive about children 's symptoms. There are a num- ber of obstacles that stand in the way of effective pain managementfor children, including perceptions about their threshold for pain,the ability of children to effectively communicate their pain, andconcerns about addictions. That is just to name a few. There isgreat need for more training and research in this area. I myself believe there is a need for more home hospice care for children. While we were fortunate enough to have this option, it isnot often available in many communities for many reasons. The de-mand is oftentimes low, thank God, but it is also difficult to staffthese organizations as people generally don 't want to even think about hospice care for children. In the interest of these kids, wehave to improve education; and, through knowledge, we have tochange attitudes. Thankfully, not all children suffer Caroline 's fate. Tremendous progress has been made in its last 30 years, and today childhoodcancer is a very curable disease in three-quarters of the patients.I have to qualify this by saying that it is largely due to greatstrides in the cure for leukemia. Solid tumor cancers are still hor-rible killers and claim a great number of our children. Continued research is the hope for cancer patients in the new millennium. The triumphs over childhood cancer are to be cele-brated, but there continue to be limitations on pediatric research.Each child diagnosed with cancer is getting only one-sixth of theFederal research support allocated to each patient afflicted with AIDS; and for every dollar spent on a patient with breast cancer,less than 30 cents is spent on a child with cancer. We need to in-vest more resources in pediatric cancer, with a focus on increasingsurvival and accessibility to care. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 also to do more to provide incentives for new drug de- velopment, which is currently lacking due in part to a very smallmarket and to liability issues that we are all aware of. Cooperationamong medical institutions, philanthropic organizations and theFederal Government can move us toward the day in the new mil-lennium where there is hope for all children and no child need fallvictim to the scourge that is cancer. I thank the committee for their indulgence. I appreciate the op- portunity to be here. [The prepared statement of Hon. Deborah Pryce follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Let me just say on behalf of the committee that we sympathize with you, and we pray for you and your family. I knowit has been a very difficult time. I watched you go through that andall my colleagues did, and when you see a good friend go throughthat or somebody in your family go through that, you feel it, too,from afar. Not nearly like you did. But you are a heck of a woman.We are very pleased you are with us today. Thank you. Does anybody have any questions?Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . I just wanted to say thank you for your testi- mony. Ms. P RYCE . I appreciate the opportunity. I think it is important that these personal experiences be related. Cancer has touched usall; and, Mr. Chairman and committee members, it is wonderfulyou are exploring this. I give you great credit. I appreciate thework you are doing here. Mr. B URTON . I have just a few questions real briefly, if you don 't mind answering them. You testified about the need to improve hospice care for children. Can you tell us how existing hospices improve their services forchildren \u2014how they can improve their services for children? Ms. P RYCE . Well, I think that the hospice care that we under- went was excellent. Unfortunately, the problem that we experi-enced is that we were not really released from traditional treat-ment until 3 days before her death, although I think it was obviousto her physician that things were imminent and I wish we hadsought hospice earlier. I think hospice care is something that Idon't have any problems with as we experienced it, but I do know it is not available in some sectors of the country and in many com-munities, especially as it relates to kids. People have a hard time seeing children be ill, and it is very dif- ficult to watch a child die. That is what hospice nurses and hospicepersonnel do. I think it is just a matter of changing attitudes andbetter educating folks. It is such an important thing. Mr. B URTON . I don 't want to cause you any additional pain by asking these questions, but you talked about a difference betweenhow her pain was managed while she was in the hospital and inthe hospice care. Can you be a little more definitive on that? Ms. P RYCE . Absolutely. We were giving Caroline a few last doses of radiation treatment before we left because we thought thatwould shrink the tumor in her brain and the spine and perhaps al-leviate some of the pain. We were doing that to reduce pain. Butthe physician in control of anesthesia at the cancer center whereshe was getting the radiation would not even allow her to have aValium for fear that, for whatever reason, she would not say, Caro-line perhaps would die. We all knew she was dying, and thereforeshe couldn 't relax, and she moved around, and it was extra painful for her. That was the afternoon that we checked out of the hospitaland went home, and at that point she had large doses of Valiumand other drugs to control her pain, which we were just asking forone small dose and it was denied her. That is when we said thisis enough. This is definitely enough. So there doesn 't have to be such a bright line between what they can do in the hospital and what they can do at home. I don 't under- stand it at all. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 talk to you about alternative pain \u2014pos- sible remedies like acupuncture or anything? Ms. P RYCE . No, that was never, ever broached. Mr. B URTON . Never even talked to you about that. You mentioned your daughter 's cancer was misdiagnosed repeat- edly. Do you feel that doctors don 't think of serious illnesses such as cancer when a child comes in with symptoms like pain? Ms. P RYCE . I absolutely feel that way. Our pediatrician group saw her at least twice, and I think three times, with this complaintin her leg, and there was never so much as an x ray ordered oranything. They did some manipulation and questioning of mydaughter. Other than that, they just dismissed it outright as justthe growing process or shin splints or whatever. She was evendragging her leg behind her. She couldn 't put pressure on it at all. Those symptoms were clearly stated, but dismissed. Mr. B URTON . The gentlelady from Florida? Ms. R OS-LEHTINEN . I just want to thank my good pal Deb for the grace and dignity which she has bestowed upon this institutionwith the way that she conducted herself through these difficulttimes. Like you said, Mr. Chairman, our prayers are with her andRandy. You know we love you, Deb. Ms. P RYCE . Thank you. I felt that all along the way from my col- leagues. It is so much appreciated. Mr. B URTON . Any other questions or comments? If not, thank you very much for being here and sharing that with us. We have some votes on the floor. We will stand in recess until the votes are over, and we will come right back. For those who are going to be testifying, I understand we will have five or six votes on the floor. We will have 15 minutes on thefirst vote, followed by five 5-minute votes. We will be gone forabout an hour. I really apologize for the time problem. I can 't control the floor. So we will be back as soon as possible. Thank you. You can restor take a little time off. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . The committee will reconvene. Mr. Elijah Cummings, one of our members, is not here today, but I wanted toextend condolences on behalf of the committee because his fatherpassed away yesterday. I hope those in the minority will be sureto extend our condolences to Representative Cummings. I know itis a tough time for him. Our second panel is Dr. Straus, Dr. Wittes, Dr. Kang and Dr. Pazdur. Would you please come forward. While they are coming forward, I would like to thank the ladies and the families that gave me this pin who lost their children tocancer. I will wear this with great pride, and I want to thank youvery much for thinking of me. I will try to make sure that your losswas not in vain. Maybe we can get some things done that willmake sure this sort of thing doesn 't happen in the future, or at least it is minimized. Would you gentleman \u2014do we have everybody? Dr. Kang, Dr. Wittes we do not have yet, Dr. Pazdur. Are they still here? Theywere downstairs having coffee? Is there anybody that can run and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul cup and lead them up here? Coffee drinkers will follow their coffee cup. We will have more Members come as time progresses. I ran back here. That is why I am perspiring, because I didn 't want to hold you folks up any longer. So we have now Dr. Wittes with us, and we are waiting on Dr. Pazdur. Is he down having coffee? Hello? Does anybody know? Why don 't we go ahead and get started. I will swear him in when he gets back. Will you gentleman please rise? Are you Dr. Pazdur? Oh, he is in the men 's room. Have a seat. We will wait just a minute. Dr. W ITTES . After all that coffee. Dr. P AZDUR . Sorry, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Pazdur. Well, we understand you had coffee and made a stop on the way. We are glad you are prepared for thehearing. I apologize to you once again for the delay in our hearing. Will you please rise, please.[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Thank you, and let the record reflect that the wit- nesses responded in the affirmative. On behalf of the committee I want to welcome you all here today. You are all recognized to make an opening statement, if you please. We will start with Dr. Straus. STATEMENTS OF DR. STEPHEN E. STRAUS, NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; DR.ROBERT WITTES, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE; DR. JEFF- ERY KANG, HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION;AND DR. RICHARD PAZDUR, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRA-TION Dr. S TRAUS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is an honor to appear before the committee for the first time and to address the opportu-nities that complementary and alternative medicine have to offerin the management of cancer. As you commented in your opening remarks, about two in five Americans rely on some forms of complementary and alternativemedicine, and more than four in five cancer patients do so, by thesurvey conducted by our new colleague in NCCAM, Dr. Mary AnnRichardson, when she was our grantee at the University of Texasin Houston. The vast majority of this use is complementary in nature to alle- viate the terrible symptoms and complications, and the minority ofuse is as alternative therapy. I can tell you, as one who has lost loved ones to cancer, that I understand the desperation and the needs of patients, but Iwouldn 't attempt to be as eloquent as the honorable speaker was prior to the break in commenting upon the needs of her child. As a physician, however, I can say that I understand the frustra- tion that we face on a daily basis, knowing that we cannot provideour patients everything that they truly deserve. My responsibility as a scientist and as the first director of NCCAM, however, really requires me to take the long-term look toinvest in a rigorous fashion, in approaches that will provide theAmerican public the definitive answers they need for the future. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul good reasons to think that some CAM modalities would be beneficial. We know that to be the case with somebotanicals, such as St. John 's Wort for depression, but in studying these modalities we become increasingly aware of unanticipatedadverse reactions. The imperative to study them carefully is evengreater. For example in today 's New England Journal of Medicine, there is a cautionary tale from Europe of a Chinese herb that not onlyfailed to alleviate suffering, but caused cancer in women. So this is a complex and challenging enterprise, and NCCAM 's approach is to harness the tools of rigorous science in a very open-minded fashion. Our strategic plan for doing so is now posted onour Web site for public comment, and it outlines the tiered ap-proach we are going to use. Cancer is one of our most important targets. We survey the en- tire field of medicine in our efforts, but by virtue of the needs ofcancer patients, this is a priority for us. Shortly after assuming directorship I met with Dr. Richard Klausner, the Director of NCI. We have met multiple times sincethen. I have met with Dr. Wittes and Dr. Jeff White, his colleague,on a monthly basis to discuss a joint portfolio to make sure we areharnessing our collaborative resources as well as possible. Our portfolio is still evolving. We have just completed our first year in NCCAM having been established in February 1999, and ourbudget for this year invests in cancer at three times what it didlast year, and our best judgment for our budget-expected potentialfor 2010 would be an additional doubling. We are already funding a collaborative project with the NCI the first large definitive trial of shark cartilage as a therapy for non-small-cell lung carcinoma. We are investing in controversial thera-pies as well, such as the study at Colombia University of Dr. Gon-zalez 's nutritional approach to the management of pancreatic can- cer, for which the standard therapies are suboptimal. With the NCI we have agreed to use a novel and expedited re- view process known as the quick trials mechanisms for fundinggrants, and we jointly benefit from the availability and the adviceof the Cancer Advisory Panel on Complementary and AlternativeMedicine [CAPCAM], which has the responsibility, among otherthings, to advise us about novel therapies through the best-case se-ries mechanism. We are currently funding two such best-case stud-ies, and we are looking forward in the September meeting to addi-tional ones. This very week we reviewed for the first time applications to fund large centers dedicated exclusively to CAM approaches to can-cer. All of these efforts combined need to be communicated effectively to the American public, and we do so with a very aggressive com-munications and outreach portfolio. In my first months in NCCAM I realized that our fact sheets and our written material providedby the NCCAM clearinghouse is inadequate. We are currently en-gaged in writing an additional 46 of them, including 10 on canceralone, together with the NCI. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 also funding, starting today, Dr. Jim Gordon 's Conference on Comprehensive Cancer Care, which I have the pleasure of ad-dressing Saturday. So, in my first several months, I have joined an active and dy- namic group. We have doubled its size already in the past 7months. We look forward to building an aggressive and very excel-lent scientific portfolio addressing CAM and cancer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. would you like to address the commit- tee? Dr. W ITTES . My name is Robert Wittes. I am the Deputy Director of Extramural Science at the National Cancer Institute. With meis Dr. Jeff White, who is the Director of the Cancer Institute 's Of- fice of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. It is a pleasurefor us to be here as well to tell you about some of the progress wehave made in the areas of interest to the committee. The title of the hearings today, Integrative Oncology, is an inter- esting way of expressing the notion that our object really in medi-cine, in oncology specifically, is to put together everything that weknow for the benefit of the patient, whatever it is and wherever itcomes from. Now, in order to do that in the best way, you have to have high standards for evidence, because ultimately things hang on the an-swer to the question, does it work? It has seemed to us, and itseems to many people, this is not a unique insight, that there can 't be multiple different standards surrounding the issue of how rigor-ous evidence needs to be. It is probably worth commenting that that is actually a rather recent notion in medicine \u2014if medicine is 4,000 or 5,000 years of age\u2014in the last half century or so, and it has pervaded the medical community, actually, gradually over that period of time. I wouldsay also perhaps somewhat unevenly. Different people have forthemselves different standards of evidence for what \u2014the judgment of what works. So when one is talking about the mainstream medical commu- nity and the complementary and alternative medicine community,there is sometimes the assumption that there is a two-culturesissue here. But I think times are changing, and my own observa-tion is that there are enough like-minded people on both sides ofthe mainstream in alternative communities to meet in the middleand to interact productively in ways that will really move the eval-uation of evidence in the direction that I think most of us think itought to be moving. There is evidence that this is already happening, I think, and one can see the establishment of complementary and alternativemedicine units in academic medical centers and in some medicalschool curricula. The meeting here in Washington that Dr. Straus just referred to is, I think, an example of an organizational effort that has reallymade an effort to bring all of the various people and constituenciesthat are interested in the care of the patient together to see wheth-er this kind of integration can occur at the care level and also atthe research level. There have been multiple actions by the NIH.There are parts of the NIH to bridge the gap between mainstreamNCCAM communities, and Dr. Straus already mentioned several ofthem, and I have summarized these, the NCI contribution to this,in my written testimony which I am, of course, submitting in par-allel with these oral comments. The organization of the Office of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the Cancer Institute is actually sort of an organiza-tional embodiment of our belief that it would be wrong for us toisolate complementary and alternative medicine from the activities VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul rest of the Institute. The reason we were interested in set- ting this up as a coordinating office within our Institute was sothat everywhere that it made sense within the Institute, the var-ious programs that we have, could begin to address matters thatare currently called complementary and alternative. I think wehave started to do this. The organization of the CAPCAM, jointlywith the NCCAM, is an example of how we are attempting to inte-grate expertise from both communities. We have a very aggressive best-case series program which we started a number of years ago, actually, to try to elicit from thecommunity of complementary and alternative practitioners evi-dence, bodies of evidence, that they have obtained in the processof their practices that should be considered by the medical commu-nity at large for action. We are trying to aggressively advertise theexistence of this process in the hope that people will come forwardand bring ideas that they have, evidence they have, about interven-tions to us. Dr. White has done a terrific job of writing letters to about 150 different people about this. We have a leaflet that is going to bedistributed at the conference here. We have a Web site now thatadvertises the details of this and will go into further detail as itis developed. This is actually a major focus of our impetus that we have to try to bring these communities together and evaluate evidence thatlooks promising. We have started a clinical trials effort, and Dr. Straus has men- tioned some of the examples of this. I also have to mention thatthere is a new evaluation panel, a peer review evaluation panel forclinical oncology proposals, that spans the spectrum of clinical on-cology that I expect will be the perfect place for complementary andalternative medicine investigators to come in with clinical propos-als. My expectation is they will get a fair review in that setting,and I have asked Dr. White to pay particular attention to the flowof applications into the Institute and to make sure that CAM issuesare adequately represented on that committee. In the matter of providing information, we are working closely with the NCCAM about this. Our protocol data base CancerNet,part of which, PDQ, has been in existence since the mid-1980 's or so, has recently been totally revamped and updated; and as partof this a couple of years ago we decided to take down a lot of theinformation that we have on complementary and alternative ap-proaches for the reason that Dr. Straus already mentioned, that wejust considered them inadequate, and we have been rebuilding thisand putting it back up and attempting to have fair-minded andcomplete evidence-based reviews of what is going on in the CAMarea. So let me just in the interest of time move on quickly to the nat- ural products area, because I know that is of interest to you, Mr.Chairman, in particular. This is an area, of course, that is very oldin medicine, it is about as mainstream as you can get, but with im-portant conceptual links, interesting conceptual links to the worldof complementary and alternative medicine. For natural products, one thinks of a whole variety of medicines in medicine \u2014morphine for pain, quinine derivatives for cardiac VerDate 11-MAY-2000 failure, any number of antibiotics for bacterial infections, and the statins for cholesterol lowering;and, of course, vincristine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, camptothecins,taxol, taxotere and other anticancer drugs all come from one or an-other corner of the natural world. Now, the notion of the natural world as a repository of medicinal chemicals actually provides a pretty clear conceptual link betweenthe world of hard science on the one hand and the world of alter-native practices on the other. There is nothing complementary oralternative about natural products ' chemistry. What you have there is a body of really rigorous science that can be used to explain, ifwe are clever about it, real observations that are made with natu-ral substances that may come out of the experience of practitionersthat are doing empirical kinds of therapies that they have a feelingwork and they have observed seem to work. The issue for us is to really tack this down as much as possible and make it as rigorous as possible. There are some interestingcomplexities and differences in the approaches between these twoworlds. Natural products chemists tend to be really interested inpure compounds. They are interested in fishing out pure com-pounds from impure extracts and trying to define what is activeand what is not within these extracts. Whereas traditional practi-tioners and traditional kinds of medical practice frequently empha-size the efficacy of complex mixtures. So one of the things we are going to have to confront as an Insti- tute in the not-too-distant future is this matter of how we can rig-orously evaluate the kinds of complex mixtures that may come tothe best-case series and may possibly look good to the people doingthe evaluations in the best-case series. So where do we want to go with all of this? We actually feel that the natural products effort is so important even in the changingscientific context that we are in now that we really want tostrengthen it. The search for new drugs involves basically the answer to two questions: Where do you look for the new drugs and how do youlook for them? The traditional answer to the where question is inthe natural world. That is why natural products are so important.People look there. The traditional answer to the how do you look question is you set up screens, you set up assays of some sort based on some em-pirical effect, in the case of cancer, like cell killing, and then youexpose the assay to mixtures of natural products or syntheticchemicals and you see what happens. That is how a lot of drugshave been discovered. Both these things are changing now, actu-ally. They are changing in remarkable ways. The answer to the where question is now not only natural prod- ucts and pure chemicals, it is complex libraries that clever chemistscan actually synthesize in their laboratories, generating hugeamounts of chemical diversity there. The answer to the how ques-tion is now no longer empirical but involves concentration on mo-lecular targets. In the Wall Street Journal article yesterday that was already mentioned with the new compound for leukemia is an example ac-tually of a synthetic search for a ligand to a molecular target. The VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 about this and the reason I am bringing this up in this kind of detail is that these changes, the increasing amount ofscience in cancer drug discovery now, do not make natural productsless important. In fact, sometimes they probably make them moreimportant, because the natural world is probably the best singleplace to find a diversity of structures that no chemist, no matterhow smart, would ever have had the insight to synthesize a ligandto a particular target that might be as useful against cancer. So we are currently thinking about ways to increase this re- source and broaden it so it is not only an internal resource for theInstitute but it is made available on a competitive basis, to discov-ery laboratories across the country that wish to employ naturalproducts in their own discovery efforts. I think in the interests of time I will stop here.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Wittes. We will get back to you with some questions shortly. [The prepared statement of Dr. Wittes follows:] VerDate ANG. I was going to say he could have my time if it means I didn 't have to testify. I am kidding. Mr. Chairman, distinguished committee members, thank you for inviting us to discuss Medicare coverage for complementary and al-ternative therapies and experimental treatments, as well as our ef-forts to address racial disparities in health care. We are well aware of the increasing integration of alternative therapies into conventional therapy. I have referred my own pa-tients for treatment such as acupuncture in my own private pa-tience. However, for Medicare coverage and payment to be made, there must be reliable scientific evidence that a treatment is reasonableand necessary. To date, there has been a paucity of such evidencefor complementary and alternative modalities, and we are actuallyeager and anxious to work with our colleagues at NIH, FDA andthe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicineto address the necessary evidence needed for Medicare coverage de-cisions. Once that evidence is generated that Dr. Wittes and Dr. Straus referred to and it is adequate, we will move quickly to provide cov-erage whenever and wherever that evidence is sufficient, withinthe limits of our statutorily defined benefit categories. For experimental therapies, Medicare has historically not covered them because they do not meet the statutory requirement for rea-sonable and necessary. However, as the President announced thismorning, we will explicitly authorize payment for routine patientcare costs associated with clinical trials. Furthermore, the Presi-dent asked us by Executive order this morning to report to himwithin 90 days regarding the feasibility and advisability of provid-ing additional financial support for the non-covered or non-routinecosts associated with clinical trials. We want to do all we can to help generate the kinds of data we need to make prompt coverage decisions on experimental and alter-native treatments. Our new open and accountable coverage deter-mination process will help that. For example, we \u2014following our testimony last fall, my agency 's testimony last fall to this committee, we actually thoroughly re-viewed all of the studies cited in the National Institutes of HealthConsensus Conference on Acupuncture in 1997. That conferenceconcluded that the scientific evidence suggests that acupuncture ispromising for the treatment of conditions such as chemotherapy-re-lated nausea and vomiting and post-operative dental pain. We will actually use that information as a starting point, and we have just initiated a national coverage determination process tolook at those two cases for coverage in Medicare, and we are re-questing any additional scientific information that has been gen-erated since 1997. We also have several initiatives under way to address racial dis- parities in care. We are particularly focusing on making health care and health care information understandable and obtainablefor all populations, and we are stressing the importance of culturalcompetency, which emphasizes the need to recognize and respectthe use of beneficiaries ' traditional treatments and beliefs from VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul they may come from and then to integrate them into the conventional medical care that we pay for. We greatly appreciate the desire of this committee for wider cov- erage of alternative and experimental therapies and steps to ad-dress racial disparities in care. We will continue to work closelywith our colleagues on this panel today to develop the scientificknowledge and evidence we need for coverage. We will also movequickly to implement the revised coverage policy regarding routinecosts announced by the President today, and we are committed toworking to address reducing racial disparities. I thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee members, for the op- portunity to testify today and am looking forward to answering anyquestions you may have. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Kang. [The prepared statement of Dr. Kang follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 AZDUR . Mr. Chairman, members, I am Richard Pazdur, MD, Director of the Division of Oncology Drug Products at the Centerfor Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Adminis-tration. Prior to coming to the FDA 9 months ago, I was at theUniversity of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for11 years, where I was involved in patient care, research, medicaleducation and administration. To the extent that information ispublicly available, I would like to address the specific issues inyour letter. We understand that cancer patients and their families are often unfamiliar with the FDA 's statutory responsibilities. To more thoughtfully work with the concerns of cancer patients and fami-lies, the FDA hired staff in 1994 who are available to answer ques-tions and discuss concerns. I would now like to address the issues in your letter.Our primary obligations are those vested in us by Congress in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to help ensure that mar-keted medical drugs are properly labeled, safe and effective andthat the procedures and studies conducted on unapproved drugsare designed to protect the vulnerable, particularly patients withlife-threatening diseases such as cancer. The FDA is interested ingood clinical studies and data, independent of the type of therapyused. It does not matter whether a drug is labeled alternative, com-plementary or conventional. You asked us to address patient access to unapproved drugs. The access process starts with a sponsor, usually a drug company, seek-ing to develop a new drug. Testing experimental drugs in patientspresents medical and ethical dilemmas. Medical and ethical stand-ards prohibit substitution of an unproven drug where curativetreatments are available. For example, in the initial treatment of Hodgkin 's disease, testic- ular cancer, child leukemia and medulloblastoma, there are cura-tive therapies. Therefore, the use of an unproven drug before thestandard therapy has been used is medically imprudent and ethi-cally unacceptable. The ideal mechanism for a patient to receive a promising but unproven drug is in a controlled clinical trial. Such trials provideappropriate patient protections and potential benefits. It is not al-ways possible, however, for each patient who might benefit fromthe drug to enroll in clinical trips. Our regulations allow patientsto have access to unapproved drugs even though they cannot enterclinical trials. In the drug development process, the sponsor must decide wheth- er it is willing to make the unapproved drug available for an indi-vidual patient. If the sponsor is not willing, even if the FDA hasno objections, the patient will not be able to obtain the unapproveddrug. One may ask, why is the FDA involved in this process? Because the FDA has access to confidential information about the safety ofthe unapproved agent, our participation in the decisionmakingprocess is critical. We work closely with the sponsor and the pa-tient 's physician. For patients for whom no curative therapy exists, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul to liberally allow patients access to unap- proved drugs. Mr. Chairman, you asked, can an unapproved therapy believed to be less toxic be tried prior to a curative therapy that has knownserious adverse events? The answer is no. The most important as-pect of any potential cancer therapy is the likelihood for prolonginglife or, hopefully, cure. Indirectly, drugs can be harmful if they leadpeople to delay or reject proven therapies, possibly worsening theircondition. The first chance for a cure is the best chance for a cure. This is because progressive tumor growth and deterioration in a patient 's health makes subsequent therapy much more difficult. Researchersare always focusing on the goal of new and better treatments withminimal side effects. For example, in childhood leukemia, progress has been made in improving the cure rate and decreasing the toxicity. With carefulobservation and no compromise in cure rate, well-designed clinicaltrials allow the development of less toxic therapies. Now the curerates for some kinds of childhood leukemias are greater than 90percent. Mr. Chairman, we are often asked the question, how should we balance public health protection with personal autonomy? We thinkthe Congress has established the balancing correctly in the Food,Drug and Cosmetic Act. As a practicing oncologist for over 20years, I understand that some patients will never stop seekingtreatment that they think might help them. Our regulations pro-tect the public from unsafe and ineffective drugs but also are flexi-ble and allow desperately ill patients access to promising unap-proved therapies. Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify. I would ap- preciate if my full written statement would be entered into therecord. I will be happy to answer any questions the committee mayhave. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. of VerDate Pazdur, let me start with you. As an expert in colon and rectal cancer, can you please state your expertise in med-ulloblastoma? Dr. P AZDUR . Medulloblastoma, I do not treat pediatric oncology patients. The decision at the FDA regarding special exceptions toNDAs for pediatric oncology drugs is handled by a board-certifiedpediatric oncologist. This is reviewed by myself and is also re-viewed by a team leader who is a board-certified medical oncologistand also at the office level. In cases \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I guess the answer is you do not have any expertise in medulloblastoma? Dr. P AZDUR . I am not a pediatric medical oncologist. Mr. B URTON . Well, I didn 't need to have the whole history there. I just wanted to ask you that question, do you have any expertisein that area, and you say no. Dr. P AZDUR . No, I do not have personal expertise in that area. Mr. B URTON . You are familiar with the legislation that I have sponsored, I presume, aren 't you, the Thomas Navarro bill? Dr. P AZDUR . I have read it, yes. Mr. B URTON . You are familiar with the situation with the Thom- as Navarro boy? Dr. P AZDUR . I am intimately aware of the case. We have spent many hours considering our decision in this case. Mr. B URTON . Can you tell me what the side effects are for chem- otherapy and radiation on a person who has that ailment? Dr. P AZDUR . OK. The side effects for chemotherapy and radiation and the discussion of toxicities need to be individualized for a givenpatient. Mr. B URTON . Well, let 's be a little bit more general than that. Do you have a list of the side effects that we have \u2014that we have found out about with chemotherapy and radiation? The reason Ibring that up, Doctor, is because in the case of that boy and severalothers that we have had contact with, the side effects \u2014mental re- tardation, a whole host of which I will read to you in just a mo-ment \u2014cause a lot of the parents to be very concerned about Dr. Burzynski 's treatment down there and how it might be as effective or more effective without the potential side effects. The adverseevents we understand include sterility, stunted growth, hormonedisorders, blindness, hearing loss, mental retardation and second-ary cancers. Now, in the case of the boy we are talking about and others that have had this kind of treatment that Dr. Burzynski has advocatedand performed down there \u2014in a clinical trial, I might add \u2014they had some pretty good results. We have talked to some of the par-ents who have had some remarkable results with this kind of treat-ment. Yet because the Navarro boy 's parents did not want him to go through the potential side effects that might arise from chemo-therapy and radiation, they decided they wanted to have the alter-native therapy that is in a clinical trial that Dr. Burzynski pro-posed. The problem they ran into is they said he could not take thealternative therapy, which is in a clinical trial, until he had takenchemotherapy and radiation; and they went so far as to say that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul did not take the chemo and radiation first, which had these potential side effects, that the State agencies might come in andtake the boy from the parents and force the foster parents or who-ever took charge of the child to give the boy chemotherapy and ra-diation in spite of the possibilities of the side effects. So I guess my question is this: Why should that family or any family, when there is a clinical trial going on, have to go throughwhat they perceived to be a real danger to their child, chemo-therapy and radiation, when there is another approach in clinicaltrials that might provide better treatment and longer survivabilityfor the child? Dr. P AZDUR . The answer to the question is a very complicated answer. When we are dealing basically with a decision of therapy,there is a question of efficacy and toxicity, how well does the ther-apy work, how well has it been established to work. The conventional therapies for medulloblastoma is one of the few success stories of pediatric oncology in that it allows a curative po-tential in over 75 percent of patient \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . May I interrupt you real briefly? Because I saw some of the children cured by this treatment. I saw them. Theywere mentally retarded, they couldn 't talk, they couldn 't speak. The cancer supposedly was cured, but the child was a vegetable.I am not sure that that is what those parents envisioned when theywent through the conventional treatment. So why shouldn 't\u2014and I see my time has run out and I will yield to my colleagues, but why shouldn 't a parent have the right to choose between a clinical trial that is ongoing and a treatment thatmight endanger their child 's life or health dramatically? Dr. P AZDUR . First of all, the patient did not qualify for the clini- cal trial in that the clinical trial is written that patients need tohave had progressive disease on standard therapy. This is gettingback to the major issue that formulated our decision, and that isthe curative potential standard therapy that has been well-testedover decades, that has led to the cure in patients. Now, granted, you have seen examples of children that have probably suffered severe side effects. There has been tremendousprogress in reducing doses of radiation therapy using differentchemotherapy regimens in an attempt to reduce the toxicities expe-rienced by patients in the treatment of this disease. No. 1, ThomasNavarro did not qualify for the protocol because it was specificallystated that patients must have had an attemptive curative therapy. Mr. B URTON . Meaning chemotherapy and radiation first? Dr. P AZDUR . And radiation, because of the cure. Mr. B URTON . Let me interrupt here. I think I understand this. So the child and the parent is taken out of the decisionmakingprocess at that point. Either they go along with chemotherapy andradiation and the potential side effects, or their child cannot getthe other treatment? Dr. P AZDUR . Here again \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . That is true, though, isn 't it? Dr. P AZDUR . Our decision is based on a balance between efficacy and toxicity. Mr. B URTON . I understand what you are saying. But what we are saying is the parent is no longer able to participate in the decision- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 unless they first use chemotherapy and radiation, though knowing full well the side effects that might occur. Dr. P AZDUR . Given the known efficacy data regarding antineoplastins in this disease, we cannot substitute it for a knowncurative regimen that carries with it a 70 percent survival. Mr. B URTON . Why don 't you just give me a straight answer? The straight answer is, yes, they cannot participate in the clinical trialunless the child has first had chemotherapy or radiation. Dr. P AZDUR . That is the eligibility criteria of the trial. Mr. B URTON . What if you have a child, you, and the child has this devastating cancer, and this child has to go through this treat-ment, and you have done all the reading and research, you havegone to the Internet and talked to a lot of other parents that hadproblems with this, and you came to the conclusion that the riskof chemotherapy and radiation was greater than going the alter-native route and trying to help your child with clinical trial, whatwould you do? Would you say, OK, we are going to go ahead andtake the risk? Dr. P AZDUR . No. Let me emphasize that I have been in practice for 20 years in medical oncology, and the issue here is the Internetand the information that patients get from the Internet. We ap-plaud and we want patients to be active participants in their care,but this does not substitute for the experience of physicians thathave treated patients with medulloblastoma. I am not saying thisin an autocratic, authoritative, authoritarian fashion. Nevertheless,when we made our decision, we contacted leading experts thattreated medulloblastoma, and they believed the risk-toxicity benefitversus the known survival advantage was far outweighed. Mr. B URTON . I am going to yield to my colleague, but I want to make one real brief comment. I went to Africa, and I got a terrible stomach problem, and I came back, and I had this bug for 2 years. I couldn 't eat properly, I had to take everything, Zantac, everything for my stomach for along time. I read about a doctor from Australia, and he had said for the first time that he believed that the problem that people have withstomach ailments was not caused by nerves, ulcers and all of thatsort of thing, but it was caused by a bacteria. And I went down tosee him, because I couldn 't live with what I was going through. He treated me, and in 1 week I was cured. He is now recognized all over the world as one of the leading doctors in his field, andwhat he said was the H pylori bacteria does exist and probably 90percent of the people in the world could be cured if they just tooka combination of medicines. FDA wouldn 't approve it, FDA didn 't look at it, none of that was approved, and yet I was cured beforethat happened. Now, the thing that bothers me is I participated in the decision- making process myself, and I went down there, and I was cured.A parent who has a child who is dying of cancer, who knows thatthe chances of survival is not all that great, who knows the sideeffects of chemotherapy and radiation and knows there is anotherapproach like Dr. Burzynski 's that is in clinical trials, it is my con- tention that they ought to have a voice in the decisionmaking proc-ess. And what we see is that \u2014and you say you are not an autocrat, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul we see is we see the agency of government, the Food and Drug Administration, saying to that parent, no. Your child is goingto go through chemotherapy and radiation, or else. And if the childhas the side effects that I have seen where a child is a mental bas-ket case, a vegetable because of the side effects of the chemo-therapy and radiation, then that is just tough. I am one of those who believes that the parent, if it is a clinical trial that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration,at least ought to have a voice in the decisionmaking process, andyou folks continue to say no, and that bothers me a great deal. Butwe will talk about this further. Mr. Horn, you are recognized for 5 minutes.Mr. H ORN. I would be glad to yield you 2 minutes more. Mr. B URTON . That is all right. Mr. H ORN. No. 1, I would like to ask Dr. Wittes, you are at NIH, is it true that there has been a loss of personnel in the portion ofNIH where drug development was being reviewed? Is that correct?I am told almost 30 have been dismissed there or reassigned toother parts of NIH. Dr. W ITTES . I don 't know what your point of reference is, your time point of reference. But we \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ORN. The last 4 months. Dr. W ITTES . No. It is not true. Mr. H ORN. It is not true. Dr. W ITTES . Right. Mr. H ORN. So nobody is being \u2014you know what I am talking about, on drug development and marine plant life and plant life. Dr. W ITTES . Correct, there has than been no loss of personnel in the last 4 months. Mr. H ORN. Then maybe some of the newspapers are a little in error. But that bothered me, to say the least. What type of a program do you have going on plant life and ma- rine life? Dr. W ITTES . Well, we will have and have had for a long time a pretty extensive program that actually goes out to far corners ofthe world and searches ecosystems like tropical rainforests and ma-rine ecological niches, soils and so on, to try to procure examplesof plant, animal or microorganism life for our natural products re-pository, which is a repository that is actually a natural treasure.It contains about 140,000 extracts of one sort or another, and thishas actually been the basis for the natural products work that hasgone on at the Cancer Institute. A little while ago, a year or two ago, we established a program that makes the repository available to people outside the Instituteinterested in screening for compounds in cancer and also outsidethe area of cancer. So it would please us greatly, for example, ifpeople interested in drug discovery for other serious medical ill-nesses would regard this also as a repository for them. That is one aspect of what we do.Mr. H ORN. What is the next one? Dr. W ITTES . Well, also, there has been in place for a number of years now a screening system that depends on inhibition of growthof a panel of various cell lines. This has been actually very usefulin discovering extracts and pure compounds that might have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul proof of that is always in the pud- ding, but it is an initial screen. We have come to question in the last few years whether that cell line screen is the right way to be asking questions about whatmight be useful in cancer. Based on new knowledge in cancer biol-ogy we have big plans, actually, to try to reorient our approach inthe direction of molecular targets but still use the same kinds ofchemical diversity that we have been talking about in the pastalso. Enhanced, however, by some of these new synthetic methodsin the laboratory that I mentioned briefly in my comments before. We also have a development program. Development is the proc- ess by which you take a chemical that looks like it might be inter-esting and you turn it into a substance that you can administer toan animal or downstream to a human being. That involves lots oftests that give you reason to think that, if you were to give it toa person, it would be safe and it wouldn 't cause horrific side effects, at least not initially, depending on how you ended up giving it, butcertainly it would be safe to introduce into clinical trials. It woudlalso have the potential to kill cancer or stop it from growing in awhole animal or a person as opposed to just a petri dish. That isa long, complicated process that involves many steps like toxi-cology, pharmacology and formulation and things like that. Mr. H ORN. Has there been substantial interest from the pharma- ceutical firms? Dr. W ITTES . We collaborate with, I would guess, probably some- where between 100 and 200 pharmaceutical companies and alsoacademic laboratories all over the world who submit compounds,unknown compounds and known compounds, to our screening sys-tems. We also commonly collaborate with companies in the clinicaldevelopment of agents that either we license to them or they wantto co-develop with us. This process has been a collaborative one fordecades now, and it is really only going to increase in intensity asindustry becomes more and more interested in cancer, which theyare in both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. Mr. H ORN. We hear every time we talk to the pharmacological industry that it costs them about $300 million in research on that.You are doing a lot of the research at the NIH. Is there any rec-ompense from the industry when they are successful or maybewhen they are not successful? And I would just be curious theway\u2014are you able to award a particular scientist on your payroll at NIH and doing a lot of this or, through grants from NIH, isthere ever a chance for that individual who has taken and pursueda particular line of endeavor where there is any monetary award? Dr. W ITTES . That is a complicated question. Mr. H ORN. I am thinking from the pharmaceutical group, in terms of your contract. Dr. W ITTES . Right. So the reward system that is in place for sci- entists who discover things that end up being useful, if that hap-pens within the intramural program of the NCI, that is on thecampus in Bethesda or in Frederick, there it is now possible for in-ventors to receive royalties up to a certain level once there is a rev-enue stream from the sale of something. Of course, for extramuralgrantees, grantees of the NIH that discover something undergrants or contracts, the legislation allows licensing, patenting and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 can therefore also benefit from a rev- enue stream once there is one. There is not, in general, direct financial feedback, however, from drug companies to the NIH, except when there is a collaborativeresearch and development agreement in place, which is, I am sureyou know, a formalized process actually created by the Congress toenable collaborations between outside organizations and the gov-ernment. Mr. H ORN. And you feel that is helping maintain first-rate schol- ars in science to the NIH? Dr. W ITTES . I think it is a factor. I think most of the people who work at the NIH work at the NIH because they love it. Nobody getsrich by working at NIH. Mr. H ORN. It is hard to beat. You don 't have students and a uni- versity bothering you either. Dr. W ITTES . Some of us like students. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Horn, we will come back to you in just a minute. Mr. Cummings.Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for taking a moment of silence onbehalf of my father who passed away on Sunday. I sincerely appre-ciate that, and I appreciate the thoughts and the prayers of thecommittee. I just have a few very brief questions.Dr. Wittes, let me just ask you, does NCI evaluate all research proposals by the same criteria? Dr. W ITTES . Well, can you say a little bit more about what you mean by that? Mr. C UMMINGS . Does the NCI hold unconventional and conven- tional research proposals to the same standards? Dr. W ITTES . That is certainly the intention, yes. You see, the rea- son I am not simply saying yes is a lot of the evaluation of the pro-posals is done by a peer review system, which involves committeesof experts drawn from the outside, and depending on who you gettogether around the table to discuss things, you may get a greateror lesser degree of enthusiasm for one type of thing or another. Theintention is certainly to mainstream the evaluation of complemen-tary and alternative approaches, yes. Mr. C UMMINGS . Many people now turn to the Internet for infor- mation about cancer and how to prevent, detect and treat it. Whatsteps has the NCI taken to make accurate information available onthe Internet? Dr. W ITTES . We have devoted an immense amount of time and energy over the last few years to that issue. I mentioned in my opening statement the revamping of our pro- tocol and information data base relating to cancer and cancer re-search. This data base is called CancerNet, and it involves thou-sands and thousands of pages of Internet pages of text about state-of-the-art treatments for cancer and about available clinical stud-ies. It has a new powerful search engine that allows people to putin information that is more closely tailored to their own cir-cumstance, including where they live, by the way, and come upwith not only protocols that are available for them for their stage VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul of disease but also in the geographic area in which they live. We also have a new Web site called CancerTrials which is full of contextual information about the research setting. So it tells peo-ple, for example, about why they should care about clinical trials,what clinical trials are, what the informed consent process is allabout, the kind of questions they should ask of people. We havereally I think done a much better job over the last few years in ex-actly that direction. Mr. C UMMINGS . I understand in the State of Maryland it is esti- mated that 22,600 new cancer cases will be diagnosed this year.Maryland is not a big State. A lot of those cases will take place inmy district which is Baltimore city, predominantly African Amer-ican. The thing that concerns me is we have seen articles here re-cently that show that there are significant racial disparities in theway people are treated for their cancers. Could you describe any ef-forts by the NCI to determine the reasons for these disparities? Dr. W ITTES . Yes. That is another area, actually, of intense inter- est to us, and we have actually a very ambitious plan relating tocancer and the disparity of the burden of cancer in various seg-ments of our population. We are doing a lot with that now, including the creation of a se- ries of ambitious community-based networks to try to create infra-structures in areas suffering a disproportionate burden of cancer.These infrastructures will actually serve as research platforms toask exactly the kind of questions that your question focuses on,which is why is there an excess burden of certain kinds of cancers.We don 't have a very good idea right now, for example, of why Afri- can American men suffer disproportionately from prostate cancer.It is known they do. We don 't know why. These kinds of issues are the issues we need to get to the bottom of. There are a number of other things we are doing also, including trying to establish relationships between sites of research in minor-ity-serving institutions and the cancer center networks that theCancer Institute already supports. We are doing this with the Of-fice of Research on Minority Health and expect that that kind offusion between institutions that are oriented toward the care of mi-nority groups on the one hand and then institutions that arescience-rich places that may not have been thinking about the par-ticular problems in minorities, will be a very creative way of get-ting people to put this on their radar screens and make it a realissue for them. Mr. C UMMINGS . Dr. Pazdur, what is the cure rate of children with pediatric brain cancer using the standard care treatment? Dr. P AZDUR . The standard treatment, I assume we are talking about medulloblastomas here \u2014\u2014 Mr. C UMMINGS . I didn 't know whether I could pronounce that word right. Dr. P AZDUR . It is in excess of 70 percent. In some series, it is even 80 percent or higher. It is a very curative disease. Mr. C UMMINGS . Well, what is the cure rate for children when we use Dr. Burzynski 's treatment? Dr. P AZDUR . This is one of the problems in determining the ade- quacy of his treatment. We really do not have adequate survival VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul with a very limited number of pa- tients that have been entered on clinical trials. Basically we aretaking a look at \u2014if we take a look at the number of patients en- tered on clinical trials, it is in the range of about 17 patients. Thesurvival data we do not have complete data on because many ofthese patients are obviously being treated at this time. We do notanalyze a clinical trial until the trial is completed. The activity that we have seen using this therapy have included some responses. However, by responses I mean tumor reductions.But in order to acquaint that therapy to the body of knowledge thathas been evolved really over the decades using radiation and chem-otherapy is impossible to answer at this time. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Following up on what Mr. Cummings just asked, how many people would you say was in that clinical trial downthere? Seventeen, I think you said. I am pretty sure that is whatyou said. Dr. P AZDUR . The most recent update on the protocol, on the pro- tocol in 1999, which is the most recent, we have eight patients onthe protocol, and nine patients that were exceptions that we en-tered on the protocol. Mr. B URTON . One of the things you said when I was talking to you a while ago, and I think you just said now, you have such lim-ited knowledge from the clinical trial. That is true, isn 't it? We have very limited knowledge. Dr. P AZDUR . We have 17 patients treated. Mr. B URTON . I understand. But you limit the number of people on that clinical trial, and then after you limit the number of peoplein the clinical trial, you say you don 't have enough evidence. You know, I don 't understand that. Would you explain that to me? You say we don 't have enough evidence because we don 't have enough people on the clinical trial, and at the same time you are sayingwe won 't let anybody beyond a certain number on the clinical trial. What you are saying is you are going to make sure you know theresult ahead of time. The result is, we don 't have enough evidence from the clinical trial. You won 't let them in, so you are never going to get the kind of end result that might come out. Isn 't that correct? Dr. P AZDUR . No, it is not. Mr. B URTON . How many people will you allow in the clinical trial? Dr. P AZDUR . We will allow the patients that meet the eligibilities criteria. Mr. B URTON . And that is? Chemotherapy and radiation first? Dr. P AZDUR . Yes. Mr. B URTON . The ones that don 't die or become vegetables, then you will allow them in the clinical trial? Dr. P AZDUR . I think that is a gross mischaracterization of a standard therapy and the results that one gets from therapies thatare administered to patients with this disease. I would like to bring up \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Then you should have come to our press conference and should have talked to the parents who had their kids there inwheelchairs who were just degenerating into nothing because of the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 instead of the other treatment that they could have taken. Dr. P AZDUR . We have talked to pediatric oncologists who are ex- perts in this disease, and they believe that the risk-toxicity benefitis warranted in the relationship to the cure rate. We have allowedover 300 patient exceptions, patients to be exempted and to betreated on antineoplaston. So I don 't think we are limiting the ac- cess to this drug in appropriate situations. Mr. B URTON . It was after, though, they had the chemotherapy and radiation, correct? Dr. P AZDUR . This is in a variety of diseases. Mr. B URTON . Oh. But as far as the medulloblastoma, how many have you had? Dr. P AZDUR . As I stated before, the number of patients that are on medulloblastoma trial, there were eight on the trial and nine ex-emptions that did not fit the criteria for the trial. Mr. B URTON . Why didn 't they fit the criteria? Dr. P AZDUR . They could have had minor laboratory abnormali- ties, etc. Mr. B URTON . Minor laboratory abnormalities. Tell me what those are? Dr. P AZDUR . I don 't have that data in front of me. Mr. B URTON . I mean, could it have been a mental problem or a physical problem that resulted from the chemotherapy or radi-ation? Dr. P AZDUR . I do not believe so. Mr. B URTON . Well, do you know? Dr. P AZDUR . I would have to look into that and get back to you. Mr. B URTON . Would you look into it and get back to me? I would like to know if the chemotherapy or radiation had side effects forthose nine patients that resulted in their non-acceptance into theprogram down there. So would you let me know that? Dr. P AZDUR . I would be happy to let you know that. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Dr. Straus, I understand that one of your employees is a Reiki master. Could you explain what that therapy is? Dr. S TRAUS . He is the expert. You are referring to Dr. Morgan Jackson who we recently had the good fortune of having join us.Hw was until now the Director of Minority Health Studies at theAgency for Health Care Research and Quality. He is a licensed in-ternist trained at Harvard and Harvard Medical School, and he isalso interested in a range of complementary therapy. Reiki therapy, as I understand it, involves manipulation of par- ticular points on the feet for therapeutic purposes. He is interestedin that therapy. Mr. B URTON . And has he had some positive results from the ther- apy he is using? Dr. S TRAUS . I believe he has, but he has been with us now for about 2 weeks, and his responsibility is to develop our entire port-folio of research addressing the issues of health disparities usingCAM approaches to traditional and indigenous health care systems. Mr. B URTON . What is the role of spirituality in healing as a phy- sician? Do you ever pray with your patients, and, if not, would yoube uncomfortable doing that? I am just curious. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I am a religious person myself, Mr. Chairman, and I have prayed when my children have been ill, as many parents do,and I support and respect my patients ' wishes for that kind of ther- apy and offer them clerical support if they wish to pray. I have not prayed in any religious context with my patients. My own religious beliefs may be different. But, as I say, these spiritualefforts are very supportive in comforting patients and families. Mr. B URTON . Regarding acupuncture and other therapies, do you think that they have been shown to be effective and should be re-imbursed by Medicare? Dr. S TRAUS . I believe that acupuncture, despite its thousands of years of use and its venerable traditions, is in the area of, still, con-troversy for some cases. It is touted for many, many illnesses. Mostof those cases have not been studied at all. There have been somegood studies, although not absolutely definitive, suggesting thatacupuncture is beneficial for certain types of pain disorders and notothers. There was a consensus panel of outside experts convened at the NIH in 1997 who, upon reviewing the literature to that time, con-cluded that the burden of evidence suggested acupuncture is bene-ficial for pain associated with dental extraction, as well as an ad-junctive therapy for relief of nausea and vomiting following chemo-therapy. As to whether the level of evidence is adequate for reimburse- ment, reimbursement issues are not ones I am particularly knowl-edgeable about, but I would say the evidence for acupuncture forall CAM modalities should be exactly the same as for all conven-tional therapies. When there has been adequate controlled trials ofa prospective nature that says it works and is safe, that should besufficient. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. Mr. Horn.Mr. H ORN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me pursue some of that drug laboratory situation. Do you see \u2014after several years, maybe decades, of this, do you see any major stream that might be the most productive as a resultof that laboratory and the grants that are granted in a similar na-ture? Where are we, in other words, in it right now, in terms ofplant life, marine life, etc? Dr. W ITTES . Well, I think as far as sources of chemicals is con- cerned, it has to be said that the microbial world has probably beenmore intensively investigated than either plants or the marineworld. Now I say that with some hesitance because the discoveryof a whole new genre of life, the so-called bacteria that live in veryhostile places like near deep sea vents and so on, plus the increas-ing knowledge there are actually very large numbers of organismsthat are not culturable by conventional technology, means thatthere is a whole lot of microbiology we are just beginning to learnabout. It may very well be that there will be very interesting chemicals coming out of that source. The business about plant life in endangered ecosystems has got- ten a lot of public attention, and we are doing what we can to col-lect specimens that are not already represented in our repositories. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul is also another area of real attention. You will be hearing from Dr. Petit tomorrow, who has actually made a lot ofcontributions in this whole area. Mr. H ORN. Well, I thank you. Dr. Kang, I would like to ask you, because of your affiliation with Medicare, do you advise the health care financing system as towhat pharmaceuticals ought to be recognized by Medicare in rela-tion to cancer? Is that one ever your roles? Dr. K ANG. You have to understand that Medicare actually cur- rently does not have a drug benefit. Mr. H ORN. We are going to give it in the next 3 months, so you will be doing that. Dr. K ANG. Yes. I am responsible for Medicare 's coverage deci- sions and to the extent that there is a limited drug benefit withregard to some cancer drugs, and I do make those decisions. I cer-tainly endorse the statements that Dr. Wittes and Dr. Straus havemade, that the evidentiary standards for whether certain drugsshould or should not be included for Medicare coverage should bethe same and the scientific method should be the same. Mr. H ORN. One much the drugs that women have to get, which is tamoxifen \u2014how do you pronounce it? Dr. K ANG. Tamoxifen. Mr. H ORN. Is that approved for Medicare? Dr. K ANG. Unfortunately, that is an oral drug, and it is not a Medicare benefit. That is something that legislation needs to pass.But I will tell you if you gave \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ORN. A number of health plans do have that, and so I am thinking when we will get to this in the next few months that Iwould hope that that would be recognized, because there are somany people out there, particularly widows, with maybe only $500a month in a Social Security pension, their husband is dead, andthen this gets to be very expensive. Have you looked \u2014even though you don 't have the authority now, have you looked at the range of pharmaceuticals that might wellbe utilized by health care, both physicians, hospitals and clinicsand all the rest, that are eligible? Dr. K ANG. In general, the administration has overall looked at the drug benefit in its total package, but we have not gone drugby drug. Obviously though, if we were to get a drug benefit, we arein full support of this; and tamoxifen certainly for the treatmentof breast cancer I think would be on the list. Mr. H ORN. I appreciate that. I guess I would ask Dr. Wittes, when we are talking about Medi- care people, we are talking about some of us that are over 60 yearsof age. Dr. W ITTES . Don 't look at me. Mr. H ORN. No, I am saying, to what degree have we included them? And I might add the same for FDA, to what degree are peo-ple over 60 in some of these particular trials that we hear aboutfrom FDA and we see in NIH and universities and elsewhere? Isthere a sensitivity to sort of making sure the elderly \u2014\u2014 Dr. K ANG. I think this is actually why the President 's announce- ment this morning \u2014currently, roughly one-third of beneficiaries over the age of 65 are participating in cancer and clinical trials, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul roughly they comprise roughly two-thirds of ac- tually the people with cancer in this Nation. So there is somewhatof a lag for the elderly. One of the barriers to that is the payment for routine costs asso- ciated with those clinical trials, and the President announced thismorning that Medicare would do that, make it explicitly clear thatbecause people enter a clinical trial, they don 't lose their Medicare benefit. Obviously, there are other reasons why the elderly may not par- ticipate in trials, but certainly we are interested in removing thefinancial barriers. Mr. H ORN. Is it tilted primarily for women because of the sort of scourge of breast cancer we have in this society? Dr. K ANG. Not that I am aware of. Dr. W ITTES . No, we also have the scourge of prostate cancer. Mr. H ORN. Yes, I am one of those. I am zero on my PSA for the last 5 years. I thank the people that did it. By the way, one of my urology surgeons had just the situation that the chairman mentioned on stomach upsets, ulcer, etc., andthe man from Australia certainly saved him after 20 years. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Barry Marshall is his name. Let me now yield to Mr. Cummings.Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Incidentally, Dr. Barry Marshall, I understand, has received one of the highest awards of any physician here in theUnited States for his medical research, and I understand he maybe nominated for a Nobel Prize for science in the future. If I might just \u2014one second, Mr. Cummings \u2014tell you, I told my stomach doctor in Indianapolis about my experience with Dr. Mar-shall, and he was visibly angry, and he turned around and walkedoff. And that kind of surprised me, because I guess the treatment,the conventional treatment that he had been using for years withwhich he made his living was being jeopardized by Dr. Marshal,and it made him very upset. Mr. Cummings.Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I didn 't have a preliminary statement, but I do appreciate you holding thishearing. I really do, because I think it is such an important subject. I want to take a moment to thank our panelists for all that they do every day to help people live the very best lives that they canand help people live, period. I think sometimes we can get socaught up in what we do that we forget how many lives we touch.So I want to express my appreciation to all of you and to all of thepeople who are associated with you who may be watching this rightnow. One of the things, Dr. Kang, that I am just serious about, if we had a drug benefit like Mr. Horn just talked about, and I have justas much optimism as he does with regards to this Congress doingthat, how do you determine what kinds of criteria is used to deter- mine what drugs would go under that benefit with regard to can-cer? I am not asking you for specific drugs, just what do you lookat? Do you look at price, do you look at effectiveness, things of thatnature? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 ANG. Under the President 's drug proposal, those drugs ap- proved by FDA and their indications, because they have alreadybeen labeled safe and effective, would be covered. So that would beone criteria. I think, in general, we would be very interested in looking at the outcomes, the health outcomes and what contributes to the pa-tients ' not only cure rates and quantity of life but quality of life. Under the President 's proposal currently, I should say those deci- sions would be made by the pharmacy benefit managers. The point,though, is that beneficiaries should get access to the FDA-approveddrugs that have been deemed safe and effective. Mr. C UMMINGS . You know that there are people who are right now glued to their televisions watching this, or maybe watching itlater, and they heard the President this morning, and there arepeople sitting there watching us right now who are suffering fromcancer and suffering from other problems. I know you have talkedabout it a little bit earlier, but, you know, I am sure they are sit-ting there saying, exactly what does this mean for me? If I havegot a problem, what does this mean for me and how do I now goabout making sure that \u2014first of all, did I fall within the category that the President was talking about? Second, how do I make thiswork for me? I think the chairman would agree that if there is something available to the public, we want to make sure they understand itand not have any misconceptions and that kind of thing. Can youjust kind of tell us real quick, as if there were somebody lookingat this right now wondering? Dr. K ANG. I think the most important message is that, because of participation, if someone participates in a clinical trial, he or shewould not lose their Medicare benefits. I think that is the most im-portant message. We will pay for the routine costs associated withthe trials. I think that the other important message is we will \u2014the Presi- dent did say that the agency and the administration will work onefforts to actually educate the community. But I think there issome misunderstanding about what is covered and what is not cov-ered, and the last thing we want to do is to make sure beneficiarieswho go into trials know what the Medicare program will be payingfor and what the trial sponsors will be paying for and really under-stand their liabilities. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . We are about to go to our next panel. I just had one more question for Dr. Straus. Dr. Straus, you talked about the foot therapy that Dr. \u2014is it Reiki? I think you are talking about a different subject. BecauseDr. White \u2014where is Dr. Jeffrey White? He indicated that the Reiki treatment is energy therapy and not foot therapy. So I thought youmay have been thinking about something else. I just thought I would mention that. Dr. S TRAUS . Let me stay, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for the op- portunity to reflect my ignorance. Mr. B URTON . No, we are not \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 The fact is, I have been hired to be director of the Center because of my expertise as a clinical scientist, but my back-ground is in infectious disease and immunology. If you would belike to discuss that, I would like to entertain you with that some-time. But I am not knowledgeable of the many hundreds of CAMtherapies. That is why I recruit the best and the brightest to helpus develop the programs to do so. Mr. B URTON . Very good. One last question. I would like to say to all of you, though \u2014I would like to submit to you a whole host of questions we haven 't had time to get to you today, and I would like you to submit themfor the record. In particular, I would like to have the backgroundson those nine people we were talking about earlier. Finally, Dr. Straus, is there a role for complementary and alter- native therapies in the hospice environment? Dr. S TRAUS . One of the largest uses of complementary therapy is to alleviate suffering from chronic illness, be it pain, be it nausea,and that is, in fact, some of the most successful uses. My own background involves a lot of studies of chronic pain asso- ciated with shingles infection. Those are the kinds of areas inwhich one can explore acupuncture, patients who are chronically illor often depressed understandably from that illness; and the use ofbotanical products that may raise their mood could be beneficial. I would say that palliative care is a huge place for CAM studies. The NIH has just announced that it has hired a director of pallia-tive care to join us this summer in the clinical center. She comesfrom the Foxchase Cancer Center where she has had extended ex-perience in this area. Mr. B URTON . Very good. Well, as I thank you for your help, let me just say one of the things that bothers me continually and bothers a lot of other peoplein the country is that people like Mr. Navarro have had to taketheir loved ones or themselves or their children out of the countryto get treatment that they think is going to be beneficial for theirfamilies, and many of the treatments that are being used in othercountries and Europe have been beneficial that are not yet recog-nized or accepted in the United States because of FDA and HTSregulations. That is unfortunate, because it costs so much moneyto take somebody to Europe or someplace else or Germany for atreatment that might save their lives when, if it is effective, itshould be utilized here as well. One of the things that I have never understood is why countries that have an effective treatment for a disease, such as cancer, whythere is not some kind of cross-pollination between that countryand the United States and vice versa so that those treatments andthose scientists ' minds and proposals can 't be utilized across inter- continental borders. So I just leave that thought with you. I want to thank you all very much for being here today. We will now bring our next panel forward. I hope, if you have a moment, you can stay and hear some the stories these people aregoing to tell. We are going to have patients here. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul Horwin, Dr. Geffen, Mr. Cary and Mr. Devries, would you please come forward? Would you pleaserise? This is a standard procedure. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Let the record reflect the witnesses have responded in the affirmative, and we will now recognize each one of you foran opening statement. STATEMENT OF JAMES NAVARRO, TUCSON, AZ; MICHAEL HORWIN, SAN DIEGO, CA; RAPHAELE HORWIN, SAN DIEGO,CA; DR. JEREMY GEFFEN, GEFFEN CANCER CENTER AND RE- SEARCH INSTITUTE; ROGER CARY, CANCER TREATMENTCENTERS OF AMERICA; AND GEORGE DEVRIES, AMERICANSPECIALTY HEALTH PLANS Mr. B URTON . Mr. Navarro, it is nice having you back with us. Why don 't you tell us how your son is doing and what has tran- spired since we last met. Mr. N AVARRO . Well, thank you. Mr. B URTON . I hate to say this, but because of the lateness of the day, if you could confine your remarks to 5 minutes, if it is pos-sible, we would really appreciate it. Mr. N AVARRO . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we speak, Thomas is in therapy outside the United States; and in spite of the eventsof the last almost 9 months, he is doing quite well in defeating hisillness. Mr. B URTON . Very good. Do you have a statement? Mr. N AVARRO . No, I wanted to share something with you before my testimony. You happen to be in luck today because I happento have a copy of protocol BT -29 for your review, which was a new protocol submitted to the FDA on Thomas ' behalf that mirrors the FDA-approved trial, with the exception that Thomas would be al-lowed treatment without prior radiation and chemo damaging hisbody. Mr. B URTON . Is that right? Well, would somebody go down there and pick that up from him? We will take a look at that. Thank youvery much. We will look at that. Do you have a statement you would like to make other than your son is doing well? Mr. N AVARRO . Well, that is everything to me. Mr. B URTON . OK. Mr. N AVARRO . But in following with your opening speech, I am here to tell you that I am a living testament to your opening speechand to the current cancer statistics. We are both fighting it now. Mr. B URTON . Yes, I understand. For those in the audience, Mr. Navarro has just discovered recently that he has fourth stage pros-tate cancer and so you are in the fourth stage, so you are in a bat-tle as well as your son. Mr. N AVARRO . Yes, and having three sons, we are two out of four males, which is the one in two statistic. Mr. B URTON . Let me just say we will all say a prayer for you and hope that the treatment you get will be beneficial. Mr. N AVARRO . Thank you, sir. I am glad to be here and hope that we can break some barriers today. Mr. B URTON . We are going to continue to work on that. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul afternoon. My name is Michael Horwin. My wife Raphaele and I, would like to thank Congressman Burton forthe opportunity to speak about the experience our 2-year-old sonAlexander had with chemotherapy that resulted in his death. Can I have the first slide, please?Today is Alexander 's birthday. He was supposed to be 4 years old today. Alexander was a strong, happy, very intelligent little boywho loved life, but when he was 2 years old everything changed.On August 10, 1998, Alexander was diagnosed with medullo-blastoma, a highly malignant brain tumor that represents a quar-ter of all brain tumors in children. After two brain surgeries, Alex-ander was tumor free, but we were warned that without furthertreatment his tumor would return. We met with the oncologist at Children 's Hospital Los Angeles, and he told us that radiation was out of the question because itwould destroy Alexander 's developing brain, but he told us his ''state-of-the-art '' chemotherapy would provide a good chance of sur- vival. This protocol was called CCG -9921, and was comprised of four chemo drugs \u2014cyclophasphamide, cisplatin, etoposide, and vincristine. He warned us that, although the side effects were notas bad as radiation, they could be severe. Can I have the second slide, please?Heart damage, lung damage, liver damage, kidney damage, loss of hearing, secondary cancer, intellectual decline, ineffectivenessand death. After hearing this, we continued researching other can-cer treatments and focused on the Burzynski Clinic in Houston,TX. We spoke to parents of children who were doing well onBurzynski 's nontoxic therapy and decided that this was the very best treatment for Alexander. On September 21, 1998, Burzynski met with us, looked at our son's latest MRI and said that because there was no tumor he could not treat Alexander. He explained that the FDA controlledhis protocols and required that Alexander have tumor in his brain.We explained that our son had suffered through 16 hours of brainsurgery to be tumor free. Burzynski said he was sorry, there was nothing he could do.In Los Angeles, we scrambled for other options, but we were un- able to find any other viable, nontoxic therapy. Reluctantly, we re-turned to Children 'S Hospital for chemotherapy on October 7th. Later, we would find out that the oncologist had contemplated tak-ing Alexander from us with a court order if we resisted. Slide three, please.After the first round of chemo, Alexander began to change \u2014con- stant vomiting, hair gone, dark skin turned pale as a ghost. He gotsick with fevers and spent weeks in the hospital. There were bloodtransfusions and hearing and kidney and liver tests; antibioticssquirted up his nose; injections in his legs; all standard fare withchemotherapy. Three months after starting chemotherapy and one-fourth the way into a 12-month protocol, Alexander was diagnosed with 30 tu-mors throughout his brain and spine. We were told that he hadabout 3 days to live. We were given decadron and morphine and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 But now, with 3 days to live, Alexander met the FDA criteria for Dr. Burzynski 's therapy. He had measurable tumors, 30 of them, and he had already had the benefit, so-called benefit, ofchemotherapy. We chartered an air ambulance. The first time Alexander had been to Burzynski 's on September 21st, he had joked with the nurses, watched TV and played. Now he was brought in on astretcher with an escort of emergency personnel. After fighting like hell to live, Alexander died on January 31, 1999, in my wife 's arms. Our son was only 2 12years old. After Alexander was buried, we wanted to know what happened. Why did he die while receiving ''state-of-the-art'' chemotherapy? We started researching the medical literature. What we found stunned us. In 1994, St. Jude's Hospital had given the exact samefour chemotherapy drugs to children the same age as Alexander,with exactly the same tumor as Alexander. The protocol had to beterminated because 11 of the 13 children had their brain cancersreturn and spread in an average of 5 months, just like Alexander'sdid. This was hard for us to understand. This so-called state-of-the- art chemotherapy had already been used before and had failed.Why were they giving this to our son now? We continued our research and found that the chemo drugs that they had given Alexander had been used for over 20 years, and theoncologists were admitting in their journals, in their medical jour-nals, that they were incredibly toxic and ineffective alone or incombination. Here is a sample of what we had written about chemotherapy\u2014 a sample of what they had written about chemotherapy. If I could have the next slide, please.This is just a sample. We have over 40 citations in our written testimony. 1985, written by an oncologist, in respect to medulloblastoma and chemotherapy: Responses are generally transient and virtuallyno cures are reported. 1988: Aggressive treatment of medulloblastoma has not improved survival. 1993: The absolute benefit of chemotherapy for the treatment of medulloblastoma in childhood is, as yet, not proven. 1994: The median time to progression, return of the tumor, was 6 months. 1996: The outcome for the majority of children with malignant brain tumors remains poor, despite surgery, radiation and conven-tional chemotherapy. 1998: For many years, chemotherapy has been utilized for the treatment of malignant brain tumors with minimal success. This is what oncologists are writing in their journals.We wondered what else oncologists were writing in their medical journals and not telling parents or the public. We discovered that chemotherapy wasn't only toxic but it was also highly carcinogenic,according to the NIH and the FDA. This explained why some chil-dren treated with chemo actually died from a different cancer. Can I have the next slide, please? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 know how the FDA and others could spout encour- aging statistics like what we heard earlier when the children wererelapsing and dying. We found journal articles that discussed howresponse rates to chemotherapy could be found where it did notexist. Others illustrated that a response rate has nothing to do with survival, and others explained that dead children are not countedin the statistics, the theory being that if a child dies while on thechemo protocol, he or she did not have the benefit of the entiretherapy and therefore should not be counted. The medical literature is clear. There is no standard of care for this disease in young children. The FDA policy of not allowing ter-minally ill children access to other therapies is outrageous. It mustbe stopped immediately. My wife now has some final testimony.Mr. B URTON . I would like to have your entire testimony and all the slides that you have. I want to send all that information overto the FDA for a response from them about that. The doctor that made the comments about the conventional treatment, we asked him to stay. He left. So we are going to makesure that he has a chance to review this and respond to us. Mr. H ORWIN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Horwin. Mrs. H ORWIN . Because the FDA did not allow us to use a therapy that could save Alexander 's life, we never gave our son a fighting chance to survive his disease. When conventional therapy has noth-ing to offer, the FDA should not sentence children to death by tak-ing away an option that could save their life. A parent should havethe right to work with their doctor and choose the best nontoxictherapy available when their child has a terminal disease. Why does the FDA not allow this?Five days of chemotherapy cost our insurance company between $23,000 and $31,000. Alexander 's body was a profit center to the drug companies and oncologists. But chemo is an ineffective treat-ment in pediatric brain tumors. Faced with a choice, no parent would use it, and that is why the drug companies, through the FDA, make sure there is no choice.We urge the committee to take a hard look at the conflict of inter-est that exists between the FDA decisionmakers and the drug com-panies that profit from these decisions. Children should not be usedas guinea pigs for profit. Two hours before Alexander died, he looked at me, and he gave me a little smile. He said, ''I love you, mommy. '' Our son was our life. We thank you for listening.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Horwin. I know that this is a very difficult time for you, but I can tell you that we are checking into the issue you are talking about. Wehave sent subpoenas to the FDA and HHS and CDC for all the peo-ple who are in the decisionmaking process. Our staff has spent many, many, many hours going through to find out if there areconflicts of interest. We believe we have found a number of thosein the advisory panels, and we will be holding a hearing on thosein the future and releasing that information to the public once we VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul it all, because there is so much of it. But we are look- ing into it and you can be assured that we will get to the bottomof it. [The prepared statement Dr. G EFFEN . Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Jeremy Geffen. I am honored to be here today to speak with you about a subject thatI care very deeply about, and to which I have devoted my entireprofessional career. I am a practicing medical oncologist and have spent the last 10 years exploring meaningful and responsible ways of integrating thevery best available conventional cancer treatments with a wide va-riety of alternative and complementary therapies. In 1994, I openedthe Geffen Cancer Center and Research Institute in Vero Beach,FL, with the vision of providing leadership in this field by creatinga model of what truly integrative cancer care would look like, howit would feel, how it would run, what it would offer, and how itwould differ from mainstream centers in the way it cared for peoplewith cancer and their loved ones. My compelling motivation to create such a cancer center ap- peared in my life 14 years ago, while I was a senior in medicalschool. In that year, my father was diagnosed with metastatic gas-tric cancer, and he died less than 4 months later. In a heartbeat,as almost always happens with this disease, my own life \u2014as well as that of my father and everyone in our family \u2014was turned up- side down and changed forever. A somewhat unusual aspect of our situation was that, prior to medical school, I had had years of experience exploring and study-ing a variety of alternative and complementary approaches to heal-ing. Like so many other cancer patients and family members, Ilonged for a place to bring my father where he could receive thevery best of both worlds; that is, state-of-the-art conventional medi-cine, along with alternative and complementary therapies, adminis-tered in a genuinely open-minded and open-hearted manner. I firmly believed that this kind of integrative care could help save his life, or at the very least, help improve the quality of hislife in the time that remained. Although I searched everywhere, I could find no such place be- cause it didn 't exist. I vowed that 1 day I would build the cancer center that I had been looking for. A summary of our approach at the Center, including examples from real patients who have gone through our program, is de-scribed in my book, ''The Journey Through Cancer: An Oncologist 's Seven-Level Program for Healing and Transforming the Whole Per-son,'' recently published by Crown. In the remainder of my time today I would like to emphasize two lessons which I have learned in building an integrative oncologyprogram and guiding patients and loved ones on their journeythrough cancer. The first lesson is very simple, yet profound, and it is this: Can- cer almost always challenges the mind, heart and spirit of patientsand their family members as deeply \u2014if not more deeply \u2014than it challenges the physical body. Unfortunately, even tragically, and as we have heard over and over and over again today, this simple lesson is overlooked bymainstream medicine, and most especially by Medicare and HMOs,as well as the major government and university research institu-tions and regulatory agencies. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 urgent, compelling search for newer and better ways to di- agnosis and treat cancer \u2014with scientifically based methods, and now with alternative and complementary therapies as well \u2014the person who has the disease, and those who love them, are often leftbehind. From my years of experience as an oncologist, and as a friend or loved one of cancer patients, I can tell you with absolute certaintythat focusing only on the physical dimensions of this \u2014or any other \u2014disease will never, ever be enough. Thus, as we begin to embrace a more integrative approach to cancer care, I believe it is time that medicine learns to honor andcare for every dimension of who we all are as human beings \u2014phys- ically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually \u2014and that we do so with equal skill and integrity. Nothing less will ever provide thehealing and fulfillment that all people seek in life \u2014especially, espe- cially when facing an ordeal as challenging as the journey throughcancer. How we can achieve this is the other lesson I would like to very briefly address this afternoon. First and foremost, we need to clear-ly acknowledge that this is an area that is worthy of our time andattention, in equal measure to the resources that we give to the bi-ological aspects of disease. We need vastly more significant fundingand reimbursement for all kinds of modalities of healing that honorand address the needs of the whole person. In my opinion, Mr. Chairman and committee members, there is something very deeply flawed about a health care system in whichI, as an oncologist, can readily spend tens of thousands of dollarsof Medicare funds, with the full blessings of Medicare, to extendthe life of an elderly man with advanced lung cancer for perhaps3 or 4 months, utilizing second, third, fourth, or even fifth-line ex-pensive chemotherapy regimens, growth factors, blood transitions,CT scans, MRI scans and other costly diagnostic procedures, but Icannot find $100, or even $50, for an acupuncture treatment, atherapeutic massage, or a private counseling session for a fright-ened, terrified, single mother of three children who is battlingmetastatic breast cancer \u2014and who happens to be sitting in the very next room. I have faced this circumstance, sad to say, countless times in my career, and I think it is wrong. It is also heartbreaking, frustrating,and, I believe, very short-sighted on our part as a Nation. Make no mistake, the advances and developments in biomolecu- lar medicine that we enjoy in this country are nothing short ofstunning and profound; and we must continue to pursue them withgreat vigor, focus and attention. In the same way, we must con-tinue and even further expand our explorations of the value andbenefits of alternative and complementary therapies. However, at the same time, we must finally begin to address a deep and fundamental issue. In America, doctors are paid to treatdiseases, not to genuinely care in a comprehensive way for the peo-ple who have the disease. Honestly facing this hard truth is, I believe, one of the most fun- damental challenges that lies before us today, especially as webegin to explore how we might create a cancer care for the newmillennium. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 process, we must not forget that the system of cancer care that we choose to create will be called upon to meet the needs ofreal people everywhere, not only people just like you and me butperhaps literally you and me, and people who we know and lovewho might need that care today, tomorrow and beyond. In closing, I would like to thank you, Chairman Burton, for your courage in sponsoring these hearings, for your leadership in help-ing to create an integrative form of cancer care, for opening theminds and the hearts of this government and this country, and forthe opportunity and privilege to appear before you today. Thankyou. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Geffen. Just one real brief comment, and that is that there was a movie called The Doctor \u2014I think it was called The Doctor, wasn 't it\u2014 about a doctor who was very direct and callous with his patientsuntil he became a cancer victim and went through the whole proc-ess, and his whole attitude changed. It is a shame that he had togo through that, and I think your message I hope is heard by phy-sicians all across the country. [The prepared statement of Dr. Geffen follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Mr. Cary. Mr. C ARY. Yes. Chairman Burton and Representative Horn, thank you for the opportunity to be able to address you today. Asthe chief operating officer of Cancer Treatment Centers of America,I am ecstatic about being able to talk with you today. Cancer Treatment Centers of America has been providing com- prehensive, integrative care for patients for over 20 years, and thereason we do this is because patients demand it. This innovativeapproach derives from our corporate mission and vision, and whatwe look for is figuring out ways to deliver care in such a mannerthat we can make a difference in the lives of patients, similar towhat Dr. Geffen talked about. Our patient-centered and interdisciplinary approach stands in stark contrast to the traditional allopathic gatekeeper model. Al-though in our treatment setting the allopathic attending physicianretains overall patient responsibility, the integration of complemen-tary oncology services assures better patient outcomes. What we find by complementary medicine and the integration of complementary medicine is we have fewer side effects. Thetoxicities of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery are much dimin-ished by finding ways to buildup the immune system. We also find \u2014it is anecdotal, I would admit, but we also find that we have improved tumor response, and we have fired up im-mune system, and we believe that that also contributes strongly topatient outcomes and the responses our patients get. This is insharp contrast to what happens today in our conventional systems.As the doctor is the gatekeeper, he is making the decisions. In ourcenters, the approach is that the patient is in the middle of the de-cision, and they choose which services they want and don 't want. However, the doctor does \u2014the allopathic doctor does continue to remain in control of their care. Our unique and comprehensive integrated oncology approach does begin with the best of conventional treatments. We do every-thing from bone marrow transplant to high-dose ratebrachytherapy for prostate cancers, to photodynamic therapy forlung cancers. We are into biological and gene therapies as well assurgery, but we believe that the complementary therapies that weintegrate into patient treatment plans by a multidisciplinary teamadds so much to the value and the outcome and the quality of lifeof our patients. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi- cine describes complementary medicine as those medical practicesnot currently integral \u2014an integral part of the conventional medi- cine. While this is true, that so-called conventional medicine over-looks many of the great traditions in nature and holistic medicine.The integration of these practices is the foundation of our treat-ment. So, again, what we want to be able to do is to take the best of conventional medicine and integrate that with more natural medi- cines. You know, many patients around the country who are treated only with conventional therapies suffer greatly. They tend to some-times even discontinue their treatment because of the side effects VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul Sometimes it is so toxic and so bad they can 't con- tinue. With the use of many of the naturopathic or complementary medicine therapies, we find that patients can tolerate therapymuch better. Recent studies, and you have heard as well today, in-dicate that 40 to 72 percent of all cancer patients utilize com-plementary medicine or alternative medicine. The sad news is thatless than 50 percent of these patients disclose this to theironcologist, and there can be contraindications, as you heard today,and it turns into disjointed or unproductive care. Cancer patients have traveled hundreds of miles and, in many cases, thousands of miles to come to our hospitals. We have had pa-tients from all 50 States and 45 foreign countries. So if the ques-tion is do patients want alternatives to just conventional, we wouldhave to say emphatically yes. What we do is we integrate five therapies, complementary thera- pies, into our conventional program. Without going into great detailwith them, they include: Therapeutic nutrition. These are therapiesthat work to enhance the body 's immune system and get the body 's immune system to be on the attack instead of being one of theproblems to their potential outcome. Spirituality is another important part of our treatment process. Meeting the spiritual needs of patients with cancer is critical. I cangive many examples of that. Psychoneuroimmunology, or what is also called mind-body medi- cine, allows us to be able to destress the patient and allow the pa-tient to focus their energies toward healing and getting better. And then we have exercise and massage therapies. We work to restore the highest level of immune function by making the bodymore physically fit. Cancer Treatment Centers of America is the only hospital system in the United States that has naturopathic physicians \u2014practition- ers working alongside medical oncologists, and the intent of the na-turopathic practitioner is to find natural nontoxic therapies to beable to work along with the allopathic oncologist. The benefits that we have seen from this is increase in effi- ciencies of the traditional medicines, the body to heal itself and re-duce side effects. A brief point on reimbursement. In November 1998, the Journal of the American Medical Association stated that the majority of pa-tients receiving complementary care paid for it out of their ownpocket. What we have created in our society is a two-tiered system.Those who can pay for the treatments or can buy a premium healthinsurance seek out alternative care, seek out locations where theycan get that; those who don 't sometimes are relegated to having to go a conventional route and try to pay for it out-of-pocket. Becauseof the lack of reimbursement for complementary therapies fromMedicare and other insurers, the majority of hospitals have beenreluctant to finance these therapies. In brevity, I come from Chicago. One of our hospitals is in Chi- cago. Recently, the Metropolitan Chicago Health Council statedthat 50 percent of the 130 hospitals they represent are losingmoney. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Balanced Budget Act, which is going to be instituted in August of this year, they are projecting 70 percent. With hospitalsstruggling to survive, it becomes more difficult for them to be ableto fund complementary care for their patient and to address thatissue. As far as the choice issue, at Cancer Treatment Centers of Amer- ica we never make a choice whether a patient should get com-plementary care, whether an insurance company is going to pay forit or not. We do not believe that the care provider should be putin that position. We believe that it is important to stand up now.It is important that we start here with Medicare and then workwith other insurances to get these complementary therapies ap-proved. We take too long taking some of these therapies from the lab bench to the patient 's bedside, and if I could implore anything upon you today it would be to move with a lot more speed. The time for action is now. We need to stand tall, make it hap- pen. We need to do something which we coined as the ''mother standard ''. We need to do whatever it takes to make a difference in the life of patients. My own mother had a bout with breast can-cer, as well as the chairman of our company. If we can treat eachpatient with the same care that we would want one of our lovedones, we will do whatever it takes to make a difference in the livesof patients, and I believe we, starting today, can do that. I thank you for the time.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Cary. I have had a chance to meet some of the people with your company, and I was very impressedwith them and the work they do. [The prepared statement of Mr. Cary follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 D EVRIES . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Horn. I am pleased to be before you to discuss insurance coverageissues on complementary and alternative medicine. I am the chairman, president and CEO of American Specialty Health. My company is a specialty health services organization forcomplementary and alternative health care. We provide specialtyhealth plans, networks, managed care programs and discount pro-vider networks for chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, di-etetics and naturopathy. American Specialty Health assists healthplans and insurance carriers in providing CAM programs for theircovered members. When health plans and insurance carriers offerCAM programs, they currently often outsource the provision andadministration to companies like ours. American Specialty Health currently covers 25 million Americans through 68 health plans under CAM discount network programs,benefit programs and network programs. There has been, over the last 10 years, we all know, a surge in interest in complementary and alternative health care. Dr. DavidEisenberg 's two studies at Harvard University have shown the dra- matic increase of interest by consumers in the use of various com-plementary and alternative health care therapies over the last 10years. Basically, in another study conducted by the International Soci- ety of Employee Benefit Specialists, they surveyed employee benefitspecialists, those people with employer groups and union trustfunds who help their organizations make decisions on which em-ployee benefits to cover. Basically, two-thirds of those employeebenefit specialists expect to see an increased coverage of CAM inthe future, and that 's basically certainly driven by the consumer in- terest in complementary and alternative health care in the direc-tion we see consumer interest driving employers to go ahead andoffer coverage in these areas. I personally speak with three to five health plans that offer or are considering offering complementary and alternative health careservices for their enrollees and generally find significant interest.The question that really comes up is what approach will the healthplan take? Most health plans have a lack of understanding and experience in working with complementary and alternative health care andmany are choosing to start with a simpler approach through a net-work discount program. Under a network discount program, the health plan does not ac- tually provide a covered benefit program but offers their membersaccess to a credentialed network of complementary and alternativehealth care providers such as chiropractors, acupuncturists, mas-sage therapists, naturopaths and dietitians. The members still pay,they still self-pay for services. However, they are able to obtainthese services at a discount from a credentialed prescreened pro- vider. The CAM provider who participates in these programs, we be- lieve, benefits since major health plans are promoting and encour-aging the use of complementary and alternative health care to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul and giving significant public visibility of these pro- grams. Invariably we see, as employers have exposure to the discount network programs and they see the interest in complementary andalternative health care on the part of their employees, that thoseemployers invariably come back and are asking health plans, well,the discount network was a nice start but how do we go to the nextlevel and actually obtain coverage for our employees for com-plementary and alternative health care? We really see that it is coming along three different levels where the benefits are being \u2014and it is really just in the beginning stages, but where they are beginning to be incorporated. The first is really through employer-sponsored health plan pro- grams where the health plans create supplemental benefit pro-grams for services like chiropractic or acupuncture, massage ther-apy or naturopathy, and where employers are able to purchase asupplemental benefit program for complementary and alternativehealth care, much like they would purchase a dental or a visionprogram. The second area we see of great interest is MedicarePlus Choice plans. As Dr. Kang had mentioned in his written comments earlier,written testimony earlier, that as HCFA provides prospective pay-ment to certain MedicarePlus Choice plans, they certainly have theability to enhance benefits that they provide for their members,and we have certainly seen MedicarePlus choice plans who, for ex-ample, provide coverage for acupuncture, even though they areunder no mandate to provide such. The third area in terms of benefit coverage is coming through State mandates, where certain States legislatively are requiringhealth plans and insurance carriers in their States to provide cov-erage for complementary and alternative health care. The State ofWashington probably has the broadest mandate for alternativehealth care, but there are many other States, also. From our perspective, we believe that CAM has become an im- portant part of the average American 's personal health care sys- tem, that when you talk to most Americans now they will not onlytalk about their primary care physician, perhaps a specialist likean OB/GYN, but they will also talk about their chiropractor; theywill talk about the acupuncturist who is treating their mother; theywill talk about their vitamins or herbal supplements; they will talkabout other types of complementary and alternative health care. We still have a long way to go before our complementary and al- ternative health care is fully integrated into our health care sys-tem, but I believe that there are a variety of steps the Federal Gov-ernment can take to support the development of complementaryand alternative health care in our country and specifically withinthird-party reimbursement systems. Quickly, those are, No. 1, the Federal Government can encourage States to enact licensure statutes and procedures for providers. Forexample, naturopathic physicians are only licensed in 11 States.Acupuncturist licensure or certification varies significantly amongthe approximately 30 to 40 States where they are licensed or cer-tified, and these disparities create unequal access to complemen-tary and alternative health care for Americans in these various VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul certainly could be corrected by providing CAM benefits for Medicare beneficiaries which would stimulate licensure in thoseStates or the consistency of licensure. No. 2, the Federal Government can support and encourage the accreditation of schools and universities that train providers incomplementary and alternative health care. The U.S. Departmentof Education and the Department of Health and Human Servicesought to explore ways to achieve this objective the way it has forchiropractic. No. 3, the Federal Government should promote and fully fund re- search on the clinical efficacy of complementary and alternativehealth care, and this would mean the continued funding expansionof the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi-cine at the NIH. No. 4, the Federal Government should promote tax equality em- ployee benefit plans allowing coverage of CAM benefits like dietarysupplements. Legislation such as H.R. 3306, which has been intro-duced by you, Mr. Chairman, would create tax incentives and aquality necessary to create benefits in health plans for nutritionalsupplements. I personally know of Fortune 500 companies whohave expressed interest in obtaining such coverage but will not be-cause of the tax issue. No. 5, the Federal Government should promote and encourage complementary and alternative health care education at U.S. medi-cal schools. Really, those are the five areas which I believe would signifi- cantly and positively impact the introduction of complementary andalternative health care into third-party reimbursement systems. Thank you for your time. I will be pleased to answer any ques- tions. Mr. B URTON . Thank you for being with us. We appreciate your statement and your recommendations. [The prepared statement of Mr. Devries follows:] VerDate Navarro, I understand you had a brief state- ment you wanted to make. Do you feel a little bit more secure nowand relaxed? Mr. N AVARRO . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for not fol- lowing your instructions a little more clearly. Mr. B URTON . No, that 's all right. Mr. N AVARRO . As you know, my name is Jim Navarro; and I am the father of Thomas Navarro, who is a 4-year-old victim of cancer.My son Thomas has medulloblastoma, which is a brain tumor lo-cated on the cerebellum. He was diagnosed with his illness Septem-ber 17, 1999. I cannot begin to tell you the impact the news had on his mother and me, and his brothers and sister. To say that it was overwhelm-ing is an understatement compared to what we dealt with after-wards. It was the lesser of two evils, for the evil that was per-petrated against our family was the reality that we, as parents,had been stripped of our rights to make life-and-death decisions forour son. You see, we had discovered, much to our horror, that asparents of a terminally ill child we were no longer deemed intel-ligent enough or responsible enough to make decisions regardingour son 's care. We had been stripped of our freedom, the freedom of choice. So I am here today in an effort to answer the question that has haunted his mother and me since that dark day in September. Thequestion is: Who decides? Who decides which doctors will treat myson? Who decides which medicines will be introduced into his bodyto fight this disease? Who decides whether he lives with dignityand quality of life or dies as some doctor 's clinical experiment? If any of you here today can answer this question, please tell me, who decides? Since those early days in September when Thomas was first di- agnosed, we have been challenged as to our capability. We havebeen challenged as to the type of parents we are. Our integrity hasbeen brought into question. Our name has been attacked. We havebeen threatened with the loss of our child, not by the disease thathe fights but by the Child Protective Services acting as the strong-arm enforcers of the medical community. To me, it is a grievous injustice in this country we call America that we as parents do not have the right to do that which we feelis best for our son. Our decisions regarding Thomas ' health have not been made out of emotion but by the sheer will and determina-tion to see our son survive when all others have said he will notlive. I do not want my son kept alive using radiation and chemo- therapy so that some doctor can see he reached a 5-year survivalrate, so that some doctor can say he is a smashing success, whenin reality history of this disease tells us that he will be left severelydamaged as a result of the devastating side effects of the chemoand radiation. In the process of doing what we felt would be best for our son, we have paid a very heavy price. It has cost us our home, our busi-ness and our friends. But it is a price that we would gladly payagain for the results that we have achieved to date. Those resultsare that our son is winning his fight against his illness, not be- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul and chemotherapy but because we found an al- ternative therapy that has not only shown to be winning againsthis cancer but it has allowed him to maintain his dignity and qual-ity of life. Mr. Chairman, I ask that this hearing not be a time of petty jealousies being brought to light in the medical community but thatit be a time the world be made aware that if we dare call ourselvesAmericans that we be allowed to live as a free people, free to makeour own choices, free to pick our own doctors, free to pick our owntreatments, free indeed to decide our own destinies. It is time to say good-bye to the old way of thinking. It is time to say good-bye and time to embrace the future, a future of newideas, a future of alternatives. Radiation and chemo have left in their path a grim testimony, a lineage that my wife and I have seen over the past months ofdeath and despair; a path of children left blind, sterile, retarded,mentally and physically damaged by the excellent results of con-ventional medicine. Mr. Chairman, every child that was diagnosed with my son from the day he first became ill we have buried, and what discouragesme about today is that the very doctor who has sat in judgmentover my son and denied him access to medical attention that wechoose best and denied him freedom didn 't even extend to me the courtesy to stay here and hear me speak, and I have traveled thou-sands of miles from a foreign country to spend 5 minutes with you. I understand he has an important job as a Director at the FDA, but I, too, like many other parents, have a very important job, andthat is that I am the father of a terminally ill child and it is mysolemn duty to keep him alive and healthy and happy. Thank you, sir, for your time.Mr. B URTON . Well, I can assure you he will get a copy of your statement. Mr. N AVARRO . Thank you. [The prepared statement of Chairman, can I just show you something really quick? Mr. B URTON . What is that? Mr. N AVARRO . As a man of common sense, I am sure you will agree. You have seen my son Thomas. This is his new best friend,Linn, after 2 months of chemotherapy. It triggered in him a reac-tion of tumors throughout his head and broke his jaw. May I show the audience?Mr. B URTON . Sure. Mr. N AVARRO . This is Thomas using alternative therapy and this is Linn, conventional therapy, 2 months ' worth. Which would you chose? Who decides?Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Navarro. If you have an extra copy of those pictures, we would like to have those submitted for therecord as well. Mr. N AVARRO . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Let us get on with the questions here. Mr. Navarro, let 's start with you. How much research did you do before you determined that your son 's treatment should be in the area that you talked about? Mr. N AVARRO . Mr. Chairman, I have to date read approximately 100 books on neurology, pediatric cancers, brain tumors, medullo-blastoma. I have gone through literally every medical abstract thatI could get my hands on, and that is from all the major cancer clin-ics throughout North America and Europe, and I am ready to chal-lenge the test to become a doctor, I think, at this point. Mr. B URTON . OK. Since the Food and Drug Administration has denied Thomas access to antineoplastons, what did you do? Youtook him out of the country, is that what you had to do? Mr. N AVARRO . Yes, sir, we did. Mr. B URTON . Because of the threat that the different agencies might take custody of your son? Mr. N AVARRO . It was actually twofold. It was not only to keep him safe from the harm of conventional medicine but also becausewe realized, because of the nature of his cancer, that he neededtreatment soon before we lost him to recurrence. And, sir, if I might add to that, one of the things that perhaps wasn 't clarified earlier is the fact that, although they may say they do have a 70 percent success rate, I think the part that got left outwas the fact that they may stop or even destroy the medullo-blastoma but what you are not told is it is the new cancer that thechemo creates that kills the child. Many times they may start withmedulloblastoma but they die of a secondary type of cancer, and Iam sure Mr. Horwin can substantiate that through his research. Mr. B URTON . What do you say to the statements made by physi- cians and those at the FDA that the success rates are so profoundfor chemotherapy and radiation with medulloblastoma that it isstandard treatment that should be followed? The same thing Iguess you just said. Mr. N AVARRO . I would \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . You challenge it? Mr. N AVARRO . I would not only challenge that, I would remind you, Mr. Chairman, that genocide was Hitler 's standard of treat- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 their social ills in World War II Germany, and it didn 't make that right. We are experiencing a new genocide today.Mr. B URTON . Mr. and Mrs. Horwin, if you had read the papers you put together for this hearing prior to choosing treatment forAlexander, I presume you would have done it differently? Mrs. H ORWIN . Absolutely. Mr. H ORWIN . Yes. What we did at that point is listen to our oncologist. He said that there was a very good likelihood that hewould be able to help our son, but at the same time he remindedus of the severe neurotoxic effects of his therapy, and when he out-lined those to us we said, gee, the treatment sounds worse than thedisease in some respects, and we began to look for other things. We found Burzynski 's therapy. We did the responsible thing that parents would do in a case like this, which means do your research,do your homework, speak to other parents, go down to the clinic,which I did. I met with the patients. I spoke with them. I met thechildren. I realized that this was exactly what Alexander needed. We went down there with our son ready to start treatment; and, as I mentioned, we were turned away. At that point, we didn 't know what to do. We had no other options left. We went back, en-rolled him in the chemotherapy protocol. Again, we were reminded many, many times that this was state- of-the-art. It was going to be successful. If it didn 't save his life, it was going to extend his life. So that 's why 3 months into this protocol, when he had \u2014again, this is a point that Mr. Navarro just made. My son was diagnosed with medulloblastoma. According tothe neurosurgeons, he died of leptomeningeal carcoma. It is an-other cancer. He had this other cancer come back. It was 30 tumorsthroughout his brain and spine, and they sent us home. They said,he is going to die. Mr. B URTON . I presume that the information that you are giving us, all that research that you have done, there is no question youwould have handled it differently. Mr. H ORWIN . Yes. Mr. B URTON . We will make sure all of your information is for- warded to the FDA and ask for a response to that. Mr. H ORWIN . May I add one other thing, Chairman? Mr. B URTON . Sure. Mr. H ORWIN . Thank you. When they talk about standard of care, I get extremely frustrated with that because, frankly, it is a veryirresponsible comment to make that there is a standard of care forthis disease. All you have to do is to be able to read English toknow there is no standard of care. The other thing you might want to remind some of these folks at the FDA is there are some very prominent cancer hospitals outthere. I will name two of them. One is St. Jude 's. The other is Me- morial Sloan Kettering. You would imagine if there is a standardof care that it would be practiced at both of those hospitals. We were at St. Jude 's at one point to see if there was something there for Alexander. This is the standard of care right now at St.Jude 's\u2014this is a very experienced pediatric oncologist who has been practicing for 20 years, realizes that these children are dying,and he is doing what he can to try to save their lives. This is his VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul He drills holes in children 's brains. He puts in an ommaya reservoir. This allows him to inject chemotherapy di-rectly into the brain. He also does, every other day, spinal taps forthe very same purpose. This is a very desperate measure, injectingchemotherapy directly into the brain and spine. When we asked him about the track record for this, he was a very honest physician, he said there is none. I asked him about thelong-term side effects, the short-term side effects, the efficacy. Hehad no information for us. My wife turned to him and said, are yougoing to use our son as a guinea pig? And he looked at her andhe said, yes, Mrs. Horwin. So this is the kind of desperate measures this one very experi- enced pediatric oncologist is using. If there was an effective stand-ard of care, do you think he would use something as desperate asthis? I don 't think so. Memorial Sloan Kettering, same thing. There is a doctor there using what is called ABMT, autologais bone marrow transplant.The idea behind that is you give a child such high dose chemo-therapy that his bone marrow can no longer produce blood cells,and he will die. So what they do in preparation for this is actuallytake bone marrow, they store it in a freezer and they take it outforcibly, store it in a freezer, give the child very high dose chemo-therapy, bring him to the brink of death and then, quote, and thisis in their language, they try to rescue him, they try to rescue himby giving back his bone marrow. The only problem with this one is, if you read his articles, any- body can do it who can read English, the death rate from the treat-ment itself is 8 to 10 percent. That means almost 10 percent of thechildren die from the therapy. They give this kid \u2014these kids such high dose chemo and they die within a couple of days. That 's a pretty desperate measure. Again, if there was an effective standard of care for this disease you wouldn 't have experienced pediatric oncologists in leading can- cer hospitals using such ridiculous methods. Mr. B URTON . Well, thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Horwin. Dr. Geffen, do you think we can move to an integrated approach to treating cancer and not be required to use chemotherapy and ra-diation? Do you think that can happen, and do you think it shouldhappen? You are an oncologist, and you have used chemotherapy and ra- diation, I presume \u2014\u2014 Dr. G EFFEN . That 's correct. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. In conjunction with others. Do you think there is alternative therapies that could be used that wouldnot necessitate the use of those? Dr. G EFFEN . From my experience over about 10 years practicing oncology, what has become very clear to me is that chemotherapyand radiation are not the problem. If you were to ask Lance Arm-strong, for example, his opinion of chemotherapy, he would have acompletely different view. It saved his life. He had metastatic tes-ticular cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation cures many, many,many people, but it is very clear, from what we have heard todayand from what we know, that there are perhaps equally as manypeople, if not more, who it doesn 't cure. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 what is needed is the honesty, the humility, to admit that we are very handicapped in our ability to treat many cancers. Butlet's not discount the areas where we have phenomenal success. I don 't think the problem is chemotherapy. I think the problem is when it is used indiscriminately, when it is used in a rigid, for-malized protocol. As I said earlier, the problem is that mainstreammedicine focuses on the disease. The goal is to get rid of the dis-ease and, along the way, the person with the disease and theirloved ones, as we have heard, are left behind. We have heard somevery moving examples of just exactly that problem. I believe it stems from the basic orientation of our health care system, which is one which reimburses doctors to diagnose andtreat diseases, rather than to ask deep and meaningful questionsabout how can we really help this human being \u2014besides focusing on what is their tissue diagnosis and what are the current stand-ard protocols calling for. I think that the problem won 't be solved until we decide as a cul- ture that our goal really is to love and care for people, not at theexpense of scientifically based medicine but in a context of love andcare that says \u2014in which we are honest and say \u2014you know, we can't solve this problem, but we can explore any modality that can help, and we will. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Morella, do you have any questions? Mrs. M ORELLA . First of all, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your efforts to hold this important hearing on integrative oncol-ogy. This last panel is exceedingly moving. Certainly, I am someone who represents the National Institutes of Health in my district andthe Food and Drug Administration in my district, and I know thatwe do have that office and I recognized and appreciated, Mr.Devries, the suggestions that you gave and I marked up \u2014and the others perhaps all agree with it \u2014where he mentioned the need for further research that should be done, research on clinical efficacyof the complementary and alternative therapies. It seems to me also full information is necessary, too. We need to do more with educating the public, educating our medical com-munity, to be open about it. And I think with the full informationI think we need to look at the credentials, history, official informa-tion. There is just so much more we need to do, and I think thisis what you have pointed out with this very moving hearing. I continue to have some questions, but I will be following those in terms of what is being done at our medical facilities and whatis being done in States in terms of various kinds of licensing. SoI thank you for being here and sharing with us your very movingstories. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership throughout on this on this issue. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. [The prepared Constance A. Let me go to Mr. Cary. What things can Medicare do to improve the reimbursement structure of the integrated oncology? Mr. C ARY. Basically to include things that Mr. Devries said that many other insurers are waking up to, and that is the fact thatmany of the naturopathic and complementary things that we aretalking about are not that much \u2014they are not that expensive com- pared to conventional medicine, and the patient outcome is better. So I would say the licensing of naturopaths as in 11 States, to keep pushing that forward; and then to cover some of the com-plementary things like psychoneuroimmunology, nutrition counsel-ing, vitamins, botanicals, etc., need to be included. Speaking from a hospital operation 's perspective, many hospitals are having a hard time doing that. We at the present time includeit in our therapies, regardless if it is a Medicare patient or anyoneelse, even though they don 't pay, but that 's becoming more and more difficult. In talking to my colleagues and in telling some ofthe other hospital administrators that I relate to, they are tellingme they would like to provide more therapy, but they are not ableto for financial reasons. Mr. B URTON . I think it was Mr. Devries that a while ago was talking about some senior patients \u2014I think it was you, or Mr. Cary, I am not sure which \u2014and they were going through chemo- therapy and radiation at an advanced stage and maybe some othertreatments as well \u2014or maybe it was Dr. Geffen, I can 't recall who it was \u2014and had they maybe had some complementary therapy along with it the problem \u2014their life quality of life would have been better and they might have lived longer. And I presume you weretalking about massage therapy and the other therapies, maybe acu-puncture and other things that went along with that. I don 't know if there are any clinical studies or anything that would bear on this, but when all these things are done together,do people live longer? I mean, do we have any statistics or any em-pirical evidence that would say that somebody who gets a combina-tion of these treatments instead of just a standard treatment wouldsurvive and live a longer and better quality of life? Whichever oneof you wants to answer. Mr. C ARY. My answer would be it is still anecdotal. We don 't have a large enough sample size, but every patient that goesthrough it, the quality of life has improved. On things that we have sample sizes, it indicates that patients are doing better by having those treatments. As Dr. Geffen was saying, chemotherapy, radiation and surgery benefit many patients. The problem is, those things are toxic on thebody. They pull the body down. And by building up the body 's im- mune system, by making it stronger, it is able to tolerate thosetreatments better, and we also believe there is an immune re-sponse. Mr. B URTON . So you believe \u2014although you don 't have statistical evidence but you believe they do live longer afterwards? Mr. C ARY. Yes. I would like to see more funding come into loca- tions like Dr. Geffen and to Cancer Treatment Centers of Americawhere we can prove our point. If we get stuck in phase one andphase two trials forever, we are never going to get it to the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul going to be more cases like the Navarros and the Horwins in the future. The longer we wait, time is an issue.Mr. B URTON . Well, you are not saying this but I am, one of the things that concerns me is that the conventional wisdom and thepharmaceutical companies and the other people who are involvedin helping in the quality of medicine have a vested interest inmaybe keeping some of these practices going on, and the new alter-native therapies that could be combined with conventional therapyare being left out like an orphan child because of the almighty dol-lar. I know you guys can 't say, especially Dr. Geffen, because he is a physician who might be in jeopardy down the road from somemedical entity. I don 't know who it might be, but it does concern me. It concerns me a great deal. We ought to be concerned about the pharmaceutical companies creating new and better drugs that can help improve and extendthe quality of life, but we should not keep ourselves in the moldthat we are in right now when there is new therapies coming alongthat, when added to the conventional therapies, can do a better job. I sometimes think that maybe the FDA and other health agen- cies in this country maybe are inadvertently controlled in part bythe pharmaceutical companies, so we don 't get these new therapies and these new things added to the mix. I think that is unfortunate.But we are looking into that, and I can promise you we are goingto continue to look into it, look into conflicts of interests and allthat sort of thing, to get it as cleaned up as possible. Does anybody have any final comments? I think we are getting ready to wrap this up. Mr. N AVARRO . Mr. Chairman, I promise to be brief. I just discovered Thomas 's consent form for radiation and what the doctor said he would face: hair loss, skin redness, fatigue, nau-sea, vomiting, loose BMs, fluid in the middle ear, hearing loss,hypothyroidism, spinal growth deficit, loss of IQ, memory loss, sec-ondary tumors, hypopituitarism, low level hormones, and radiationnecrosis, which is a disintegration of his brain matter. This helpedmake the decision that we made. Mr. B URTON . The doctor gave you that and said that was the side effects one could expect. Mr. N AVARRO . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Anyone else have any final comments? Dr. G EFFEN . I just wanted to say, you know, not only am I not afraid to speak the truth, but in fact in my testimony today I saidthat I really believe one of the most fundamental core issues thatsooner or later we are going to have to confront in this country, aswe are involved in this discussion of how do we proceed in a waythat makes sense, is the fact that, in America, doctors are paid totreat diseases. We are not paid, we are not honored, we are nottrained and certainly not reimbursed, to care for people in a com-prehensive way. So it is impossible to overestimate the overbearinginfluence of that on every decision that is made in the medical en-vironment. I am not condemning physicians, because I believe most physi- cians are genuinely motivated by a desire to help. But we are oper- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 in a health care system that is fundamentally crazy in many, many respects. Because our interest of caring fora person is in opposition to Medicare regulations, insurance regula-tions, reimbursement structures, that do not allow us to really carefor the human being. We have to make a diagnosis and prescribea drug and move on. And that is a fundamental issue that sooneror later will have to be looked at. Mr. B URTON . Very good. Anyone else?Mr. C ARY. The last comment that I would like to make is the pro- ton\u2014the photon and the neutron that hit the tumor do kill the tumor. The problem is, as he said, the side effects are what are sodraconian. But through naturopathic and CAM therapies, we canalleviate that. You don 't have to have as high doses, or you can pin- point it more closely, or you can take other therapies andbotanicals that have an offsetting effect. Similar to what you saidrelated to your stomach, we have similar things with cancer pa-tients. In our Seattle practice, we have patients that went through very extensive bone marrow transplants, and the quality of life was sopoor, treated somewhere else, but so poor, they did not \u2014they were thinking of \u2014they had suicidal ideations. They had all kinds of problems. But we were able to alleviate the side effects and the re-sults of their conventional therapy through naturopathic medicine,through CAM therapies. It would be so much better if our integrated health care system could be providing that at the same time, so you get the thera-peutic effects of CAM therapies at the same time you can tie inconventional and alleviate the radiation therapy, the surgery, thechemotherapy, by using more CAM therapies. Mr. B URTON . You know, I will be contacting people at the Food and Drug Administration, the doctors and others, and some ofthem are still here. And I have talked to some of the people in yourfacility, and they have told me that where chemotherapy is con-cerned and radiation, that sometimes they will give smaller dosesover a longer period of time, spread out, and, in the interim, theywill give vitamins and minerals and other supplements that stimu-late the immune system so while the chemotherapy is killing thetumor or cancer, the body 's immune system has been boosted. It seems to me that is something that our health agencies ought totake a look at, whether or not just a bombardment by conventionalmedicine is going to solve the problem, or whether or not it shouldbe maybe extended over a longer period of time, along with thesupplements that you are talking about. Mr. C ARY. We find that patients can tolerate treatment much better. Patients that could not take the high doses of chemotherapycan take it over time much better, tolerate it, and the tumor re-sponse is very high. And, as you said, the immune system is fired up, and it gives you a better result. Mr. B URTON . I want to thank all of you for being here. It has been a long day. I apologize for the time we were on the floor andhad those votes. But you have all had so much to contribute. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul that some of you have suffered a great deal, and our heart goes out to you, and we will try to continue to be vigilant intrying to bring about some positive change. Thank you very much. We stand adjourned.[Whereupon, at 5:15 p.m., the committee was adjourned.] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 MILLENNIUM \u2014 INTEGRATIVE ONCOLOGY THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 2000 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1 p.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Stephen Horn (acting chair-man of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Horn, Burton, Morella, Sanford, Hutch- inson, Waxman, and Kevin counsel and parliamentarian; Mark Corallo, director of communica-tions; S. Elizabeth Clay and Nicole Petrosino, professional staffmembers; Lisa Smith Arafune, chief clerk; Robert A.

Mr. H ORN. Good afternoon. The Committee on Government Re- form will come to order. And I ask unanimous consent all Members ' and witnesses ' writ- ten and opening statements will be automatically included in therecord. And without objection, that 's so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits, extraneous or tabular material referred to in the hearing will be included in therecord. Without objection, so ordered. Today the Committee on Government Reform begins the second of our 2 days of cancer hearings. This has been a busy week forcancer awareness. It 's also been very moving when you see the wit- nesses that have come before us with their stories and their lossesand their benefits. June 3rd was the Coleman National Race for the Cure event in Washington. 69,000 participated in this Washington event, whichis one of the 109 events sponsored across the country to raiseawareness and research dollars to work toward a cure for breastcancer. June 4th was National Cancer Survivors Day. Tomorrowand through the weekend, the Third Annual Comprehensive Can-cer Care Conference on Complementary and Alternative Medicine,sponsored by the Center for Mind/Body Medicine, the NationalCancer Institute, the National Center for Complementary and Al- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul University of Texas at Houston Medi- cal Center. Yesterday we were pleased to hear from Congresswoman Debo- rah Pryce, the Horwin family, James Navarro, about the challengesparents face when their child is diagnosed with cancer. We alsoheard from Dr. Jeremy Giffin and Mr. Roger Kerry about integrat-ing complementary therapies into a conventional oncology environ-ment. They explained the benefits, including better quality of lifeand at times extension of life, and also the challenges which in-clude the lack of reimbursement for treatments such as acupunc-ture, guided imagery, massage therapy and naturopathic medicine.Mr. George DeVries outlined advances in the private sector insur-ance programs regarding the addition of complementary and alter-native therapy benefits packages. We also received updates from the National Center for Com- plementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Cancer Insti-tute, the Health Care Financing Administration and the Food andDrug Administration. Today I 'm pleased that we will be hearing from Mrs. Connie Payton. Mrs. Payton established the WalterPayton Cancer Fund as a living legacy of her husband, the Hall ofFame running back from the Chicago Bears who died last yearfrom cancer. She will be joined by Dr. Jeanne Achterberg, a psychologist and expert in mind/body medicine. In addition to being the senior editorof Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, a peer reviewedmedical journal, Dr. Achterberg is also a cancer patient. Dr. HaroldFreeman, Director of Surgery at North General Hospital in NewYork City, will address racial disparities in care. Last year, the New England Journal of Medicine published re- search that highlighted one area of racial disparity. The observa-tional study assessed the rates of resection and survival among el-derly patients with early stage, non small cell lung cancer. Thereis agreement that surgical resection saves lives in patients withearly stage non small cell lung cancer. After accounting for the confounding effects of sex, coexisting ill- ness, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage and availability ofcare, the study showed that Black patients, once lung cancer hadbeen diagnosed and staged, were 12.7 percent less likely thanWhite patients to undergo surgical resection. Blacks also had alower 5 year survival rate than Whites. The authors concluded thatif Blacks were to undergo surgery at the same rate as Whites, thesurvival rate among Blacks would be substantially improved andalmost equal to that among Whites. Dr. George Pettit is the director of the Cancer Research Institute at Arizona State University. Dr. Pettit will address the discoveryand development of new anti-cancer drugs from plants, marine or-ganisms and microorganisms. If we 're going to find a cure for can- cer, it most certainly is going to be from nature. It is very impor-tant that the National Cancer Institute strike an appropriate bal-ance with genetics research, natural product drug development,complementary and alternative therapies for cancer, prevention re-search and other research portfolios. Dr. Daniel Nixon, the president of the American Health Founda- tion in New York, and a professor of experimental oncology at the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 South Carolina in Charleston will present testimony on integrative approaches in lung cancer. Dr. GiancarloPizza of Italy and Dr. Wolfgang Woeppel of Germany will presenttestimony regarding developments in integrative oncology in Eu-rope. Burton Goldberg has led the field in providing the inform-ative publications in alternative medicine. These publications in-clude Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide to Cancer. Thehearing record will remain open until June 21st for those whowould like to submit a statement into the hearing record. I now will yield to the chairman of the full committee, the gen- tleman from Indiana, if he 'd like to comment at this point. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to say I really appreciate you handling the hearing today and being chairman ofthis very important meeting. I had an opportunity last night to be with Connie Payton, who 's with us today. I was a great admirer, Mr. Chairman, of her hus-band, who was not only an outstanding football player, but a veryfine human being as well. He was a real credit to the athletic com-munity as well as to the human race. And I got to know Connie yesterday, and she 's now heading up the Walter Payton Cancer Fund, to also work on cancer research.I wanted to say hello to her and tell her I would be here for hertestimony, for the early part of the hearing, but then I have toleave. But I really do appreciate all you 're doing and what you 've gone through. I also want to thank the other members of the panels that are going to be here today. I really appreciate them being here, becauseit's such a very, very important topic. And I want to apologize for my having to leave. It 's one of those situations where I 've just got double duty. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. H ORN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have the presence of the Delegate from the District of Colum- bia. I 'm delighted to recognize Ms. Norton for an opening state- ment. Ms. N ORTON . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I very much appreciate that the chairman, himself, has called this very important hearing. I had intended to be here for the en-tire hearing. My staff tells me that a colloquy between myself andChairman Porter must take place almost immediately during thisperiod, while they 're in general debate. So I am literally running to the House floor, because it involves one of my own bills. Then there is a press conference with our Mayor on school board elections. I will endeavor to get back. I did want to say to Mrs.Payton, who came to speak and spoke eloquently to the Congres-sional Black Caucus yesterday, how much I appreciate the leader-ship she is taking on cancer, a disease in outsize proportion in ourcommunity. More than anything that any elected official can do, even the kindness of our chairman in holding this hearing, a role model likeyou who has suffered a loss which the entire country has felt canhelp us reach people who we might otherwise have not been ableto reach, and to obtain treatments of the kind that have not beenpopularized because they are so little known. You struck a real VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul you spoke so beautifully and eloquently yesterday about what the non-traditional treatment had done for your hus-band, a great athlete and a great man. So I come on my way to the House, both to thank the chairman, and of course, above all, to thank you for what you 're doing and what it means to our country. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair-man. Mr. H ORN. We thank you for that presentation. I now yield to the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, for an opening statement. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We continue this hearing today, after the hearing yesterday on the same subject, and we face many challenges relating to cancer.There are many questions about the causes and biology of manycancers and there are ongoing debates about the best treatments.Because so much remains unknown, and because cancer continuesto affect so many lives, it is imperative that we continue to con-centrate our efforts on developing the most effective prevention, de-tection and treatment approaches. We must also work to ensure that all patients have access to ap- propriate treatment and to accurate information about their treat-ment options. As we face these challenges, it is important that wekeep an open mind about innovative and unconventional ap-proaches to cancer treatment and prevention. But our first prioritymust be ensuring patients have access to treatments which areproven to offer the best chances of curing them. Our second priority should be the rigorous testing of new thera- pies, including complementary and alternative therapies, to deter-mine their safety and efficacy. We cannot rely on anecdotal evi-dence which sometimes proves to be misleading. Instead, we needto rely on the scientific method, which can give us objective an-swers about whether a product works and is safe. This standardmust be applied to all therapies in order to ensure that patientscan rely on the claims made by providers or manufacturers. Some of the witnesses at our hearings on this subject will share their personal experiences with cancer. Others will highlight ongo-ing efforts to advance cancer prevention, detection and treatment.There 's also been testimony regarding payment for these treat- ments. This discussion will increase our understanding of the op-tions currently available to people who have been diagnosed withcancer, and of the research efforts we should continue to explore.I join my colleagues in welcoming them and look forward to theirtestimony. This hearing marks a truly landmark event. A couple of days ago, President Clinton announced that Medicare will cover the costof participating in clinical trials. This is a dramatic and enor-mously important step forward for the health of older Americans.It will speed the development of new therapies and it should leadCongress to ensure that routine patient costs are covered for allwho received their health care from Government programs likeMedicaid, veterans, community health centers and the IndianHealth Service. Older Americans will now be more willing and able to enter trials for new cancer treatments, as well as for heart disease, ar- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul diseases affecting the elderly. So I ap- plaud the President and Secretary Shalala for this decision. But we should also recognize that Health Care Financing Admin- istration 's new policy is based on legislation sponsored by our col- leagues Nancy Johnson, Ben Cardin and Ken Bentsen, as well asSenators Rockefeller and Mack. They should be very pleased thattheir proposal will benefit the health and welfare of older Ameri-cans. I want to welcome the hearings that will be here today, and Mrs. Payton particularly. I 'm delighted you 're here to share your con- cerns with us and we 're looking forward to hearing from you and from all the witnesses. I have to say in advance that unfortunatelyon the House floor is the appropriations bill for Health and HumanServices, so I 'm going to have to be on the House floor and won 't be here to personally hear all the testimony. But I will get a chance to review all the testimony, and I may even ask, if the Chair would permit, to send questions and to re-ceive responses in writing, so those can also be in the record,should these written testimonies reported at today 's hearing pro- voke additional questions that I might have and want to have forthe record. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me and yield back my time. Mr. H ORN. Without objection, both majority and minority staff will have a series of questions. And once we swear the witnesses,we will try to get many of these questions in today. But we knowyou have travel schedules and so do some of the Members. So wewill, if you don 't mind, try to respond to these questions. We 'll make it part of the hearing record, to round out all the differentquestions. So we will now swear in the witnesses, and we would like for panel four, since we had three yesterday, Mrs. Payton, Dr.Achterberg, Dr. Freeman, Dr. Woeppel, Dr. Pizza, and Dr. GeorgePettit, if you will all come up. There are signs here for you, startingwith Dr. Freeman, Dr. Achterberg and Dr. Woeppel and Mrs.Payton. If you 'll raise your right hands. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. H ORN. Thank you. If there are any staff behind you, let us know. So we 're just going to go down the list. Mrs. Payton is going to have staff behind. So in remarks you will be giving here, please,you will have the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. OK, the clerk will get the names, put them in the record at that point. I do want to recognize former Congressman Berkeley Bedell,Democrat from Iowa, who 's done a lot to help alternative cancer and his great interest. So I wonder, Congressman, if we can \u2014\u2014 Mr. B EDELL . Right here. Mr. H ORN. Oh, OK. We don 't have a sign for you somehow, but welcome. We 're delighted to have you here. Because you 've made some of the witnesses possible to be here, and that 's appreciated. Mr. B EDELL . You know, Mr. Chairman, Congressmen do not like to be identified as such, so that 's why I don 't have a sign. Mr. H ORN. OK. Now, we 'll start then with Mrs. Connie Payton, of the Walter Payton Cancer Fund. Mrs. Payton, please proceed. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 JEANNE ACHTERBERG, SANTA FE, NM; DR. GEORGEPETTIT, M.D., DIRECTOR, CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, NATURAL PRODUCT DRUG DE-VELOPMENT; DR. WOLFGANG WOEPPEL, GERMANY; AND DR.HAROLD FREEMAN, M.D., NORTH GENERAL HOSPITAL, NEWYORK, MINORITIES ACCESS TO ONCOLOGY CARE Mrs. P AYTON . Distinguished members of the House Committee on Government Reform, I am honored to be invited here by Chair-man Burton to testify at your extremely timely and importanthearings. Our common concern for developing a cure for cancer and pro- moting creative new methods for treatment for those who are cur-rently suffering from cancer unites us all regardless of our race,creed or political persuasion. I would also like to thank the commit-tee staff, including Beth Clay, T.J. Lightle and Mark Corallo, fortheir assistance this week on Capitol Hill of the kickoff of the Wal-ter Payton Cancer Fund. As most of you know, my late husband Walter died November 1st at the age of 45. I would like to share with you today my personalstory of how Walter and my family struggled with cancer and whyI firmly believe in integrative oncology. And my story is this. Wal-ter was fortunate that he had great insurance coverage. And I 'm thankful for that today, because today we 're still receiving invoices from bills from insurance companies. So I 'm thankful that we weren 't burdened with that. But he also got real good treatment from other major hospitals, but it was in August of last year, after finding out that Walter hadaggressive tumors in his bile duct area, that he had started havingsevere pain and by this time, we were told that there was nothingmuch the doctors could do for him but just keep him comfortable,and under their assumption, they pretty much just put him on ex-tremely harsh drugs that kept him so out of it that he had no com-munication at all with family members. He was pretty much layingthere and dying. And through a friend of mine who was a cancer survivor, who had been a patient at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America,she invited me to an outing they were having on nutrition thatmade me realize that my husband was laying there dying mainlyfrom, he had cancer, but it was malnutrition and dehydration thatwas going to kill him before the cancer. And thank goodness, wefound out about the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, who arereal into real innovative treatments. And also, they have a humanside. You felt comfortable sharing with them. And if you 're spiritual people, like my husband and I are, they had wonderful pastoral counselors and within a week, they madea difference in my husband 's life. The first week there, he had no knowledge of what was going on, because that 's how drugged up he was. And within a week, through nutrition and vitamins and relax-ation techniques and pastoral counseling to nourish his spiritualside and to continue to give him hope to fight with this dreadeddisease, they made a big difference in my husband 's life. So I'm proud to be involved, and I 'm proud to be here today be- cause I know it makes a difference in a person 's life. And I would VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul insurance companies and the medical field would be open to these services and use them as a complement to other medicinesthat are out there. My husband was treated with high doses of ra-diation. It 's not something he wanted, but he was told that was his only help. So what do you do, when you 're told that 's the only way you can live. And he did, he went through 4 to 5 weeks of intense radiation that he felt damaged his kidneys, took away his taste, took awayhis smell. And he couldn 't enjoy foods and foods that he normally would enjoy. And my husband was a man who loved smelling won-derful things, but all of that became a burden to him after he hadgone through the radiation. So I'm here to say that integrative oncology and innovative medi- cines do work, and they gave my husband back to my kids and Ifor 2 12months, to a way where we were able to interact with him. And he was able to live his last couple of months on this Earthwith some dignity. I 'm happy to be here, and if launching this Wal- ter Payton Fund will make a difference in our researching new in-tegrative medicines, to make a difference in cancer patients ' lives, then I 'm happy and I feel like I 've done my job and I 've done his name justice and for what he stood for. Because he was a goodhuman being, and he was into helping people. And I know hewould want us to do something to fight this dreaded disease. [The prepared statement of Mrs. Payton follows:] VerDate ORN. A very moving statement, just as the ones about chil- dren were yesterday. So I think we get a feeling, although we cannever be in your shoes, we get a feeling of how moving that is. AndI know your husband would really appreciate what you 've done. Our next witness has a travel problem, Dr. Wolfgang Woeppel, so we 're going to ask you to speak next, sir. Dr. W OEPPEL . I am Dr. Wolfgang Woeppel. I operate a medical hospital in Bad Merghentheim, Germany, specializing in the treat-ment of cancer. We operate from a different basic belief in regard to cancer as compared to conventional cancer treatments. Conventional treat-ments focus exclusively on the destruction of the cancer tumor, pri-marily with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. We believe thatcancer is a disease of the whole body, and our cancer treatmentsfocus on the patient 's entire body, enabling the body to overcome the disease. We believe that it is insufficient to destroy the tumor if one does not also focus on restoring the patient to sufficient health so thatthe body will prevent the reoccurrence of cancer. Our treatmentsconsists of several individual methods, directed at detoxifying thebody, strengthening the immune system and restoring the patient 's total health. Statistics show that for 30 or 40 years, there has been a certain stagnation in the healing rate of cancer with conventional treat-ment. We need, therefore, a change in the thinking. I am able to use some medical treatments, for example, that are legal in my country but not in yours. All of these medications areessentially non-toxic and I believe highly beneficial. A study done by the University of Wuerzburg of our treatments stated, ''We found that the survival time from the beginning of gen- eral metastases here was much longer than those mentioned inconventionally treated groups. The earlier such a treatment began,the longer was the survival time. '' The cost of treatment at my clinic is about $240 per day, includ- ing room, board, medication and doctor 's consultations. The treat- ment usually lasts from 4 to 6 weeks. In Germany, this is coveredby government health insurance. To summarize, first, I believe that the lack of progress in the treatment of cancer in spite of the billions of dollars spent for can-cer research means that we need to take a new look at cancertreatment. Second, I am administering essentially non-toxic cancertreatments focused on the patient 's entire body as compared to treatments focusing exclusively on destruction of the tumor. Theseconventional treatments frequently not only destroy the tumor butalso damage the patient 's health as well. Third, studies have confirmed the effectiveness of my treatment. Fourth, I am advised that these non-toxic treatments are substan-tially less expensive than conventional cancer treatments in theUnited States. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 of the parts of my non-toxic treatment are prohibited in the United States. And I am absolutely convinced that your can-cer patients might benefit greatly if such treatments could be madeavailable in your country. I thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. Woeppel follows:] VerDate ORN. Thank you very much. We appreciate that statement. I know you have to leave, so bon voyage. If you can stay for somequestions, we 'd appreciate it. Our third witness now on this panel is Dr. Jeanne Achterberg. Please proceed. Ms. A CHTERBERG . My name is Jeanne Achterberg, and I 'm a psy- chologist and a physiologist by training, and a human being bybirth, which is one thing that we need to keep in mind as we beginto talk about cancer. The crisis of cancer is one of immense proportions and it calls forth all the resources and makes glaringly clear the deficiencies inthe culture of modern medicine. It is, in fact, ladies and gentlemen,a crisis of the soul, and for the first time in our lives we may beasking questions about our immortality or mortality. And whencancer is diagnosed in oneself or a loved one, that which is creamrises to the top and trivialities float down. To think that cancer can be treated with only pills and potions and surgery and radiation, no matter how advanced they are,misses the whole point of this journey through cancer, which isawesome and terrible. The field of mind/body medicine, which isnow being called mind/body medicine, includes many therapeutictechniques, including counseling, biofeedback, hypnosis, imagery,meditation, and is now being expanded to include prayer and com-munity support. I, along with my co-chairs, Dr. Larry Dossey and Dr. James Gor- don, published the state-of-the-art of this field in Alternative Medi-cine: Expanding Medical Horizons, which was a report to NIHwhich I have included with my materials for this presentation. Weconcluded that the evidence was strong that the interactions be-tween mind and body and spirit were primary to the practice ofmedicine and not secondary. Furthermore, in comparison to other so-called alternative or inte- grative or complementary treatments, the mind/body field is sound-ly researched and provides a very, very good data base as well asa standard for other types of alternative therapies to follow. Themind/body work is not just something you do while you 're waiting for the undertaker to come, I have to tell you that. There is good evidence now that well crafted support groups may increase your life span by two times over. We know that certain ac-tivities, such as spending 20 minutes a day relaxing or meditating,increase the power of the immune system. We also know that joy,love and expressing your emotions from a deep level stimulate yourimmunology. And that having company, community, support groupor the lack thereof is the single greatest risk factor in death fromall disease, including cancer. So again, they 're not nice little activi- ties to do to keep you from thinking so much about the diagnosisyou've received. Over the past year, however, I learned about cancer in a far more profound way than I did over 25 years of being a research sci- entist. On July 23rd, I was diagnosed with an ocular melanoma inmy left eye and I was going blind. The ironies were too great. I hadwritten a book which is regarded as a classic text on imagery andthe use of inner vision. My work for the past 25 years has been VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul and its psychological and spiritual dimen- sions. St. Lucy, the patron saint of vision, was on my book, Woman as Healer, 10 years ago. And over the past few years, I 've been senior editor of Alternative Therapies, which is a peer reviewed medicaljournal. I know virtually everyone in the alternative and com-plementary community, and I taught at a medical school, got ten-ure, was there for 12 years. So I 'm fully aware of the politics of cancer and medicine. And as I say this, I do it with some humility. For now I have a disease so rare that there are no records in the world of a singlecase of primary ocular melanoma being treated by so-called alter-native methods. In the United States, the treatment of choice ishigh-tech radiation, or for me, because of the size of the tumor, re-moval of the eye. And ladies and gentlemen, I could not do it. Isimply could not have my eye removed. Although I fully anticipated using western medicine, when it came right down to it, I said, there must be a better way. Removalof my eye would not save my life. In fact, there is some evidencethat eye removal is followed by an increased instance of metastasis.But I knew that my tumor was very immunoreactive. So I gathered from all around the world everything that I knew about stimulating the immune system. And I became a walkingchemical stew. Happiness stimulates the immune system. So Iworked consistently, since the diagnosis, to bring more happinessinto my life. The evidence that prayer heals is overwhelming, andI became the subject of hundreds of prayers, thousands of prayers,from all around the world. And the healing power of communitywas given to me and touched my heart on a daily basis. Love, gifts,cards, poetry, songs, from so many people who said, we have nomedicine, but we have these. And on November 17th in Washing-ton, DC, I held on to the sides of a bed in a hotel room for 5 dayswhile whatever it was in the back of my eye exploded. I knew thatI could not present myself to modern medicine because the treat-ment would be cortisone, and that would stop the inflammatoryprocess. And at some level, instinctual level, I knew that my eyeneeded to inflame. So molecule by molecule, photon by photon, I 'm getting well. I 'm still alive, I don 't have a safety net of conventional medicine. I am the most privileged of all people with this grim diagnosis, and yetstill in the middle of the night, I wake in sheer terror. My conclusions about the practice of medical care in this country for cancer are that it must be imbued with trust, caring, effectivecommunication and a remembrance that all medicine practiced inall places in the world is connected to the divine. And that medi-cine for cancer, as practiced in this country, is brutal. That 's a fact. With all the critical flaws in the institute of medicine, though, I've found that there are mystics and sages and healers in the health care professions, and they too seek to resolve this crisis ofhuman values. Research into the causes and cure of cancer will notprovide effective treatment unless the broad spectrum of mind/bodyand even spirit issues is addressed. And in years to come, finally, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul that does not honor the deepest core of humanity with love, caring and recognition of the interaction of mind, bodyand spirit, will be declared both inhumane and unethical. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Ms. Achterberg follows:] VerDate ORN. Thank you very much. That is a very sensible presen- tation for us. The next witness I would like consent of my colleagues to have Representative Salmon of Arizona introduce Dr. Pettit. So if youwant to come down this way, you 've got any choice of seats. Mr. S ALMON . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'm pleased to introduce to the committee Dr. George Robert Pettit, the director of the Arizona State University Cancer Re-search Institute, which is based in my district. Dr. Pettit has de-voted 43 tireless years to cancer research. In that time, he 's discov- ered numerous anti-cancer drugs in nature, marine life, plants andmicroorganisms. Six of the drugs discovered by the ASU CancerResearch Institute are in clinical trials, and dozens more are inpre-clinical development or heading toward pre-clinical develop-ment. Dr. Pettit 's anti-cancer drugs have been acknowledged by CNN, Fortune Magazine, Time Magazine and U.S. News and World Re-port, just to name a few. The ASU Cancer Research Institute,under Dr. Pettit 's brilliant leadership, is the National Cancer Insti- tute's most prolific source of drugs derived from natural products and is regarded as one of the most productive anti-cancer drug dis-covery research groups in the world. I'm also pleased to be here as the chairman of the Honorary Ad- visory Council of the International Foundation for Anti-CancerDrug Discovery, a charitable organization founded and chaired bymy friend Sid Rosen of Phoenix, which works hard to accelerate theNation 's drug discovery pipeline. They also have a wonderful execu- tive director, and her name is Marcia Horn. I think you mightknow her. Mr. H ORN. I think I do. [Laughter.] Mr. S ALMON . Finally, I 'd like to wish a very happy birthday to Dr. Pettit today. Happy birthday. I 'd sing to you but I 'm a little off key. Thank you. Mr. H ORN. Well, since he only looks in his forties, I 'd hate to admit what his age is. Welcome. We 're delighted to have you here. Dr. P ETTIT . Distinguished chairman, distinguished members of the committee, the Honorable Matt Salmon from Arizona, who Ithank very much for that most kind introduction. Mr. Chairman, I 'm here as a friend of the Congress, your com- mittee, cancer patients and their families and the U.S. NationalCancer Institute. What I 'd like to relate is an ongoing problem that we have suffered over the last 25 years in our Government 's cancer conquest program. To begin with, thanks to the Congress, we are now saving, in the United States, several hundreds of thousands of cancer patients ayear, and over the world 's population, that amounts to millions of cancer patients. That had its start in congressional action in 1937,with the establishment of the U.S. National Cancer Institute. The next really crucial step was followed about 1955 with an ap- propriation of $5 million for starting an anti-cancer drug discoveryprogram in the U.S. National Cancer Institute that actually be-came viable by about 1957. In fact, it was September 1957, andthat's when I had the honor of starting to work with the U.S. Na- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul I was a 2-week old assistant professor at the University of Maine. As a result, I either have the fortune or misfortune of being the only chemist that has the institutional memory of our Govern-ment 's anti-cancer drug discovery program over the past 43 years. The next really major event which was again the result of the wonderful actions of Congress, namely the passage of the CancerConquest Act of 1971, that allowed the National Cancer Institute 's anti-cancer drug discovery program to be greatly accelerated andby 1974, the stage was set to actually double the discovery of anti-cancer drugs. However, due to the retirement of the brilliant direc-tor of the Division of Cancer Treatment at that time, the windowwas opened for massive attacks on the NCI anti-cancer drug dis-covery programs. And as a result, within the next year or so, welost all the research in the NCI for the structural modification syn-thesis of new anti-cancer drugs. And the next event was in 1981 when we lost all the natural products based anti-cancer drug discovery research. And that wasan especially disastrous event, because most of the drugs that arenow in use in the United States and worldwide were discovered inthe period up to 1974. And had our Government 's program been al- lowed to continue after that period, we would not be losing 600,000patients this year, and in the next year getting to the point wherecancer will actually exceed and become the No. 1 killer of peoplein the United States, in a year from now, after heart disease. So we have allowed a devastating series of events to take place. And if one realizes that in nature, we have some probably 800,000plant species, of which only about 5 percent have ever been inves-tigated for anti-cancer constituents, we have some 30 million micro-organisms, again which a very small percentage have ever beenlooked at. We have 2 million marine animals, for example, of whichonly 20,000 have even had a cursory examination so far. If you assume that you can extract 3,000 or 4,000 compounds from each specimen, that would lead to some 100 billion to 140 bil-lion compounds that would be available, not only for cancer, but forthe various medical problems right across the spectrum. To giveyou an idea of some of the successes up to 1974, and those subse-quently from the NCI 's anti-cancer drug discovery programs, you need only look at the drugs such as Taxol, camptothecin and its de-rivatives, such as 9AC, CPT -11, topotecan and so on. And I see my time is getting very short. Mr. H ORN. Go ahead. Dr. P ETTIT . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I would like to point out that in 1984, thanks to a new direc- tor of the Division of Cancer Treatment in the early 1980 's, it was possible to restart some of the natural products based anti-cancerdrug discovery. One of the deputy directors, Dr. Michael Boyd, whois the second really brilliant leader in the National Cancer Insti-tute over this timeframe, demoted himself and became the head ofthe new laboratory for discovery of new anti-cancer drugs and theirdevelopment. However, over the past 4 years, that remaining anti-cancer drug discovery program in the National Cancer Institute has been un-dergoing successive destruction. And the situation now is that we VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul a half a dozen chemists left in the National Cancer Institute. That 's out of a staff of nearly 3,000. Whereas we really need not 5 but 5,000, and at least 500 chemists working on thisproblem. Otherwise, it 's going to continue and will haunt all of us for the rest of our days. What I 'd like to do is make a plea to save what is left of our Na- tional Cancer Institute discovery programs, and also to make a se-ries of three recommendations that could turn the situation aroundrather abruptly, not only for cancer, but for the remaining lethaland debilitating diseases that our population suffers from, andagain, across the world. And this could be achieved by first of all the establishment of a new Division in the National Cancer Institute designated the Divi-sion of anti-cancer drug discovery and development. Then as effi-ciently as resources permit, that Division could be developed intoan institute for cancer treatment drug discovery, not only for thedrugs that you need directly to treat metastatic cancer patients,but also the drugs you need for AIDS and related viral diseases in-volved in the cancer problem, and of course in general. Also theantibiotics, the antifungal agents that you need to help cancer pa-tients and a variety of other drugs that are very necessary to im-prove cancer treatment in the United States and elsewhere. Furthermore, to ensure that this new Division is properly di- rected, it should be written into statute that the new Division di-rector be an internationally respected organic chemist, naturalproducts chemist and/or medicinal chemist. And the reason for thisis that this type of chemist is the one who discovers new drugs.And that is what 's been missing for 25 years now in our National Cancer Institutes, in our Government 's programs. And this person should have a tremendous motivation and knowledge of pharmacology and cancer medicine. That organiza-tional structure would make maximum use of our country 's best chemists, pharmacologists and cancer biologists in a new andgreatly accelerated war on cancer that would soon be extraor-dinarily successful. It will also have a multitude of critics, just as your congressional action in 1971 did, where you 're going to have many private sector critics. However, the result today is that what you did in 1971 andprior to that is now saving hundreds of thousands of people in theUnited States every year. Second, I would like to urge and recommend that you consider the addition of a new drug discovery and development Division ineach of the NIH institutes. Again to ensure that the new Divisionbe properly directed, it should be written into statute that the newDivision director be an internationally respected organic chemist,natural products chemist and/or medicinal chemist with tremen-dous motivation and a knowledge of medicine important to that in-stitute. This is what we 've been missing in our NIHs through my whole knowledge over the past 50 years. We have not undertaken the dis-covery of the drugs in our NIH that will really cure these diseasesthat the NIH is directed at. Third and finally, I also strongly urge and recommend the cre- ation of a completely new institute in the NIH called the institute VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul discovery and development for all other diseases that are not covered by our present NIH system. As with the new NCI Divi-sion director, the new NIH institute director must be highly re-spected and motivated and either an organic chemist, natural prod-ucts chemist or a medicinal chemist with a knowledge of phar-macology, and in this case, general medicine. These qualificationstoo should be memorialized in statute. Mr. Chairman, members of the House Committee on Government Reform, thank you for inviting me to participate in this importantcongressional hearing on cancer care for the new millennium. Ihave high hopes that your work will result in the proper redirec-tion of the NCI to its core mission, namely the discovery and devel-opment of the new anti-cancer drugs and a renewed war againstcancer. That would be a fitting tribute to all who fought in the can-cer crusade and hammered out the National Cancer Act of 1971 30years ago next year. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you very much.[The prepared statement of Dr. Pettit follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ORN. Well, thank you. That 's very positive and it 's some- thing that I 'm sure the full committee and the relevant subcommit- tees will do the work and see what can be done to get just that linethat you 've suggested. So the next witness on panel four is Dr. Harold Freeman, the North General Hospital in New York. And he 's a specialist in mi- nority access to oncology care. Dr. F REEMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for inviting me. Dr. Pettit mentioned the declaration of the war against cancer in 1971 by President Nixon, something about which we can all beproud. That stimulated the research that has been translated intomuch improvement for the American people. I don 't think the re- search effort is perfect, but I think we 've had a lot of success in the treatment of cancer when you compare the point that in 1900,only 20 percent of cancer victims survived, and in the year 2000,two-thirds survive, so progress has been made. But despite that, what I am aware of through my personal expe- rience as a surgeon in Harlem for three decades is that there 's an unequal burden of cancer in our country. And I 've struggled over these 30 some years to try to understand why some people don 't do as well as others when they develop cancer. One of the issuesthat we looked at closely was race. And we know, for example, thatBlack Americans have the highest death rate from cancer com-pared to all racial groups. But when we looked at poverty, as part of the research that I 've done, we found that most of the disparity, but not all, in BlackAmericans, disparity was corrected when it corrected for economicstatus. But something was left over that we couldn 't explain. Recently, in the last 7 or 8 years, there have been at least a dozen major published papers in the peer reviewed literature thathave showed that the problem is beyond poverty. The problem alsoincludes the point that Black Americans, and sometimes HispanicAmericans, don 't get treated the same way at the same stage of disease at the same economic status. And this is very troubling tome. An editorial that I was invited to write in the New England Jour- nal of Medicine goes into this, and to cite some instances of thisfailure to treat people the same according to race, include the pointthat in a large veterans study, national study, Black men were notworked up as vigorously when they had chest pain that mightmean that they had coronary heart disease. In another study fromHarvard, they found that Black people, male and female, were notas likely to be referred for renal transplantation at the same eco-nomic status. Other studies have shown differences in the treatment of pain according to race, and in a study just published in New York City,for Mount Sinai, it was found that the pharmacies in Black andHispanic neighborhoods tend not to carry the morphine-like medi-cines, so it 's harder for people who are Black and Hispanic to ob- tain medicines for chronic pain related to race. The study that you mentioned in your introduction, Mr. Chair- man, was a study by Bach at Memorial Sloane Kettering whichshowed at the same stage of early lung cancer, stage one lung can- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 are not treated the same although the eco- nomic status is the same. So this is a troubling set of issues whichis superimposed on the point that Blacks don 't do as well related to disproportionate poverty and lack of education. And I would like to indicate the way that I see this issue. I was asked to give my opinion in the New England Journal of Medicine.I believe that doctors don 't intentionally hurt anybody. I have no evidence that doctors don 't treat people fairly, in their own think- ing. But I believe that even within the medical profession, thereare reflections of society itself, doctors and others are socialized be-fore they become educated. So it is very possible that certain biasesare carried with the person into his higher level of education or herhigher level of education that influence the assumptions that aremade when they look at different groups of people, without intend-ing to do harm. So I believe that leads us to the question of what could be done, if this is correct. Certainly the findings are correct. The questionis, is this a bias situation, do the patients themselves have a rolein not accepting treatment. That has to be studied. Are there prob-lems on the side of patients who don 't accept treatments because they don 't believe in treatment. That 's another issue that has to be looked at. But yet it is such an important issue, Mr. Chairman, that I be- lieve that it requires further studies. And the studies should lookat, for example, not only are we doing the right research, whichhas been brought up here, but have we paid attention to the pointthat there is a disconnection, Mr. Chairman, between discovery anddelivery. The discovery system is working rather well. But I believethat we don 't always apply across the entire population what we discover. And this is a problem. I believe we need to consider the training of a more diverse re- search and care giving force in our Nation. That would create moresensitivity, because if the people who we train mirror the popu-lation, in whatever that may mean racially and ethnically, and inevery other way, there would be more of a chance that these kindsof insensitivities, if they do occur, would not occur. Also I think we have to tear down the economic and cultural bar- riers to early diagnosis and treatment. I also recognize the pointthat there are geographic areas in America that can be defined eco-nomically and culturally which need very special attention. An ex-ample of that is described in a paper which I authored in 1990which showed that males in Harlem have less of a chance of reach-ing age 65 than males in Bangladesh, which is a Third World coun-try by that definition. Let me end by saying that I think there 's a lot we can say posi- tive. We have conducted a war against cancer that we 've fought rather well. But we have trouble now in translating the findingsto all people in a fair way, including racial differences. Cancer isa broad societal problem as well as a scientific problem and that must be considered. Finally I think we must see cancer disparities not only as a sci- entific problem, but also a moral and ethical challenge to our Na-tion. Thank you very much. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 ORN. We thank you. You 've made some useful suggestions. As I listen to them, having spent about 40 years of my life in civilrights matters, I find that a lot of those studies are very clear, andwe know what the problem is. Now we have to figure out a wayto get people into the hospital, into preventive care, all of that atthe same time. So I don 't know if we need too many studies, we just need to do it, as Churchill 's greatest commence address was, when he got up and looked at the students and he said, ''Do it, '' and he sat down. And I think we all know what the do its are. You 've made a very good rounding out of that total situation, and you 're living it every day. So we appreciate your presentation. We will now go to questions. And we 'll go with majority, minor- ity, 5 minutes to a side and the first will be the senior memberhere of the Government Reform, the gentlewoman from Maryland,Mrs. Morella. Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you all for testifying. As I listened and tried to digest the elements from your very moving testimony, I was re-minded of a definition that Robert Frost once gave to a poem. Hesaid it begins in delight and it ends in wisdom. And at the end,it tells me something I didn 't know I knew, because there were ele- ments of what each of you have stated that should be commonsense, that some time we tend to not think about in the total con-text. And that 's of course what integrative technology and oncology is really all about. Your story was very moving, Mrs. Payton, and I guess one of the elements I got from it was the fact that nobody ever told you aboutintegrative technology, and that we are not unilateral elements,that we are a combination of elements. And in listening to yourwonderful comments, Dr. Achterberg, I realized even music, as wellas faith, and I 've often thought that what every hospital, every health care provider institution should have should be a humorward, I mean, truly where there is humor, where people can laugh.Because I think if they can laugh, this is another element of a to-tality. And Dr. Pettit, you had some very interesting comments with re- gard to every institute of NIH, which is in the district I represent,should have some drug discovery facet of it with chemists. I wouldbe interested in at some point pursuing how you do that and whatdoes it mean, are you adding a whole extra element, could it notbe done right now with what they have and why aren 't they doing something like that in some way. And Dr. Freeman, your conceptof the disconnect between discovery and delivery and the need forstudies. So I think you 're all saying we need more research, we need more studies, and we shouldn 't have blinders on in terms of what the elements are beyond just trying to give somebody chemo-therapy or whatever traditional mode of curative or medicine mightbe, to not be so traditional, but remember those things we take forgranted. OK. Out of each of your statements, if you could give me maybe one sentence that you think is most important that you want tomake sure that this subcommittee, those of us who are here, of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul 't here who will be able to read the testimony, re- member, what would it be? I could start with any one of you. Dr.Pettit. Dr. P ETTIT . Representative Morella, I 'll try to be very brief in re- sponse to your question about chemists in the National Institutesof Health and the National Cancer Institute. The National CancerInstitute 's program, when it was set up for discovery and develop- ment of new anti-cancer drugs, and that was primarily in 1957,that was the best program in the world. It was a model program,it was serving as a model program for the rest of our country 's en- deavors. That was because there were chemists there that were ac-tually discovering the drugs. They were doing it both in the Na-tional Cancer Institute and in research contract type endeavorsthat were supervised by chemists from the National Cancer Insti-tute. Unfortunately, it was that absolutely marvelous initiative that began to undergo dismantling in 1975 to 1977 and again in 1981.However, had it been preserved, again, we would not be losing600,000 cancer patients this year. Also in the other NIHs, they could use that model very effectively for the other diseases that they are involved with, everything fromcoronary diseases to mental illness. And the fact that we have inour country, with our resources, not made better progress towardthe solution to these medical problems, I think you can point tovery accurately is a result of this lack of focused effort in the dis-covery of new drugs in the various institutes. Because when youlook at the personnel in the various institutes, you 'll find very few chemists, I mean really few, you can count them on one hand, andthey are primarily involved in various administrative duties ratherthan directing substantial and very productive programs to dis-cover the new drugs necessary to patients with those particular af-flictions. So we know how to do it. But the focus and motivation has been lacking and that has been primarily due to attacks from some seg-ments in the private communities. Sorry about that long answer. Mrs. M ORELLA . If I could just ask the rest of you if there 's any brief comment you 'd like to make. And I appreciated that, Dr. Pettit. Ms. A CHTERBERG . Just a brief one. I would also like to reiterate that it 's time to do it, that the research base for the mind/body therapies, mind/body techniques is sound, it 's old, it 's phenomenal and it 's really time for implementation. Dr. F REEMAN . Congresswoman, I would like to say that since I believe that the critical problem that produces the unequal burdenin cancer is the disconnect between what we know we should doand what we actually do, the disconnect between discovery and de-livery, I believe that we need to find ways to eliminate the barriersthat prevent the benefits of research from reaching all Americanpeople, irrespective of who they are, economically and racially. Mrs. M ORELLA . Mrs. Payton. Mrs. P AYTON . And my statement would be to ensure adequate re- search in the areas of complementary medicines and to provide cov-erage and assets to complementary therapies for all people. Andhopefully that will allow, no, I should say I know it would allow VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul to function better, to work, to go to school, because I know in my case, when my husband was lying there in the state that hewas in, it affected all of us. He might have been physically ill, butit affects the whole family, it affects friends, it affects everybodythat is involved. Mrs. M ORELLA . I want to thank you all very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. H ORN. I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Mary- land, Mr. Cummings, for questioning. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I too want to thank all of you for being here. As I 'm sitting up here, listening to you, and I think about all the people that sufferfrom cancer. It sounds like you 're saying that there are much better ways to address this dreadful disease. But in this country, which can senda man to the moon, and a country that is basically the world leaderin so many areas, is it that we just don 't get it? Or is it that there are such forces going against traditional methods that we just don 't do it? We don 't do the things that make sense? As I'm listening to you, you sound like you 're making sense. But I'm trying to figure out, when you think about something like can- cer, and you think about something like death, it just seems as ifin this country, we would connect them. You talked about discoveryto delivery, Dr. Freeman. Dr. Pettit, you talked about having, youuse the word attack, and I couldn 't remember what you were say- ing, you said, Mrs. Morella asked you a question, and you said be-cause of attacks from folks in the private sector, I think you said,can you elaborate on that for us a little bit? Dr. P ETTIT . Thank you, Congressman Cummings. I certainly would. The problem in our system, in the NIHs and the National Cancer Institute, is that primarily there are some forces coming from thepharmaceutical companies and elsewhere and also in some sci-entific quarters, too, that are avidly against having new drugs dis-covered in our Government laboratories and in our university lab-oratories. And this of course is abominable, because we are all inthe same jeopardy from cancer and all of the other diseases. Andeverybody in this country should be pulling on the same oar andtrying to get these problems solved, instead of some political agen-das that prevent this from being done. And as our great chairman has just indicated, with a statement from Mr. Churchill, we need to do it. We need to be disciplined andget it done. Because we have the resources, both financially and in-tellectually, to solve these problems. And at the state-of-the-art invarious scientific disciplines, now in the year 2000, there is no rea-son why we can 't solve these problems relatively rapidly, if we mar- shall the forces. But again, having the correct leadership. We have lacked the cor- rect leadership terribly in these various medical areas. Mr. C UMMINGS . When you heard the story of Mrs. Payton, when you heard her story, about how her husband was in this vegetativestate and then basically came back to life for 2 12months, have you heard those kinds of stories before? Have you seen examples ofthat? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Cummings, I have. In fact, I 'm in the difficult position of being a director of a cancer research institutewhere we do not treat patients, because we 're focused entirely on the discovery of new anti-cancer drugs. However, daily I have dis-cussions with cancer patients who wish to talk about the possibilityof new drugs coming, and of course their own personal involve-ment, or with family members. And it 's enough to tear your heart out every day. But you do see that with the anti-cancer drugs that are available and the treatments that are available today, that depending on thetype of cancer, you can get curative results, at least a certain per-centage with certain types of human cancer. But there is nothingthat will do it 100 percent. And this is why we desperately needthe new drugs, to save patients. Also, you will find too that 1 cancer patient in 1,400 will have a spontaneous remission. No matter what you do, that patient willget well by his or her own. And of course, that confuses manyissues, too. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. H ORN. Thank you. I 'm going to ask a few questions on my 5 minutes, and then will yield to Ms. Schakowsky. Dr. Pettit, I 'm curious. What drugs have been developed from your various discoveries? What drugs, just to get it in the recordhere, have been developed from your discoveries? Dr. P ETTIT . Thank you, Chairman Horn. For example, bryostatin 1, was a lead that we started on 32 years ago, in 1968, from a marine bryozoan. And fortunately, in1993, the National Cancer Institute decided to proceed ahead withit in its clinical trials programs. Incidentally, the U.S. NationalCancer Institute 's clinical trials programs are second to none in the world. They are absolutely excellent. The oncologists that work inthe CTEP division are routinely excellent. That drug is either in trials accruing patients, or with trials that are already closed, there have been some 90 human cancer trialseither initiated or completed. And the current trials that are in-volving combination drug therapy are giving excellent results. Andthat's just one example. Another example might be our combretastatin A4 pro-drug. That was a drug that we discovered in a tree, used primarily by theZulus in southern Africa, with a long history of primitive medicaluse. And we found that drug is one that turns out to be a powerfulcancer anti-angiogenesis drug. It will actually go right to the meta-static tumor, and cutoff the blood supply, so within a few hours, Imight add too, this is just finishing the first four human cancerclinical trials, and what the oncologists are finding is that this drugwill generally cause pain in the tumor about 2 hours after the in-jection of the drug. And that 's because the blood is being cutoff to that metastatic tumor. And within 24 hours, there 's a 100 percent cutoff of the blood to the tumor. There have been several patients, just among the firstfew, that have now been saved with that drug. And we 're hoping as the clinical trials expand, and that 's certainly in combination with other drugs that might remove the last of the viable cancer VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul the peripheral aspects of the tumor, that it 's going to be a very successful treatment. But these are only two examples, one from a plant, one from a marine animal. That gives you some good feeling, not only goodfeeling, but every expectation that if we could concentrate in thisarea and certainly have our national effort focused far more strong-ly than the half dozen chemists in the National Cancer Institutedirected by, superbly, the NCI superstar, Dr. Michael Boyd, andthat if that program could be expanded, we would have all sortsof drugs of this sort being discovered and developed. And of course, it 's a tragedy, a travesty for our country that we are in that position. And also, some of these new drugs are exactly what we need, for example, for bettering the treatment in our Afro-American popu-lation, which has, for example, a higher incidence of prostate can-cer. And we need drugs like the one I was just talking about thatwill go to those tumors, cutoff the blood supply and put that pa-tient on the road to complete recovery. Mr. H ORN. Let me ask all of you, and particularly Dr. Freeman, this next question. We 've been looking at the role of complementary and alternative medicine now for several months in our health caresystem, and in particular in relation to cancer. Are there dif-ferences in access to these treatments for these types of therapies? Dr. F REEMAN . In my own experience, I don 't have much experi- ence with alternative treatments. Complementary treatments Iknow more about. I think that there 's a need to open up our ability to test these drugs that are brought up as complementary and alternative, andbring the same scientific analysis to those drugs that we bring todrugs coming up in the routine way. I believe that there 's little de- bate now in the medical world about a complementary treatment,in other words, going along with the so-called traditional treat-ment, and adding a complementary treatment that doesn 't have an untoward effect. The question is, how much more resources we should put toward providing complementary treatments. And I believe we should putresources toward proving the so-called alternative treatmentswhich displace the traditional treatment. That needs a lot more ef-fort. Mr. H ORN. Any other thoughts on that by any of you? Yes, Dr. Pettit. Dr. P ETTIT . Mr. Chairman, in 1973, I had the experience of being sent to the People 's Republic of China by the U.S. National Acad- emy of Sciences and the National Cancer Institute. That was thefirst scientific medical delegation, and the intention was to exploremedicine in the People 's Republic of China. I had a very interesting experience in about 60 different hospitals and research institutesand what was left of the universities at that time, and found thatthe Chinese were doing exactly as some of my colleagues here have suggested. They were combining, in fact, Dr. Freeman just madethis suggestion, the combination of alternative treatments, ofcourse, with the sharply focused, for example, anti-cancer drugtreatments. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 exactly what was going on in China. The mission there was to use the traditional medical treatments of China, where theyhave roughly 5,000 plant materials that have been found to haveuse against various types of medical problems in China. And in thecase of cancer, to use some of those therapies in connection withthe drugs that at that time had been discovered in our U.S. Na-tional Cancer Institute 's programs, to improve the patient 's im- mune system, to reduce toxicity, and in fact, in general, to reducenausea, and in general make the life of the patient far more man-ageable. And I 'm convinced, as I was then and today, that there is an ex- cellent place for alternative therapies in the treatment of cancerpatients. But fundamentally, you must have the drugs that weknow will give curative results. Mr. H ORN. Any other comments? Dr. Achterberg. Ms. A CHTERBERG . I just would like to make three observations, brief observations, based on the history of cancer and medicine asI know it. And that 's that nothing cures everybody. Nothing. And that everything cures somebody. And that 's a fact. Everything cures somebody, and that nothing works forever. That 's another fact. I think if we take that kind of a dogma, which I believe it is,into consideration, we have to acknowledge the versatility of thehuman condition and the need to be versatile in ourconceptualization of what medicine might be for the treatment ofcancer. Mr. H ORN. That 's well put. Mrs. Payton. Mrs. P AYTON . Well, I would just like to say that it saddens me to know that today that still we have to worry about things likeall Americans, regardless of race, not being treated equally, withany types of medical care. And hopefully through this fund, we willuse it as a platform to address those issues. And I just think every-body should be treated the same. And it happens, because my husband, like I said, was fortunate to have good insurance. But there are times, too, that we walkedinto hospitals, and if he was not recognizable right away, he wastreated differently. And things like that really bothered him, too.And that even today, we are still being faced with those types ofissues. So I 'm glad those issues are being brought up today and hopefully will be taken care of in the future. Mr. H ORN. Well, you 're right. I think almost every family in the Nation sometimes, when you look at the bill, they always have thatold gag that they put you in a wheel chair to wheel you out, andthat's because you see the bill on the way out. [Laughter.] I will now yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to say to Mrs. Payton that, and to all of you, that I apologize for not being here for your testimony. I have read someof it. But Mrs. Payton, I 'm from Chicago and represent a district in Chicago where your husband, for so many wonderful years, wasour hero in the way that he played, but also in the way that helived, and finally in the way that he died as well. And I know that while your pain is incomparable to anyone else's, that Chicagoans are also grieving for him. And I want to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul for taking your pain and your grief and your knowledge now and using it as an opportunity to save lives. So thank you verymuch for all that you do, being here today, but everything else aswell. We really appreciate it. I wanted to tell you a personal experience of mine. My father lived with me for the last 6 years of his life. He had prostate can-cer, and was pretty healthy until about the last few months. Andthen at the end had hospice care. It wasn 't until he had hospice care that there was a whole new attitude. Now that all hope wasgone, there was this emphasis on comfort, on his emotional as wellas his physical well-being. Suddenly, quite frankly, there were all kinds of different options available to him, and a new level of caring and concern. And itseemed to me, in retrospect, at the time we were just grateful forthat, that why is that? It 's not until hope is gone, there is no longer a chance of life being greatly extended. And I read in your testi-mony, Mrs. Payton, that it seems in a way that that was true andyou had to fight for it, to make sure that pain was really well con-trolled and appropriate. I just wondered if any one of you had thoughts on that, and maybe all of your testimony already referred to that. I apologize ifit has already. It seems like there 's a disconnect here that we 're not treating the whole person until that person is about to die. Dr. F REEMAN . In my experience as a teacher in a hospital and residency program, I 'm always concerned about this point. I think in general in America, my opinion is that our technology has out-stripped our humanity. You get into a technical setting, and the CTscans and MRIs. Sometimes my residents are paying more atten-tion to the tests than they are to the patient. I think somehow we have to reinject the humanitarian part into the people, the doctors and others who are treating people for cure,or at the point even where treatment fails. And to get a balancebetween the wonderful technological advances that we all areproud of, but at the same time, I think there 's been a diminishment about the human concerns. And that needs to be fixed. Mrs. P AYTON . I just feel this is probably where educating people as to other alternatives. Because if you don 't know any better, then you won 't do better. And I think in our case that was it. You sort of do what your doctors tell you, and you followed their lead. Andlike I said, thank goodness for some lady who was an angel in mylife, and saw fit to come to me and give me another alternative. Ithink educating people that they do have other choices and thatthey can feel comfortable with these other choices is what we needto do. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . And that 's a good segue. I wonder, Mr. Chair- man, if I could have included in the record an article that was inthe Wall Street Journal on June 6th, ''Cyberspace is Spurring De- mand for a New Leukemia Treatment. '' Mr. H ORN. Without objection, it will be put in the record at this point. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you. I wanted to direct a comment about that, in the brief time I have, to Dr. Freeman. It talks about how a clinical trial with a newdrug for a certain kind of leukemia became communicated over theinternet and suddenly there was this great demand by the growingnumber of patients who are trying to take care into their ownhands. But I wanted to raise this issue, does this not make the dig-ital divide, that is the problem that you 've raised in your work of the disparity between perhaps low income people, so if they don 't have access to the internet, they may not even know about this, orother treatments that may be available. Dr. F REEMAN . Congresswoman, you 've touched on a very critical issue. The problem is that the more advances we make, techno-logical and computer and things like the example you mentioned,the wider the disparity becomes between those who don 't have re- sources and those who do. And so there 's a catch -22. We clearly want to advance, and we will advance, and we 're going to keep put- ting money into research. We need to do that. But we have to be aware of the point that when we do that, we widen the gap between the people who are poor and uneducatedand not include into the mainstream of the American society. Soit's an issue that becomes a deep moral and ethical issue for U.S. policymakers and for the Nation as a whole. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. H ORN. Quite welcome. Good line of questioning. I'm going to ask a few more on the subject of the alternatives. And Dr. Achterberg, I 'd like to know, how important is music and visualization to healing in your judgment? Ms. A CHTERBERG . I think what they represent is essential to healing. Not everyone will like music and not everyone wants to dovisualization. But it 's the idea that they tap deeper into our hu- manity than the pills and potions that are being administered. So rather than focus on those two things, I 'd like to broaden it to the whole base that they represent, which is the creative, ex-pressive arts, for example, ways of self-care. It is absolutely truethat what we believe and our thoughts affect our bodies. And any-thing that influences a sense of hope, a sense of peace, a sense ofwell-being, a sense of trust, is bound to be healing. Not just in thesense of healing your mind or healing your psyche, but healingyour body. Mr. H ORN. I happen to agree with you, having once wanted to be a music major. And Louise Slaughter from New York and I arethe co-chairs of the Arts Caucus. We 've been trying to educate them on just what you 're trying to talk about. Ms. A CHTERBERG . Arts are healing. Mr. H ORN. You 're right. Where can individuals find good information on the mind/body techniques to use when facing cancer? Ms. A CHTERBERG . I think a place to start is the report that I mentioned that was created for the National Institute of Health. Mr. H ORN. Is that still in print? Ms. A CHTERBERG . I assume it 's still in print \u2014is it, Beth? It is truly the state-of-the-art as of 1994, anyway, and there haven 't been that many developments since that period of time. So I would VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul there. It was written with great integ- rity for this purpose. Mr. H ORN. I've found Norman Cousins books are also very help- ful. Could you explain some of the alternative approaches to pain management? Ms. A CHTERBERG . Pain is a confusing phenomena, because we 're not ever sure how much pain is really depression, and for cancer,especially, how much pain is really, stems from anxiety. So manyof the alternative techniques which are attempting or based tostem factors of anxiety would be recommended for cancer pain. Interestingly enough, cancer pain has not been given the atten- tion that it should have been over the years. When I first startedthis work in 1973, there wasn 't a single pain protocol for a child with cancer. I think we made the assumptions, or the assumptionswere made that children with cancer don 't feel pain. That 's im- proved somewhat but not a lot in recent years. Mr. H ORN. Yesterday we had a doctor from the Health Care Fi- nancing Administration on one of our panels. And he testifiedabout Medicare 's coverage of complementary and alternative thera- pies for cancer patients. Do you think that treatments such as acu-puncture, massage therapy, music therapy, we could add art ther-apy, a whole series of them, should be reimbursed by Medicare? Ms. A CHTERBERG . To some extent. But we need to go back and take a look at the data base for all of those therapies. For example,acupuncture has been shown effective for pain. But not for a lot ofother conditions associated with cancer. Yes, they should be reim-bursed provided they can come forth with research, a data base. Mr. H ORN. Anybody else want to get in on that? Dr. Freeman? Dr. F REEMAN . I agree that you need a scientific base of proof be- fore Medicare will pay for something. Mr. H ORN. Dr. Pettit, any thoughts on that? Dr. P ETTIT . I'd like to add that as part of the experience in 1973, I had tremendous exposure to acupuncture in some of the largehospitals in China. And it was pretty clear that for pain manage-ment, it can be very, very effective. In fact, I watched numbers ofdifferent types of pretty severe surgeries being conducted underacupuncture anaesthesia. I'd also like to add that, as a general thought, that three quar- ters of the world 's population now are treated with traditional med- ical materials, materials from plants and animals. That 's only about, again, a quarter of our world 's population, normally here in the western world, that are treated with the drugs that we nor-mally know. And it tells us that there 's a vast treasure house of substances that we could find in these various natural materials on our planetthat could very well solve essentially all of the medical problemsthat we 're confronted with. Mr. Chairman, I 'm sorry, I need to add one other thought. In the United States today, probably 30 percent or more of all prescrip-tions written are for plant and animal products. And the otherdrugs that we use, if you trace back, when you 're thinking as an organic chemist, you 'll find that all of those leads pretty much all go back to naturally occurring substances. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul these substances that you find in nature have chemical structures that we organic chemists would have never thought of.And as a result, they 're just absolutely superb for the ever-increas- ingly more effective design of new drugs. Mr. H ORN. I remember when I was a little boy of 7 or so, and I'd put my hands and pulled up some poison ivy in the east, poison oak in the west. And my father, being a chemist, said, well, go lookand see what plants are around that. And sure enough, there wasa plant you could put in, boil, take all the itching out of it. So afew things are in nature. Now, is there anything any of you would like to say before we ask the next panel to come up? Mrs. Payton. Anything you wantto add that we haven 't asked? Mrs. P AYTON . No, when you were talking about alternative medi- cines and being picked up, I was just going to say, from a personalside, the treatments that Walter had, he didn 't have acupuncture, but he did have a naturopath who did real deep tissue massagetherapies on him. And the nutrition and the relaxation techniquesand some of those therapies he used, and they did make significantdifference. I think if it 's proven that these things work, then I would hope that they would be looked at and covered by some insurance. Mr. H ORN. Well, I think you 're right about that. And we started prodding the gentleman yesterday. Dr. F REEMAN . Mr. Chairman, I think that I 'd like to end with one thought. I think we know how to fight a war in this country.We have a military that understands how to fight war. And whatI've noticed that they do is they create these weapons of destruc- tion, and then when a war occurs, they use them against where theenemy is invading the most. I think there 's something to be learned from that philosophy. We develop weapons in research, in cancer, but we don 't use them where the enemy is invading the most. And there 's something to be learned by that. Mr. H ORN. Well, I think you 're right. Some of this is a manage- ment situation where there has to be a goal set, whether it bePresident Kennedy saying we go to the moon, or all sorts of things,we've had a makeover with the nuclear navy, they achieved great things. And we need to do the same in this field, obviously. Yes, Dr. Pettit.Dr. P ETTIT . Mr. Chairman, I 'd like to followup on those thoughts. It's exactly what the cancer problem needs, and it 's sort of all the other terrible problems that we have that kill people. And we 've had good experience in our Nation, for example, with the Manhat-tan Project that helped to end the second World War. As you justindicated, we had another strike force approach with NASA to puta person on the moon. And this is what we 've been missing in the cancer problem. And that's what we need, to have a strike force. And the only way you're going to do this is to have several hundreds or several thou- sands of chemists, organic chemists, discovering the drugs, to solvethe cancer problem. And that can best be done through our U.S.National Cancer Institute. But it would have to be reorganizedalong the lines that I 've been urging. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul applies to our NIHs. Mr. H ORN. Well, I want to definitely pursue some of that, since we are a subcommittee dealing with that organization. But obvi-ously, we 've got to get them to come along and not just fight every- thing, or maybe set up two NIHs or something. Does the gentleman from Maryland have any more questions he'd like to ask? Mr. C UMMINGS . Just very briefly, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, and to our panel, I want to thank you for being here. We 've heard from Dr. Harold Freeman of North General Hos- pital, and I thank you, Dr. Freeman, for being here. And I thinkI had something to do with having you here. And the reason whyI wanted you to be here was because according to the AmericanCancer Society 's publication, and I 'll be brief, Mr. Chairman, cancer facts and figures for African Americans, African Americans aremore likely to develop cancer than persons of any other racial andethnic group. For a number of years, it has been assumed thathealth disparities were due to social and economic differences. But as reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh suggested thatdifferences in diagnosis and treatment accounted for a higher num-ber of some cancer cases. I certainly appreciate the invitation ex-tended to Dr. Freeman to speak about racial disparities in cancertreatments. But I feel the issue merits a separate hearing. As such, the minority members of the committee have joined in a letter to request such a hearing, Mr. Chairman. I 'll submit that to you at this time. Thank you very much. Mr. H ORN. Well, thank you. Does the gentlewoman from Illinois have anything else? Is that for the record?Mr. C UMMINGS . It's for the record, Mr. Chairman. Mr. H ORN. OK. We thank you very much. We know we 've taken a lot of your time, but I think a lot of good ideas came out of this,and that 's why we have the hearing process. We learn a lot. Hope- fully some of you might have learned from the iteration of your col-leagues. We're now going to move to the last panel, panel five. Mr. Dan Nixon of the American Health Foundation, Mr. Giancarlo Pizzafrom Italy, Mr. Burton Goldberg from Tiburon, CA. Gentlemen, the tradition of the Government Reform is we have the oath administered to all of the witnesses and any of their lifesupports, as we say nowadays, I guess. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. H ORN. The clerk will note the witnesses have affirmed the oath. And we will go in the order on the panel five, on the agenda.So Dr. Dan Nixon of the American Health Foundation will be first.Please proceed. And automatically, your written statements are inthe record. We 'd like a summary, really. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul DANIEL WALKER NIXON, M.D., PRESI- DENT, AMERICAN HEALTH FOUNDATION; ALICE AND HAYNEFOLK PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL ONCOLOGY, MEDICALUNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA; DR. GIANCARLO PIZZA,ITALY; AND BURTON GOLDBERG, TIBURON, CA Dr. N IXON . Well, I am Dr. Dan Nixon, president of the American Health Foundation, which is a National Cancer Institute fundedcancer prevention center. It 's in Valhalla, NY and in Manhattan, with affiliates throughout the United States. I'm honored to accept this invitation, and I want to first explain what the American Health Foundation is all about and hopefullyto broaden the focus of the discussion today into a consideration ofthe 70 percent of cancers that are preventable in this countrytoday. That means about 300,000 lives that we lose that we don 't have to lose. American Health Foundation is a translational research organi- zation, taking prevention research from the lab to the clinic to thecommunity. We have about 60 senior scientists and 130,000 squarefeet of labs. We are vigorously pursuing the ways to prevent malig-nant disease. This includes integrative medicine. We 're looking at nutrition, phytochemicals, nutrients, tobacco carcinogenesis preven-tion, and how to put all that into the clinic. Specifically, we 're looking at, and I appeal to the committee to support this kind of research, the effects of phytochemicals in lungcancer prevention, and colon cancer and breast cancer. We have anumber of preventive chemicals, several thousand actually exist infruits and grains. We are focusing specifically on phytochemicals in teas, anti-neoplastic effects of certain chemicals in berries, such asraspberries, strawberries, blackberries and mulberries. And certainsynthetic chemicals, along with some organic materials like sele-nium. We have very good data that these chemicals will kill cancercells in the lab. We're now moving these into clinical trials. And we also have evi- dence that a high fat diet is very effective as a cancer promoter,even in lung cancer. My predecessor, Dr. Ernst Wynder, was veryperceptive in figuring out that a high fat diet might promote thedevelopment of cancer of the lungs, so we have clinical trials in thisarea as well. So how do we really put this together so that it 's a translational, real prevention process? And you have to think about this not somuch as prevention in the traditional sense, it 's really almost treatment before the tumor develops. We know that for exampleprostate cancer takes about 30 years to develop, so that before thetumor is there, you 've still got a malignant process going on. And this is what we 're targeting, those cells that have gone down the road toward malignancy, but haven 't actually started to invade and spread. I'll give you three examples of what we 're doing. We have a grant from the National Cancer Institute that 's looking at molecular epi- demiology. Why do some patients get cancer and why do some pa-tients not get cancer, even though they 're exposed to the same car- cinogens? Very interesting question. One out of eight women getbreast cancer. Seven women don 't get breast cancer. Why is that? Could we identify that one and focus on that one and leave the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul throughout their lives, for example, no mammo- grams or anything would be necessary. The second item I want to mention to you is the WINS project, the Women 's Intervention and Nutrition Study. We have the larg- est breast cancer recurrence prevention trial currently in the world.We've got over 40 hospitals around the country entering patients into this trial. It 's a trial to determine if decreasing fat in the diet will prevent recurrence of breast cancer. We now have almost 2,300patients in this trial, and should finish accrual at the end of thisyear. To put all this together and to try to address some of the dispari- ties that Dr. Freeman and others have mentioned, we are now es-tablishing an informatics system so that we can link our labora-tories with clinics in the low country of South Carolina, the Beau-fort Jasper Comprehensive Health Care Agency, and clinics in theinner city of Harlem and other inner city areas, so that we canreach those who are at disproportionate risk of cancer with ourchemo preventive clinical trials. And the final item I want to mention to you is our new clinical trial that we are about to start with certain chemicals from berriesin lung cancer. We know that some of the anticyanidins from ber-ries, this is a natural product area, do affect malignant cells in theclinics. So now we 're going to look at the people who have stopped smoking, who are still at cancer risk, or who have continued tosmoke, give them a various variety of berry extracts, which will beproduced by a group of botanists in Canada, and use certain inter-mediate markers of oxidative damage and stress to see if we canstop the malignant process before it becomes a tumor. So in summary, we 've got to concentrate on cancer prevention re- search as well as cancer treatment research. I 'm a cancer treater by trade, so I 'm now convinced that we must do this cancer preven- tion research as well. Cancer prevention and intervention, chemoprevention, nutritional strategies, when proven, are especially ap-propriate for integrative medicine approaches and cancer control.To give the one sentence summary that Mrs. Morella asked for ear-lier, we can save 300,000 lives in this country every year by pre-vention, so let 's do it. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.[The prepared statement of Dr. Nixon follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you very much. Dr. Pizza.Dr. P IZZA. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to be before you to report on my experiences as medical doctor in Italy, particularly asit relates to the treatment of cancer. I operate in a 2,000 bed hos-pital in Bologna, Italy. My treatments for cancer are paid for byour national government health insurance and are very differentfrom those generally administered in the United States. They areessentially non-toxic and include treatment with transfer factor,interleukin 2, human monoclonal antibodies and other medications.Specific transfer factor is the treatment which Congressman Bedellbelieves cured his Lyme disease. I believe I can document for several kinds of cancer that this non-toxic treatment is significantly more effective than currenttreatments being administered in your country. For example, Ihave done a study of 122 metastatic renal cell cancer patientstreated with my non-toxic protocol in which I have documented asurvival of over 11 years by 25 percent of the patients. I am in-formed that an 11 year survival from such cancers with conven-tional treatment is less than 10 percent. I believe that the patients with other types of cancer also treated with my non-toxic treatments could show significant longer sur-vival than patients only conventionally treated. Except for renal cell cancer, metastatic, my treatment consists of one injection per month. For an American coming to Italy to betreated by me for such cancers, our charges would be about $20 permonth. This is partly subsidized by our government. Without suchsubsidy, I estimate the cost would still be less than $200 per monthfor treatment. In summary, I believe that I am an example of an Italian medi- cal doctor where I am administering treatments that are, first, gen-erally more effective for the cancers I treat than are conventionaltreatments for such cancers, with documented increased survival instudies I have done. Second, these treatments are essentially non-toxic. Third, the treatment costs significantly less than conven-tional cancer treatment. Fourth, these treatments are not adminis-tered in the United States because of your laws and regulations,and I believe it would be to the benefit of American cancer patientsif such treatments could be permitted in your country. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. Pizza follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much. Dr. Goldberg, Tiburon, CA. Beautiful part of the world, I know. What are you doing here this afternoon? Dr. G OLDBERG . I came here to make a difference. Mr. H ORN. Great. Mr. G OLDBERG . Cancer is epidemic. The American Cancer Society now says every other man in America will have cancer in his life.Breast cancer is one in eight. In Marin County, where I live, inParadise, it 's one in six. In Long Island, it 's one in seven, breast cancer of the female. In 1960, that number was 1 in 14. In 1950, that number was 1 in 20. And in 1900, 1 in 33 Americans, men, women or children,had cancer of any kind, shape or form. So you see the escalation,and we know the escalation, we know what 's causing cancer. When I was born in 1926, and through the 1930 's, cancer was the 10th cause of death in children. Today it 's the second, behind accidents, both. The holistic, alternative, complementary, there 's all kinds of names out there, but they all mean the same thing, get-ting out of the paradigm of conventional treatment, which is sur-gery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the object and the paradigm isto treat the person rather than the disease. You and I could be diagnosed with the identical cancer, yet the causes are totally different. The mind/body plays a role. You havea bad marriage, it could be 90 percent of it, the emotions which af-fect the immune system. But the main cause, and when you askconventional oncologists what caused cancer, they say, well, sunand smoking and we don 't know. And yet their medical journals are full of the research. And let me give you an example. Israel, 1973, they discover the relationship between female breast cancer and pesticides and her-bicides. They then do a 10-year study, and the citizens areoutcrying and the government forbids the use of pesticides and her-bicides in only two things, the feed of milk cows and cattle. Andthere was a 10-year study, 1976 to 1986. And here are the results.Women under 40, the female breast cancer rate plummeted 34 per-cent. Now, this is in medical journals that is accessed to everyoneelse. I 'm a medical journalist and I know it. For all women for those 10 years, it dropped 8 percent, while we in the United Stateswent up 4 percent for those 10 years. The causes are pesticides and herbicides. They did the same thing in the Connecticut General Hospital where they took two tu-mors and they did what the call a split biopsy. Half went to pathol-ogy, it was cancerous, the other half went to toxicology. Inside thetumor in the one that was benign and one was cancerous, theyfound through toxicology, DDT, DDE and PCBs. The same thing isin prostate cancer, because the breast and the prostate are bothfatty tissue and they suck up like a blotter, these toxins. And in the prostate, they find when they do digital examination that the hard part, the BPH, is next to the colon. So it seems to transfer the poisons. Because when they split biopsies, they find ar-senic, chlordane and DDT. Why aren 't conventional doctors talking about it? We must go to the causes. We must get the poisons outof our food supply, whether it 's the Agriculture Department. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul is not being talked about. You 've got to first go to the cause to stop this holocaust. Alternative medicine paradigm and treatment is 180 degrees dif- ferent than conventional medicine. You first have to find out whatthe insults to your immune system are. You can transfer all kindsof organs, but you can 't transfer the immune system. And the im- mune system is how the holistic physicians treat it. First, you haveto get food that has nutrition and lots of our food is produced byfactory techniques, where they throw chemicals at the crops. So thecorn looks beautiful, but what 's missing is one part per million the selenium, molybdenum, chromium, the zinc, the nutrition that weneed to flourish on. So it 's important to stop and put nutrition back in food. Organic food is different. Quite often you hear that fat causes cancer, high fat diets. And it's true, because it 's what 's inside the fat. When they produce beef in this country, they feed them corn to fatten them up with pes-ticides and herbicides laden. They then put hormones into the ani-mal so that the animal gets big and fat, so that they get moreweight. What happens to us when we consume that fat? They use antibiotics to keep them alive in filthy conditions. That goes for chickens as well. And these antibiotics come into our bodyand they kill the flora, the good enzymes within our body. Anti-biotics are a double edged sword. They 're marvelous. They saved my life. But if you don 't take probiotic, acidopholus and lactobacillus and a whole bunch of other things to reforestate, youend up with acid alkaline imbalance and you end up with the para-sites living within you and candida and yeast infections and thebreeding grounds for disease. The early detection, now I 'm going to say something that is abso- lutely going to blow you out, and that is, mammograms cause can-cer. People can 't buy that. But we 've studied it. We 've looked at the research of Dr. Goffman at Berkeley University who finds that 90percent of all breast cancer is in part due to medical x-rays. Now,let me give you an example. You go to the dentist to have yourteeth x-rayed. They put a lead sheet over your sexual organs andthen they run. Why are they running? Because it kills the DNA inthe cells. Now there 's a reason for x-rays, you have to do surgery, you have to do an x-ray. But there 's a safer way, and that 's thermography. Thermal imaging where you can see cancer coming much earlier.In the case of breast cancer, you can 't see it through a mammo- gram before it 's multiplied 25 to 30 times. By the time it 's multi- plied 40 times, it 's lethal. And yet the simple, using thermal imag- ing, which is less expensive and can see disease coming 3 to 5years earlier, with no radiation, far less false positives. And inmammography, they squeeze the breast. And if there is a pustuleor something, it can go into the blood stream. Because cancer issystemic, it travels through the blood. So if the knife comes in andinadvertently hits some of the cancer, it travels through the bloodand metastasizes. In early detection, we have the Darkfield microscope, which con- ventional medicine won 't take a look at. It reminds me of Galileo, he said, gentlemen, look at the moon and the stars, look at my tele- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 they refused. It 's the same thing going on today with the Darkfield microscope. With the prick of a finger on the slide,you can see the aberrant blood. You can see disease coming asmuch as with a competent physician, 5 to 10 years in advance. Those are only a few of the techniques. We have electric dermal screening, which uses a meridian system of the Chinese, which isignored by mainstream medicine. The basis of acupuncture, theriver of energy, charted by the French and Koreans, totally ignoredand not taught in medical schools unless they 're teaching acupunc- ture. And it affects the mouth. The nervous system and the merid-ian system and the teeth, teeth. One of my mentors, a Catholicpriest from Germany, finds that the dental implication can be asmuch as 50 percent in the removal of cancer and the reversal ofcancer. And I 'm here to tell you that if you don 't have chemo- therapy and radiation, sometimes surgery is necessary and if it is,the holistic physician encapsulizes the tumor by using enzymes andnutritional substances that Dr. Pettit talked about. I know of a cancer clinic in Tijuana that 's using his drug right now. This is an over the counter anti-angiogenesis, and using it onthe young boy who testified yesterday, lovely Thomas Navarro, whoI visited down there, and he 's doing extremely well using the sys- tem. Whereas conventional medicine has really truly no cure. But it 's a system. You go to the causes, you remove every single insult to the immune system. Then you feed the body absorbablenutrients, usually intravenously, orally. The diet is essential, be-cause cancer loves sugar. No sugar. Which brings up the subject of the National Cancer Institute. I 'm here to tell you that the General Accounting Office caught them,and caught the smoking gun, where it proves that the NationalCancer Institute doesn 't want anything other than chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. There is a drug called hydrazine sulfate thatcould have helped Mrs. Payton 's husband. I don 't say it 's going to cure, because it does have a small aspect of curing. But it helpscachexia, the wasting away process. This drug was said by Dean Burk, the head of cellular biology of the National Cancer Institute many years ago, he said in his 35years of experience, there 's not another drug like it. And yet DeVita, who came much after him, said, we throw away betterdrugs than this. And the study was scuttled, even after the GeneralAccounting Office did a study of 14 months. It was brought aboutby Representatives Towns and Shays of Connecticut. They muddiedthe report. And let me give you an example of how this is done. The original report that Barry Tice, a 28 year veteran of the General AccountingOffice, which is usually impeccable, the title that he put in herewas, the National Institute 's actions spur continued controversy over hydrazine sulfate therapy. After politics, after this report wassent to the National Cancer Institute, they came back and arguedwith the political powers that be at the time, and then it waschanged. And here 's what the change was. Contrary to allegations, the National Institute of Health studies on hydrazine sulfate werenot flawed. And yet in studies in UCLA, Harbor Hospital, and in Petrov In- stitute in Russia, which came up with the identical results, 51 per- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 population got results, in some cases even remissions, provided the proper dose was given. And when they did it at SloanKettering and other areas in this country, there were higher doses.And Dr. Gold, who developed this, said, I 'm telling you, if you go on the higher doses, it 's not going to work. As a matter of fact, you're going to get death. And another proviso, no barbiturates, alcohol, sleeping pills, tranquilizers and things along that line. If you do, it will negateit. Every single person by the independent investigator used thatkind of product and negated the results. That 's a smoking gun you can easily verify. It will show you why Dr. Pettit 's work is being diminished, why you don 't have the chemists that he called for. They don 't want to cure cancer. And this is the proof. I believe in order to have the Office of Alternative Medicine func- tion as it should, thanks to the great work of Berkeley Bedell, youare spending now $2 billion, it 's now up to $3 billion a year on can- cer. And where is it going? Nowhere. And the reason? They don 't want to cure cancer. The Office of Alternative Medicine must be managed by people who understand alternative medicine. The whole system, there areno magic bullets, there 's no essiac tea, there 's no one drug or one vitamin. It 's a system that has to be understood. And there are 50, in the books I gave you, the book on cancer that I did, Alternative Medicine, Definitive Guide to Cancer, wehave 50 different therapies, many of which are used to help the pa-tient. I believe that the Office of Alternative Medicine must be pulled from the National Institute of Health. Because I 've been tracking it since its inception. The attitude at the NIH is, how dare you tellus that we 've been hurting people all these years. Billions of dollars, and we 're going nowhere. I think that 's it. God bless. [The prepared statement of Mr. Goldberg follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ORN. You stated it very eloquently. The gentlelady from Illinois, for questioning.Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . I wanted to ask Dr. Nixon a question. In your written testimony, actually you referred a little bit more even to the issue of smoking as a way of preventing many, manythousands of death, and smoking in children. And you probably areaware of the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down FDAregulations that would have prevented tobacco companies frommarketing products to children. And it was not because they thinkthat they should be marketed to children, but basically turned,passed the ball back to the Congress and said that the Congressshould act on this. And so far, Congress has failed to do so. I wondered if you had any suggestions for us on what we might do to make sure that we have done everything possible to preventchildren from beginning to smoke and thus creating the most pre-ventable cause of disease that we have in this country. Dr. N IXON . Yes, you are correct, the cause of cancer, the percent- age of cancer attributed to cigarettes and tobacco use is about 35percent of the total, and about 30 percent from nutrition. How doyou convince children not to do hazardous things? We have a pedi-atric task force, headed by one of the leaders in the Nation 's pedi- atric development research community addressing these issuesnow. We have an affiliation with a group in New Orleans to lookat our Know Your Body program and to move that into a youngerage group, rather than the grades one through six, but at the pre-K and the K. What we 're trying to address is the situation that we all see as parents, that if you tell an adolescent not to do something, they 're going to do it. Don 't drive fast, they go drive fast, don 't smoke, they tend to smoke. So what we want to do is through the pediatric taskforce and another task force on spirituality and health is try toteach a philosophy of health to very young children, which wouldinclude smoking cessation, proper dietary habits, drug avoidance,all the good things of life and health promotion. We haven 't been able to do it in the current KYB milieu of teach- ing, the age group that we 're looking at. So I again would call for congressional attention toward teaching, learning how to teachvery young children, perhaps as young as the age of 2, not facts,but philosophy, and how to maintain their health. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Are you concerned at all that the financial in- terests of the tobacco companies may have some undue influencein policymaking? In your view, is this an issue? Dr. N IXON . I think it 's clear that the tobacco companies would like to sell more cigarettes to whoever they can, overseas, youngpeople, any age group. Whether that influences congressionalthought, I would hesitate to say that. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . I don 't mean congressional, necessarily. We find all kinds of races being sponsored by tobacco companies andall kinds of institutions, private as well as public, where there 's a close relationship between tobacco companies and there seems to bea contradiction there. Dr. N IXON . There 's clearly a contradiction there. The American Health Foundation 's founders first linked tobacco and lung cancer, so we go back at least 50 years in this area. And it 's focusing spe- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 as one of the things that Dr. Wynder did for decades. And the KYB program is designed as a smokingcessation program, and now we 're just trying to move it backward into earlier ages. The problem of what to do with tobacco companies ' influence is immense. I don 't have any bright ideas there, I 'm sorry. Mr. H ORN. The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Sanford, 5 minutes for questioning. Mr. S ANFORD . Yes, sir. I would first of all say to Dr. Nixon, thank you very much for coming up this way, or down this way, I 'm not sure which direction we're coming from today. But as one who lives down in the low country of South Carolina, I appreciate all that you 've done to make a difference in people 's lives back home. I went to the University of Virginia for graduate school. And there they believed in the Socratic method. So it struck me as Mr.Goldberg was speaking that some of what he was saying was con-trary to some of what you had said. It would help me if you allwould just bicker a little bit back and forth. In other words, wouldyou pick out three things that he said that didn 't make any sense, and then if you would say why he 's wrong in suggesting that what he's suggesting you said didn 't make sense, and really does make sense, just a little bit of back and forth would help me a whole lotin trying to get to the bottom of the cancer thing. And at the end, if you would just tack on as a personal supple- ment to me one, I notice that you 're not pasty white. And I thought that, I grew up on a farm down in South Carolina, I love being out-side. We 've got four young boys, I 'm constantly outside. But I never grew up putting on sunscreen. My mother-in-law says, whateveryou do, don 't put on sunscreen, it actually causes cancer. So which is the truth there? And too, if you would give me sort of three personal pointers, Mr. Goldberg, aside from hell no, I won 't go to the dentist, what would be two other pointers in terms of things you 'd suggest in terms of personally avoiding cancer. But Dr. Nixon, if you 'd lead off. Dr. N IXON . Thank you very much. I do disagree with a number of things that were said, and I think that would be pretty appar-ent. Let's talk first about pesticides. There is no doubt that pesticides occur in human tissue. There is no doubt that pesticides, that expo-sure to pesticides 20 years ago can still lead to pesticide residuesin the breast. The problem with the argument, and I 'm not saying it 's a good thing to have pesticides in your breast, maybe it 's related to the asthma epidemic or something like that, but as far as cancer isconcerned, breast cancer rates increased in this country extraor-dinarily rapidly around the turn of the century and before, about1870 and 1900. And in fact, the American Cancer Society wasfounded on the recognition of a group of surgeons in New York thatthere was an epidemic of breast cancer. The pesticide argument fails here because there were not any pesticides at that point in widespread use, and breast cancer rateswent like that. The last 50 years or so, they 've been sort of waver- ing up and down a little bit at a very high level. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul the pesticide era, breast cancer has not changed a great deal. So that would be my first point. Do you want to respond tothat, or do you want me to go with the other three? Mr. S ANFORD . Let me just throw one more zinger at them, be- cause I m going to be tight on time with 5 minutes. Mr. H ORN. Don 't worry about the 5-minutes. I have a special rule for South Carolinians. [Laughter.] Dr. N IXON . We 're neighbors on Sullivans Island. The other big thing I take strong exception to is the contention that the National Cancer Institute does not want to cure cancer.I take absolute violent almost exception to that. I 've worked at the NCI, I 've been in the cancer field for now 30 years. Never seen any- body in cancer research or cancer treatment that didn 't hate the disease and want to get rid of it in any way that they can. Thereis not a conspiracy against, to promote cancer. It 's just not there. I'm sorry, but it 's not. Mr. B URTON . Well, I don 't believe you have read the report of the General Accounting Office and the article, and I 'd like you to have a copy of my testimony where I lay it forth. The report absolutelyshows this. As a matter of fact, Barry Tice, the man who did thereport, this 28 year old veteran, Barry Tice strongly objected tohaving his 14 months of work distorted. This is a quote from Barry Tice. He 's now retired, living in Mary- land, and I spoke to him the other day. You can imagine how upsetI was, and still am, about the title, he told Mr. Kamen in a subse-quent interview. The impact of the changes and a few key deletionswas tremendous. Those changes took NCI almost completely off thehook. This is Mr. Tice of the General Accounting Office, and youknow what kind of a reputation they have. There 's politics. As far as pesticides are concerned, I give you numbers that I get from medical journals. The New England Journal of Medicine hadan article on, one of the gentlemen said, we 've lost this war on can- cer. We 've got to do so many other things. But the numbers are this. Breast cancer in 1950 was 1 in 20 women. Pesticides startedcoming in 1950, big time. In 1960, it was 1 in 14 would have breastcancer. In other words, it was 1 in 20, and today, in other words,it comes down, the lower the number, the more women have ittoday. One in eight American women have breast cancer. This isin the world of pesticides, the wonderful world of chemistry. Now, how do I know this? Because when you look at the research at Connecticut General Hospital on split biopsies and toxicology,you don 't hear this. They don 't talk about this, because this flies in the face of the food industry, the chemical industry, the pharma-ceutical industry, the medical industry and everybody else whoseeconomic, petroleum industry where a lot of these things comefrom, it 's in their interest. And you don 't hear it in the media, be- cause they 're the recipients of the ads. How many ads have you seen for drugs now, going directly to the patient? And then withthe side effects of the drug, your left ear will turn yellow and falloff, your nose will this, you 'll have a headache, you 'll vomit and so forth and so on. Drugs today are the third cause of death in our society. First is heart disease, cancer and then drugs. Used to be fourth behindstrokes. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 occurs where the sun doesn 't shine. It is important, most of our doctors will agree that the sunshine,getting vitamin D3 on the pineal gland and on the face, not toomuch sun, certainly you don 't want to injure the skin, so that 's why you put the stuff on. But the sun God provided to nourish us. Oureyes get the light of the sun and it affects us. So many people liv-ing in Wisconsin, so far away from South Carolina, have the SADDdisease, because there 's not enough sun and they go into depres- sion and so forth. The dentist, silver fillings are 50 percent mercury. If your kid broke a thermometer in the mouth, you 'd go crazy. You would put him in a hospital. The American Dental Association says it doesn 't leach. But if you put a device in that measures the vapors, you willsee that it 's wrong. It does leach. And it goes into the ganglia and all through the bodies. And one of the techniques of detoxification, which is the word you will hear for this century, your liver is the filter of the body.And if it gets clogged and dirty, it can no longer filter, it 's like a barrel you put the poisons in, one thing on top of the other. Whenit overflows, that 's when we end up with degenerative disease, in- cluding cancer. And mercury goes into the ganglia. In the case of breast cancer, the blood supply and the lymph system, which is not paid attentionto at all by conventional medicine, which is the seat of your im-mune system, lymphocytes in the small intestine, control and helpyour immune system. And if you don 't open up that lymph system and allow the garbage to come out of the body, as a matter of fact,in chemotherapy \u2014\u2014 Mr. S ANFORD . Could I interrupt on that point? Dr. Nixon, I 'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that. I had a friend that actuallywent to Switzerland and had the traditional fillings taken out ofhis teeth to put in some kind of plastic or whatever. But then Italked to another friend who 's a doctor who actually said the data is bad on that, taking out the fillings really doesn 't make any dif- ference. Do you agree or disagree? Dr. N IXON . I disagree that the tooth filling has anything to do with malignant disease, the tooth filling composition, the amal-gams that dentists use. There is certainly mercury toxicity, there 's a Japanese disease that is a central nervous system disorder fromexcessive mercury. There 's no doubt that mercury is toxic. But the link between teeth, fillings of teeth and cancer is in my opinionvery, very weak and tenuous. Mr. G OLDBERG . I would like to balance that out with, the Coors Beer people had a daughter-in-law and she was not doing well, outin Colorado. So they sent her to Hal Huggins, a dentist in ColoradoSprings. And they paid, after she got well by having in part herdental work done and other things, they paid for a study. Andhere's how the study went. There were 33 patients with silver fillings, I think there were an average of 18, 20 fillings in the mouth. They gave a quarter of amillion dollar amount for this study. They took the immune systemcompetence by blood test before they removed the fillings. Thenwhen you remove these fillings, you have to properly do it, other-wise the patient can get very bad, you have to use oxygen in the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul use a dam in the mouth and they have the suction, and most of the doctors wear gas masks in the chamber in the office. They remove the fillings and then they put in plastic fillings. They then took the competence of the immune system and it wentfrom the basement to the ceiling. They then removed the plastic,put back the mercury and the immune system went back into thebasement. I'm going to tell you a story of a little boy by the name of Smith in Denver, CO. He couldn 't swallow when he was born. And the mother took him to all the hospitals, Denver Children 's, he even went to Boston, and nothing they could do. They were about to puta tube in his belly to feed him, for his life. I directed the familyto Dr. Lee Cowden in Dallas, TX, who 's a holistic physician and who is my co-author of my cancer book. He discovered that the boywas laden with mercury, and the mercury was in the ganglia of thethroat. He used the DMPS, which is a drug out of Russia, and there are studies done in this country, to pull out mercury. The child gotback his swallowing ability and no longer needed the tube and isliving a happy, normal life. That speaks to dentistry. How to avoid cancer. No. 1, organic food, chicken, beef, vegeta- bles, range-grown beef and chicken, vegetables that are organicallygrown. If you can 't afford to have organic, use grapefruit seed ex- tract from a health food store or Blue Label Clorox, wash yourvegetables there, a tablespoon per gallon. It will take care of pes-ticides, herbicides and parasites. And parasites play an enormousrole. No. 2, filter all your drinking water. And your shower water, you have eight times more poison from the skin, the largest organ inyour body then from the shower. Avoid fluoride. They tell you thatit stops children 's cavities. Not true. There is no difference between those areas that fluoridate and those that don 't. It's a rat poison. And the union for the Environmental Protection Agency is totally against fluoridation of the water, and another thing, one of the rea-sons we have so much Alzheimer 's in this country, they use alu- minum sulfate by the truckload to take the cloudiness out of waterin communities. And then they put it back into the rivers afterthey complete it and it goes into the next village. And it builds up,and that 's one of the reasons you find aluminum in Alzheimer 's. We can go on and on and on, because in my book, which you will receive a copy of, we give you the 33 categories of the causes of can-cer. Now, we have a holocaust. What 's causing it? Come up with another solution, Mr. Nixon. How do you explain this holocaust,this increase? One in two men in America, by the American CancerSociety, will have cancer in his lifetime? This is outrageous. Mr. S ANFORD . Any last refutation point? Dr. N IXON . Well, the example of the kid with the swallowing dif- ficulty may have been mercury toxicity. I 'll give you that. But that's not a cancer case, that 's something else. Mr. G OLDBERG . Well, you say there 's no relationship. Dr. N IXON . No, I said mercury is toxic. Mr. G OLDBERG . Well, we know mercury is toxic. Mr. S ANFORD . Could we say this? In other words, if you listen to his suggestions in terms of organic food, filtering water, because VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul fact, she must have read your book, she says the same stuff, which is you need to filter your shower, filter thewater, eat organic food, whatnot. If you were to do those things, doyou think that would reduce one 's chances of cancer, or it would be a placebo? Dr. N IXON . Well, he asked what I think the cause of cancer is. I think it 's nutritionally based and too much exposure to toxins from tobacco. Those are the two big things. So if you eat a vegetar-ian diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and grains, we are inagreement there. I wouldn 't fuss on whether it 's organic or not. But fruits and vegetables and grains are preventive and cancer protec-tive. Mr. S ANFORD . How about filtering your water in your shower and whatnot? Dr. N IXON . I don 't do it at home. Although the Sullivans Island water may need it some. But it 's a different problem. But no, I think that that is not very high on my worry list for cancer, thewater. Mr. G OLDBERG . Mr. Sanford, I 'd like to know who is financing your studies and whether we have chemical companies, agricul-tural companies and pharmaceutical companies that are fundingyour research. Dr. N IXON . No, actually, 99 percent of our funding comes from the Federal Government, the National Cancer Institute. We are acancer center funded by the NCI. Mr. G OLDBERG . And we 're back into old things, the how dare you prove us wrong. They 're not going to find the cause of cancer. They haven 't been able to do this \u2014with $3 billion a year, to be able to go on satellites, as Mr. Cummings said, and we can 't knock out cancer? I have many clinics that can knock out cancer, even endstage cancers, using the system known as alternative medicine. Mr. S ANFORD . I thank you all for your time. Mr. Goldberg, my mother-in-law is going to be calling you. Mr. Nixon, I look forwardto seeing you back on Sullivan 's Island. Mr. Chairman, I yield back to you.Mr. H ORN. Thank you very much. We really appreciated that line, and I 've learned a lot from you today, as I 've learned through- out the campaigns in the last year. There 's where we ought to get something changed, is with all you experts on how you changethings. And campaigns can do it. A number of us tried to talk to previous Presidential nominees about a decent war on cancer. And we never got much attentionfrom them back in the, like 4 years ago and 8 years ago and soforth. So there 's a lot of things that we have learned today, and I think we 've got to followup on them. And we will, because Mr. Bur- ton is pretty well focused, our committee chairman. And I 'm par- tially focused, so anyhow, we really thank you for coming and we 've learned a lot. Mr. S ANFORD . Mr. Chairman, if you 're closing out the time, could I ask one last question? Mr. H ORN. Please. Mr. S ANFORD . And this would be of Dr. Pizza. Sir, if you were to suggest from the European or from the Italian perspective, twothings that we 're doing wrong in terms of either addressing the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:49 Jul from the standpoint of surgery, or from the standpoint of research, what would they be? Dr. P IZZA. I think surgery and chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the most important approach in treatment. But it is not enoughto cure cancer. We do immunotherapy, we did immunotherapy thelast 27 years. And we cured a lot of patients, using very simpleproducts that are used from the immune cells of our body to com-municate each other to do something. One of these molecules is called the transfer factor, it is ex- tracted from the lymphoid cells of the spleen or blood, and it canbe produced also in vitro. This small molecule is completely non-toxic. It is today wasted in your country, because you could takefor example, the buffy-coat of blood bank and extract it from thebuffy-coat and inject to cancer patient, mainly two types, in whichwe showed, demonstrated the effectiveness. Prostate metastatic cancer in stage D3, when the tumor is not more responsive to the hormones, we showed that the median sur-vival for these patients treated also with the transfer factor isabout 110 weeks, with respect to 55, 40 weeks of untreated pa-tients. And in lung cancer, we treat the patients with lung cancerand we have a long experience with that. We have 14 years of ex-perience of treatments for lung cancer. And we have a long seriesof patients treated and control series also, evaluated longitudinally.And we observe that the transfer factor improved significantly thesurvival of patients in stage III of the disease and in stage II. So my suggestion is not to say, to do more research in your coun- try. I believe that your country is more advanced, I think it is themost advanced. I have been visiting scientists at NIH, NationalCancer Institute, in 1980. I have collaboration with the epidemiol-ogy branch of National Cancer Institute. I collaborate also withGeorge Washington University. So I cannot suggest to do more re-search. It would be not right. What I am suggesting is to do today what can be done, and what can be done is to use the new products that we are already surethat are working. You can take transfer factors simply from thebuffy-coats that you put into garbage. A very simple way to takethis is one source. If you want to go to the specific transfer factor,you can produce in vitro. So I would not suggest to make different research. But being a practitioner, being a medical doctor treating patients, I would sug-gest to do that, because this can be done today. Mr. H ORN. We thank you, gentlemen. And one of the traditions we have here is to thank the staff that worked on this hearing.And we had T.J. Lightle as legislative assistant, Beth Crane, in-tern, Robin Daugherty, intern, to my left here and your right isBeth Clay, the professional staff member in charge of this area.And Lisa Arafune is the clerk and Bob Biggs is the assistant clerk. So with that, we thank all of you for coming and spending your time with us. We are adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3:29 p.m., the committee was "}
