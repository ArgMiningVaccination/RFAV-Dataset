The material contained herein may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, or otherwise used, except with the express written permission of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. Introduction Athletes and athlete support personnel play a critical role in helping to protect the integrity of sport at every level. USADA's mission is based on the fundamental truth that all athletes deserve the opportunity to compete on a clean and level playing field, where the results of any competition are determined by talent and hard work. USADA works to ensure that no athlete is ever cheated by a competitor engaging in the use of performance-enhancing drugs. This Clean Sport Handbook is designed to provide athletes and athlete support personnel with a summary of the information needed to successfully participate in the anti-doping program governing their sport. Access to accurate information ensures that athletes and support persons are not only fully prepared for training and competition, but also for the important role they play in the broader global anti-doping movement. \" Clean sport matters because it creates a level playing field and a level playing field is a space for the athletes who prepare, who train really hard towards their goals, and work tirelessly to become the best versions of themselves...\" - Chris Mazdzer 4x Olympian, Luge3 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKWORLDWIDE EFFORT FOR CLEAN SPORT THE WADA PROHIBITED LIST Who makes the rules? As a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code (the Code), USADA complies with all the International Standards developed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in order to harmonize anti-doping efforts around the world. The Code was first implemented in 2004 and is amended approximately every six years (2009 and 2015). The latest version of the Code has been in effect since January 1, 2021. What is USADA? The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) is recognized by the United States Congress as the official anti-doping agency for all Olympic, Paralympic, Pan American, and Parapan American sport in the United States. USADA began operations on October 1, 2000, and is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental agency whose mission is to stand with athletes to champion their right to clean sport, inspire true and healthy sport, and promote the integrity of sport .WADA reviews and publishes the Prohibited List (the List) each year following an extensive consultation process. The List identifies substances and methods prohibited at all times, in-competition only, and in particular sports. How does a substance or method get placed on the Prohibited List? A substance or method is included on the List if it meets at least two of the following three criteria: * It has the potential to enhance or enhances sport performance. It represents an actual or potential health risk to the athlete. It violates the spirit of sport.1 In consultation with signatories and governments, WADA also establishes a monitoring program regarding substances that are not yet on the Prohibited List. The substances and methods added to this list are ones WADA wishes to monitor in order to detect potential patterns of misuse in sport. If you would like a substance or method to be considered for the monitoring program, please contact WADA directly by visiting www.wada-ama.org/en/contact-us and completing a contact form. USADA has created several resources to help athletes determine if substances are prohibited. One of the fastest ways to search the status of a medication and/or ingredient is by using Global Drug Reference Online (GlobalDRO.com), which provides easily accessible and accurate information on the status of brand-name pharmaceutical products sold in Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Some over-the-counter medicinal products are also included in the database. Global DRO\u00ae does not contain information on, or relating to, dietary supplements because they are associated with unreliable manufacturing and evaluation practices. If an athlete can't find the brand name of their medication on Global DRO, they can also search the active ingredients listed on the medication label, which is often necessary in the case of cold, flu, and other such over-the-counter medications. Supplement Connect, USADA's dietary supplement safety education and awareness resource, is where athletes and support persons can find information about the many risks associated with supplements, as well as a growing list of supplements that have been determined to be high risk. Supplement Connect also provides information about third-party supplement certification, which USADA recommends to help athletes reduce their risk if they decide to use supplements despite the known risks. For additional assistance, contact USADA's Drug Reference Team to find out if a medication or specific ingredient is prohibited in sport before choosing to use it. Reach the Drug Reference Team at (719) 785-2000, option 2, or email drugreference@USADA.org. * See Article 4.3.1 of the 2021 WADA Code for more information. 1 As defined in the Code, the spirit of sport is the celebration of the human spirit, body, and mind. It is the essence of Olympism and is reflected in the values we find in and through sport, including health, ethics, fair play, honesty, character, joy, teamwork, dedication, respect for rules and one's self, and other similar values.4 5 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKHEALTH AND SAFETY SUMMARY OF PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES SUMMARY OF SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED AT ALL TIMESThis section provides answers to common questions about the health and safety risks associated with substances and methods included on the Prohibited List. Details are provided by category, as outlined on the List. It also provides information concerning the legitimate medical use of substances. See USADA.org/effects-of-substances for more information. ANABOLIC AGENTS Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are by far the most prevalent performance-enhancing drugs to build muscle strength and lean muscle mass. Due to scientific advances in detection sensitivity, AAS like testosterone, stanozolol, oxandrolone, and nandrolone are readily detectable in athlete samples. What are some potential side effects of anabolic steroid abuse? The physiological and psychological side effects of anabolic steroid abuse have the potential to impact any user, while other side effects are male and female-specific. The list below is not comprehensive. Physiological - All Acne Hair loss Liver damage* Premature closure of the growth centers of long bones (in adolescents) which may result in stunted growth Psychological - All Increased aggressiveness and sexual appetite, sometimes resulting in abnormal sexual and criminal behavior, often referred to as \"Roid Rage\" Withdrawal from anabolic steroid use can be associated with depression and suicide Male-Specific Side Effects Breast tissue development* Shrinking of the testicles* Impotence Reduction in sperm production Female-Specific Side Effects Deepening of the voice* Cessation of breast development Growth of hair on the face, stomach, and upper back* Enlarged clitoris* Abnormal menstrual cyclesPEPTIDE HORMONES, GROWTH FACTORS, RELATED SUBSTANCES, AND MIMETICS Some substances in this category have important medical uses, such as erythropoietin (EPO) to treat anemia and human growth hormone (hGH) for growth hormone insufficiency. But many substances in this category are experimental and have no legitimate therapeutic use. When misused, the substances in this category can lead to negative health effects. For example, some Erythropoietin-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) could cause high blood pressure (hypertension), a lack of healthy red blood cells (anemia), an interruption of blood supply to the brain (stroke), blood clots (pulmonary embolisms), and even blood cancers/leukemia. Additionally, the use of hGH and hCG could result in heart attack, feminization, and thyroid issues. While the use of substances in this category affects individuals differently, it is important to understand the potential health risks. BETA-2 AGONISTS The primary medical use of these compounds is to treat conditions like asthma and other respiratory ailments. The misuse of beta-2 agonists could lead to side effects including, but not limited to, a rapid heart rate, headaches, sweating, nausea, muscle cramps, and nervousness. The anti-doping status of beta-2 agonists depends on the medication, the route of administration, whether it is being used in conjunction with another medication, and the dosage. It is essential that athletes check GlobalDRO.com before using any beta-2 agonist. The following list describes the dosages for the four permitted inhaled beta-2 agonists: Inhaled albuterol (also called salbutamol): maximum 1,600 micrograms (mcgs) over 24 hours in divided doses, not to exceed 600 mcgs over 8 hours starting from any dose, as long as it is not used in conjunction with a diuretic or masking agent Inhaled formoterol: maximum delivered dose of 54 mcgs over 24 hours, as long as it is not used in conjunction with a diuretic or masking agent Inhaled salmeterol: maximum 200 mcgs over 24 hours Inhaled vilanterol: maximum 25 mcgs over 24 hours Please be aware that threshold doses mentioned above do not apply to arformoterol or levalbuterol. Athletes using inhalers containing arformoterol or levalbuterol should refer to Global DRO to determine whether the inhaler is permitted in sport. If the status says, \"Not Prohibited,\" then an athlete can use the inhaler as prescribed. If the status says \"Conditional,\" it means there is a dosage threshold. The Additional Information section on the Global DRO search results will describe the permitted dose. If the status says \"Prohibited,\" then an athlete should begin the TUE process for continued use. All other beta-2 agonists, regardless of route of administration, are prohibited at all times and at all dosages!* Effects may be permanent but can vary by individual7 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 6 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKHow do I figure out the dosage per puff on my inhaler? There are four permitted beta-2 agonists (vilanterol, formoterol, albuterol, and salmeterol) with limits to calculate. Your inhaler will show the dosage of each active ingredient in milligrams (mg) or micrograms (mcgs). If using a metered dose inhaler, you can use the dosage per puff, and the permitted dose, to calculate how many puffs you can have per day in sport. For example, for an albuterol (salbutamol) inhaler that delivers 90 mcgs/puff: 90 mcgs per puff X 6 puffs = 540 mcgs From the WADA Prohibited List, the maximum permitted dosage of an albuterol (salbutamol) inhaler is 1,600 mcgs over 24 hours in divided doses, not to exceed 600 mcgs over 8 hours starting from any dose. Takeaway: You could take 6 puffs of the albuterol inhaler in an 8-hour period without incurring an anti-doping rule violation, but 7 puffs would exceed the maximum dosage allowed over an 8-hour period As another example, Symbicort is a combination product that contains budesonide and formoterol. It is common to see the dosages (prescription dependent) listed in this format: 160/4.5. One number is the dosage of the budesonide and the other number is the dosage of the formoterol. If you read the packaging carefully, it will state exactly how much of each ingredient is in each \"actuation\" (puff, or inhalation). In this example, you only need to calculate how many puffs you could take of the formoterol. 4.5 mcgs per puff X 12 puffs= 54 mcgs Per the WADA Prohibited List, the maximum permitted dose of formoterol is 54 mcgs over 24 hours Takeaway: You could take 12 puffs of Symbicort per day without incurring an anti-doping rule violation. Albuterol syrups or tablets and nebulizers If a doctor prescribes an albuterol syrup or tablet, athletes need to be aware that the use of an oral (swallowed) form of any beta-2 agonist, such as a tablet or syrup, is prohibited at all times and requires an approved TUE. Similarly, if an athlete uses a nebulizer (where the medication is inhaled as a mist using a mouthpiece or mask) instead of a metered-dose inhaler, they should apply for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). Takeaway: Remember! The anti-doping status of beta-2 agonists depends on the medication, the route of administration, whether it is being used in conjunction with another medication, and the dosage. NOTE: See Therapeutic Use Exemption policies pertaining to the use of prohibited medications at USADA.org/tue.HORMONE AND METABOLIC MODULATORS Hormone antagonists are agents that modify hormone functions. Specific classes of hormone antagonists and modulators are prohibited, including: Aromatase inhibitors insulin-mimetics Meldonium, trimetazidine, AICAR What are some potential side effects and health risks of hormone and metabolic modulators abuse? Dramatic change in blood sugar levels (insulin) Endocrine system disruption (clomiphene) Liver damage (AICAR) Cholesterol imbalance (aromatase inhibitors) Motor function disorders and tremors (trimetazidine) DIURETICS AND MASKING AGENTS The primary medical use of these compounds is to treat conditions like high blood pressure, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. Blood plasma expanders (e.g., intravenous administration of albumin, dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, and mannitol) are also prohibited. There are some ophthalmic (topical eye) preparations of substances in this category that are permitted. The use of diuretics or masking agents along with a beta-2 agonist inhaler invalidates the permitted dosages for the inhalers. Athletes should check GlobalDRO.com for ALL their medications before use. What are some potential side effects and health risks of diuretic abuse? Dehydration Dizziness or fainting Muscle cramping and heart arrhythmia due to potassium depletion NON-APPROVED SUBSTANCES This category refers to substances that are not addressed by any of the other sections of the List and that have no current approval by any governmental regulatory health authority for human therapeutic use (e.g., drugs under pre-clinical or clinical development, discontinued designer drugs, and substances approved only for veterinary use). However, given the recent example of the COVID-19 vaccine, there are circumstances when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can implement an Emergency Use Authorization of a drug or substance. In the event a substance is authorized by a government agency in an emergency situation, WADA will closely monitor the situation and broadly communicate any changes or warnings to athletes. Before participating in a clinical trial, athletes need to call or email the USADA Drug Reference Line to determine if a Therapeutic Use Exemption is required. A drug in development and undergoing clinical trials could be considered prohibited if it falls into one of the categories of banned substances on the WADA Prohibited List, or if it has the potential to be performance-enhancing.8 9 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKSTIMULANTS The primary medical use of these compounds is to treat conditions like Attention Deficit Disorders, asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity. In contrast, some designer simulants, which mimic drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA (Ecstasy), and \"bath salts,\" are used by athletes to impact performance. The use of stimulants outside of medical necessity may be unsafe and result in negative side effects, including an increased heart rate and blood pressure that leads to a greater risk of stroke, heart attack, and cardiac arrhythmia. In addition, misuse has led to involuntary shaking (tremors), dehydration, insomnia, anxiety, dependence, and addiction. Though most medications containing stimulants are prescribed by a physician, some over-the- counter medications are known to contain prohibited compounds. For example, pseudoephedrine, levomethamphetamine, propylhexedrine, and epinephrine can be present in allergy, cold, and flu medications, or nasal sprays or inhalants. Other stimulants can be found in dietary supplements, such as pre-workout powders and diet aids. Dietary supplements, which can be purchased over-the-counter, can also contain prohibited stimulants like methylhexaneamine and oxilofrine, also known as methylsynephrine. Be sure to visit Supplement Connect for more information, and call (719) 785-2000, option 2, or email drugreference@USADA.org with questions. In-Competition vs Out-Of-Competition Use Similar to other substances, it is difficult to predict the clearance times or washout periods for stimulants. Stimulants are prohibited in competition, but even if taken out-of-competition, can remain in an athlete's system during the in-competition period, which could lead to an anti-doping rule violation if the athlete is selected for testing. For example, athletes should assume there is a risk returning a positive test if the use of pseudoephedrine is during or close to a competition.EPI PENS Athletes with severe allergies to foods, insect bites/stings, medicines, and other substances may need to possess and use a life-saving epinephrine auto-injector, or Epi Pen. This device delivers a predetermined dose of epinephrine, a stimulant also known as adrenalin, into the muscle through a needle, in the event an athlete experiences anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is prohibited in-competition as a stimulant on the WADA Prohibited List, however, the use of Epi Pens is not prohibited by local administration (e.g., nasal, ophthalmologic, or co-administration with local anesthetic agents). Some event organizers have rules regarding the medications or equipment (such as needles) an athlete is allowed to bring to a competition. However, this does not apply to epinephrine auto-injectors. It is generally recognized that epinephrine is an emergency and potentially life-saving medicine, so athletes will not incur an anti-doping violation for being in possession of epinephrine auto-injectors at a competition. Athletes do not need to submit a TUE application in advance of using or being in possession of an auto- injector. In the event an athlete needs life-saving treatment, they may need to request a retroactive TUE if they used an epinephrine autoinjector in-competition. Once the emergency has subsided, an athlete should complete a TUE Pre-Check Form on the USADA website to learn whether a retroactive TUE is required. USADA will evaluate the TUE Pre-Check Form to determine what TUE requirements apply to the particular situation and will notify the athlete accordingly. NARCOTICS When dosed appropriately, narcotics have medical uses like relieving or managing severe pain. While a sensation of euphoria or psychological stimulation are effects common to the use of narcotics, misuse of narcotics can pose serious health risks. Side effects such as nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression, and a decreased heart rate are possible. In addition, the misuse of narcotics could lead to a false sense of invincibility, increased pain threshold and failure to recognize injury, and a physical and psychological dependence leading to addiction, and even death. What should I do if painkillers are needed for an injury? Check GlobalDRO.com, call USADA's Drug Reference Team at (719) 785-2000 option 2, or email drugreference@USADA.org for more information. Go to the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) section to learn more about applying for a TUE if needed.SUMMARY OF SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED IN-COMPETITION ONLY SECTION TAKEAWAYS Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) can have both psychological and physiological effects on users, varying from minor to life threatening. Four inhaled beta-2 agonists are permitted up to certain dose thresholds and it is essential that athletes check GlobalDRO.com before using any beta-2 agonist. \u2014 If a threshold is identified, it is important to accurately determine the amount acceptable and file for a TUE, if necessary. If an athlete needs to use a hormone antagonist and/or modulator to modify hormone function, be advised that many are prohibited. Non-Approved Substances include those under pre-clinical or clinical development, discontinued designer drugs, or substances approved for veterinary use only.10 11 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKCANNABINOIDS (cannabis, hashish, marijuana, THC, synthetic THC) are prohibited in-competition, regardless of the legal status in the competition location. Cannabimimetics (JWH-018, JWH-073, HU-210) are also prohibited. While cannabidiol (CBD) is not prohibited, athletes should be extremely cautious with these products because it is nearly impossible to obtain a pure CBD extract or oil from the cannabis plant. Anyone who buys a CBD oil, extract, or other CBD product should assume that it is a mixture of CBD and other prohibited cannabinoids, such as THC. Athletes should be aware of the risk that these products may still contain prohibited cannabinoids, even if they are certified or evaluated by a third party. The body absorbs THC, which is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, and breaks it down into metabolites. THC and its metabolites can accumulate in the body fat and tissues and are excreted in the urine over an extended period of time after use depending on the user's metabolism and other factors. What are some potential side effects and health risks of marijuana use? Increased heart rate Impaired short-term memory Distorted sense of time and space Diminished ability to concentrate Slowed coordination and reflexes Mood instability Impaired thinking and reading comprehension Respiratory diseases due to smoking, vaping, or dabbing GLUCOCORTICOIDS The primary medical use of these compounds is to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory conditions, and skin disorders, among other musculoskeletal ailments. Glucocorticoids are often found in asthma control inhalers, eye or ear drops, topical creams, intra- muscular or intra-articular injections, and nasal sprays. As of 2022, ALL glucocorticoid injections are prohibited during the in-competition period. This includes, but is not limited to, injections into joints, bursa, or the epidural space, which are all routes of administration that were previously allowed. Oral and rectal routes of administration also remain prohibited. For clarification, oral administration of glucocorticoids also includes oromucosal, buccal, gingival, and sublingual routes. WADA has determined that these routes of administration result in a significant level of glucocorticoids circulating in the blood, which has the potential to result in performance enhancement or cause harm to health. Glucocorticoids are permitted both in- and out-of-competition when administered by: inhalation (e.g., eye drops) perianal (e.g., topical hemorrhoid creams) dermal (e.g., topical creams to treat rashes or allergic reactions) dental intracanal application Athletes who are required to have a TUE to use glucocorticoid in-competition should apply for a TUE if the use of their medication will occur within the time periods established below. To reduce the risk of a positive test, athletes should follow the minimum washout periods* recommended by WADA. Athletes should check GlobalDRO.com before using any glucocorticoid. If athletes are concerned about their TUE application not being processed prior to a positive test, they are encouraged to contact the Drug Reference Team at (719) 785-2000 option 2, or email drugreference@USADA.org. What are some of the potential side effects of glucocorticoid misuse? Loss of muscle mass and bone density Weakening of injured areas in muscle, bone, tendons, or ligaments Halted or stunted growth in young people Immune system suppression Fluid retention Increased susceptibility to infection Psychiatric disorders, such as changes in mood and insomniaROUTE Oral (swallowing, or cream or gel used inside the mouth/on gums/under tongue) Intramuscular injections Injections into or around joints or tendons, as well as days of a competition Prednisolone & prednisone within 10 days of a competition Betamethasone, dexamethasone & methylprednisolone within 5 days of a competition Triamcinolone acetonide, prednisolone & prednisone within 10 days of a competition All other glucocorticoids within 3 days of a competitionAPPLY FOR A TUE IF YOU USE: Triamcinolone acetonide within 30 days of a competition* All other glucocorticoids within 3 days of a competition * Washout period refers to the time from the last administered dose to the time of the start of the in-competition period (i.e., beginning at 11:59 p.m. on the day before a competition in which the athlete is scheduled to participate, unless a different period was approved by WADA for a given sport). This is to allow elimination of the glucocorticoid to below the reporting level. 12 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK SUMMARY OF SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED IN PARTICULAR SPORTS BETA-BLOCKERS The primary medical use of beta-blockers is to control hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris (severe chest pain), migraine, and nervous or anxiety-related conditions. Beta-blockers are prohibited in-competition only in the following sports, and are also prohibited out-of- competition where indicated: Archery (WA),* Automobile and snowboard halfpipe/big air, and Underwater Sports (CMAS). The misuse of beta-blockers could lead individuals to experience fainting or loss of consciousness, sleep disorders, a decreased heart rate, and spasms of the airway. In some cases, users have also reported sleep disorders, constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs, as well as feelings of tiredness and decreased performance ability in endurance activities. *Also prohibited out-of-competition Medical information used for the Prohibited List section was taken from the WADA Sport Physician's ToolKit, available at wada-ama.org and used with permission.SUMMARY OF PROHIBITED METHODS OF DOPING MANIPULATION OF BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENTS Blood doping is a prohibited method of increasing oxygen to the tissues. Blood doping is used to artificially increase the number of red blood cells in the body by transfusion of one's own blood (autologous transfusion) or blood from donors matched by blood type (homologous transfusion). The end result is that the hemoglobin mass (number of red cells in the blood) is increased for a period of time and translates into the potential for increased endurance, workload, and recovery. What are the health risks of blood doping? Adding more red blood cells to the cardiovascular system can cause the blood to be more viscous (thicker) and cause the heart to overwork. A person with already thickened blood is at greater risk of dehydration. Artificially boosting the number of red blood cells increases the risk of: Stress on the heart and cardiovascular system, leading to an enlarged heart Blood clotting Stroke Adverse immune response, including anaphylactic reaction that could result in death With transfusions, there is an increased risk of infectious disease, such as AIDS or hepatitis. 13SECTION TAKEAWAYS Not only can the use of stimulants outside of medical necessity be unsafe, but athletes who intentionally or accidentally have stimulants in their system during an in-competition period, without proper documentation, could receive a positive test and/or further consequences. If painkillers are needed for an injury, it is important to check the prohibited status on GlobalDRO.com, call USADA's Drug Reference Team at (719) 785-2000 option 2, or email drugreference@USADA.org for more information on whether a TUE is needed. Cannabinoids (cannabis, hashish, marijuana, THC, synthetic THC) are prohibited in-competition, regardless of the legal status in the competition location. \u2014 While cannabidiol (CBD) is not prohibited, athletes should be extremely cautious as CBD oil, extract, or other CBD products usually contain a mixture of CBD and other prohibited cannabinoids, such as THC, even if third-party certified. As of 2022, ALL glucocorticoid injections are prohibited during the in-competition period. \u2014 Other routes of administration of glucocorticoids such as oral, intravenous, intramuscu- lar, or rectal/suppository, are also prohibited during the in-competition period. Beta-blockers are prohibited in certain sports, so it is important for athletes to check the status of their medications on GlobalDRO.com.14 15 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK The permitted substance exceeds the 100 mL per 12-hour threshold, even if the athlete receives several small volume injections - e.g., saline the substances being administered is prohibited the athlete receives treatment outside of a hospital facility that is not part of a surgery or diagnostic test. The following are examples of non-suitable locations to receive an IV infusion or injection: - athletes' home with personal IV equipment - medical practitioner's office, clinic, suite, home, tent, hotel room, or vehicle - health clinic, health center, or wellness clinic - any kind of IV clinic, dialysis center, or treatment room - event organizers' medical facility, tent, first aid station, polyclinic, or start-finish line facility - home visit by IV services or therapies from boutique or concierge IV clinics cleanses, detoxes, refreshes, food poisoning/jet lag/hangover cures, flu relief, or antioxidant treatments received in an emergency situation, instead apply for retroactive TUE as soon as possible after receiving treatment the total IV infusion/injection is less than 100 mL per 12-hour period - However, the athlete still needs to check the prohibited status of the substance being injected the IV infusion/injection is more than 100 mL in 12 hours but is received at the hospital or emergency room, part of urgent medical treatment in an urgent-care or after-hours clinic that is part of a hospital or a hospital system, as part of a surgery/surgical procedure (in or out of the hospital), or as part of a diagnostic procedure or test (in or out of the hospital) like an MRI or CT scan TUEs will only be considered and granted retroactively (after the fact) in exceptional circumstances. Please note that the health and well-being of the athlete must always remain the priority in emergency circumstances. In an emergency, athletes should always receive medical care first, and then notify USADA afterwards. Athletes should obtain medical notes or records relating to the emergency treatment to submit with their TUE application after the emergency has subsided. For more information regarding IV infusions or injections, call USADA's Drug Reference Team at (719) 785-2000, option 2.CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL MANIPULATION Chemical and physical manipulation is tampering or attempting to tamper with the sample in order to alter its integrity, using intravenous infusions, or sequentially withdrawing, manipulating, and reinfusing whole blood or extra fluids. GENE AND CELL DOPING Gene doping is the use of normal or genetically modified cells, the transfer of nucleic acids or nucleic acid sequences, or the use of agents that directly or indirectly affect functions known to influence performance by altering gene expression. Most gene transfer technologies are still in experimental phases. The long-term effects of altering genetic material are unknown, although several deaths have occurred during experimentation. INTRAVENOUS (IV) INFUSIONS AND/OR INJECTIONS Intravenous infusions and/or injections of more than a total of 100 mL per 12-hour period are prohibited except for those legitimately received during hospital treatments, surgical procedures, or clinical diagnostic investigations. Small volume intravenous injections (under 100 mL) are not prohibited as long as the substance delivered is not prohibited and the total volume does not exceed 100 mL in 12 hours. IV infusions and/or injections provided through on-site event medical services, ambulatory treatment, outpatient clinics, doctors' or medical offices, home visits, mobile IV clinics, boutique IV clinics, etc., are prohibited if they exceed the 100 mL per 12-hour period limit and don't meet criteria for a TUE. Keep in mind that sometimes hydration clinics sponsor sporting events and set up tents to provide IV services to athletes. Just because an IV service is offered at a sporting event doesn't mean it is permitted to use. It is still a prohibited method!YES A TUE is required if any of the below apply: NO A TUE is not required if: 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK16 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 17REFERENCE CHART OF PROHIBITED Agents Stimulants Narcotics OtherEnhancement of Oxygen TransferChemical and Physical Manipulation Gene and Cell Doping hGH (human growth hormone) EPO (erythropoietin) IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides (GHRPs) hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) in increase the number of red blood cells in the body by transfusion of one's own blood (autologous transfusion) or blood from donors matched by blood type (homologous))Tampering, diluting urine, substituting urine samples, use of substances and methods, including masking agents which alter, attempt to alter, or may reasonably be expected to alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping controlsGene doping is the non-therapeutic use of cells, genes, or genetic elements to modify gene expression, thereby having the capacity to enhance athletic performance DOPING RATIONALE Building mass and muscular strength Recovery Reduction of joint pain Builds mass and strength when combined with steroids Improve blood's oxygen transport capacity (hGH/EPO) Endurance, improved metabolism of sugar (hGH/Insulin) Compensate for reduction of testicular size (hCG) Improved respiratory capacity Quick weight loss Reduce urine concentration of PEDs to minimize detection Limit excretion of anabolic agents Alertness Awareness Will to win Reduces fatigue Maintain aggressiveness Heart, lungs, brain function faster Limits hunger Relax and cope with the pressures of competition Steadiness for athletesAnti-Estrogenic Agents: Regulation of estrogen levels Cannabinoids: Reduce pain Heightened sense of well-being Euphoria Glucocorticoids: Reduces pain and soreness Reduces tiredness Hematocrit (percent of red cells in the blood) is increased for a period of time and the blood can carry more oxygen to tissues that are performing work Hiding the use of prohibited substances Reduce the chances of prohibited substances being detected by intentionally diluting or manipulating the sample Muscle development Stimulate endogenous hormones LEGITIMATE MEDICAL USES Weight gain for wasting conditions (AIDS, Cancer) Decreased gonadal function in males Delayed puberty in males Osteoporosis Hereditary angioedema Metastic breast cancer EPO-kidney failure Anemia hGH-growth problems Dwarfism Insulin-diabetes hCG-testosterone deficiency Naturally produced during pregnancy Treatment of asthma and other respiratory ailments Treat kidney disease and congestive heart failure Reduce excess fluid from body Management of high blood pressure Treat conditions such as Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD/ADHD), asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity Suppress hunger Relieving severe pain, including in terminally ill cancer patients, or after surgery or injury Help people relax because it reduces activity in the brain and nervous system Induces sleepAnti-Estrogenic Agents: Cancer and osteoporosis treatments Cannabinoids: Reduce stress Glucocorticoids: Treatment of allergies, inflammations, asthma Blood transfusion Legitimate medical indications for IV infusions and/or injections are well documented and are most commonly associated with either medical emergencies or in-patient care Treatment of genetic diseases RISKS Rage Liver and kidney dysfunction Cancer Clotting disorders Stunted growth Women: Masculinization Abnormal menstrual cycles Reduced breast size Men: Impotence Sperm reduction Testicular shrinkage Breast and prostate gland enlargement Hypertension (ESAs/hGH) Feminization in males (hCG) Thyroid problems (hGH) Diabetes (insulin) Hypertension Cardiac arrhythmia and high blood pressure Nausea Headaches and dizziness (constricting blood vessels in the brain) Muscle cramps (constricting blood vessels in muscles) Severe dehydration Excessive weight loss Muscle cramps Blood volume depletion Drop in blood pressure Electrolyte imbalance Potassium depletion Cardiac arrythmia Death Anxiety Insomnia Increased aggressiveness Addiction Dehydration Shaking Convulsions High blood pressure Sudden death Increased risk of stroke Heart attack and cardiac arrhythmia Hallucinations Fatigue Increase/slow the heart rate, Impair mental functions Lower than normal blood pressure (hypotension) A false sense of invincibility and failure to recognize injury Addiction OverdoseAnti-estrogenic Agents: Hormonal imbalance Menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, sweating, insomnia) Cannabinoids: Poor coordination Mental and respiratory problems Impairment Glucocorticoids: Fragilization of tendons and muscles Chronic fatigue Hypertension Immune suppression Adding more red blood cells to the cardiovascular system can cause the heart to overload during exercise, increase stress on the heart, and cause blood clotting and stroke.

The Drug Reference Line\u00ae is available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. MT, by calling (719) 785-2000 and selecting option 2, or by emailing drugreference@USADA.org. If an athlete needs a TUE, they should submit the appropriate application, along with all required medical documentation, at least 30 days before use. Upon application, USADA must receive the entire medical file relevant to a given diagnosis because an independent TUE Committee has to be able to reach the same diagnosis and arrive at the same treatment plan as the athlete's physician. The most common reason for delayed or denied TUEs is a lack of medical documentation or a clear diagnosis. A prescription from a physician is not sufficient grounds in itself to obtain a TUE. Please visit USADA.org/tue for more information on TUEs and the application process. All TUEs are evaluated in accordance with the WADA International Standard for TUEs (ISTUE). How to Apply For a TUE: 1. Download and complete the TUE application form with the treating physician. 2. Provide medical documentation to support the use of the prohibited substance or method (a complete and comprehensive medical history of the diagnosis, symptoms, management strategies, lab results, and a clear statement from the physician indicating why the use of non-prohibited alternatives are not effective in symptom management). 3. Submit the completed TUE application and medical documentation to USADA by email at tue@USADA.org or by fax at (719) 785-2029. 4. USADA will contact the athlete upon receipt of the TUE application, and it can take up to 21 calendar days after receipt of a complete application for the TUE Committee to issue a decision. All TUE applications are reviewed in accordance with the WADA ISTUE and USADA's TUE Policy. 5. If a TUE is approved, the athlete will receive a certificate indicating the approval length for the prohibited substance and/or method. The period of validity for a TUE varies among cases. All medical information submitted to USADA remains confidential. NOTE: In rare circumstances when a prohibited substance or method is required for emergency treatment, an athlete must file a TUE application with full medical documentation from the emergency as soon as reasonably possible after the treatment. Emergency treatment should not be withheld, as the athlete's health and well-being remain the top priority. In such cases, the emergency TUE request will be considered by a TUE Committee after treatment has taken place, per the WADA ISTUE.SECTION TAKEAWAYS Manipulating blood is considered a prohibited method in sport. Chemical and physical manipulation, such as using intravenous infusions, or sequentially withdrawing, manipulating, and reinfusing whole blood or extra fluids is considered tampering or attempted tampering with a sample and is prohibited at all times. Altering the integrity of normal or genetically modified cells, the transfer of nucleic acids or nucleic acid sequences, or the use of agents that directly or indirectly affect functions known to influence performance, is prohibited at all times. Intravenous infusions and/or injections of more than a total of 100 mL per 12-hour period are prohibited except for those legitimately received during hospital treatments, surgical procedures, or clinical diagnostic investigations. THERAPEUTIC USE EXEMPTIONS There may be a time during an athlete's career when they have a legitimate medical need to use a prohibited substance or method. GlobalDRO.com allows athletes to search for the prohibited status of a recommended medication online and is mobile friendly. If the recommended medication is prohibited, athletes in the Registered Testing Pool (RTP) and Clean Athlete Program (CAP) should submit an application for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) before taking a medication, which allows athletes to meet their medical needs while still following the anti-doping rules. All other athletes, including recreational athletes, should submit a TUE Pre-Check Form (USADA.org/tue-pre-check-form) to USADA to determine if a TUE is required. After a TUE is granted, it is valid only at a national level. If an athlete becomes an international athlete or competes internationally, the TUE will not be valid unless it is recognized by an athlete's International Federation (IF). If the IF declines to recognize an athlete's TUE, then the presence, use, possession, or administration of the prohibited substance or prohibited method is prohibited. Athletes should reach out to USADA if they are unsure what TUE rules apply to them. Athletes are strictly responsible for what is found in their body at the time of a drug test, therefore, it is important to understand that predicting the amount of time needed for a medication to clear completely from an individual's system is complicated and unique to an individual based upon the medication and various other factors. For this reason, USADA cannot advise on clearance times for athletes. If an athlete intends to temporarily stop using their medication, they will need to talk with their physician and/or pharmacist about the safety of doing so and potential health impacts. Once athletes have that information, they will need to decide whether the \"clearance time\" estimated by their physician or pharmacist is sufficient for them to compete. If an athlete is not certain that the medication will have cleared by the time they compete, they are encouraged to apply for a TUE.20 21 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKRetroactive/ Emergency TUE There are certain instances in an athlete's career when a TUE cannot be obtained before the use of a prohibited substance or method. A retroactive TUE may be considered under any one of the following circumstances: 1. Emergency or urgent treatment of a medical condition; or 2. There was insufficient time, opportunity, or other exceptional circumstance that prevented submission prior to sample collection; or 3. Due to prioritization of sports by the athlete's NADO, the athlete was not required to get a TUE in advance; or 4. The athlete used a substance/medication/method out-of-competition that is prohibited in-competition only. Athletes and athlete support persons are encouraged to call USADA directly if they have questions regarding a retroactive TUE and if it is necessary for their specific situation. Emergency Hospital Treatment or Surgery In any emergency situation, an athlete's health is always the top priority. When an athlete is able, they should inform their physicians and nurses that they are subject to drug testing and will need to get copies of all clinical notes listing the medications that they received during their treatment. If it provides peace of mind, an athlete or a representative can contact USADA's Drug Reference department to let them know that the athlete is receiving emergency medical treatment. The athlete and their physicians should determine the best medical care, so contacting USADA to approve treatment is NOT necessary. The goal of notifying USADA is to allow us to help an athlete get all the necessary paperwork for a TUE application if a TUE is needed. Athletes are not required to notify USADA at this stage. When an athlete has time or when they are released from the hospital (whichever comes first), they should be sure to check all the medications on GlobalDRO.com or call Athlete Express to determine if a TUE is necessary. If a TUE is required, please consider the following as it will aid in the TUE request: Provide copies of the hospital medical records outlining the clinical exam, diagnosis, treatment plan, and any prohibited substances and methods administered (ER admission/discharge notes, and a physician's clinical notes detailing the treatment). Completely fill out a TUE application and write \"EMERGENCY TUE\" at the top of the form. Provide written personal statement regarding the circumstances surrounding the events as they occurred, along with any other relevant information.Planned Hospital Visit for Treatment or Surgery In the event an athlete has a treatment or surgery scheduled ahead of time, the following details are important to keep in mind: Inform doctors and nurses that they are an athlete subject to drug testing and that the athlete would like to check the prohibited status of all medications and methods that they may receive during treatment. Search the medications on GlobalDRO.com or contact the Drug Reference Line at (719) 785-2000 (option 2) or by emailing drugreference@USADA.org to find out if any of the medications are prohibited. USADA can also help athletes and support persons determine if any of the methods are prohibited. REMEMBER: All IV infusions and/or injections of any substance, prohibited or permitted, in excess of 100 mL per 12-hour period are prohibited at all times, except for those legitimately received during hospital treatment, surgical procedures, or clinical diagnostic investigations. In all other circumstances, an approved TUE is required in advance of an IV infusion above the limit and/or involving a prohibited substance. If the proposed substances or methods are prohibited, athletes should ask their physician if any non-prohibited alternatives are appropriate for the treatment. Non-prohibited alternatives for most medications can be found by searching GlobalDRO.com. If athletes need to use a medication that is prohibited at all times, they must apply for a TUE. Submit the TUE to USADA in advance of their treatment involving a prohibited substance or method. On the application, athletes will inform USADA when their surgery (or other treatment) will take place. REMEMBER: Athletes are responsible for everything that goes into and on their bodies. While checking GlobalDRO.com (hyperlink) is an important step, the responsibility ultimately lies with the athlete. All Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) have an expiration date. If an athlete's TUE is nearing its expiration date or it has already expired, they will need to renew their TUE. Athletes can follow the steps below and visit USADA.org/TUE for more information on the renewal process. Complete a new TUE applicationProvide medical notesReview previous approval TUE certificateReview applicationSubmit completed application 1 2 3 4 5 How to Renew a TUE:22 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 23 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKSUBSTANCE CLARIFICATIONS Regenerative Medicine: Stem cell injections and PRP treatments As the field of regenerative medicine has advanced in recent years, athletes have increasingly turned to therapies that utilize biological substances, such as stem cells and amniotic or umbilical cord derived tissues to heal sports injuries faster. As these products and treatments vary widely, they may or may not be prohibited, depending on how the cellular material and its constituents are manufactured, purified, manipulated, or modified for use. The WADA Prohibited List states that it is prohibited to use both normal and genetically modified cells, in any way, if the process causes performance enhancement. Based on these regulations, athletes should be aware that the use of regenerative medicine products or treatments cannot justify a positive doping test if any prohibited substances are identified in a sample. Further, in the U.S., the FDA has issued warnings to consumers about some regenerative therapies because the safety and benefit of almost all these products are so far unproven. Before administering any regenerative medical treatment, athletes and athlete support personnel should confirm the prohibited or permitted status by calling USADA's Drug Reference Team at (719) 785-2000 option 2, or emailing drugreference@USADA.org. Blood Donation WADA has issued a public statement confirming that plasmapheresis is prohibited under M1.1 for the donor because the donor's own red blood cells and other blood components are reintroduced into the circulatory system after the plasma has been separated. However, donating whole blood is permitted. Athletes should consult with USADA prior to any plasma donation. Clinical Trials Before participating in a clinical trial, athletes need to call or email the USADA Drug Reference Line to determine if a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) is required. A drug in development and undergoing clinical trials could be considered prohibited if it falls into one of the categories of banned substances on the WADA Prohibited List, or if it has the potential to be performance enhancing. To contact the Drug Reference Line, please call (719) 785-2000 and select option 2, or email drugreference@USADA.org.SECTION TAKEAWAYS GlobalDRO.com allows athletes to search for the prohibited status of prescription and over-the-counter medications. If a medication is prohibited, athletes in the Registered Testing Pool (RTP) and Clean Athlete Program (CAP) should submit an application for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) before taking a medication. After a TUE is granted, it is valid only at a national level. If an athlete becomes an international athlete or competes internationally, the TUE will not be valid unless it is recognized by an athlete's International Federation (IF). If the dosage or medication identified on the TUE changes at any time, the athlete is responsible for connecting with the USADA Drug Reference team to identify the steps for reapplying/ updating their existing TUE. A TUE has an expiration date, and the athlete will be responsible for renewing at the appropriate time. If a TUE cannot be obtained before the use of a prohibited substance or method, a Retroactive TUE may be available if certain criteria are met. If an athlete experiences an unexpected hospital stay where prohibited substances and/or methods were administered, athletes should contact USADA as soon as possible about the need for a retroactive TUE and be prepared to provide a statement and other relevant information about the circumstances in which the prohibited substances and/or methods were used. In the event an athlete has a treatment or surgery scheduled ahead of time, the following details are important for athletes to keep in mind: \u2014 Inform their doctors and nurses that they are an athlete subject to drug testing and that they would like to check the prohibited status of all medications and methods that they may receive during treatment. \u2014 Search their medications on GlobalDRO.com or contact the Drug Reference Line at 719-785-2000 (option 2) or by emailing drugreference@USADA.org to find out if any of the medications are prohibited. USADA can also help determine if any of the methods are prohibited.24 25 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKHave questions about dietary supplements? USADA has created an online resource designed to provide athletes and support persons with the best possible information to evaluate the risks associated with the use of supplements. From product contamination to issues with product labeling, Supplement Connect provides athletes and support persons with information that will help them Realize that safety issues exist, Recognize risk when they see it, and Reduce their risk of testing positive or experiencing harmful health effects from the use of dietary supplements. To learn more about the dietary supplement industry and access valuable information, including the TrueSport Supplement Guide, visit USADA.org/supplement-connect. Third-Party Certification If an athlete chooses to use dietary supplements despite the known risks, USADA recommends the use of products that have been certified by a third-party. To be clear, using certified products reduces, but does not eliminate, the health and anti-doping risk athletes assume when using a supplement. To find out which third-party certifications USADA currently recognizes, visit USADA.org/supplement-connect. High Risk List USADA has compiled a growing list of products that are considered to be risky to athletes and consumers. The High Risk List can be accessed by visiting USADA.org/supplement-connect.Your hub for supplement resources. SECTION TAKEAWAYS Dietary supplements are regulated in a post-market manner, so the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not analyze the safety, efficacy, or contents of supplements before they are sold to consumers. Athletes need to understand that they are strictly liable for substances they ingest. Supplement Connect is USADA's hub to provide athletes and support persons with information on supplements. USADA recommends athletes use third-party certified products to reduce their risk from supplements. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS No organization, including USADA, can guarantee the contents or safety of any dietary supplements. Consequently, athletes always assume some risk of testing positive for prohibited substances when they use supplements. As always, athletes are strictly liable for substances they ingest, including those consumed through dietary supplements. It is very important for athletes who are considering using supplements to be aware of the potential risks associated, including: 1. A positive anti-doping test result 2. Negative and potentially dangerous health issues Athletes also need to be aware that manufacturers may misidentify prohibited substances on labels, or they may omit prohibited substances from labels altogether. Because dietary supplements are regulated in a post-market manner, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not analyze the safety, efficacy, or contents of supplements before they are sold to consumers. There are many products on the market currently that aren't labeled as dietary supplements but are instead labeled as 'for research purposes only', or may not have any kind of label. As a reminder to athletes and athlete support persons, these products should be considered risky from both a health and anti-doping perspective. Be an Informed Consumer Athletes should always investigate the source of the product. Never use a product unless you have checked the ingredients against the Prohibited List and fully investigated the source of that product. If you have any questions, always contact USADA before using the product. Never use a pill, capsule, powder, drink, injectable, or other product that has been removed from its packaging by anyone other than you. Use extreme caution when considering substances from supplement stores, vitamin stores, and online suppliers. Be aware of red flag marketing claims and never use products that make claims about weight- loss, sexual enhancement, muscle-building, testosterone-boosting, or pre-workout energy boosting. It is risky to use products from a seller that also sells products containing prohibited substances, markets to bodybuilders, or makes extreme claims about the performance-enhancing benefits of the product. No product should ever be used that is advertised as being for research purposes only, or not for human consumption. 26 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKAthletes are subject to both in-competition and out-of-competition testing if they compete in events sanctioned by, or are members or license holders of, a National Governing Body or International Federation or fall under the USADA testing jurisdiction as defined in the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing. Testing and education are both important factors to maintaining an effective anti-doping program, which is why all U.S. athletes who are credentialed for the Olympic, Paralympic, Pan American, Parapan American, and Youth Olympic Games are required to undergo anti-doping education in the months prior to the event, in accordance with the USOPC National Anti-Doping Policy. All athletes appointed to a U.S. team may also be subject to additional testing throughout the Games by the International Olympic Committee or International Paralympic Committee (IOC/ IPC) or the Games Organizing Committee, which is why it is important athletes understand their rights and responsibilities. The USADA anti-doping program utilizes in-competition (event) testing, as well as no-notice, out-of- competition testing, to help protect the rights of clean athletes and maximize unpredictability and the deterrent value of testing. The standard definition for \"in-competition\" is the period commencing at 11:59 p.m. on the day before a competition in which the athlete is scheduled to participate, through the end of the competition and the sample collection process related to the competition. Out-of-competition testing is defined as testing at all other times and locations, such as an athlete's home or training location. Athletes are subject to both urine and blood testing 365 days a year and tests can occur at any time and any place. The sample collection process is designed to be safe, consistent, and as comfortable as possible for athletes. The following information identifies the procedures athletes can expect to follow when providing a sample, the processes unique to each type of test, and athlete rights and responsibilities. The steps for blood and urine sample collection and processing are similar for both in-competition and out-of-competition testing. SELECTION There are a variety of reasons why an athlete might be selected for testing, including the: Physical demands of the sport Benefit an athlete would receive from doping in the sport History of doping in the sport and/or discipline All athlete selection and testing is conducted in accordance with WADA's International Standard for Testing and Investigations (ISTI).SAMPLE COLLECTION EQUIPMENT There are a variety of sample collection kits used by Anti-Doping Organizations (ADOs) across the world. Though the kits may look different, all sample collection equipment in use is WADA compliant. USADA currently uses SAFESystem by InnoVero. Below are the ways in which these sample collection kits ensure efficacy and safety: The SAFESystem A and B bottles are made from a proprietary polymer material, which is not only stronger and lighter than glass, but also contains tamper-evident and anti-counterfeit qualities to deliver state-of-the-art security. The bottle openings are approximately three time larger than other kits, making it much easier for athletes to distribute samples into the A and B bottles. The bottles feature a trihexagonal shape intended to improve grip and usability. The locking mechanism is entirely transparent and fully engages in just three clicks every time. Unique alpha-numeric IDs ensure the anonymity of athletes' samples. The SAFESystem features a partial sample vault and security tag to ensure the integrity of partial samples until the full sample is ready for processing. The SAFESystem is a universal collection kit and can secure both urine and blood samples, eliminating the need for two different kits and improving the consistency of collections.DOPING CONTROL PROCEDURES 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2728 29 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKAthletes will then divide their sample between the A and B sample bottles as instructed and seal them. The DCO will not handle any of the equipment during the procedure unless by athlete request or if an athlete provides a partial sample, in which case the DCO will retain control of the sealed partial sample. Otherwise, athletes are to maintain direct observation and control of their sample until the sample is sealed. Once the sample is sealed, athletes will be asked to place the A and B sample bottles into plastic transport bags and back into the original box for secure transport to the laboratory. The DCO will check the specific gravity (density) with what's left of the sample. Additional samples may be requested if the sample is not within the required range. When instructed by the DCO, athletes will declare any prescription/ non-prescription medications, injections, blood transfusions, and/ or dietary supplements they are taking on the Doping Control Official Record (DCOR), along with details of any Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) they have obtained. Finally, if the athlete or representative would like to include any additional comments, these can be included on the supplementary report form. Athletes should check the entire DCOR thoroughly to ensure that the information is correct before signing. Their name is not on the documentation that goes to the laboratory. The laboratory reports all results based on the unique sample code numbers to ensure the athlete's anonymity is protected. Athletes will then receive a copy of the test session documentation. At this time, the Athlete Evaluation Form will be shared with the athlete so that they can provide feedback or comments, if desired. The sample may be subject to long-term storage and further analysis at any time at USADA's discretion.SAMPLE COLLECTION PROCESS While drug testing may not be the most glamorous part of an athlete's career, it is critical to the global fight for clean sport. By participating in the anti-doping program, athletes are doing their part to help protect the integrity of competition. The following information provides an overview of the sample collection process. Tests can be conducted by USADA, another National Anti-Doping Organization (NADO), the International Federation (IF) for the athlete's sport, WADA, and/or other third-party sample collection agencies. SAMPLE COLLECTION PROCESS - URINE Athletes selected for testing will be notified by a Doping Control Officer (DCO) or chaperone. They will ask the athlete to provide photo identification. Following notification, athletes must stay within direct observation of the DCO or chaperone. Athletes should report to the doping control station (in-competition), or to an appropriate location (out-of-competition) immediately, unless a valid reason is discussed with, and permitted by, a DCO or chaperone. Athletes will be asked to select a sealed sample collection vessel from a choice of vessels. They will check and inspect the collection vessel to ensure that it has not been tampered with before opening the vessel. Athletes will be required to provide a urine sample of 90 mL under direct observation of a DCO or witnessing chaperone of the same gender. Minor athletes are encouraged to be accompanied by a representative of their choice. If 90 mL are not immediately provided, athletes will use additional collection vessel(s) to provide the remainder when capable. Athletes will be offered a choice of sealed sample collection equipment (which includes A sample and B sample bottles). They should check and inspect the equipment thoroughly prior to use.7* 8 9 101 2 3 4 5* Valid reasons for delay may include receiving medical attention, media commitments, or attending a medal ceremony. * While sample collection equipment may vary slightly according to the sample collection agency or region, the integrity of the sample will always be maintained.6*30 31 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKSAMPLE COLLECTION PROCESS - BLOOD Blood samples collected by USADA may be analyzed for prohibited substances and/or methods and/or indirect biomarkers of doping that in some cases may not be detectable in urine, including, but not limited to those used in the Athlete Biological Passport. The blood collection process closely resembles the urine collection process described previously, and it is not uncommon to provide both a urine and blood sample during a sample collection session. Here are a few differences and processes to expect: Some USADA DCOs will be qualified phlebotomists, but if they are not, a certified and/or licensed phlebotomist, called a blood collection officer (BCO), will perform the blood draw. To control for blood plasma volume changes, the athlete will be asked to remain seated for at least 10 minutes prior to providing a blood sample. If the athlete has exercised within the last two hours, they will need to wait until two hours after completion of exercise before their blood sample can be collected. The BCO or DCO will select an area, typically the non-dominant arm, from which to draw the blood. The amount of blood drawn, which is up to approximately two tablespoons, is unlikely to affect performance. Athletes will be asked supplementary questions specific to blood collections that are important to the analysis of the sample. For example, they may be asked about their exposure to high altitudes or extreme environments, recent exercise, or blood loss. SAMPLE COLLECTION PROCESS - DRIED BLOOD SPOT (DBS) While urine testing remains the most common testing method, blood samples are a critical component of anti-doping programs because they allow laboratories to detect prohibited substances and methods that are not otherwise detectable in urine samples. Over the years, anti-doping experts have been conducting research to make blood collection easier for both anti-doping organizations and athletes. Dried Blood testing, or DBS, is one of the latest and most innovative methods for collecting blood samples. An FDA-regulated sterile collection device is placed on an athlete's skin and allows USADA to collect a series of very small capillary blood spots in a near painless way with the push of a button. In general, the process takes about 1-5 minutes, and the device collects about 25 times LESS volume than traditional blood collection methods. Athletes report lower levels of pain with the DBS device compared to collecting blood with a finger stick or standard venipuncture procedure. After collection, DBS samples can be transported without refrigeration and can be stored for longer periods of time, leading to greater opportunities for blood collection and reanalysis of samples. More athletes should expect to experience DBS collections, in combination with traditional urine and blood collections, in the near future as USADA continues to collaborate with the World Anti-Doping Agency and global partners to incorporate DBS collections worldwide. Refer to the step-by-step process below to learn more: An outside portion of the upper arm needs to be accessible for the DBS draw. Warming the skin by vigorously rubbing the arm can encourage skin blood flow and aid collection. Unlike a standard venous blood draw, the athlete does not need to be seated for 10 minutes prior to collection, and there are no restrictions around prior exercise. The skin will be cleaned with an alcohol swab and left to air dry. The Tasso M20 device will be applied to the clean skin and the athlete (or DCO if preferred) will push the red button to start the collection. There is a small prick, like a rubber band snapping against the skin, which means the Tasso M20 device is working properly. The collection is complete when all four spots are red, which may take 3-5 minutes. The device is then removed, and a small bandage is applied to the arm. Finally, the security kit is placed inside a light-proof bag and is ready for shipping.The collection cartridge is removed from the collection device by placing the tongue of the collection device into the groove of the security kit and pushing down. The cartridge is placed into the compartment of the security kit with the white tab facing to the left. Once the cartridge has been vented by removing the tape, the black foam is removed, and the security kit can be closed. A tamper evident security seal is applied.1 2 3 5432 33 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKATHLETE BIOLOGICAL PASSPORT (ABP) The Athlete Biological Passport, or ABP, monitors selected biological markers in urine and blood samples over time that may indirectly reveal effects of doping on the body. The ABP allows anti-doping organizations to track individual athlete data and utilizes a mathematical model to monitor and analyze patterns and variations that may indicate the use of performance-enhancing drugs or methods. Passports that are flagged by the model as atypical are investigated by internal and external experts to establish whether the profile can be explained by normal physiology, a possible medical condition, or a prohibited method. An athlete's ABP data can also be used to complement traditional doping control approaches, such as conducting targeted anti-doping tests on athletes with atypical, or suspicious, characteristics, providing rationale for special analyses, or to establish an anti-doping rule violation. SPECIAL ANALYSIS In addition to the data provided by the ABP, USADA utilizes special analysis testing, to include human growth hormone (hGH), erythropoietin (EPO), and Carbon isotope ratio (CIR)/Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). USADA may instruct the lab to perform these analyses at the time of sample collection or may request the analysis at a later date based on other results or information. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS Obtaining blood via venipuncture, most commonly from a superficial vein in the arm, allows blood to be collected for anti-doping testing for substances and methods not otherwise detectable in urine. BCOs use sterile blood collection equipment and follow strict infection and hygiene control procedures during blood collections to minimize risk of infection. Complications or adverse health effects from a blood draw are rare but can include fainting, dizziness, bleeding, bruising or swelling at the puncture site (hematoma), pain, nerve injury, infection, and arterial puncture or laceration. Site reactions such as bruising or swelling can be minimized by applying constant pressure to the collection site for at least five minutes, avoiding strenuous exercise for at least 30 minutes, and keeping the bandage on for at least two hours. If an athlete has ever experienced complications or adverse health effects from a past blood draw, they are advised to inform the USADA DCO before the blood draw begins. DECLARATION OF USE DOCUMENTATION Athletes are required to complete specific doping control documentation during every sample collection session. Part of this process is accurately declaring any and all medications, methods, or supplements that an athlete has ingested or used in the specified time frames. Providing complete and accurate information in the declarations portion of the doping control documentation is critically important and to an athlete's advantage- it could mean the difference between a rule violation and a lengthy period of ineligibility, or no period of ineligibility. For example, if an athlete has received an intravenous injection or infusion, they should declare the date received and the total volume of that infusion or injection in milliliters (mL). The same goes for prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as dietary supplements. The name, dosage amount consumed or ingested, the time the substance was taken, and the frequency are important details for the documentation. Even if an athlete has been granted a Therapeutic Use Exemption, or TUE, for an illness or condition, the permitted substances and/or methods and existence of a valid TUE should be declared in the doping control documentation. It is important to note that under the World Anti-Doping Code, athletes are strictly liable, meaning they are ultimately responsible for what is in their systems. An athlete's declaration is considered evidence of the athlete's intent to comply with the rules, especially if it leads to a finding that the athlete has not intended to cheat. On the other hand, when an athlete fails to disclose a substance on their doping control form and tests positive, the failure to disclose can cast doubt on the athlete's efforts to demonstrate that they were trying to comply with the rules, and this may result in a longer period of ineligibility. Therefore, it is always in an athletes' best interest to declare all supplements, methods, and medications - both prescription and non-prescription - during every sample collection process.If accepted, athlete sample and passport require no further analysis at this time12Panel reviews athlete's explanation. If not accepted or provided, then an ADRV is filed.11 Athlete provided with opportunity to explain APF10If all three experts independently come to a 'likely doping' conclusion, then a joint report is produced and the passport advances to an APF-adverse passport finding (equivalent to AAF)9 If considered 'likely doping,' passport is sent to two additional experts for anonymous review 8External expert reviews passport and provides a recommendation: normal, suspicious, likely medical, or likely doping 7 Atypical Passports sent anonymously to external ABP expert6 If sample is outside of individual ranges, the passport is flagged as \"atypical\" and additional testing/ special analysis may occur 5If new sample is within the individualized upper and lower references ranges, no further analysis or review occurs at this time4 Data is analyzed by the Passport Adaptive Model and new individual references ranges are calculated (upper and lower)3 Sample is analyzed and data entered into Passport2Athlete provides sample134 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKWhile the declaration process might seem repetitive, all athletes are required to declare substances and methods each time they are tested by USADA and other testing agencies. These anti-doping protocols are designed to protect athletes and sport so all athletes can compete clean and win. Athletes are encouraged to embrace the process and take it upon themselves to fully research and disclose every product they use because this is one of the best ways to ensure that they are competing clean. SAMPLE SHIPMENT AND NOTIFICATION After the conclusion of the collection session, the DCO will ship the sample(s) to a WADA-accredited laboratory. The chain of custody for the sample is thoroughly documented by USADA to protect the sample integrity, and the sample collection documentation that accompanies the sample(s) to the WADA- accredited lab does not include the athlete's name. The sample may be stored and retested. An athlete will receive notification (either electronic and/or postal mail) from USADA that states the analysis has been completed. If the sample(s) was collected by another anti-doping organization, the athlete may not receive the results or any form of notification. PROVIDING FEEDBACK Athletes have the right to provide feedback about their USADA collection session. After each session, a USADA DCO will provide the athlete with an evaluation form to provide feedback related to the collection session. If documentation is conducted digitally, USADA DCOs will inform athletes that a link to an Athlete Evaluation Form will be available at the bottom of the email they receive after testing. USADA encourages athletes to provide feedback about their experience, and every form that is submitted to USADA is reviewed. If the athlete or the athlete's representative is interested in submitting written comments specific to their sample collection session, this is done on a supplementary report form. This form is available from the DCO at the time of the sample collection. Remember, athletes can always provide feedback by calling USADA directly at Athlete Express (719) 785- 2000 or confidentially through USADA's Play Clean Tip 1-877-752-9253. PAPERLESS SAMPLE COLLECTION USADA's Doping Control Officers (DCOs) predominantly use a paperless format (from a handheld device) to document a test session and sample collection on the Doping Control Official Record (DCOR). This paperless system allows for secure and fast transmission of athlete information. Not only does the DCOR on the device provide excellent security, but it also allows athletes to quickly access their own testing data through their secure online USADA account . GIVING CONSENT FOR RESEARCH Recognizing that research is the cornerstone of an effective anti-doping program, USADA has always placed emphasis on the study of prohibited substances, the development of tests, and advancing other research impacting anti-doping science. During the drug testing process, a DCO will ask about the athlete's consent for research. This will be described verbally but ultimately involves an athlete checking \"I Accept\" and signing the Doping Control Form (DCF) under the following text: Consent for Research (optional): By checking \"I Accept\" and signing in the space provided I agree this/these Sample(s) may be used for anti-doping research purposes. When all analyses have been completed, and this/these Sample(s) would otherwise be discarded, it/they may then be used by any WADA-accredited laboratory for anti-doping research of any type, provided that it/they can no longer be identified as my Sample(s). When an athlete voluntarily chooses to contribute their sample to anti-doping research, all identification is removed so that the sample can never be traced back to the particular athlete. This anonymous sample can then be used in various anti-doping research projects such as testing newly developed laboratory instruments, calibrating a new technique, or developing normal ranges for the athlete population. This research is crucial to keeping anti-doping science on the cutting edge, which plays a major role in our ability to protect clean sport. Without access to real samples, anti-doping science cannot progress. Once routine anti-doping analyses has been completed, the analyzing laboratory is required by the anti-doping rules to store the sample for a minimum of three months. After this time, the sample may be discarded or USADA may request to store the sample for up to 10 years and may re-analyze it at any point if, for example, a new technique is developed to allow analysis for a substance prohibited at the time of collection. All samples must be discarded after 10 years. Regardless of how long the sample is stored, if the athlete has provided consent for research, then the anonymized sample may be used for research before it is discarded. An athlete's consent to have their sample used for anti-doping research is entirely voluntary and does not affect the selection or frequency of future testing. USADA encourages all athletes to consent to their sample being used for research because it supports innovation that helps improve the anti-doping system and keep sport clean! 3536 37 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKMINOR ATHLETES (UNDER THE AGE OF 18) Due to the sensitivity of a minor being involved in the sample collection process, extra precautions are taken. When USADA tests an athlete who is a minor (under the age of 18), USADA urges a minor athlete to appoint a representative to accompany them at all times during the sample collection process, including in the washroom area. However, the representative will not witness the passing of the sample but may witness the observing DCO or chaperone. Additionally, the DCO will have a second sample collection personnel present throughout the sample collection process. ATHLETES WITH A DISABILITY Athletes with a disability requiring extra assistance are strongly encouraged to have a representative present throughout the sample collection session. As outlined in the World Anti-Doping Code, athletes with a disability may request slight modifications to the sample collection process. An athlete with restricted mobility or restricted manual dexterity may ask the athlete representative or the DCO to assist when handling equipment, splitting the sample, or completing paperwork. Athletes with a visual impairment may always be accompanied by an athlete representative during the sample collection, including to the washroom area; however, the representative will not witness the passing of the sample. The athlete representative or the DCO may read the doping control form to the athlete , and they may ask the athlete representative to sign the doping control form on the athlete's behalf. Athletes with an intellectual disability may always be accompanied by an athlete representative during the sample collection procedure, including to the washroom area; however, the representative will not witness the passing of the sample. Athletes using condom drainage or indwelling catheter drainage should remove the existing collection bag and drain the system so that a fresh sample can be obtained as soon as possible after notification and under observation of the DCO. Where possible, the existing urine collection or drainage system should be replaced with a new, unused catheter or drainage system prior to the sample collection. Athletes who self-catheterize may use their own catheter to provide a sample and the new catheter should be produced in tamper-evident wrapping.WHO CONDUCTS TESTING? As a member of the global anti-doping community, USADA works with many other Anti-Doping Organizations (ADOs) from around the world to coordinate testing of U.S. athletes living and training abroad. If the athlete is selected for testing under USADA's program, and the attempt is made outside of the United States, the sample collection authority will provide the athlete with a Letter of Authority confirming their selection for testing under the USADA program. When the athlete is contacted or notified for testing, it is important to be aware of which entity is conducting the test. Ask for the DCO's credentials and have an understanding of an athlete's basic rights and responsibilities (see Rights and Responsibilities section). While many aspects of the testing process are identical worldwide, minor modifications to notification, equipment, and collection protocols are normal. Ask to document any irregularities in writing should they arise and be of concern. TESTING FAQS Who can test an athlete? In addition to USADA, U.S. athletes are subject to doping control by: The ADO of the country or region in which they are living, training, or competing The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) The International Federation (IF) governing the athlete's sport, or a testing agency appointed by the athlete's IF Major games organizations, such as the International Olympic or Paralympic Committees, all continental championships, etc. How are athletes selected for USADA testing at a competition or event? In-competition testing plans are primarily developed by coordinating with each National Governing Body (NGB) and are often created in accordance with International Federation (IF) rules. Athletes may be selected for testing by USADA based on criteria that typically includes established rules set forth by an athlete's IF. An example of how athletes would be selected for in-competition or event testing could be: placed finishers, such as the top three finishers, as well as randomly selected athletes, such as 5th, 7th, 12th, 18th, 19th, etc. How are athletes selected for USADA's out-of-competition testing? USADA's out-of-competition testing plan is designed to strategically maximize resources by allocating tests based on specific factors in accordance with the International Standard for Testing and Investigations (ISTI). Tests are then conducted throughout the year when out-of-competition testing is most effective, and according to selection criteria and incoming data, including previous and current event results and/or world and national rankings. To maintain an effective anti-doping program, USADA retains the right to test athletes at any time and location.39 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 38 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKHow is an athlete notified for testing? A Doping Control Officer (DCO) or a notifying chaperone will notify an athlete of their selection for doping control and will provide them with his/her credentials. The athlete will then be asked to acknowledge in writing on the Doping Control Official Record (DCOR) or Athlete Notification Form that they were notified. A DCO or chaperone can notify athletes at any time and any location, including their home, training facility/area, work, school, etc. If an athlete refuses to provide a sample, they are subject to an anti-doping rule violation and up to a four-year period of ineligibility. The DCO or notifying chaperone will keep the athlete in direct observation and accompany them at all times until they report to the doping control station (in-competition) or to an appropriate location (out- of-competition) where they will complete the sample collection process. When and where does an athlete report for testing? In-competition testing: An athlete, their representative (if applicable), and the notifying chaperone will report to the on-site doping control station immediately, unless there is a valid reason for delay and it is approved by the DCO, which may include: 1. A medal ceremony 2. Media commitments 3. Medical obligation 4. Warming up and cooling down 5. Competing in further events 6. Arranging for an athlete representative and/or language specialist Out-of-competition testing: A safe, secure, and private location (e.g., a home or training facility) will be used as the doping control station during the sample collection session. Sample collection documentation may be started at the initial location of notification. Can athletes eat and drink liquids after being notified for testing? After notification, the DCO should advise the athlete that should they choose to consume food or fluids prior to providing a sample, they do so at their own risk. The DCO should also advise the athlete not to hydrate excessively, since this might delay the production of a suitable sample.What kind of information accompanies the urine and/or blood sample to the lab? Whether it's an in-competition or out-of-competition test, every athlete sample sent to a WADA-accredited laboratory includes an abbreviated copy of the DCOR and Declaration of Use documentation, which does NOT include the athlete's name. The information on the laboratory copy of the DCOR and Declaration of Use contains: Athlete gender The type of test (in-competition or out-of-competition) The athlete's sport and discipline The type of the sample (urine, blood) and required laboratory information on the sample (volume, specific gravity, time sealed) The sample code number that matches the numbers on the sample collection kit Medications and supplements taken within the previous seven days The name of the testing authority, sample collection authority, and results management authority40 41 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKBecause of the anonymous sample code number, there is no way for the lab to identify which athlete provided the sample.What happens to my sample? To help ensure a level playing field globally, elite athletes participate in no-notice, in-competition and out-of-competition urine and blood testing in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) International Standards. The sample collection and analysis process are designed to ensure security of the sample during and after collection, as well as sample anonymity during the analysis process. Now that you've seen what happens to a sample, it's important to remember that the entire process is based on robust international standards that are designed to protect athletes' rights and ensure accuracy and anonymity.The Doping Control Officer (DCO) is responsible for managing the sample collection process to protect the integrity of the sample throughout the collection process.If a sample screens positive for a prohibited substance or method, the lab will always perform robust and targeted confirmation procedures using the A sample. A minimum of two scientists certify all positive tests before delivering a report. Following the collection process, samples are shipped to a laboratory in the global network of WADA- accredited laboratories, which all operate independently of sample collection agenciesFor deterrence purposes, anti- doping agencies may also request that the lab keep frozen samples beyond the required period of three months, and even up to 10 years. A sample can be reanalyzed at any time using new, state-of-the-art detection methods.The lab then securely stores the B sample and completes preparation procedures for the A sample analysis. After the sample arrives at the lab, it's inspected for any evidence of tampering or leaking that may impact the integrity of the sample.The DCO first notifies the athlete and initiates the sample collection session.After analysis is completed, the lab reports the results to the results management authority. Only authorized commercial couriers are used. Samples can also be retained for anonymous research with the athlete's consent. Then, lab technicians open the A bottle and remove small volumes of the sample for specific analysis procedures. These procedures screen for the presence of prohibited substances, their metabolites, or the markers that indicate the use of a prohibited substance or method. The DCO is responsible for observing the athlete as they provide a sample, assisting with paperwork, and instructing the athlete on how to divide and securely seal the sample into A & B parts. All athletes are also afforded the right to have their B sample analyzed in the event of a positive test. Athletes may attend the B sample opening and analysis in person, or appoint a representative. Alternatively, athletes can waive their right to have their B sample analyzed. Sometimes there are special sample transport requirements to ensure the stability of the sample, such as temperature control for blood samples. Otherwise, sample labels are destroyed, and the samples disposed of, after the required three-month storage period.Because of the large number of substances and methods on the WADA Prohibited List, analysis requires extremely sensitive instruments that can detect substances and metabolites in a sample down to parts per billion amounts. That's less than a sugar cube being added to an Olympic size swimming pool!

SAMPLE DISPOSAL 742 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 43 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKSECTION TAKEAWAYS Athletes are subject to testing in both in-competition and out-of-competition periods. Athlete testing is based on strategic planning and criteria. Athlete's may be required to provide a urine sample (90 mL), a blood sample (venous and/or DBS), or both urine and blood samples. Once the sample has been analyzed by a WADA accredited laboratory, the athlete should expect notification from USADA stating the analysis has been completed. Modifications to the sample collection process may be made for athletes with disabilities. Athletes are expected to know and understand their rights and responsibilities. ATHLETE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Athletes have a number of rights and responsibilities related to doping control. These rights and responsibilities are essentially the same for both in-competition and out-of-competition testing. When selected for testing, athletes have the right to: Have a representative accompany the athlete throughout the doping control process Have an interpreter present, if one is available Complete a training session or other activities while the DCO or notifying chaperone observes the athlete (out-of-competition) Have the testing procedures explained to the athlete, including how the sample collection equipment works Request to view the DCO's credentials Choose a collection vessel and sample collection kit Receive a copy of the sample collection documentation used to document the processing of the athlete's sample Provide feedback on the USADA Athlete Evaluation Form and/or a Supplementary Report Form Request a delay in reporting to the doping control station for valid reasons (in-competition testing) Request modifications if the athlete has a disabilityDuring a test, athletes are responsible for: Complying with the sample collection procedure* Reporting immediately to the doping control station unless there are approved reasons for delay Presenting government issued photo identification at the time of notification Staying in direct observation of the DCO or notifying chaperone from the time of notification until the sample collection session is complete Keeping the collection vessel in their possession and in view of the DCO at all times** Having control of the sample until it is sealed in the sample collection bottles (the DCO may assist upon request)** Ensuring the sample code number is correctly documented on the sample collection documentation Ensuring all appropriate sample collection documentation is accurate, complete, and signed * NOTE: As defined by the Code: Evading Sample collection; or refusing or failing to submit to Sample collection without compelling justification after notification by a duly authorized Person is an anti-doping rule violation; tampering or attempted tampering shall include, without limitation, offering or accepting a bribe to perform or fail to perform an act, preventing the collection of a Sample, affecting or making impossible the analysis of a Sample, falsifying documents submitted to an Anti-Doping Organization or TUE committee or hearing panel, procuring false testimony from witnesses, committing any other fraudulent act upon the Anti-Doping Organization or hearing body to affect Results Management or the imposition of Consequences, and any other similar intentional interference or Attempted interference with any aspect of Doping Control. ** If an athlete provides a partial sample, the DCO will retain control of the sealed partial sample.44 45 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKHow to Submit Whereabouts Information Athletes can use USADA's online system to submit Whereabouts filings. USADA will provide athletes with a username and password to access the online Whereabouts system. For questions about updates, or username or password issues, call Athlete Express at (719) 785-2000 or toll-free at (866) 601- 2632, Login to Athlete Express at USADA.org Athlete Express App: Update Whereabouts instantly through the mobile app Phone: Text updates to text@USADA.org Email: Send an email with updates to update@USADA.org Quarterly Filing Deadlines Whereabouts filings must be submitted quarterly (every three months). Deadlines for submitting Whereabouts filings are: December 15 for the first quarter (beginning January 1) March 15 for the second quarter (beginning April 1) June 15 for the third quarter (beginning July 1) September 15 for the fourth quarter (beginning October 1) Whereabouts Updates If an RTP athlete's schedule changes during the quarter, they must submit an update as soon as possible. For example, if an athlete will be in a location different from what they provided on their quarterly Whereabouts filing, such as traveling for a competition, they must submit an update. Access to an athlete's Whereabouts account is located at athlete.USADA.org. RTP WHEREABOUTS REQUIREMENTS Providing timely and accurate Whereabouts information is vitally important to ensure USADA can provide the best anti-doping program. It is critical that RTP athletes file their Whereabouts by each deadline, update their Whereabouts information when plans change, and make sure that they are available at the locations and times specified on their Whereabouts updates. What constitutes a Whereabouts Failure? A Whereabouts Failure is a Filing Failure or a Missed Test. In addition to an initial notice (see below), Whereabouts Failures are listed on the athlete website when an athlete logs into their account. How could an athlete receive a Missed Test? RTP athletes could receive a Missed Test if they are unavailable during the 60-minute time slot at the location specified on their Whereabouts filing or update.Athletes who have been identified and notified of their inclusion in the USADA Registered Testing Pool (RTP) are responsible for maintaining current and accurate Whereabouts information at all times. This Whereabouts information is used to facilitate out-of-competition testing, which is critical to an effective anti-doping program. Providing thorough, accurate Whereabouts information helps USADA provide athletes with the best anti-doping program possible. How will an athlete know if they are in USADA's RTP? The RTP selection criteria is established by USADA. Athletes will receive an email notification from USADA if they are in the RTP, as well as notices about when they need to provide Whereabouts. How long may an athlete be subject to the requirements of the RTP? If an athlete no longer meets the requirements to be included in the RTP, or has provided written notification of their retirement to USADA, their National Governing Body (NGB), and their International Federation (IF), they will be notified via email of their pool removal and the date on which they no longer need to provide Whereabouts information. RTP WHEREABOUTS REQUIREMENTS Under the International Standard for Testing and Investigations (ISTI) and the USADA Whereabouts Policy, if an athlete is in the USADA RTP, they are responsible for informing USADA of their Whereabouts. It is required that they submit accurate and complete quarterly Whereabouts filings and ongoing updates so that USADA can locate them for testing. To ensure compliance with Whereabouts requirements, athletes must: File accurate and complete Whereabouts. \u2014 Complete Whereabouts filings include: daily overnight residence, training locations and times, competitions, other regularly-scheduled activities, such as school and/or work locations, AND a daily 60-minute window (between 5 a.m. and 11 p.m.). Update their Whereabouts as soon as their plans change (don't wait until the last minute, or until after arrival at a new location). Athletes also need to delete old locations when adding a new location.USADA REGISTERED TESTING POOLUSADA WHEREABOUTS PROGRAM To maximize testing resources and minimize the burden on athletes, USADA has created a Registered Testing Pool (RTP) and a Clean Athlete Program (CAP). Athletes in the two pools are subject to different Whereabouts requirements and compliance criteria. The following sections outline the different requirements for each pool. At least once a year, an athlete in either pool must also complete Athlete's Advantage\u00ae, an online education tutorial that provides information related to anti-doping requirements for RTP and CAP athletes. Athletes must complete the tutorial prior to submitting Whereabouts information.46 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK3 12INTHREE WHEREABOUTS FAILURES IN 12 MONTHS WILL BE A VIOLATIONREMEMBERREMEMBERHow could an athlete receive a Filing Failure? An RTP athlete may receive a Filing Failure if: A quarterly Whereabouts filing has not been submitted to USADA by the specified deadline Whereabouts information has not been updated in a timely manner Whereabouts information is inaccurate or too incomplete to reasonably locate the athlete for testing How will an RTP athlete be notified of a Whereabouts Failure? RTP athletes should be sent initial notice* via email of an apparent Whereabouts Failure no later than 14 days after the discovery of the Whereabouts Failure. Athletes can also choose to have a secondary contact receive notification of their Whereabouts Failure(s). After notice is received, athletes will be responsible for subsequent Whereabouts Failures, regardless of whether the subsequent failure involves the same type of Whereabouts Failure or a different type of Whereabouts Failure. For example, an athlete whose first failure resulted from a failure to file Whereabouts by the deadline will also be held responsible for a second failure whether it is related to the continued failure to file by the subsequent deadline, or another Missed Test or Filing Failure. Athletes have the opportunity to provide a response to the initial letter and explain their actions in writing within 14 days of the initial notification. If a response is received, USADA will review the response and make a final determination within 14 days of receipt of the response, provided no additional investigation is necessary. The athlete is then notified* of the final decision. If no response is provided by the athlete, the initial decision will be upheld and the athlete will be notified.* If the athlete chooses to contest the final determination of a Whereabouts Failure, they can request an administrative review, in writing, within 14 days of the final notification letter. WADA and each International Federation (IF) also have a right to appeal USADA's final Whereabouts Failure decisions. * The USOPC and an athletes' NGB are copied on all correspondence. WADA and an athlete's IF also have access to all Whereabouts Failure information.When can an RTP athlete be tested? An athlete in the Registered Testing Pool can be tested at any time during the day, even outside their 60-minute time slot. How many Whereabouts Failures make an athlete ineligible? An athlete could be subject to an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) should they accumulate three Whereabouts Failures in any rolling 12-month period. Please note that any combination of three Missed Tests and/or Filing Failures declared by any Anti-Doping Organization or an International Federation may constitute an ADRV. An ADRV could lead to ineligibility, which means the athlete would be banned for a specific period of time (up to two years for a first violation) from participating in any competition or other activity authorized by an NGB or the USOPC. For a complete copy of the Whereabouts Failure Policy, visit USADA's website at USADA.org/whereabouts. 4748 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 49 Athletes must submit updates to USADA if their schedule changes. Heading out of town? Update USADA immediately! Even if an athlete doesn't know the address or exact details, update USADA with the city, state, and other available location information and provide additional information as soon as it becomes available. Athletes often receive a Whereabouts Failure when they wait to update until they are at the airport, on the plane, or after they arrive at their destination. Update before leaving! Make sure to add travel days when updating a schedule and delete outdated locations. If an athlete moves or changes their primary residence or training facility, they need to update their Whereabouts filing. Athletes need to provide an accurate overnight location for every day they are required to submit Whereabouts. Whereabouts Failures often occur when DCOs attempt to test an athlete at home, but the DCO learns the athlete was actually at a training facility, work, or out of town. Athletes should remember to provide all required Whereabouts information on their Whereabouts filing and in subsequent updates! When updating information, make sure to delete any information that is no longer accurate. It is an athlete's responsibility to update USADA any time their schedule changes from the information submitted on their quarterly Whereabouts filing, even if the task of updating has been delegated to someone else.Who may be included in the RTP? Athletes in their International Federation's Registered Testing Pool. Athletes identified by USADA for inclusion. Athletes who failed to comply with expectations while in the Clean Athlete Program. Sanctioned athletes. Athletes returning from retirement. What are the Whereabouts requirements for RTP athletes? File quarterly Whereabouts by the following deadlines: March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15. Required information includes: athletes' daily overnight location, training locations and times, competitions, other regularly-scheduled activities, such as school and/or work locations, AND a daily 60-minute window. Keep Whereabouts information updated as locations and schedules change. How are athletes located for out-of-competition testing? A DCO will use Whereabouts to make a reasonable attempt to locate an athlete. A DCO may, but is not required to, call an athlete to confirm their location. Athletes may be tested at any time, even outside of their 60-minute time slot. Athletes must be at the indicated location during the entire 60-minute time slot. What happens if athletes fail to comply with RTP Whereabouts requirements? Athletes in the RTP are subject to Whereabouts Failures. An athlete may be issued a Filing Failure for failing to file required information, failing to file by the specified deadline, providing inaccurate or insufficient information, or being unavailable for testing at a listed location. A Missed Test may be issued if an athlete is unavailable for testing during the 60-minute time slot. Three Whereabouts Failures (Filing Failures and/or Missed Tests) in a 12-month period is considered an anti-doping rule violation.USADA CLEAN ATHLETE PROGRAM Athletes who have been identified and notified that they are part of the Clean Athlete Program (CAP) will be subject to limited Whereabouts requirements as part of USADA's strategic testing plan, which in part, is designed to make Whereabouts requirements for athletes proportional to testing. How will an athlete know if they are in USADA's CAP? The CAP selection criteria are established by USADA. Athletes will receive an email notification from USADA if they are in the CAP. How long may an athlete be subject to the requirements of the CAP? If an athlete no longer meets the requirements to be included in the CAP, or has provided written notification of their retirement to USADA, their NGB, and their International Federation (IF), they will be notified of their removal and will no longer be subject to CAP Whereabouts requirements.USADA REGISTERED TESTING POOL (RTP) SUMMARY RTP WHEREABOUTS TIPS50 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 51 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKWho may be included in the CAP? Athletes who are selected for a national team or are representing Team USA at international competition. Athletes identified by USADA for inclusion. Athletes with specific competition results. Athletes who have returned from retirement. What are the CAP requirements? File a Whereabouts summary twice per year by the following deadlines: June 15 and December 15. Required information includes: a primary overnight residence, training location(s) and typical times of training, and details regarding upcoming competitions. Ensure basic summary information is accurate at all times. \u2014 For example, if an athlete moves from their home location to college, they need to update their summary. Or if an athlete usually trains at a specific gym but stops training at that location and switches to a different training location, this would require an update. Do CAP athletes file Whereabouts changes? CAP athletes do NOT notify USADA when their schedule changes and they do NOT file a 60-minute time slot. However, CAP athletes are required to submit updates to their Whereabouts if their primary overnight residence or typical training locations change for a significant amount of time. What happens if CAP athletes aren't compliant? CAP athletes who fail to file Whereabouts summary information by the deadlines will be notified that they are being moved to the RTP for a minimum of nine months. CAP athletes who are unavailable for testing due to inaccurate Whereabouts summary information and fail to subsequently update Whereabouts summary information will be notified that they are being moved to the RTP for a minimum of nine months. Unlike athletes in the RTP, CAP athletes are NOT subject to Whereabouts Failures.CAP WHEREABOUTS REQUIREMENTS To ensure compliance with CAP Whereabouts requirements, athletes must: File an accurate and complete Whereabouts summary twice per year. Provide the following in their CAP Whereabouts summary : a primary overnight residence, training location(s) and typical times of training, and details regarding upcoming competitions. Ensure basic summary information is accurate at all times. How to Submit Whereabouts Summary Information Athletes can use USADA's online system to submit Whereabouts summary filings. USADA will provide athletes with a username and password to access the online Whereabouts system. For questions about Whereabouts information, or username or password issues, call Athlete Express at (719) 785-2000 or toll- free at (866) 601- 2632, athleteexpress@USADA.org.

Deadlines for submitting Whereabouts summaries are: December 15 for the first and second quarters June 15 for the third and fourth quarters CAP Whereabouts Updates CAP athletes do NOT need to notify USADA of daily schedule changes and they do NOT need to file a 60-minute time slot. Other than filing a Whereabouts summary twice per year, CAP members will only be required to provide updates if their basic summary information becomes inaccurate. For example, if an athlete moves from their home location to college, they need to update the primary overnight residence on their Whereabouts summary. CAP Whereabouts Compliance Unlike RTP athletes, CAP athletes are NOT subject to Whereabouts Failures. However, CAP athletes who fail to file accurate Whereabouts summary information by the deadlines will be notified that they are being moved to the RTP for a minimum of nine months. Similarly, CAP members will be moved to the RTP for a minimum of nine months if they are unavailable for testing due to inaccurate Whereabouts summary information and subsequently fail to update their Whereabouts summary information. See the RTP section to learn more about RTP Whereabouts requirements.USADA CLEAN ATHLETE PROGRAM (CAP) SUMMARY53 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKResults management is the process that begins when USADA receives the results of a urine or blood test from a laboratory, or receives information about a possible anti-doping rule violation (ADRV). In total, results management encompasses the initial review and notification of potential ADRVs, the enforcement of provisional suspensions, any assertion of anti-doping rule violations and the proposed consequences, and any related hearing processes. USADA is responsible for the results management and adjudication process for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic movement in the United States. To facilitate that process, USADA utilizes its Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing (the Protocol). The objective of the Protocol is to provide a process that: Is fair to athletes and others Has international credibility Provides for a full evidentiary hearing with the right of appeal Eliminates the conflicts that could arise from NGBs directly sanctioning their own members 52 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATIONS (ADRVS) Doping, as defined by the Code, is the occurrence of one or more of the following anti-doping rule violations (ADRV): Presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete's sample, or simply put, a positive test Use or attempted use by an athlete of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method Evading, refusing, or failing to submit to sample collection without compelling justification after being notified by an authorized person Violation of applicable requirements regarding athlete availability for out-of-competition testing, including failure to file required Whereabouts information and Missed Tests \u2014 Any combination of three Missed Tests and/or Filing Failures, as defined in the International Standard for Testing and Investigations, within a 12-month period by an athlete in a Registered Testing Pool Tampering or attempted tampering with any part of doping control. For example, procuring false testimony from witnesses, or falsifying documents submitted to an anti-doping organization. Possession of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method Trafficking or attempted trafficking of any prohibited substance or prohibited method Administration or attempted administration to any athlete in-competition of any prohibited substance or prohibited method, or administration or attempted administration to any athlete out-of-competition of any prohibited substance or any prohibited method that is prohibited out-of-competition Complicity or attempted complicity: Assisting, encouraging, aiding, abetting, conspiring, covering up, or any other type of intentional complicity involving an anti-doping rule violation, or attempted anti-doping rule violation, or a violation of a period of ineligibility by another person Associating with coaches, trainers, physicians, or other athlete support personnel who are sanctioned, criminally convicted, and/or professionally disciplined in relation to doping. Some examples of assistance include obtaining training, nutrition, or medical advice, and/or allowing the individual to serve as an agent or representative. To establish a violation, the anti-doping organization must establish the athlete knew of the athlete support person's disqualifying status. The anti-doping organization may, but is not required to, provide notice to the athlete of a support person's disqualifying status prior to initiating a case. To threaten, intimidate, or discourage a person from the good faith reporting of information relating to an ADRV, non-compliance with the Code, or other doping activity, are all considered violations, as well as retaliation against a person for making such a report ATHLETE RETIREMENT At some point in an athlete's career, they may make the decision to retire from ALL sport at the national and international level. When they are ready for retirement, there are steps that must be taken to make it official and to remove themselves from either of the testing pools. They must promptly inform USADA, their National Governing Body (NGB), and their International Federation (IF) in writing via mail or email that they are retiring. They should also check with their IF to determine if there are additional steps they need to follow to complete the retirement process. Until an athlete has finalized all of the necessary retirement steps, they are still subject to the requirements of an athlete in a USADA testing pool. If an athlete does not provide advance written notice of retirement and is notified for testing, but refuses to provide a sample for an out-of-competition test, this is a refusal to test. If the athlete refuses to provide a sample, they may be subject to an anti-doping rule violation and a four-year period of ineligibility. What if an athlete wants to come out of retirement and return to competition? Athletes are required to notify USADA and their IF, in writing, of their return from retirement and be in the RTP or CAP for at least six months before participating in any national or international events. At the start of the six months, athletes must submit Whereabouts and make themselves available to be tested. If they wish to seek an exemption from the six-month written notice rule, they may apply to WADA. NOTE: USADA will not suspend or terminate the prosecution of an anti-doping rule violation as a result of an athlete's subsequent retirement. RESULTS MANAGEMENT54 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 55Substances of Abuse WADA has identified a category of substances called Substances of Abuse, which are substances that are both prohibited in-competition and frequently abused in society outside of sport. Substances of Abuse include: Cocaine (S6. may still receive an anti-doping rule violation if they test positive for a Substance of Abuse. The designation of Substance of Abuse only affects the resolution of the case during the results management process, including the length of a resulting sanction. If an athlete tests positive for a Substance of Abuse and establishes that the use of that substance occurred out-of-competition and was unrelated to sport performance, the athlete's period of ineligibility will be reduced to three months with no need to further analyze the degree of fault. The period of ineligibility can be further reduced to one month if the athlete completes a substance of abuse treatment program that is approved by USADA. If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction or substance abuse, please reach out to the National Helpline by visiting the website at www.samhsa.gov or calling the confidential Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Specified and Non-Specified Substances and Methods While an ADRV generally carries a standard sanction of four years of ineligibility for a first violation and a loss of results, an athlete may receive a reduced sanction for an ADRV related to a \"Specified Substance.\" On the Prohibited List, the following are consider Non-Specified: Anabolic agents Peptide hormones, such as erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs) Growth hormone, growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRPs) and related substances, and mimetics Certain hormone and metabolic modulators, such as agents modifying myostatin function(s) and insulins Non-specified stimulants Any remaining substances on the WADA Prohibited List are considered Specified Substances. All prohibited methods are Non-Specified except methods of intravenous infusions and/or injections (M2.2), which are Specified Methods. Specified Substances and Methods should not in any way be considered less important or less dangerous than other doping substances or methods. Rather, they are substances and methods that are more likely to have been consumed or used by an athlete for a purpose other than the enhancement of sport performance. What is the notification process for test results? All laboratory results under USADA results management authority are sent to USADA and WADA. USADA provides notification of the test result to the athlete, the athlete's National Governing Body (NGB), the athlete's International Federation (IF), and the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC). The athlete's written notification will be sent via email, if an email address was provided during the test session. The results letter is also available through the athlete's online account. In general, athletes will receive their test results within six to eight weeks. What are the consequences if an athlete commits an ADRV? Sanctions on athletes may include, but are not limited to: Disqualification of results in a particular competition or event Forfeiture of any medals, points, and prizes Team disqualification and forfeiture Fines Loss of benefits, grants, awards, employment, and training facilities provided by the USOPC An ineligibility period that may vary according to circumstances Public announcement For more information on consequences of ADRVs, please refer to the Protocol at USADA.org/publications-policies. When are doping violations publicly announced? USADA publicly announces doping violations following the conclusion of its results management process or as otherwise provided in the applicable rules. USADA also announces aggregate data for all test results and arbitration outcomes on its website. USADA does not comment on cases in process; however, if an athlete or their representative publicly comments while their USADA case is pending, USADA may respond publicly by providing details about the athlete's case. What is an Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF)? An AAF is a report from a WADA-accredited laboratory that identifies the presence of a prohibited substance and/or its metabolites or markers in a sample. This is commonly referred to as a positive test. When one or more prohibited substances are detected in an athlete's A sample, USADA receives a report from the laboratory and then issues a notice to the athlete, the athlete's NGB, the USOPC, the athlete's IF, and WADA. The athlete has the option to proceed with the B sample analysis at the lab if they choose, and they and/or their representatives have the right to attend the processing of the B sample. Once USADA receives the B sample analysis, a copy is sent to the athlete, NGB, USOPC, IF, and WADA. What is a Non-Analytical Case? Unlike an AAF, a non-analytical case does not stem from a positive urine or blood sample, but instead originates from, and is substantiated by, other evidence of doping or violations by an athlete or athlete support personnel. For example, an ADRV that is considered non-analytical may stem from an investigation based on a confidential tip to a hotline. Non-analytical ADRVs can be important because these types of cases and investigations have led to the discovery of large performance-enhancing drug (PED) trafficking operations, as well as the use of new designer drugs or doping methods that are harder to detect through testing. These types of cases, which are built on evidence other than a positive drug test, are called \"non-analytical\" cases because they do not start with laboratory analysis of a sample. 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK56 57 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKUSADA TESTING AND RESULTS MANAGEMENT PROCESS RESEARCH TESTINGEDUCATION Athletes in the U.S. are supported by a gold standard testing process aimed at detecting and deterring doping, following the worldwide harmonized practices for testing and results management. At the same time, significant efforts in education are undertaken to prevent doping in future generations and investment in research is committed to advance anti-doping science. SAMPLE COLLECTION Two types of testing: \u2014 In-competition and out-of-competition (no advance notice) Athletes are subject to both urine and blood collection for analysis. LABORATORY ANALYSIS Samples are collected and processed, sent to WADA-accredited labs for analysis, and may be stored for up to 10 years for possible retesting as new testing detection methods are developed. NO ADVERSE ANALYTICAL FINDING - No prohibited substances detected. - Notice is sent to the athlete, the athlete's National Governing Body (NGB), and U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC). - No further action taken. ADVERSE ANALYTICAL FINDING - One or more prohibited substances detected in sample; USADA receives adverse analytical finding A sample lab report. - Notice of finding sent to athlete, NGB, USOPC, athlete's International Federation (IF), and WADA. - Athlete has the option to proceed with the B sample analysis at the lab. Athlete and/or athlete's representative has the right to attend processing of B sample. - B sample finding received by USADA and copy is sent to athlete, NGB, IF, WADA, and USOPC. NO ANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATION - Athlete, NGB, IF, WADA, and USOPC receive notification. ANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATION (ADRV) Acceptance of Sanction: \u2014 Athlete can choose to accept a sanction at any point during the results management process. Request for Hearing: \u2014 Athlete exercises right to request a hearing before independent arbitral body or, if athlete, USADA, and WADA agree, to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). - If initial hearing not heard at CAS, athlete, USADA, IF, and WADA have right to appeal hearing decision to CAS. - C AS ruling is final. Public announcements made for athletes accepting a sanction and for hearing decisions finding a violation of the anti-doping rules.RESULTS MANAGEMENT 58 59 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKINVESTIGATIONS The WADA International Standard for Testing and Investigations (ISTI) is a set of mandatory policies and procedures that require USADA and other Anti-Doping Organizations (ADOs) around the world to develop and maintain the ability to gather and process intelligence from analytical and non-analytical information. This knowledge allows ADOs to rule out the possibility of anti-doping rule violations (ADRVs), or to initiate investigations if there is evidence a potential violation has been committed. While investigations have been a part of ADO procedures long before the ISTI went into effect, these standards for collaboration between ADOs and law enforcement place an even greater emphasis on intelligence gathering from all available resources. Many of USADA's investigations stem from tips left on its Play Clean Tip Line. In addition to ensuring that tips can be submitted anonymously, USADA handles all tips in a secure and systematic manner to ensure their reliability, relevance, and accuracy. Through its Play Clean Tip Center, USADA makes available a number of channels to report the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs in sport, which can help protect clean athletes and promote clean competition. PLAY CLEAN TIP CENTER: Call: (877) 752-9253 Text: 87232 (\"USADA\") powered by RealResponse. If reporting a tip from outside the United States, PRINCIPLES Undertake vigorous investigation of potential rule violations. Code Arts. 5.7, 7.2, 20.5.7; ISTI Arts. 12.2; USADA Protocol Secs. 2, 4, 6; ISRM Annexes A and B. Investigation takes place whenever there is a reasonable cause to suspect that an anti-doping rule violation may have been committed. Code Art. 20.5.7; ISTI Art. 12.2.1; USADA Protocol Sec. 2. The goal of each investigation is reliable evidence. Code Art. 3.2.; ISTI Arts. 11.3.1, 12.2.2. Each investigation is conducted fairly, objectively, and impartially. ISTI Art. 12.2.2. \"Integrity\" is an important principle in USADA investigations. For example, USADA is always truthful with witnesses and respondents and does not claim to have incriminating evidence that it does not have. USADA will never harass or intimidate witnesses or respondents in the course of its work with athletes. USADA goes into each investigation with an open mind and simply follows the facts. It is only after it becomes apparent that an anti-doping rule violation has occurred that USADA starts to build a case. USADA's strict conflict of interest policy also applies to its investigations. USADA will not attempt to persuade other organizations to withhold rights or property from an athlete unless such an action is permitted by the rules of that organization. All persons interviewed by USADA during the course of an investigation will be treated with dignity and respect. All reasonably available investigative resources may be used to conduct investigations. ISTI Art. 12.2.3; USADA Protocol Sec. 2. The Code does not allow USADA to exercise \"prosecutorial discretion\" and decide to take no action in cases where the evidence indicates that an anti-doping rule violation has occurred. USADA can, however, prioritize the use of its resources. Our highest-priority investigations are those that: a) relate to athletes or other persons who would otherwise represent the United States at the Olympic Games, Pan American Games, or World Championships; b) have the potential to involve doping by multiple athletes through the involvement of athlete support personnel; or c) potentially involve the use of prohibited substances or prohibited methods that are more difficult to detect through the analysis of urine or blood samples. Athlete and Athlete Support Personnel Cooperation. Code Article 21 requires all athletes and athlete support personnel to cooperate with USADA investigations into anti-doping rule violations. In particular, USADA has found that the cooperation of clean athletes is crucial to maintaining a level playing field in their sport. Code Art. 21; ISTI Art 12.2.4; USADA Protocol Sec. 5(b)(iii). Each investigation protects and upholds the established rights of athletes, athlete support personnel and other persons set forth in the Code, USADA Protocol, ISTI 60 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 61 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKand ISPPPI. Prior to initiating an interview with a U.S. athlete as to whom USADA has and/or expresses any specific suspicion committed an Anti-Doping Rule Violation, USADA will advise the athlete: that USADA is investigating potential anti-doping rule violations, which is a serious matter; that USADA's Investigation Principles and Athlete Interview Responsibilities govern the interview and all interactions with USADA, providing URLs for both documents on USADA's website; and that the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (\"USOPC\") Athlete Ombuds is available as a resource if the athlete has questions. The applicability of these Principles to USADA investigations and the opportunity for athletes to contact the USOPC Athlete Ombuds will be made clear in USADA's educational materials for athletes. USADA may, in its discretion, provide the same advice where no specific suspicion exists. Each investigation is conducted independently of outside operational control. Code Art. 20.5.1. Discussions regarding substantial assistance and sanctions with potential witnesses follow the requirements set forth in Article 10.7.1 of the Code and Articles 5.1.2.1, 5.3.2.1, 7.1 and 9.2.1 of the ISRM. USADA cooperates with and seeks the cooperation of government agencies as provided in the Code. Code Arts. 20.5.3 and 22.2. Each investigation will also follow all applicable state and federal laws. A USADA decision to assert an anti-doping rule violation based on non-analytical evidence is subject to the hearing and appeal process set out in the Code and USADA Protocol. Any decision by USADA not to bring a case forward as a result of an investigation or to impose a sanction on an athlete or other person is always reviewable by both WADA and the relevant International Federation. Code Art. 13.2.3; USADA Protocol Sec. 15(c). If WADA believes that USADA has taken too long to render a decision in a particular investigation, WADA may elect to appeal directly to the Court of Arbitration for Sport as if USADA had rendered a decision finding no anti-doping rule violation. Code Art. 13.3. Anti-doping rule violation decisions arising out of USADA Olympic and Paralympic Movement investigations are also ultimately subject to review on the merits through established legal processes including an independent arbitration process and a CAS appeal process. Code Arts. 8, 13; USADA Protocol Sec. 17. Any claim that USADA has failed to follow these Principles shall be addressed as a contract issue between USADA and the USOPC and shall not be admissible or used as a defense in any anti- doping rule violation proceedings. USADA-INITIATED U.S. ATHLETE INTERVIEW RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES U.S. Athletes shall have the following rights and obligations in connection with all USADA matters which are subject to the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing. 1. An athlete may consult with the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (\"USOPC\") Athlete Ombuds, counsel, and/or other representatives before participating in an interview with USADA. The USOPC Athlete Ombud is completely independent of USADA and available to offer cost-free, confidential, and independent advice regarding anti-doping policies and procedures. The Athlete Ombuds may be reached by telephone at (719) 866-5000, by email at ombudsman@usathlete.org or through the website www.usathlete.org. 2. An athlete may have counsel or another who is not an athlete support person (or an athlete support person reasonably acceptable to USADA) present during the USADA interview. 3. An athlete may request that the interview be recorded or transcribed at the athlete's expense. USADA also has the right to record or transcribe the interview at its expense. 4. An athlete is not required to travel to meet USADA for an interview. Should an athlete choose not to travel to the interview, it may be conducted by telephone, video conference, or, at USADA's option, USADA will travel to the location of the athlete for an in-person interview. 5. Any athlete who USADA seeks to interview is required to cooperate and be truthful with USADA. (Code Art. 21.1.6; ISTI 12.2.4) 6. An athlete's failure to cooperate or participate in a requested interview may result in disciplinary action under the rules of an International Federation, Major Event Organization, or other Anti- Doping Organization. A failure to be truthful may result in a tampering or attempted tampering anti-doping rule violation. (Code Arts. 2.5 and 21.1.6; ISTI 12.2.4). 7. Failure to cooperate in a USADA investigation or failure to appear if requested to give hearing testimony may be used against an athlete in an anti-doping rule violation hearing. (Code Art. 3.2.5) 8. Where an athlete has committed an anti- doping rule violation, the period of ineligibility otherwise applicable for that violation may be reduced if the athlete: comes forward and admits the violation to USADA before receiving notice of a Sample collection which could establish an anti-doping rule violation or other notice (Code Art. 10.7.2), promptly admits the violation after being notified of the violation by USADA (Code Arts. 10.8.1 and 10.8.2), or provides substantial assistance to USADA as recognized in Code Art. 10.7.1.62 63 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOK 2023 CLEAN SPORT HANDBOOKUSADA RESOURCES Need help?
