The ten-day timely notice period is also used to determine whet her benefits are to continue if a request for a hearing is filed during the timely notice pe riod. Therefore, if the ten-da y timely notice period ends on a week- end or holiday, the ten-day period for filing a request will be extended to the nex t full work day. 9006.2 Adequate Notice The notice is considered adequate when: 1) It is in writing; 2) It is a clear expression of the proposed action;3) It explains the proposed act ion and the reasons for it;TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE3 4) It explains that the household has a right to r equest a fair hearing; 5) It gives a telephone number and the name of a person to conta ct for further information; 6) It notifies the household of the circumstances under which th e benefits may continue; 7) It notifies the household of i ts liability for any overissuan ce received while awaiting a fair hearing if the final hearing decision is adverse to the household; 8) It notifies the household of t he availability of free legal s ervices. 9006.3 Exempti ons From Notice [273.13(b)]Do not provide individual not ices of adverse action when: 1) The State initiates a ma ss change (see DSSM 9086); 2) The Division determines, based on reliable information, that all members o f a household have died or that the household has moved from t he project area ; 3) The household has been receiving an increased allotment to re store lost benefits, the restoration is complete, and the household was previously not ified in writing of when the al lotment would terminate; 4) The household's allotment vari es from month to month within t he certification period to take into account changes which were anticipated at the time of certif ication and the hou sehold was so notified at t he time of certification; 5) The household jointly applied for TANF/ GA/RCA and food stamp benefits and has been receiving food stamp benefits pending the approval of the TANF/GA/RCA grant and was notified at the time of cert ification that food stamp benefits would be reduced upon approval of the TANF\\GA grant; 6) A household member is disqualif ied for intentional Program vi olation in accordance with DSSM 2023, or the benefits of the remaining household members are reduced or term inated to reflect the disqualification of that household member. The notice requirements for individuals or households a ffected by intentional Program violation disqualifications are explained in DSSM 2023. 7) DSS has assigned a longer certification period to a household certified on an expedited basis and for whom verification was postponed, provided the household has received written notice that the receipt of benefits beyond the month of application is contingent on its providing the postpon ed verification and that DSS may act on the verified information without further notice as provided in DSSM 9041. 8) DSS must change the household's benefits back to the original benefit level as required in DSSM 9085. 9) DSS is terminating the eligibility of a resident of a drug or alcoholic treatment center or a group living arrangement if the facility loses either its certification from DHSS or has its status as an authorized representative suspended due to FN S disqualifying it as a retailer.

If the household d oes not provide a written reques t, send the household a letter confirming the voluntary withdrawal. Written information does not entail the same right s as a notice of adverse action except that the household may request a fair hearing. 12) DSS determines, based on reliable information, that the hous ehold will not be residing in the project area and, therefore, will be unable to o btain its next allotment. Inform the household of its termination no later than its next schedul ed issuance date. Do not delay terminating the household's partici pation in order to pro vide advance notice. If the following conditions are met, dispense with the timely n otice requirement in DSSM 9006.2 . However, the household must be notified tha t its benefits will be reduced or terminated no later than the date the household receives, or would have received its allotment: a) The household reports the infor mation which results in the re duction or termination. b) The reported information is in writing. Information reported on a TANF monthly report form will satisfy this requirement. c) Based solely upon the household's written information, DSS ca n determine the household's allotment or ineligibility. d) The household retains its right to a fair hearing.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE4 e) The household retains its right to continued benefits by requ esting a fair hearing within the time period provided by the notice of adverse action. f) The Division continues the hou sehold's previous benefit level , if required, within five working days of the household's request for a fair hearing. 11 DE Reg. 795 (12/01/07) 9007 Citizenship and Alien Status 9007.1 Citizenship and Alien Status [7 CFR 273.4] The following residents of the Un ited States (U.S.) are eligibl e to participate in the Food Stamp Program based on their citizenship or alien status: A.

A parent or sp ouse quarter is not creditable if the parent or spouse received any Federal means-tested benefits or actually received food sta mps in that quarter. If an alien earns the 40 th quarter of coverage before applying for food stamps or any other Federal m eans-tested benefit in that same quarter, all that quarter counts toward the 40 qualifying quarters total. b.

Lawfully in U.S. in a qua lified status for five years; m. Immigrants who are victims of severe trafficking in persons p er Public Law 106-386 Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Severe fo rms of trafficking in persons is defined as sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person in duced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age; or the recruitment, harborin g, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the useTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE6 of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to i nvoluntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Victims of trafficking are issued T visas by U.S. Immigration a nd Citizenship Services. The Trafficking Victims Protectio n Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2003 expanded eligibility to include the minor children, spouses, and in s ome cases the parents and sibl ings of victims of severe traf ficking. Under TVPRA, eligible relatives of trafficking victims are entitled to visas designat ed as T-2, T-3, T-4 or T-5 (known as Derivative T Visas) and ar e eligible for foo d stamps like the direct victims of severe traf ficking. If an alien is awarded a T visa and was under the age of 21 yea rs on the date the T visa application was filed, the Derivative T Visas are available to the alien's spou se, children, unmarried siblings under 18 years of age, and parents. If an alien is awarded a T visa and was age of 21 years or olde r on the date the T Visa application was filed, the Derivative T Visas a re available to the alien's spou se and children. Adult victims of severe trafficking will be certified by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and will receive a certific ation letter. Children, those under 18 years of age, who are victims of severe trafficking do not need to be certifi ed but will receive a letter stating that the child is a victim o f a severe form of t rafficking. These v ictims of trafficking, and eligible relatives awarded a Derivative T V isa, are treated like refugees for food stamp purposes. Victims of trafficking do not have to hold a certain immigration status , but they need to be certified by HHS in order to receive food stamps. When a direct victim of a severe form of trafficking applies fo r benefits, DSS will follo w normal procedures for refugees e xcept DSS will: Accept the original certification letter or letter for children in place of INS document ation. Victims of severe forms of trafficking are not required to provide any documentat ion regarding immigrant status. (DO NOT CALL SAVE.) Call the trafficking verification line at (202) 401-5510 to con firm the validity of the certification letter or similar letter for children and to notify the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the benefits for which the individual ha s applied. Note the \"entry date\" for refugee benefit purposes. The individ ual \"entry date\" for refugee benefits purposes is the certification dat e, which appears in the body o f the certificat ion letter or le tter for children. Issue benefits to the same ext ent as a refugee, provided the vi ctim of a severe form of trafficking meets other program elig ibility criteria lik e income limits. Re-certification letters will used to confirm that the individu al continues to meet the certification requirements. These letters will have the same \"entry date\" as the original certification letters. The regular recertification periods will apply to these indivi duals in the sa me manner that they apply to refugees. When an eligible relative of a d irect victim of severe traffick ing applies for benefits: Accept the nonimmigrant T-2, T-3, T-4 or T-5 Derivative Visa an d follow the normal procedures for providing services and benefits to refugees. Call the toll-free trafficking verification line at 1 (866) 402 -5510 to notify ORR of the benefits for which the individual has applied. (NOTE: th e DHS Systematic Alien Verific ation for Entitlements (SAVE) system does not contain information about victims of a severe form of trafficking or no nimmigrant alien family members. DO NOT CONTACT SAVE concerning victims of trafficking or their nonimmigrant alien f amily members.) Issue benefits to the same extent as a refugee provided the Der ivative T Visa holder meets other program eligibility criteria like income. For an individual who is already present in the United States o n the date the Derivative T Visa is issued, the date of entry for food stamp purposes is the Notice Date on the I-797, Notice of Action of Approval of that individual Derivative T Visa. For an individual who enters the United States on the basis of a Derivative T Visa, the date of entry for food stamp purposes is the date of entry stamped on that individual passport or I-94 Arrival Record. 8 DE Reg. 1712 (6/1/05)10 DE Reg. 1702 (05/01/07) 12 DE Reg. 455 (10/01/08) 9007.2 Income and Resources The income and resources of an ineligible alien will be handled as outlined in DSSM 9076.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE7 9007.3 Reporting Illegal Aliens DSS Policy and Program Develop ment (PPDU) Unit will inform the local INS office whenever eligibility personnel knows for sure that an y member of a household is ineligible to receive food stamps because the member is present in the United States in vio lation of the Immigration and Nationality A ct. Caution must be exercised to ensure that the determination is n ot made merely on the alien' s inability or unwillingness to provide documentation of alien status. When a person indicat es inability or unwillingness to provide documentation of alien status, staff shall not continue efforts to obtain the do cumentation. That person shall be classified as an ineligible alien. Staff will obtain only th e documents necessary to provid e information on the income and resources of the ineligible alien to be made available to the remaining members of the hous ehold. This regulation does not permit the reporting of aliens to INS on mere suspicion of prejudice. Firm evidence that a household is illegally in the U.S. would be required. Two exam ples of circumstances when an alien would be reported to INS are: INS documents presented by the household during the application process are determined to be forged. A former order of deportation is presented by the household dur ing the application or recertification process. If a determination is made that a household, or household membe r, is in fact an illegal alien present in the United States in violation of the immigration laws, staff will report the det ermination to the supervisor. Th e supervisor will send a writte n report to the Food Stamp Polic y Administrator who will decide w hether the evidence is enoug h to make a re port to INS. 10 DE Reg. 1702 (05/01/07) 9008 Residency [7 CFR 273.3] Individuals must live in Delaware to get food benefits from thi s state. Filing Applications in Local Offices Individuals will file applications for benefits at local office s based on zip codes. However, any office will accept an application and consider it filed the same day. No Duplication of Benefits An individual cannot participate as a member of more than one h ousehold in any month. There is an exception for individuals who are residents of shelters for battered women an d children. Refer to DSSM 9080 for the rules for residents of shelters for battered women and children. No Durational Requirements There is no requirement for an individual to live in Delaware f or any specific length of time. A fixed residence is not required. Residency rules do not require intent to reside perma nently in Delaware. Migrant c ampsites meet the residency requirements. Non-Residents Individuals vacationing in Delaware are not considered as resid ents of this state. Moving Within the State When a household moves within th e state, DSS will transfer the household's case file to the new office. The household's certification period continues without having to re apply. The current office will act on changes in household circumstances resulting from the m ove before transferring the c ase file to the new office. Temporary Absences Out of State Households that temporarily leave the state, maintain their Del aware residency and intend to return can continue to receive benefits. This includes, but is not limited to, househo lds on vacation or taking care of a sick family member in another state. This does not include households that leave for military deployment or hospita lizations that will exceed 30 days.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE8 Homeless Households Homeless individual means an individual who lacks a fixed and r egular nighttime residence or an individual whose primary nighttime residence is: A supervised shelter designed to provide temporary accommodati ons (such as a welfare hotel or congregate shelter); A halfway house or similar inst itution that provides temporary residence for individuals intended to be institution- alized (applied to ind ividuals released from institutions who s till need supervision, not p risoners considered to be detained under a Federal or Stat e law while in a halfway house) ; A temporary accommodation in the residence of another individu al if the accommodation is for no more than 90 days. The 90-day period starts at app lication or when the household reports a change. The 90-day period starts over when a household moves from one residence to another. If a homeless household leaves, for whatever reason, and retur ns to the same residence, the 90-day period will start over again. If a household has a break in receiving food benefits, the 90- day period will not start over if the household remains in the same residence. The 90-day period will start ove r if the household moved to another residence. 12 DE Reg. 1326 (04/01/09) 9009 Disqualification for In tentional Program Violation [273.16] (See 2023 Disqualification for Intentional Program Violation fo r Food Stamps and TANF) 9010 Students [273.5] Any Student who is enrolled at l east half-time in an institutio n of higher education shall be i neligible to parti cipate in the Food Stamp Program unless the individual qualified for one of t he exemptions listed in DSSM 9010.1.

If no natural, adoptive or stepparent is in the food stamp hous ehold as the child, another full-time student in the same food stamp household may qualify for eligible student stat us if he or she has parent control over the child and is not living with his or her spouse. 11) Be assigned to or placed in an institution of higher educati on through or in compliance with the requirements of one of the following programs: a) A program under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA); b) The Food Stamp Employment and Training program; c) A program under Section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974;d) A State or local government employment and training program f or low-income households where one or more components of the program a re equivalent to the food stamp employment and training p rogram, determined by DSS. Self-initiated placements during the period of time the person is enrolled in one of these employment and training programs shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of the employment and training program in which the person is enrolled provided that the program has a co mponent for enrollment in an institution of higher education and that program accepts the placement. Persons who voluntarily participate in one of these employment and training programs and are placed in an institution of higher education through or in compliance with t he requirements of the program shall also qualify for the exemption. Ineligible students (i.e., those not meeting the requirements f or student participation in this section) are non-household members per DSSM 90 13.2 and cannot participate re gardless of with whom they live. The enrollment status of a student begins on the first day of t he school term of the institution of higher education. The enrollment shall be considered to continue thro ugh normal periods of class attendance, vacation and recesses, unless the student graduates, is suspended or expelle d, drops out, or does not int end to register for the next normal school term, excluding summer school. The income and resources of an in eligible student shall be hand led according to DSSM 9077.1. 9011 Restoration of Lost Benefits9011.1 Entitlement Restore to households benefits which were lost whenever the los s was caused by an error by the Division or by an administrative disqualification for intentional Program violati on which was subsequently reversed as specified in DSSM 9011.5, or if there is a statement elsewhere in the regulations specifically stating that the household is entitled to restora tion of lost benefits. Benefits will be restored for not more than twelve months prior to whichev er of the following occurred firs t: 1. The date DSS receives a request for restoration from a househ old; or 2. The date DSS is notified or oth erwise discovers that a loss t o a household has occurred. Restore to households benefits which were found by any judicial action to have been wrongfully withheld. If the judicial action is the first action the recipient has taken to obtain re storation of lost benefits, the n benefits will be restored for a period of not mor e than twelve months fro m the date the court a ction was initiated. When the judicial action is a review of an action taken by the Division, the benefits will be restored for a period of not more than twelve months from t he first of the following dates: 1. The date DSS receives a request for restoration; 2. If no request for restoration is received, the date the fair hearing action was initiated, but 3. Never more than one year from w hen DSS is notified of, or dis covers, the loss.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE10 9011.2 Errors Discove red by the Division If the Division determines that a loss of benefits has occurred , and the household is entitled to restoration of those benefits, automatically take action to restore any benefits tha t were lost. No action by the household is necessary. However, benefits will not be res tored if they were lost more t han 12 months before the loss was discovered by the Division or were lost more than 12 months before the Division was notifi ed in writing or orally of a possible loss to a specific household. Notify the household of its entitlement, the amount of benefits to be restored, any offsetting that was done, the method of restoration, and the ri ght to appeal through the fair hearing process if the household disagrees with any aspect of the proposed lost be nefit restoration. 9011.3 Disputed Benefits If the Division determines that a household is entitled to rest oration of lost benefits, but the household does not agree with the amount to be restored as calculated by the Division or any other action taken by the Division to restore lost benefits, the household may request a fair hearing within 90 da ys of the date the household is notified of its entitlement. I f a fair hearing is requested prior to or during the time lost be nefits are being restored, the household will receive the lost benefits as determined by the agency pending the results of the fair hearing. If the fair hearing decision is favorable to th e household, restore the lost benef its in accordance with that de cision. If a household believes it is entitled to restoration of lost b enefits but the Division after reviewing the case file does not agree, the household has 90 days from the date of the Division determination to request a fair hearing. Restore benefits to the household only if the fair hearing decision is favorable to the household. Benefits lost more than 12 months prior to the date the Division was initially informed of the household's pos sible entitlement to lost benefits will not be restored. 9011.4 Computing the Amount to be Restored After correcting the loss for fut ure months and excluding those months for which benefits may have been lost prior to the twelve month time limit, calculate the amount to be restore d as follows: 1. If the household was eligible but received an incorrect allot ment, the loss of benefits will be calculated only for those months the household participated. If the loss was cause d by an incorrect delay, denial, or termination of benefits, calculate the months affec ted by the loss as follows: a. If an eligible household's app lication was erroneously denied , calculate the loss beginning with the month of application. For an eligible household filing a timely re-appl ication, calculate the loss beginning with the month following the expiration of its certification period. b. If an eligible household's application is delayed, calculate the months for which benefi ts may have been lost in accordance with the procedures in DSSM 9040. c. If a household's benefits were erroneously terminated, the mo nth the loss initially occurred will be the first month in which benefits were not received as a result of the er roneous action. d. After computing the date the loss initially occurred, calcula te the loss for each month subsequent to that date until either the first month the error is corrected or the firs t month the household i s found ineligible. 2. For each month affected by the loss, determine if the househo ld was actually eligible. In cases where there is no information in the household's ca se file to document that the h ousehold was actually eligible, advise the household of what information must be provided to determine eligib ility for these months. For each month the household cannot provide the necessary informatio n to demonstrate its eligibility, the house hold will be consid ered ineligible. 3. For the months the household was eligible, calculate the allo tment it should have received. If the household received a smaller a llotment than it was e ligible to receive, t he difference between the actual and correct allotments equals the amount to be restored. 4. If a claim against a household is unpaid or held in suspense as provided in DSSM 7005, the amount to be restored will be offset against t he amount due on the claim before the b alance, if any, is restored to the household. At the point in time when the household is certified and receives an initial al lotment, the initial allotmen t will not be reduced to offset claims, even if the initial allotment is paid retroactively. Audit and Recovery Management Services processes all claim dete rminations. C onsequently, benefits will not be restored to any household until ARMS advises the DSS via Form 1 06, of any off-setting that is required due to outstanding claims. The procedure for effect ing benefit restorations is fo und in DSSM 7002.1. 9011.5 Lost Benefits to Individuals Disqualified for Intentiona l Program ViolationTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE11 Individuals disqualified for inte ntional Program violation are entitled to restoration of any benefits lost during the months that they were disqua lified, not to exceed t welve (12) months p rior to the date of DSS notifica tion, only if the decision whic h resulted in disqualification is subsequently reversed. For exa mple, an individual would not be entitled to restoration of los t benefits for the period of disqualification based solely on the fact that a criminal conviction could not be obtained, unless the individual successfully challenged the disqualification period imposed by an administrative disqualification in a separate court action. For each month the individual was disqualified, not to exceed t welve months prior to DSS not ification, the amount to be restored, if any, will be determi ned by comparing the allotment the household received with the allotment the household would have received had the disqualified member been allowed to participate. If the household received a smaller allotment than it should have received, the difference equals t he amount to be restored. Part icipation in an administrative disqualification hearing in which the household contests DSS' a ssertion of intentional Progra m violation will be considered notification that the household i s requesting restored benefits . 9011.6 Method of Restoration Regardless of whether a househo ld is currently eligible or inel igible, the agency will restore lost benefits to a household by issuing an allotment equal to t he amount of benefits that we re lost. The amount restored will be issued in addition to the allotment currently eligible households are entitled to receive. Reasonable requests by households to restore lost benefits in m onthly installments will be hon ored. As an example of a reasonable request, the household may fear that the excess food stamp benefits will be stolen or that the amount to be restored is more than it can u se in a reasonable period of time . Instructions for the issuance of res tored benefits are containe d in DSSM 7002.1. 9011.7 Changes in Household Composition Whenever lost benefits are due a household and the household's membership has changed, restore the lost benefits to the household containing a majority of the individuals who were household members at the time the loss occurred. If DSS cannot locate or determine the h ousehold which contains a major ity of household mem bers, restore the lost benefits to the household containing the head of the household at the time the loss occurred. 9011.8 Accounting Procedures If applicable, each case file will contain Form 106 documenting a household's entitlement to restoration of lost benefits. In addition, DMS will maintain a central alphabetic listing of cases where lost benefits have been or will be restored and wil l cross-reference this listing to cases in which a claim against the household can be used to offset the amount to be restored. 9012 Social Security Numbers [273.6] 9012.1 Requirements for Participation Require that a household particip ating or applying for particip ation in the Food Stamp Program provide the SSN of each household member or apply for on e before certification. Explai n to applicants and participants that refusal or failure withou t good cause to provide a SSN will result in disqualification of the individual for whom a SSN is not obtained. If individuals have m ore than one number, all numbers will be r equired. 9012.2 Obtaining SSNs for Food Stamp Household Members For those individuals who provide SSN's prior to certification, recertification or at any office contact, record the SSN and verify it in accor dance with DSSM 9032.5. For those individuals who do not have a SSN, issue an Form 122 including the system-generated unique identifier (Client ID#) for each individual listed on the form. (Inclusio n of the unique identifier will en able automatic transmittal of the SSN to the DCIS database.) Inform the household where to apply and what information will be needed. Advise the household member that proof of applicatio n from SSA will be req uired prior to certification (SSA normally use s the Receipt of Application for a So cial Security Number, Form SSA- 5028, as evidence that an individual has applied for a SSN). Follow this same procedure for i ndividuals who do not know if t hey have a SSN, or are unable to find their SSN.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE12 If the household is unable to pro vide proof of application for a SSN for a newborn, the household must provide the SSN or proof of application at its next recertification or within 6 months following the month the baby is born, whichever is late r. If the household is unable to provide a SSN or proof of applica tion at its next recertification within 6 months following the baby's birth, DSS shall determine if the good cause provisions of DSSM 9012.4 apply. 9012.3 Failure to Comply If DSS determines that a household member has refused or failed without good cause to apply for a SSN, that individual is ineligible to part icipate in the Food Stamp Progr am. The disqualification applies to the individual for whom the SSN is not provided and not to the entire household. The earne d or unearned income and resources of an individual disqualified from the household for failure to comply with this requirement will be counted as household income and resources to the extent sp ecified in DSSM 9076.2. 9012.4 Determining Good Cause In determining if good cause exists for failure to comply with the requirement to apply for or provide DSS with a SSN, consider information f rom the household member, SSA and DSS. D ocumentary evidence or collateral information that the household member has applied for a SSN or made every effort to supply SSA with the necessar y information to complete an application for a SSN will be c onsidered good cause for not complying timely with this r equirement. Good cause does not include delays d ue to illness, lack of transport ation or te mporary absences, because SSA makes provisions for mailing applications in lieu of applyi ng in person. If the household m ember can show good cause why an application for a SSN has not been completed in a timely manner, allow the person to part icipate for one month in addition to the month of application. If the household member applying for a SSN h as been unable to o btain the documents requir ed by SSA, make every effort to assist the individual in obtaining these documents. Good cau se for failure to apply must be shown monthly in order for such a household member to cont inue to participate. Once an app lication has been filed, permit the member to continue to participate pending notification to DSS of the household member SSN. Workers should establish short-term controls to check the statu s of the SSN application m onthly. If DSS has requested the necessary documents for the clients (birth certificates, et c.), check monthly to see if the documents have been received. Refer the client back to SSA wh en documents arrive. If the client was responsible for obtaining the necessary docum ents, check with the client by phone or by mail to determine what progress has been made. Inform the client that continued eligibility is dep endent upon th eir continued efforts to obtain documents needed to apply for a SSN. 9012.5 Ending Disqualification The household member(s) disqualified may become eligible upon p roviding the Division with a Social Security Number. 9012.6 Use of Social Security Numbers The Division is authorized to use Social Security Numbers in th e administration of the Food Stamp Program. To the extent determined necessary by the Secretary of Health and Huma n Services, State agencies are given access to information regarding individual Food Stamp Program applicants and participants who receive benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI) to determine such a household's e ligibility to receive assistance and the amount of assistance, or to verify information related to the benefit of the househol ds. Use the State Data Exchang e (SDX) to the maximum extent possible. Use SSN's to prevent duplicate particip ation, to fac ilitate mass changes in Federal benefits a nd to determine the accuracy and/or reliability of i nformation given by households. In particular, DSS will use SSN's to request and exchange information on individuals thr ough IEVS (see D SSM 2013.1). 9012.7 Entry of SSNs into Automated Databases Enter all Social Security Numbers obtained in accordance with t his section into the automated food stamp data base (DCIS). 9013 Household Concept [273.1] A household may be composed of any of the following individual or groups of individuals: 1. an individual living alone;TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE13 2. an individual living with others, but customarily purchasing food and preparing meals for home consumption separate and apart from the others; 3. a group of individuals who liv e together and customarily purc hase food and prepare meals together for home consumption; 4. an individual who is 60 years of age or older, living with ot hers (and the spouse of such individual), who is unable to purchase and prepare meals because he/she suffers fro m a disability considered p ermanent under the Social Security Act or suffers from a n on- disease related, severe, pe rmanent disability. However, th e income (all income included under DSSM 9055) of the others with whom the individual resides (excluding the income of such individual's spouse) cannot exceed 165% of the povert y line. (Refer to the current October Cost-of-Living Adjustm ent Administrative Notice.) 9013.1 Household Definition 7 CFR 273.1 A) General Definition - a household is composed of one of the following individuals or groups of individuals, provided they are not residents of an inst itution (except as otherwise s pecified in DSSM 9015), or are not boarders (as specified in DSSM 9013.3). 1. An individual living alone2. An individual living with other s, but customarily purchasing food and preparing meals for home consumption separate and apart from the others; This includes severely disabled i ndividuals who have someone pu rchase and prepare their meals for them (regardless of whether or not they are paid for the service). T he disabled individuals are considered separate food stamp households, even if they live in the same home as the individua l purchasing and preparing the meals for them. This household does not have to meet the 165 percent rule. 3. A group of individuals who live together and customarily purc hase food and prepare meals together for home consumption; B) Special Definition - the following individuals liv ing with others or groups of in dividuals living together must be considered as customarily purchasing food and preparing meals t ogether, even if they do not do so*. 1. Spouses who live together. Spou se refers to either of two ind ividuals: a. Who would be defined as marr ied to each othe r under applicabl e State law; or b. Who are living together and are holding themselves out to the community as husband and wife by representing themselves as such to relatives, friends, neighbor s, or trades people. 2. Children 21 years of age and younger living with their parent s. [Parents are defined as natural parent(s), adoptive parent(s), or step-parent(s)] Children (other than foster care children) who are under 18 and live under the parental control of a non-parent, adult household member cannot be separate households. Adult children (22 years of age and older) who live with their parents can be separate households if they purchase and prepare food separately. 3. Child(ren) living with a non-parent who has legal custody of the child(ren) will continue to be a member of the household for food stamp purposes even if a natural parent move s into the home. The non-parent must provide proof of legal custody. If the adult who has legal custody of the child chooses to let the child and natural parent purchase and prepare meals together, the child can become a member of the na tural parent's food stamp household. 4. Joint custody - Children who live with parents in a joint cus tody situation can get food stamps with the parent who is the first to apply for food stamps. This also covers sha red custody situations. If both parents are applying for the same child(ren), the parent who provides the majority of the me als (21 meals a week) will include the child as part of his/her food stamp household. When the parent who provides the majority of the meals applies for food stamps after the other parent is already getting food stamps for children, he/she can include the children in th eir food stamp after they are removed from the other parent's case. The children are removed from the first parent's case and opened in the second parent's case no later than the second month after the month the second parent requests food st amps for the children. 5. When an individual resides a portion of the month with a food stamp household, the household can choose to include or exclude the individual from the food stamp household . If included, the income of the individual must be included and the individual cannot get b enefits in another household or state. Examples: A son works out of state but comes home every weekend. His mom can include or exclude him.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE14 A child lives in PA with her fath er. She comes to DE to live wi th her mom on weekends. Her mother can include her in her food stamp h ousehold as long as the child is not getting food stamps in PA. A child goes to a residential school and comes home every other weekend and holidays. The parents can include the child in their food stamp household. 6. Although a group of individuals living together and purchasin g and preparing meals together constitutes a single household under the provisions of the above general defi nition, an otherwise eligible member of such a household who is 60 years of age or older and who is unable to purchase a nd prepare meals be cause (s)he suffers from a disability considered permanent under the Social Security Act, or suffers from a non-disease-related, severe, permanent disability, may be a separate household from the others based on the provis ions of this section provided that the income (all income under DSSM 9055) of the others with whom the individual resides (excluding the income of the spouse of the elderly and disabled individual) does not exceed 165% of the poverty line. Only the spouse of the elderly and disabled individual is required to be included in the same household with the individu al. \"Elderly or disabled member \" means a member of a household who: a. is 60 years of age or older; b. receives Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits under Ti tle XVI of Social Security Act or disability or blindness payments under Titles I, II, X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act; c. receives federally or State-administered supplemental benefit s under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act provided that the eligibility to receive benefits is based upon the di sability or blindness criteria used under T itle XVI of the Social Security Act; d. receives federally or State-administered supplemental benefit s under section 212(a) of Public Law 93- 66; e. receives disability retirement benefits from a governmental a gency because of a disability considered permanent under section 221(i) of the Social Security Act; f. is a veteran with a service-connected or non-service connecte d disability rated by the Veteran's Administration (VA) as total or paid as total by the VA under T itle 38 of the Unit ed States Code; g. is a veteran considered by the VA to be in need of regular ai d and attendance or permanently housebound under Title 38 of the United States Code; h. is a surviving spouse of a veteran and considered by the VA t o be in need of regular aid and attendance or permanently housebound or a surviving child of a veteran and considered by the VA to be permanently incapable of self-support under T itle 38 of the United States C ode; or i. is a surviving spouse or surviving child of a veteran and is considered by the VA to be entitled to compensation for service-connected death or pension benefits fo r a non- service connected death under Title 38 of the United States Code and has a d isability considered permanent un der Section 221(i) of the Social Security Act; j. received an annuity payment under Section 2(a)(l)(iv) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 and is determined to be elig ible to receive Medi care by the Railroad R etirement Board, or Section 2(a)(i)(v) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 and is determined to be disabled based u pon the criteria used under Tit le XVI of the Social Security Act. k. is a recipient of interim assistance benefits pending the rec eipt of Supplemental Security Income, disability related medical assist ance under Title XIX of the So cial Security Act, or disability- based State general assistance benefits provided that the eligib ility to receive those benefit s is based upon disability or blin dness criteria w hich are at l east as stringent as those used under Title XVI of the Social Securi ty Act. \"Entitled \" as used in this definition refers to those veterans' survivin g spouses and surviving children who are receiving the compensation or pension benefits stated o r have been approved for such payments, but are not yet receiving them. Note : Some disabled persons optionally receive Federal Employee Com pensation Act (FECA) payments in lieu of Civil Servic e Disability payments. Such per sons are considered to meet t he disability def inition under this section. Some persons, however, receive FECA payments on a temporary basis while recovering from an on-the-job injury. Receipt of these temporary payments does not satisfy th e disability definitio n. Therefore, verify which type of FECA payment a client receives. VERIFICATION OF DISABILITY DISABILITY BASIS VER IFICATION METHOD b, c, d Household must provide proof of benefit receipt.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE15 9 DE Reg. 1077 (01/01/06) 10 DE Reg. 1003 (12/01/06)11 DE DE Reg. 147 (08/01/14) 9013.2 Non-Household Members [273.1(b)] For the purposes of defining a household under the provisions o f this section, the follo wing individuals will not be included as a member of the household unless specifically inclu ded as a household member under the special definition at DSSM 9013.1. If not included as a member of the household unde r the special definition, such individuals will not be included as a member of the household for the purpose of determ ining household size, eligib ility or benefit level. The income and resources of such individuals will be handled in acc ordance with DSSM 9077. The following individuals (if otherwise eligible) may participate as separate households: 1) Roomers to whom a household furnishes lodging, but not meals, for compensation. 2) Live-in attendants who reside with a household to provide med ical, housekeeping, child care or similar personal services. 3) Other individuals who share living quarters with the househol d, but who do not customarily purchase food and prepare meals with the household. For example, if the applican t household shares living quar ters with another family to save on rent, but does not purchase and prepare food together w ith that family, the members of the other family are not members of the applicant household. Some household members are ineligible to receive Program benefi ts under the provisions of the Food Stamp Act (such as certain aliens and certain students). Others may become ineligible for such reasons as being disqualified for committing an intentional Program violation or refusing to comp ly with a regulatory requirement. These individuals must be included as a member of the household for the purpose of defini ng a household under the definition in DSSM 9013.1. However, such individuals must not be included as eligible memb ers of the household when determining the household's size for the purpose of comparing the household's monthly incom e with the income eligibilit y standard or assigning a benefit level by household size. The income and resources of s uch individuals will be handl ed in accordance with DSSM 9076. These individual s are not eligible to participate as sepa rate households. Ineligible individuals include the following: 1) Ineligible students who do no t meet the eligib le student requ irement of DSSM 9010. 2) Ineligible aliens w ho do not meet the cit izenship or eligible alien status requirements of DSSM 9032 or the eligible sponsored alien requirements of DSSM 9081. 3) Individuals disqualified for intentional Program violation pe r DSSM 2023. 4) Individuals disqualified for failure to provide a SSN per DSS M 9032.fHousehold must present a statement from the Veterans Administration which clearly indicates (1) that the disabled in dividual is receiving VA disability benefits for a service- connected di sability, and (2) that the disa bility is rated as to tal or paid at the to tal rate. g, hH o u s e h o l d m u s t p r o v e t h a t t h e d i s abled individual is receiving VA disability benefits. e, iUse SSA's most current list of d isabilities considered permanen t. If it is obvious that one in dividual has one of the listed disabiliti es, the item is considered verified. If disability is not obvious, the household must provide a statement from a physician or licensed or certif ied psychologist certifyi ng that the individual has one of the non- obvious disabilities listed. jHousehold must provide proof that individual receives a Railroa d Retirement disability annuity from the Railr oad Retirement Boar d and has been determined to qualify for Medicare. kHousehold must provide proof of receipt of interim benefits pen ding receipt of SSI; or disability-re lated medical a ssistance under Title XIX of the SSA. Verify t hat the eligibility to receive these benefi ts is based upon disability or blindness crit eria that are at least as stri ngent as those used under title XVI of the Social Security Act.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE16 5) Individuals who do not attest to their citizenship or alien s tatus as required on the Form 100 application form. 6) Individuals found guilty of having made a fraudulent statemen t or misrepresentation to the identity and/ or place of residence in order t o receive the mu ltiple benefits at the same time per DSSM 2024. 7) Individuals who are fleeing pr osecution or custody for a felo ny or probation/parole violators per DSSM 2025. 8) Individuals convicted of trafficking food stamps of $500 or m ore per DSSM 2026. 9) Individuals ineligible due to work requirements per DSSM 9018 . 10) Individuals who are ineligible because o f a drug-related fel ony conviction per DSSM 2027. 11) Individuals ineligible due to the time limit fo r Able-bodied Adults without Dependents per DSSM 9018. 9013.3 Boarders and Foster Care [273.1(c)] Boarders Boarders are defined as individuals or groups of individuals re siding with others and paying reasonable compensation to the others for lodging and meals (excluding residents of a c ommercial boarding house). Boarders are ineligible to participate in the Program independent of the household providi ng the board. They may participate as members of the household providing the boarder services to them, at such house hold's request. In no event will boarder status b e granted to tho se individuals or groups of individuals described in DSSM 9013.1 (B) which includes childre n living with parents. The household with which a boarde r resides (including the house hold of the proprietor of a boarding house) may participate in the program if th e household meets all the eligi bility requiremen ts for program participation. To determine if an individual is paying reasonable compensation for meals and lodging in making a determination of boarder status, only the amount paid for meals will be used, pr ovided that the amount paid for meals is distinguishable from the amount paid for lodging. A reasonable monthly payment will be either of the following: 1) Boarders whose board arrangement is for more than two meals a day will pay an amount which equals or exceeds the maximum food stamp a llotment for the appropriate si ze of the boarder household; or 2) Boarders whose board arrangement is for two meals or less per day will pay an amount which equals or exceeds two-thirds of the maximu m food stamp allo tment for the appropriate size of the household. An individual furnished both meals and lodging by a household b ut paying compensation of less than a reasonable amount to the househo ld for such services will be co nsidered a member of the household providing the services. This means that a person paying reasonable compensation for mea ls is considered a boarder and can be included in the household's food stamp household if the househo ld providing the boarder services wants them to be included. A person paying less than a reasonable amount to the household for meals must be included in the food stamp household of the household prov iding the service. Either way, the person paying for the meals cannot receive food stamps on their own separate from the ho usehold providing the service. None of the income or resources of individuals determined to be boarders and who are not members of the household providing the boarder services will be considered ava ilable to such household. However, the amount of the payment that a boarder gives to a household will be treated as self-employment income to the household. The procedures for handling self-employment income from boarder s (other than such income received by a household that owns and operates a commercial boarding house) a re set forth in DSSM 9074. The procedures for handling income from boarders by a household that owns and oper ates a commercial boarding house are also covered in DSSM 9074.6. For program purposes, a commercial boarding house is defined as an establishment licensed as an enterprise which offers meals and lodging for compensation. In project ar eas with licensing requirements, a commercial boarding house will be defined as a commercial establishment which offer s meals and lodging for compensation with the intent of making a profit. The number of boarders residing in a boarding house will not be used to determ ine if a boarding house is a commercial enterprise. Foster CareTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE17 Foster care individuals (children and adults) placed in the hom es of relatives or other i ndividuals or families by a Federal, State, or local governmental foster care program, shal l be considered boarders. The foster care payments received by the household for such foster care boarders shall n ot be considered as available income to the household. The foster care payments are exempt from the computation of net sel f-employment income from boarders under DSSM 9074. Foster care children/adult boarders may participate in the Food Stamp Program as members of the household providing the boarder services to them, at such household's req uest. If the household chooses the option to include the foster care individuals in their food stamp household, foster c are payments received by the household shall be considered unearned income to the household and counted in their entirety in determining t he household's income eligibility and benefit level. 9014 Head of Household [273.1(d)] It is not a requirement that the head of household appear at th e office for certification to the program. Another responsible member of the household or the authorized represent ative may appear to make application for benefits. When designating the head of household, the household may selec t an adult parent of children (of any age) living in the household, or an adult who has parental control over childr en (under 18 years of age) living in the household, as the head of household. All adult household members must agree to t he selection. Households can select their head s of households at each certifi cation action or whenever there is a change in household composition. The Applic ation (Form 100) contains the written notification about designating the head of household. Failure to designate or agree on a head of household will not d elay certification or cause benefits to be denied. DSS will designate a head o f household if the h ousehold does not de signate one or the a dults do not agree on a designation. If DSS has to designate a head o f household, the designee will be the principal wage earner. For purposes of failure to comply with DSSM 9018, the head of h ousehold shall be the principal wage earner unless the household has selected an adu lt parent of children. The pri ncipal wage earner is the household member (including excluded members) who is the greatest source of earned income i n the two months prior to the month of the violation. This provision applies only if the employment involves 20 hours or m ore per week or provides weekly earnings at least equivalent to the Federal minimu m wage multiplied by 20 hours. No person of any age living wit h a parent or person fulfilling the role of a parent who is registered for work or exempt from work registration requirements because such parent or pers on fulfilling the role of a parent is subject to and participating in the Food Stamp Employment and Training (FS E&T ) Program, or is in receipt of unemployment compensation (or has registered for work as part of the UC appl ication process), or is employed or self-employed and working a minimum of 30 hours we ekly or receiving a weekly earn ings equal to the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours can be considered the head of household. If there is no principal source of earned income in the household, the household member documented in the casefile as head of the hous ehold at the time of the v iolation will be considered the head of household. 9015 Residents of Institutions Individuals will be considered re sidents of an institution wher e the institution provides the m with the majority of their meals (over 50% of three meals da ily) as part of the institutio n's normal services. Residents of institutions are no t eligible for participation in the program with the following exceptions: 1. Residents of federally subsidized housing for the elderly. \" Federally subsidized housing for the elderly\" includes housing built under eit her Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 or Section 236 of the National Housing Act. 2. Narcotics addicts or alcoholics, and their children, who, for the purpose of regular participation in a drug or alcohol treatment and rehabilitat ion program, reside at a facil ity or treatment center. Resident addicts or alcoholics, and their children, will be treated as one hous ehold for purposes o f eligibility determination. 3. Blind or disabled individuals who are covered under the Food Stamp Act's definition of a disabled person in DSSM 9013, b through k, and who reside in properly certified pu blic or private non-profit group living arrangements serving no more than 16 residents. Processing standards, verification requirements, lost benefit entitlement, and rights to fair hearings, and advance notice will apply to the households in (2 ) and (3) as they do to all other households. See DSSM 9078. 4. Women or women with their children temporarily residing in a shelter for battered women and children. Persons temporarily residing in shelters for battered women and children will be considered ind ividual household units forTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE18 the purposes of applying for and participating in the program. A shelter for battered women and children is a public or private non-profit residential f acility that serves battered wo men and their children. If such a facility services other individuals, a portion of the facilit y must be set aside on a l ong-term basis to serve only battered women and children. 5. Residents of public or privat e nonprofit shelters for homeles s persons. Residents of public institutions who apply for SSI prior to the ir release from an institution under the Social Security Administration's Pre-release Program for the Instituti onalized [42 U.S.C. 1383(j)] can apply for food stamps at the same time they apply for SSI. Process these pre-release applic ants in accordance with the 9042, Authorized Representatives [273.2(n)] Representatives may be authorized to act on behalf of a househo ld in the application process, in obtaining food stamp benefits, and in using food stamp benefits. 5 DE Reg. 894 (10/01/01) 9016.1 Application Processing and Reporting Inform applicants that a nonhousehold member may be designated as the authorized representative for application processing purposes. The authorized representative may carry o ut household responsibilitie s during the certification period such as reporting changes in the household's income or o ther circumstances. Inform the household that the household will be held liable fo r any overissuances that result s from erroneous information given by the authorized representative. A nonhousehold member may be designated as an authorized repres entative for the applicati on process provided that the person is an adult who is sufficiently aware of relevant ho usehold circumstances. The authorized representative designation must be made in writing by the head of the househol d, the spouse, or another responsible member of the household. DSSM 9016.4 contains more restrictions on who can b e designated an authorized representative. Residents of drug or alcohol treatment centers must apply and b e certified through the use of authorized representatives in accordance with DSSM 9078.1. Residents of group living arrangements have the option to apply and be certified through the use of authorized representatives in accordance with DSSM 9078.2. 9016.2 Obtaining Food Stamps Benefits An authorized representative may be designated to obtain benefi ts. Encourage households to name an authorized representative for obtaining b enefits in case of illness or oth er cir cumst an ce s wh ich migh t pre vent the hou se ho ld fro m obtaining their benefits. The name of the authorized represent ative must be recorded in the household's case record and in DCIS. The authorized representative for obtaining benefits may or may not be the same individual designated as an authorized representative for the application process or for me eting reporting requirements d uring the certif ication period. When a household needs someone to obtain their food stamp benef its for a particular month, the household may designate an emergency authorized representative. The emergenc y authorized representative is designated to obtain the household's allotment when none of the persons specified on the ID card are available. Form 105, Emergency Authorized Representative Designation Form, is used by the household to designate an emergency authorized represent ative. DSS will fill out and sen d the Emergency Authorized Representative Designation Form to the client when requested. Do not require households t o come into the office to get the Emergency Authorized Representative Designation Form. The designated emergency authoriz ed representative must present the form that contains the signature of the household member on the ID card and the signature of the emerge ncy authorized representative and the food stamp ID card to the food stamp issuance site. The form must be signed by both the household member and the designated emergency authorized representative before going to the issuanc e site. A separate written designation is required each time an emergency representative is authorized. 9 DE Reg. 799 (11/01/05) 9016.3 Using BenefitsTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE19 A household may allow any household member or nonmember to use its ID card and benefits to purchase food or meals, if authorized, for the ho usehold. Drug or alcohol treat ment centers and group living arrangements which act as authorized representatives for residents of the facilities must use food stamp benefits for food prepared and served to those residents participating in the Food Stamp Program, except when residents leave the facilitie s as provided in DSSM 9078.1. 9016.4 Restrictions on Designati ons of Authorized Representativ es DSS must restrict the use of aut horized representatives for pur poses of application proc essing and obtaining food stamp benefits as follows: 1. DSS employees who are involved in the certification and/or is suance processes and retailers that are authorized to accept food stamp benefits may not act as authori zed representatives without the specific written approval of the Operations Administrator and only if the Operations Adminis trator determines that no one else is available to serve as an authorized representative. 2. Individuals disqualified for an intentional Program violation cannot act as authorized representatives during the period of disqualification unless the individual disqualified i s the only adult member of the household able to act on its behalf and the agency has determined that no one else is availa ble to serve as authorized representative. In this case it will be determined wheth er the authorized representative is nee ded to apply on behalf of the household, or to obtain benefits on behalf of the household. 3. Homeless meal providers may not act as authorized representat ives for homeless food stamp recipients. A \"homeless meal provider\" is a p ublic or private nonprofit estab lishment (e.g., soup k itchen, temporary s helter) approved by DHSS, that feeds homeless persons. 4. If DSS determines that an authorized representative has knowi ngly provided false information about household circumstances or has made imprope r use of food stamp benefits, it may disqualify that person from being an authorized representative for u p to one year. DSS will send written notif ication to the affected household(s) and the authorized representative 30 days prior to the date of disqualification. The notification must specify the reason for the proposed actio n and the household's right to request a fair hearing. This prov ision is not applicable in the case of drug and alcohol treatment centers and those group homes that act as authorized representatives for their residents. However, drug and alcohol treatment centers and the heads of group living arrange ments that act as authorized representatives for their residents, and which intentionally misrepresent households circ umstances, may be prosecuted under applicable Federal and State statutes for their acts. There is no limit on the number o f households an authorized rep resentative may represent. In the event that employers, such as those that employ migrant or seasonal farmworkers, are designated as authorized representatives or if any one authorized representat ive has access to a large number of food stamp benefits, caution should be exercised to assure that the household has fr eely requested the assistance of the authorized representative, the household's circumstances are correctly rep resented, and the household is receiving the correct amount of benefits. DSS should m ake sure that the authorized r epresentative is properly usi ng the food stamp benefits. Any suspected improper use should be reported to the Chief Soci al Service Administrator, Program Implementation Unit, who will in t urn report the circumstances to FNS for investigation. 9017 Strikers [273.1(g)] Households with striking member s will be ineligible to particip ate in the Food Stamp Program unless the household was eligible for benefits the day prior to the strike and is ot herwise eligible at the time of application. Such a household will not receive an increased allotmen t as the result of a decrease in the income of the striking member(s) of the household. For food stamp purposes, a stri ker will be anyone involved in a strike or concerted stoppage of work by employees (including a stoppage by reason of the expiration of a collecti ve- bargaining agreement) and any concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by employees. Any e mployee affected by a lockou t, however, will not be deemed to be a striker. Examples of non-strikers who are eligible for participation in the program include bu t are not limited to: 1. Employees whose workplace is c losed by an employer in order t o resist demands of employees (e.g., a lockout); 2. Employees unable to work as a result of striking employees (e .g., truck drivers who are not working because striking newspaper pressmen prev ent newspapers from being print ed); andTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE20 3. Employees who are not part of the bargaining unit on strike w ho did not want to cross a picket due to fear of personal injury or death. Further, an individual who goes on strike who is exempt from wo rk registration, in accordance with DSSM 9018, the day prior to the strike, other t han those exempt solely on the grounds that they are employed, w ill not be deemed a striker. Pre-strike eligibility will be det ermined by considering the da y prior to the strike as the d ay of application and assuming the strike did not occur. Eligibility at time of applicati on will be determined by compar ing the striking member's income before the strike to the striker's current income and adding the higher of the two to th e current income of non-striking members during the month of application. To determine benefits (and elig ibility for households subject t o the net income eligibility standard) deductions will be calculated for the month of application as for any other househ old. Whether the striker's pre-strike earnings are used or his current income is use d, the earnings deduc tion will be allowed if appropriate. Strikers whose households are eligible to participate under the criteria in this section will be subject to the work registration requirements under DSSM 9018 unless exempt under D SSM 9018.2. 9018 Work Requirements 9018.1 Work Registration Requirements No physically and mentally fit individual over the age of 15 an d under the age of 60 shall be eligible to participate in the food supplement program if the individual: refuses, at the time of applicat ion and every 12 months therea fter, to register for employment; refuses without good cause to a ccept an offer of employment at a site not subject to a str ike or lockout at the time of refusal, at a wage no t less than the higher of 1. the applicable Federal o r State minimum wage; or 2. 80% of the wage that would have governed had the minimum hour ly rate been applicable to the offer of employment. refuses without good cause to p rovide DSS with sufficient info rmation to allow DSS to determine the employment status or the job avail ability of the individual; voluntarily and without good cause quits a job or reduces the hours of work so the individual is working less than 30 hours per week; or fails to comply with a wo rk supplementation program. 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9018.2 Maintaining and Regaining ABAWD Eligibility 7 CFR 273.24 This policy applies to applicants for and recipients of the Foo d Supplement Program who are able-bodied adults who do not have depende nt children living with them.

Report to an employer to whom referred by the case worker if the potential em ployment meets the suitability requirements described in DSSM 9022. 4. Accept a bona fide offer of suitable employment to which he o r she is referred by an employment/training agency; at a wage not less th an the higher of either the applicable Sta te or Federal minimum wage. 9021 RESERVED 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9022 Suitable Employment [273.7(i)] Any employment will be considered unsuitable if: 1. The wage offered is less than the highest of the applicable federal minimum wage, the applicable state minimum wage, or 80% of the federal minimum wage if neither the federal nor state minimum w age is applicable, or 2. The employment offered is on a piece-rate basis and the avera ge hourly yield the employee can reasonably be expected to earn is less than t he applicable hourly wage specif ied in #1, above, or 3. The household member, as a condition of employment or continu ing employment, is required to join, resign from, or refrain from joinin g any legitimate labor organization, or 4. The work offered is at a site subject to a strike or lockout at the time of the offer unless the strike has been enjoined under the Taft-Hartley Ac t, or the Railway Labor Act, or 5. The degree of risk to health a nd safety is unreasonable, or 6. The member is physically or mentally unfit to perform the emp loyment as documented by medical evidence or by reliable information from other sources, or 7. The employment is offered within the first 30 days of registr ation and is not in the member's major field of experience, or 8. The distance from the member's house to the place of employme nt is unreasonable considering the expected wage and the time and cost of c ommuting. Emplo yment will not b e considered suitable if daily commuting time exceeds two hours daily, not including the transporting of a child to a nd from a child care facility . Employment is not considered suitable if the distance to the place of employment prohibits w alking and neither public nor private transportation is available to transport the member to the job site, or 9. The working hours or nature of the employment interferes with the member's religious observations, convictions, or beliefs. For example, a Sabbatar ian could refuse to work on th e Sabbath and not affect the household's eligibility. 9023 Participation of Strikers [273.7(j)] Strikers whose households are eligible under the criteria in DS SM 9017 will be subject to the work registration requirements unless exempt under DSSM 9018.3 at time of applica tion. 9024 TANF Employment and Training Households [273.7(k)] Registrants for the TANF Employment and Training program are ex empt from food stamp work registrations. Household members who are required to register for work under T ANF Employment and Training or Unemployment Compensation and who fail to comply with the work registration requirements of those pr ograms will be handled in accordance with DSSM 9021. 9025 Determining Good CauseTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE25 [273.7(m)] DSS will be responsible for determ ining good cause in those ins tances where the work registrant has failed to comply with the work registration, vol untary quit, or employment and t raining requirements, of this section. Determining good cause in cases o f voluntary quit. In determin ing whether or not good cause exists, the employment and training agency and DSS will consider the facts and circums tances, including information submitted by the household member involved and the employer. Good cause will include circ umstances beyond the member's control, such as, but not limited to, illness, illness of a nother househol d member requir ing the presence of the member, a household emergency, the unavailability of transportation or the lack of adequate child care for children who have reached age six but are under age 12. 9026 Voluntary Quit [7 CFR 273.7] No individual who voluntarily quits his/her most recent job or reduces work hours to less than 30 hours per week, without good cause will be eligible to partici pate in the Food Supplement Program (FSP) as specified below. At the time of application, explain to the applicant the conseq uences of the individual quitting his or her job without good cause. 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9026.1 Application Processing 1) When a household files an applic ation for participation or wh en a participating household reports the loss of a source of income, determine whether any household member volunt arily quit a job. Benefits will not be delayed beyond the normal processing times specified in DSSM 9028 pending the outc ome of this determination. This provision applies only if the employment involved 30 hours or more per week or provided w eekly earnings at least equivalent to the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hou rs; the quit occurred within 3 0 days prior to the date of application or anytime thereafter; and the quit was without good cause. Changes in employment sta tus that result from reducing hours of employment while working for the same employer, terminating a self-employment en terprise or resigning from a job at the demand of the employer will not be considered a s a voluntary quit for the pur pose of this subsection. An employee of the Federal Government or of a state or local go vernment, who participates in a strike against such government and is dismissed from his or her job because of part icipation in the strike, will be considered to have voluntarily quit a job without good cause. 2) In the case of an applicant household, determine whether any currently unemployed (i.e., employed less than 30 hours per week or receiving less than weekly earnings equivalen t to the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours) household member who is required to register for work has volun tarily quit his or her most recent job within the last 30 days. If DSS learns that a househ old has lost a source of incom e after the date of applicati on but before the household is certified, determine whether a voluntary quit occurred. 3) In the case of a participating household, determine whether a ny household member voluntarily quit his or her job or reduced work his or her hours, while participating in the FSP. 4) Upon a determination that the individual voluntarily quit emp loyment, determine if the voluntary quit was with good cause as defined in DSSM 9026.3. In the case of an applicant h ousehold, if the voluntary quit was without good cause, the individual's application for pa rticipation will be denied and t he appropriate period of inelig ibility imposed per DSSM 9026.2. If DSS determines that an individual voluntarily quit his/her j ob or reduced his/her work hou rs while participating in the program or discovers a quit or reduction of work hours which oc curred within thirty (30) days prior to application or between application and certification, provide a notice of adverse acti on within ten (10) days after t he determination of a voluntary quit is made. The notification must contain the proposed perio d of ineligibility and must spec ify that the individual may reapply at the end of the sanction. The periods of ineligibili ty are imposed according to DSSM 9026.2, and are effective upon the issuance of the notice of denial. If a voluntary quit or reduction in work effort occurs in the l ast month of a certification period, or it is determined in the last 30 days of the certificatio n period, the individual must b e denied recertification for a period equal to the appropriate period of ineligibility. The begi nning of the sanction starts w ith the first day after the la st certification period ends and continues for the length of the sanction period, regardless of whether the individual reap plies for food benefits. 5) If an application for participation is filed in the last mont h of the sanction period, use the same application for the denial of benefits in the remaining month of the sanction and c ertification for any subsequent month(s) if all other eligibili ty criteria are met.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE26 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9026.2 Periods of Ineligibility (Sanction Periods) When an individual voluntarily quits a job or voluntarily reduc es work hours to less than 30 hours per week and becomes ineligible to participate in the Foo d Supplement Progra m, the periods of inelig ibility are as follows: First violation, the individu al will remain ine ligible for a o ne month period after the date of ineligibility. Second violation, t he individual will rema in ineligible for a three month period after the date of ineligibility. Third violation, the individua l will remain ine ligible for a s ix month period after the date of ineligibility. Determine whether good cause for the job quit exists, per DSSM 9025 and 9026.4. Within te n (10) days of the DSS determination that the non-compliance was without good cause, p rovide the individual with a notice of adverse action. The notice must contain the particul ar act of non-compliance commit ted, the proposed sanction period, and a statement that the individual may reapply at the en d of the sanction period. Inclu de information describing the action that can be taken to end or avoid the sanction. The sanction period begins with the first month following the e xpiration of the adverse notice period, unless a fair hearing is requested. Individua ls may appeal DSS actions such a s DSS refusal to make a finding of good cause. If the individual with the job quit sanction moves to another f ood benefit household, the sanction would follow the person. 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9026.3 Exemptions From Voluntary Quit Provisions Persons exempt from the full-time work registration provisions are also exempt from voluntary quit provisions (See DSSM 9018.3). 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9026.4 Good Cause Good cause for leaving employment includes the good cause provi sions found in DSSM 9025 and resigning from a job that does not mee t the suitability criteria speci fied at DSSM 9 022. Good cause for leaving employment also includes: 1) Discrimination by an employer based on age, race, sex, color, disability, religious beliefs, national origin, or political beliefs; 2) Work demands or conditions that under continued employment wo uld be unreasonable, such as working without being paid on schedule; 3) Acceptance by the head of household of employment, or enrollm ent at least half-time in any recognized school, training program or institution of higher education, that requi res the head of household to leave employment; 4) Acceptance by another household member of employment or enrol lment at least half- time in any recognized school, training program, or inst itution of higher education in another county which requires the household to move and thereby requires the head of h ousehold to leave employment; 5) Resignations by persons under the age of 60 wh ich are recogni zed by the employer as retirement; 6) Employment which becomes unsuitable by not meeting the criter ia specified in DSSM 9022 after the acceptances of such employment; 7) Acceptance of a bona fide offer of employment of more than 30 hours a week or in which the weekly earnings are equivalent to the federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours w hich, because of circumstances beyond the control of the head of household, subsequently either does not materialize or results in employment of less than 30 hours a week or weekly earnings of less than the federal minimum wage multiplie d by 30 hours; and 8) Leaving a job in connection wit h patterns of employment in wh ich workers frequently move from one employer to another such as migrant farm labor or construction work. There may be some circumstances where households will apply for food benefits between jobs, particularly in cases where wor k may not yet be available at the new job site. Even though employment at the new site has not actually begun, the quitting of previous employment will be considered as with good cause if it is part of the patt ern of that type of employment. 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9026.5 Voluntary Quit VerificationTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE27 If the information given by the household is questionable as de fined in DSSM 9033, request verification of the household's statements. The prim ary responsibilit y for providin g verification as provided in DSSM 9035.1 rests with the household. If it is difficult or impossible for the household to obtain documentary evidence in a timely manner, offer assistance to the household to obtain the needed verification. Acceptable sources of verification include but are not limited to the previous employer, employee associations, union represen tatives, and grievance co mmittees or organizations. Whenever DSS cannot obtain docume ntary evidence, substitute a c ollateral contact. The Division is responsible for obtaining verification from acc eptable collateral contacts provided by the household. If the household and the Division are unable to obtain requested v erification from these or other sources because the cause for the quit resulted from circumstances that for good reason c annot be verified, such as a resignation from employment due to discrimination practices or unreasonable demands by an e mployer or because the employer cannot be located, the household will not be denied access to the Food Supplement Prog ram. 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9026.6 Ending a Voluntary Quit O r A Reduction In Work Hours San ction Following the end of the sanction period as defined in DSSM 902 6.2, an individual may begin participation in the program if he or she applies again and is determined eligible. During the sanction period, if an individual is found exempt fr om work registration under D SSM 9018.3, the sanction would no longer apply. 13 DE Reg. 1335 (04/01/10) 9027 Application Processing [273.2(a)] DSS will provide timely, accurate , and fair service to applican ts and recipients of the Fo od Stamp Program. DSS will not impose additional application or application processing req uirements as a condition of eligibility. The application process includes filing and completing an appli cation form, being interviewed, and having certain information verifi ed. Prompt action will be taken on all appli cations and food stamp benefits retroactive to the period of application will be provided to t hose households that have comp leted the application process and have been determined eligible. Expedited service will be availa ble to households in immediate need. 9028 Filing an Application [273.2(c)] Households must file a food stamp application by submitting the form to a certification office either in person, through an authorized representative, by fax or other electronic transm ission, by mail or by completing an on-line electronic application. Applications sign ed through the use of electronic signature techniques or applic ations containing handwritten signatures and then transmitted by fax or other electronic tran smission are acceptable. DSS must document the date the application was filed by recordi ng the date of receipt at the l ocal office. The length of time DSS has to deliver benefits is calculated fr om the date the application is filed in the food stamp claim office designated to accept the household's application, except when a resident of a public institution is jointly applying fo r SSI and food stamps prior to his/her release from an institutio n in accordance with DSSM 9015. Certify residents of public institutions who apply for food stamps prior to their release f rom the institution in accordance with DSSM 9039 or DSSM 9041, as appropriate . The date received will be documented on the application. Each household has the right to file, and should be encouraged to file an application form on the same day it contacts any food stamp office during office hours and expresses interes t in obtaining food stamps or expresses concerns which indicate food insecurity. DSS shall make clear to applicants that the disadvantages and r equirements of applying for cash assistance do not apply to food stamps. Applicants shall be encouraged to continu e an application with food stamps. DSS shall inform households that receiving food stamps will have no bearing on a ny other program's time limits that may apply to the household. Mail an application form the same day households request food s tamp assistance either by te lephone or written notice. Advise the household that it does not have to be interviewed be fore filing the application and may file an incomplete application form as long as the form contains the applicant's n ame and address, and the signature of a responsible household member or the househol d's authorized representative. Any office must accept applications when filed, but mustTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE28 subsequently refer the household to the proper office for the e ligibility determinatio n. Mail applications received in the wrong office to the correct office the same day. Applications filed at incorrect o ffice locations are considered filed and the receiving office will forward the application to the correct office. If the house hold is eligible for expedited services, the receiving office will fax the app lication and pro of of identity to the correct office and alert the office by phone ab out the fax. The cor rect office will issue the expedited benefi ts and, if necessary, schedule an appointment for an interview. When a resident of an institution is jointly applying for SSI a nd food stamps prior to leaving the institution, the filing dat e of the application to be record ed by DSS on the application is the date of release of the a pplicant from the institution. Have application form s readily accessible to potentially eligib le households in each regional office and provide them to those groups and organizations i nvolved in outre ach efforts. D SS will provide a means for app licants to immediately begin the application process with name, address, and signature by ha ving applicants complete and sign a copy of the on-line Referral for Assistance or the first page of the hard-copy appl ication. Households that co mplete an on-line electronic application in person have the o pportunity to review the inform ation that has been recorded el ectronically and to receive a copy for their records. When a household contacts the wrong certification office in per son or by telephone, the household will be given the address and phone number of the correct office. The office cont acted in person will provide the household an o pportunity to file an application that same day. The office will forward the application to the correct office the same day. If the househol d has mailed its applic ation to the wrong cer tification office, f orward it to the proper office on the same day. Provide each household at the time of application for certifica tion or recertification with a notice (Form 105) that informs the household of the verificati on requirements the household mu st meet as part of the application process. The notice must also inform the househ old of the Division' s responsibility to a ssist the household in obtaining required verification provided the household is cooperati ng as specified in DSSM 9029. 9028.1 Joint Application Processing Notify households applying for T ANF/GA/RCA of their right to ap ply for food stamp benefits at the same time and permit them to do so. DSS will notify suc h households that time limits or other requirements that appl y to the receipt of TANF/GA/ RCA benefits do not apply to the receipt of food stamp benefits . DSS will also notify such households, which cease receiving TANF/GA/RCA because they have reached a time limit, h ave begun working, or were closed for other reasons, that they may still be eligible f or food stamp benefits. DSS wi ll encourage applicants to continue to apply for food stamp benefits even if household determines not to apply for TANF/GA/ RCA due to the requirements or disadvantages of that program. DSS will info rm households that rec eiving food stamps will have no bearing on any other program's time limits that may apply to the household. These households' food stamp e ligibility and benefit levels ar e to be based solely on food stamp eligibility criteria. Howeve r, any household in which all members are recipients of TANF/GA/RCA and/or SSI benefits are to be considered eligible for food stamps because of the TA NF/ GA/RCA/SSI status in acc ordance with DSSM 9042.2. Recipients include individuals a uthorized to receive TANF/GA/RC A and or SSI benefits but who have not yet received payment. In addition, persons are considered recipients if the TANF/GA/RCA or SSI benefits are suspended or recouped. Persons entitled to TANF/GA/RCA benefits because the grant is l ess than $10 are also considered TANF/GA/RCA recipients. Households, whether jointly processed and/or eligible because o f their TANF/GA/RCA/SSI status, will be certified in accordance with the notice, procedural and timeliness requireme nts of the food stamp regulations. 8 DE Reg. 1485 (4/1/05) 9029 Household Cooperation [7 CFR 273.2(d)] A. Households are required to cooperate in the application proce ss in order to rec eive food benefits. The household or its authorized representative must complete th e application, have an interview, and verify certain information on the application be fore DSS can determine eligibi lity. If the household refuses to cooperate in completing this proces s, DSS will deny the application at the time the household refuses to cooperate. B. DSS will not deny a case becaus e a household merely failed to cooperate or was unable to cooperate. DSS must determine that the household refu sed to cooperate. Before DSS c an make a determination of refused to cooperate, the household must: \"be able to cooperate,TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE29 \"clearly demonstrat e that it will not take actions that it can take, and \"fail to take required actions to complete the application pro cess. If there is any question as to whether the household merely fai led to cooperate, as opposed to refused to cooperate, the DSS worker will not deny the household. The worker must provide assistance. C. DSS will determine the househol d ineligible if it refuses to cooperate in any subsequent review of its eligibility. A subsequent review of eligibility includes, but is not limited t o: \"reviews generated by reported changes, \"applications for recertification, and \"reviews of cases certified un der disaster FSP procedures. After a DSS denial or termination for refusal to cooperate, the household may reapply and must cooperate before determined eligible. If there is a ny question as to whether the household has merely failed to cooperate, as opposed to refused to cooperate , the DSS worker will no t deny the househol d. The worker must provide assistance. The household may voluntarily withdraw its application at any t ime before the determ ination of eligibility. D. If a household withdraws its application, the worker will: document the case record to inc lude the reason for withdrawal. contact the household to confirm the withdrawal and document t he case record. advise the household of its right to reapply at any time. E. DSS will not determi ne the household to b e eligible when a pe rson, organization or agency outside of the household fails to cooperate wit h a request for verification. The worker will docume nt the case record. Non-household members, like roomers, live-in attendants or othe rs sharing the residence, are not considered as living outside the household fo r the purposes of this policy. This means the failure of a non-household member to cooperate could cause the ho usehold to be ineligible. 12 DE Reg. 1225 (03/01/09) 9029.1 Cooperation With Quality Control A household is ineligible if it refuses to cooperate in any sub sequent review of its eligibility as a part of a Quality Contro l (QC) review. If a household is terminated for refusal to coope rate with a QC reviewer, the household may reapply but will not be determined eligible until it cooperates with the QC revi ewer. If a household terminated for refusal to cooperate with a State QC reviewer reapplies after 95 days from the end of Sep tember, (the end of the annual review period which runs October through September each fiscal year), do not determine t he household ineligible for its refusal to cooperate with a State QC reviewer during the completed review period. However, the household must provide verification in accordance with DSSM 9032.13. If a household terminated for refusal to cooperate with a Feder al QC reviewer reapplies after seven months from the end of September, (the end of the annual review period which ru ns October through September each fiscal year), do not determine the household ineligible for its refusal to cooperate with a Federal QC reviewer during the completed review period. However, the household mu st provide verification in acc ordance with DSSM 9032.13. If the household who refuses to cooperate with a QC reviewer jo ins another food stamp household, those individuals would be treated as in eligible household m embers until they coo perate with the QC reviewer. 9 DE Reg. 1077 (01/01/06) 9030 Interviews [273.2(e)] Households must have a face-to-f ace interview with an eligibili ty worker at initial certification and at least once every 12 months thereafter, unless the fa ce-to-face interview has been w aived. DSS may not require a household to report for an in-office inte rview during their certification period although they may request a household to do so. Interview may be conducted at the food stamp office or other mu tually acceptable location, including a household residence. Interviews conducted at the household's residence mu st be scheduled in advance. The head of household, spouse, any other responsible member of the household, or an authorized representative may be interviewed. Advise the households of their rights and respo nsibilities during the intervie w, including the appropriate processing standard and the resp onsibility to report changes. T he interview will be conducted as an official and confidentialTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE30 discussion of household circum stances and will be limited stric tly to facts that relate directly to food stamp eligibility cri teria. The applicant's right to priva cy will be protected during the i nterview. The eligibility worker must expl ore and resolve with the househ old any unclear and incomplete information. Households applying for cash assistance must be informed that t ime limits and other requirements that apply to the cash assistance program do not apply to the receipt of food stamps. Inform households that stop receiving cash assistance due to reaching a time limit, getting a job, or other reasons, that they may still be e ligible for food stamp benefits. Inform applicants that DSS will waive the office interview and conduct a telephone interview on a case-by-case basis because of household hardship si tuations. Hardship situations include, but are not limited to, age, disability, illness, transportation difficulties, care of a household member, hardsh ips due to residency in a rural area, prolonged severe weather, or work or training hours which prevent the household from participating in an in-office interview. Document the casefile to show when a waiver was granted due to hardship. Waiver of the face-to-face inter view does not exempt the househ old from the verification req uirements. A waiver of the face-to-face interview cannot not affect the length of the hous ehold's certification period. Assign households waived the face-to-face interview no rmal certificat ion periods However, special verification procedures may be used such as su bstituting a collateral contact in cases where documentary evidence would normally be required. Households for whom the office interview is waived will be offe red either a telephone interview or a home visit. Home visits will be scheduled in advance with the household. DSS will schedule an interview fo r all applicant households who are not interviewed on the day they submit their applications. All interviews will be scheduled as promptly as p ossible to ensure eligible households receive an opportunity to participate within 30 days af ter the application is filed. If the household misses its interview appointment, DSS will not ify the household that it missed the interview and that the household is responsible for making another appointment. D SS will not deny the application prior to the 30th day after the application was filed if the household fails to appear for the interview. If the household requests a second interview during the 30-day application processing period and is determin ed eligible, DSS will prorate benefits from the date of application. Applicant and participant households which are unable to obtain certification services wit hout missing time from work must be given appointments for such services. The applicant may bring any person he or she chooses to the int erview. 9031 Definition of Verification [273.2(f)] Verification is the use of third party information or documenta tion to establish the accuracy of statements on the application. DSS must give households at leas t ten (10) days to provide requ ired verifications. 9032 Requiring Verification 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1) This policy applies to applicants of the FSP. Verification is the use of third party information or documenta tion to establish the accuracy of statements on the application. 1. DSS Requires Mandatory Verifi cation of Eligibility Factors Be fore Certifying Applicants The following verifica tions are mandatory: A. Gross income ( unless excluded) If the client is unable to provi de verification use other resou rces available to you including third party verification. If you are still un able to verify the income, det ermine an amount based on the best available information. Sometimes the best available information will be from a collate ral contact or from the client him/herself. B. Alien Eligibility Status DSS must verify the eligible status of applicant aliens. 1. If an alien does not wish DSS to contact INS to verify his or her immigration status, give the household the option of withdrawing its ap plication or participating with out that member. 2.

Medical Expenses DSS will verify the medical expen ses deductible under DSSM 9060 . Verification of other factors, su ch as whether a service provid ed is allowed, may be required if questionable. E. Social Security Numbers DSS will verify Social Security N umbers (SSNs) re ported by the household by submitting them to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for verifica tion through t he DCIS system. 1. Contact the household to determi ne if the information the hou sehold provided is correct if the SSN returns from SSA as unv erified. Obtai n the correct information so that the SSN can be resubmitted to SSA.Exceptions: 1. If DSS has submitted a copy of a document provided by the hou sehold to INS for verification, DSS cannot delay, deny, reduce, or terminate the individual's eligibility for benefits on the basis of the indiv idual's immigration status wh ile pending. 2. If SSA has responded that the i ndividual has fewer than 40 qu arters, and the individual provides documentatio n from SSA that SSA is conducti ng an investigation to determine if more quarters can be credited, DSS will certify th e individual pending the results of the investigation for up to 6 months from the date o f the original determination of insufficient quarters.3. If the applicant or DSS has submitted a request to a Federal agency for verification of information which bears on the i ndividual's eligible status, DS S will certify the individual pending the results of the investigation for up to 6 months fro m the date of the original request for verification.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE32 2. Pursue all unmatched SSNs with the client. If the household r efuses to provide the correct information, take action against t he household fo r refusal to c ooperate per DSSM 9029. 3. When a household claims it c annot cooperate fo r reasons beyon d its control, verify and document the household's inab ility to cooperate. 4. If an individual must appear at the SSA Office to provide cor rect information and refuses to, the refusal is grounds for termination per DSSM 9029. 5. When an individual household member refuses or fails without good cause to provide or apply for an SSN, that individual shall be ineligible to participate. 6. Disqualifications apply only to individual members, not the e ntire household. Treat the income and resources for the disqualified individual according to DSSM 907 6.2. 7. Do not delay the certification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise eligible household solely to verify the SSN of a household member. 8. Once an SSN has been verified, enter the number as verified t o prevent the unnecessary re- verification of the SSN in the future. 9. Accept as verified a SSN which has been verified by another p rogram participating in the Income and Eligibility Verifi cation System (IEVS). 10.

Possible methods to verify payments are as follows: Benefits may be authorized if th e following conditions are met: a) A new household provides a satisfactory explanation of past m anagement including any verification that is reasonably available to the household. b) A participating household satis factorily verifies factors of past management. Verification must be from the month(s) immediately preceding certification/recertification. Additionally, households where management has been questionable will be notified that they will be responsible for verifications o f all cash outflow at times of r ecertification if management con tinues to appear questionable. A. Household Composition. Verify factors affecting the compositi on of a household, if questionable. Individuals who wish to be a separate household from those with whom they reside will be responsible for proving a claim that they are a separate househo ld to the satisfaction of the D ivision. Individuals who claim to be a separate household from those wit h whom they reside based on t he various age and disability factors for determini ng separateness will be responsible for pr oving a claim of separateness in accordance with DSSM 9032.11. B. Citizenship. The household must provide acceptable verificat ion for any member whose U.S. citizenship is questionable. A claim to citizens hip may be considered questionable if: 1) The claim of citizenship is in consistent with statements made by the applicant or with other information on the application or on previous applications. 2) The claim of citizenship is in consistent with information rec eived from another source. 3) The individual does not have a Social Security Number. When a household's statement that one or more of its members ar e U.S. citizens or has the status as a non-citizen national is questionable, ask the household to pr ovide acceptable verification. Acceptable forms of verification include birth certificates, religious records, voter registrati on cards, certificates of citize nship or naturalization provide d by INS, such as identification cards for use of resident citizens in the United States (INS form I- 179 or INS form I- 197), or U .S. passports. Participation in the TANF Program will also be consi dered acceptable verification if verification of citizenship or non-citizen national status was obtained for that program. If t he above forms of verification cannot be obtained and the household can provide a reasonable explanation as to why verifi cation is not available, accept a signed statement from a third party indicating a reasonable basis for personal knowledg e that the member in question is a U.S. citizen. The signed statement must contain a warning of the penalties for helping s omeone commit fraud, such as: \"If you intentionally give false information to help this p erson get food stamps, you may be fined, imprisoned, or both.\"Income SourceType of Verification Loans and gifts Statement from lender Sale of personal prope rty Receipt from sale Exchange of services/ in-kind benefits Statement from landlord, etc. Gambling proceeds Lottery ticketsOdd jobs Note from employerTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE35 The member whose citizenship or non-citizen national status is in question will be ineligible to participate until proof of U.S. c itizenship or non-citizen nati onal status is obtained. Until proof of U.S. citizenship or no n- citizen national status is obtained, the member whose citizensh ip or non-citizen national status is in question will have his or her income, less a prorata share, and all of his or her reso urces considered available to any remaining household members as set forth in DSSM 9076.2. C. Deductible expenses. If obtaining verification for a deductib le expense may delay certification, advise the household that its eligibility and benefit le vel may be det ermined without providing a deduction for the claimed but unverified expense. This provision also applies to the allowanc e of medical expenses per DSSM 9032. Shelter costs would be computed without including the unverified components. The st andard utility allowance will be used if the household is entitled to claim it. If the expense cannot be verified within 30 days of the date of application, determine the household's eligibility and benefit level wi thout providing a deduction of the unverified expense. If the h ousehold subsequently provides the missing verification, redetermine the household's benefits, and provide increased benefits, if any, in accordance with the timeliness standards in DSSM 9085. If the expense could not be verified within the 30- day processing standard because the Division failed to allow the household sufficient t ime per DSSM 9040 to verify the expense, t he household will be entitled to the restoration of benefits retroactive to the m onth of application, provided tha t the missing verification is supplied in accordance with DSSM 9040. If the household would b e ineligible unless the expense is allowed, the household's applicat ion will be handled a s provided in DSSM 904 0. 11 DE Reg. 216 (08/01/07) 9034 Sources of Verification 9034. 1 Documentary Evidence Use documentary evidence as the primary source of verification for all items except residency and household size. Documentary evidence consists of a written confirmation of a ho usehold's circumstances. Although documentary evidence will be the primary source of veri fication, acceptable verifica tion will not be limited to any single type of document and may be obtained through the household or other source. Whenever doc umentary evidence cannot be obtained or is insufficient to make a firm deter mination of eligibility or benefit level, r equire collateral cont acts or home visits. Examples of documentary evidence include wage stubs, rent recei pts, and utility bills. For example, documentary evidenc e is considered insufficient wh en the household presents pay stubs which do not represent an accurate picture o f the household's income. Each w age stub submitted must contain a complete data (month, day, year) affixed by the employ er. When wage stubs presented a re not acceptable, any of the alternate procedures following may be invoked: 1) Make a collateral contact by telephone to verify the informat ion reflected on the client's wage stubs. If discrepant, use the amounts furnished by the employer. 2) The client may optionally prese nt another source of documenta tion. Additional docum entary evidence will also be evaluated for sufficiency. 3) Mail Form 170 to the employer. Documents that appear to be fals ified are never to be considere d as documentary evidence. 9034.2 Collateral Contacts A collateral contact is a verbal confirmation of a household's circumstances by a person outside of the household. The collateral contact may be made either in person or over the tel ephone. Select a collateral contact if the household fails to designate one or designates one which is unacceptable to the Di vision. Examples of acceptable collateral contacts are employers, landl ords, social service agencies, migrant service agencies, and neighbors of the household wh o can be expected to provide a ccurate third part y verification. When talking with collateral co ntacts, DSS will disclose only t he information that is absolutely necessary to get the information being sought. DSS will avoid disclosing that the ho usehold has applied for food stamps, nor should they disclose any information supplied by the household, especially information that is protected by DSSM 1003, or suggest that the household is suspected of doing any wrong doing. If the Division designates a co llateral contact, no contact wil l be made without providing prio r written or oral notice to the household. At the time of th is notice, inform the household that it has the following options: 1. Consent to the contact;TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE36 2. Provide acceptable verification in another form; or 3. Withdraw the application. If the household refuses to choose one of these options, its ap plication will be denied in ac cordance with the normal procedures for failure to verify information. Systems of records to which DSS has routine access are not cons idered collateral contacts and, therefore need not be designated by the household. Examples are the Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX) and the Sta te Data Exchange (SDX) and records of another agency where a routine access agr eement exists (such as records from DOL Unemployment Compensation section). 9034.3 Home Visits Home visits may be used as verification only when documentary e vidence is insufficient to make a firm determination of eligibility or benefit level, or ca nnot be obtained, and the ho me visit is scheduled in advance with the household. Home visits are to be used on a case-by-case basis where the su pplied documentation is insufficient. Even though a household fits a profile of an er ror-prone household, it does n ot constitute lack of verification, therefore a home visit in t his case would not be appropriate. DSS will assist a household in obtaining sufficient verification in accordance with DSSM 9305.1 prior to a r eferral for a home visit by ARMS. 9034.4 Discrepancies Where unverified information from a source other than the house hold contradicts statements made by the household, afford the household a reasonable opportunity to resolve the di screpancy prior to a determina tion of eligibility or benefits. Verify the information directly with the primary source and con tact the household only if dire ct verification efforts are unsuccessful. If the unverified information is received through the IEVS, as specified in DSSM 2013.1, obtain verification from a third party as s pecified in DSSM 9037. 9035 Verification and Documentation9035.1 Responsibility for Obtaining Verification The household has the primary r esponsibility for providing docu mentary evidence to support statements on the application and to resolve any questionable information. DSS w ill assist the household in obtaining this verification provided the household is cooperating as defined in DSSM 9029. Households may supply documentary evidence in person, through the mail, by fax or other electronic device, or through an authorized representative. Do not require the household to present verification in person at the food stamp o ffice. Accept any reasonable documentary evidence provided by the household. Be primarily concerned with how ade quately the verification proves the statements on the application. Whenever documentary evidence is insufficient to make a firm de termination of eligibility or benefit level or cannot be obtained, require a collateral contact or a home visit in accor dance with DSSM 9034.3. Rely on the household to provide the name of any collateral contact. The household may request a ssistance in designating a collateral contact. DSS is not required to use a collateral contact designated by the househol d if the collateral contact cannot be expected to provide an accurate third-party verification. When the collateral contact designated by the household is unacceptable, either designate another collateral contact, ask the household to desi gnate another collateral contact, or provide an alternative form of verification or substitute a home visit. DSS is respon sible for obtaining verification from acceptable collateral contacts. 9035.2 Documentation Case files must be documented to support eligibility, ineligibi lity, and benefit level determinations. Documentation must be in sufficient detail to permit a reviewer to determine the r easonableness and accuracy of the determination. For all negative actions (denia ls, withdrawals) a substantive reason sh ould be provided in the disposition section. 9036 Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Prog ram [273.11(a)]TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE37 DSS participates in the SAVE Program established by the Immigra tion and Naturalization Se rvice (INS) in order to verify the validity of documents provided by aliens applying fo r food stamp benefits. The c entral data files utilized are maintained by INS. 9036.1 Use of Data Use information obtained through the SAVE Program only for the purposes of: 1) Verifying the validity of doc umentation of alien status prese nted by an applicant; 2) Verifying an individual's eligibility for benefits; 3) Investigating whethe r participating households received benef its to which they were not entitled, if an individual was previously certified to recei ve benefits on the basis of el igible alien status; and 4) Assisting in or conducting adm inistrative disqualification he arings or criminal or civil prosecutions based on receipt of food stamp benefits to which participating household s were not entitled. 9036.2 Method of Verification Before benefits can be approved, a signature from a household m ember must be obtained on the application (Form 100) certifying all household members are U.S. citizens or alie ns in lawful immigration status. For each member designating \"alien\" (i.e., non-ci tizen) status, access the Alie n Status Verification Index (ASV I) database to verify the alien 's documented status through the SAVE Point-of-Contact (POC) perso n located in the Deputy Director's Office for Service Delivery in the Lewis B uilding. Requests f or verification can be mailed (using form SA VE-1) to the SAVE POC. When either of the f ollowing conditions exist, secondary (manua l) verification procedures must instead be utilized: 1) The documentation pres ented is questionable. 2) DSS accepts documents that are not issued by INS, but are det ermined to be reasonable evidence of the alien's immigration status. S e c o n d a r y v e r i f i c a t i o n i s a c c o m p l i s h e d t h r o u g h u s e o f F o r m ( I N S ) G- 845, submitted along with photocopies of documentation presented to DSS by the alien. This secondary ver ification procedure is also to be used whenever the client's documented alien status has not been verified successf ully through ASVI or significant discrepancies exist between data on the ASVI file and the inf ormation provided by the alien applicant. 9036.3 Use of SAVE Provide an applicant alien with a reasonable opportunity to sub mit acceptable documentation of eligible alien status prior to the 30th day following the date of application. A reas onable opportunity is at least te n (10) days from the date DSS requests an acceptable document. An alien who has been given a reasonable opportunity to submit acceptable documentation and has not done so as of the 30th day following the date of application cannot be certified for benefits until documentation has been submitted. However, if the ten-day reas onable opportunity period does not lapse before the 30th day following the date of application, provide the household wi th benefits no later than 30 days following the date of application if the househol d is otherwis e eligible. The written consent of the alien applicant is not required as a condition for DSS to contact INS to verify the validity of documentation. Submit INS Form G- 845, with an attached photocopy of the alien 's document to the Division's SAVE Point-of-Contact person whenever the initial automated access does not confirm t he validity of the alien's documentation or a significant discrepancy exists between the data provided by ASVI and the in formation provided by the applicant. Pending such responses from eithe r the ASVI or INS Form G- 845, do not delay , deny, reduce, or terminate the alien's eligibility for benefits on the basis of the individual's alien status. If it is determined that the alien is not in an eligible alien status, take action, including proper notices to the household, to terminate, deny, or reduce benefits. Provide households the opportunity to request a fair hearing under DSSM 5000 prior to any adverse action. Document the use of SAVE in the casefile. While awaiting a resp onse from SAVE, notate the date of the verification request or retain a copy of the INS Form G- 845 sent to INS. On ce the SAVE response is rec eived, enter the ASVI Query Verification Number or file a copy of the INS- annotated Form G - 845. Whenever the response from automated access to the ASVI directs the eligibility wo rker to initia te secondary v erification, show documentation of the ASVI Query Verification Number in the record and file a copy of the INS Form G- 845.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE38 Once signed, the Affidavit of Cit izenship or Lawful Immigration Status does not need to be signed at each recertification unless the individual is in a temporary INS status. 9037 Use of Income a nd Eligibility Verifi cation System (IEVS) 7 CFR 273.2(f)(9) Use information obtain ed through the IEVS to verify the eligibi lity and benefit level of ap plicant and participating households, in accordance with pr ocedures specified in DSSM 201 3.1. Disclosure safeguards must be satisfied, per DSSM 9003. Take action, including proper not ices to households, to termina te, deny, or reduce benefits based on information obtained through the IEVS which is considered ver ified upon rec eipt. This information is soc ial security and SSI benefit information obtained from SSA and UIB information obtained from DOL. If DSS has information that the IEVS obtained information about a particular h ousehold is questionable, consi der this information unverified. Unverified information is: Wage information from SSA and DOL; Any questionable IEVS information. Prior to taking action to terminate, deny, or reduce benefits b ased on unverified information obtained through IEVS, independently verify the information. Independent verification includes verification of the a mount of the asset or income involved, whether the household actually has or had access to s uch asset or income that it wo uld be considered countable for food benefit purposes, and t he period during which such acc ess occurred. When DSS has information indicating that independent verification is unnece ssary, such verification is n ot required. Obtain independent verification of unverified information from IEVS by contacting the househ old and/or the appropriate income, resource or benefit source. When contacting the househo ld, do so in writing, informing the household of the information DSS has received, and requesting that the household respond within ten (10) days. If the household fails to respond in a timely manner, send a notice of adverse action. Contact the appropriate source by the means best suited to the situation. When the household or appropriate source provides the independent verific ation, properly notify the hous ehold of the action DSS intends to take and provide the household with an opportunity to request a fair hearing prior t o any adverse action. 18 DE Reg. 142 (08/01/14) 9038 Verification for Recertif 273.2(f)(8)]A. At recertification, verify: All income. Shelter costs when the househol d moves or reports a change of more than $25. Utility expenses if the household moves or reports a change. Unreported or new medical expenses. Monthly allowable medical expens es that have changed by more t han $25. Changes in the legal obligation to pay child support, the obli gated amount, and the am ount of actual payments made to non-household members. Newly obtained Social Security Numbers. Work hours for individuals who are satisfying the ABAWD work r equirements. Other information that has changed if questionable. Do not verify: Monthly allowable medical expenses that are unchanged or have changed by $25 or less, unless the information is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent, or more than 12 months ol d. Unchanged child support payments, unless questionable. Unchanged information, except for income, unless the informati on is incomplete, inaccurat e, inconsistent, or more than 12 months old. B. For changes reported during th e certification period, verify: The same information as verif ied at initial certification. All income. Shelter and utility expenses if the household re ports a change .TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE39 Do not verify: Total recurring medical expenses unless the information is inc omplete, inaccurate, inconsistent, or more than 12 months old. 11 DE Reg. 216 (08/01/07) 13 DE Reg. 267 (08/01/09) 9039 Normal Processing Standard 9039.1 Thirty-Day Processing Provide eligible households that complete the initial applicati on process an opportunity to participate as soon as possible, but no later that 30 calendar days following the date the application was filed. The following exception applies fo r residents of public institutions who apply jointly for SSI and food stamp benefits prior to release from the institution per DSSM 9015. For residents of public institutions who apply for food stamps prior to their release from the institution, provid e an opportunity to participate as soon as possible, but not late r than 30 calendar days from the date of release of the applicant from the institution. The 30 day period begins on the day following the date of the a pplication (do not include the date of application in the thirty (30) days). Action (computer input) must take place on or before the 26th day for mailed EBT cards. Do not delay due to weekends or holidays. If work cannot be completed by the 26th day, the worker issues a pendi ng notice (Form 340) on the 26th day. If the 26th day falls on a weekend or holiday, action must take place on t he last preceding day. Action must take place on the 27th, 28th, or 29th day for those clients picking up their EBT cards at a card iss uance site. This ensures the client can have access to their benefits by the 30th day. Instances of computer error, su ch as computer down time, will s till be considered errors by FNS, but worker will document the reason in the case record. 9 DE Reg. 799 (11/01/05) 9039.2 Opportunity to Participate An opportunity to participate consists of providing households with Food Stamp benefits they can access by the 30th day. 9039.3 Denying the Application Households that are found to be ineligible must be sent a notic e of denial as soon as possible but not later than 30 days following the date the application was filed. If the household has failed to appear for a scheduled interview and has made no subsequent contact with DSS to express interest in pursuing the application, send the household a notice of denial on the 30th day following the date of application. The household m ust file a new application if it wishes to participate in the program. If the 30th day falls on a weekend or holiday, action must take place on the next working day. In cases where DSS was able to conduct an interview and request all of the necessary verification on the same day the application was filed, and no subsequent requests for verificat ion have been made, DSS may also deny the application on the 30th day if the Division provided assistance to the househo ld in obtaining verification per DSSM 9035.1, but the household failed to provide the requested verification. 9040 Delays in Processing [273.2(h)] If the agency does not determine a household's eligibility and provide an opportunity to participate within 30 days following the date the applicati on was filed, t he agency will t ake the following action: A. Determining Cause - The agency must have taken the followin g actions before a delay is considered the fault of the household: 1. For households that failed to complete the application form: offered or attempted to offer assistance in its completion.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE40 2. For households with members who failed to register for work: informed the household of the need to register for work, determined if the household members are exem pt from work registration, and given at least ten (10) days to do so. 3. In cases where verification is incomplete, DSS must have prov ided the household with a statement of required verification (Form 105) and offered to assist the hous ehold in obtaining required verification and allowed the household sufficient time to p rovide the missing verification. A delay is considered the fault of the household if the househo ld has failed to complete the application process even though DSS has taken all action required to assist the household. DSS must have taken the following actions before a delay can be considered the fault of the house hold: For households that have failed to complete the application for m, offer, or attempt to offer, assistance in its completion. Where verification is incomplete, provide assistance as require d in DSSM 9035. Allow the household sufficient time to provide the m issing verification. Sufficien t time is at least ten (10) days from the date of the initial r equest for the particular verific ation that was missing. 4. For households that have failed to appear for an interview, D SS must notify the household that it missed the scheduled interview and that the household is responsible f or rescheduling the missed interview. If the household contacts DSS within the 30-day pr ocessing period, DSS must sche dule a second interview. If the household fails to schedule a second interview, or the subsequent interview is po stponed at the household's request or cannot otherwise be rescheduled until after the 20th day but before the 30th day fo llowing the date the application was filed, the household must appear for the interview, bring verification, and register memb ers for work by the 30th day; otherwise, the delay will be the fault of the household. If the household has failed to appear for the first interview, fails to schedule a second interview, and/ or a subsequent interview is post poned at the household's reque st until after the 30th day following the date the application was filed, the delay will be the fault of the household. If th e household has missed both sched uled interviews and requests another interview, any delay will be the fault of the household . B. Determine Fault of the Household 1. If by the 30th day the agency cannot take any further action on the application due to the fault of the household, send a notice of denial. If the household takes the required action within 60 days of the date the application was filed, reopen the case with out requiring a new application. 2. The household is not entitled to benefits for the month of ap plication when the delay was the fault of the household . C. Determine Fault of DSS 1. Whenever a delay during the initial 30-day period is agency f ault, take immediate corrective action. Notify the household of any action it must take to complete the applic ation. If verification is lacki ng, hold the application pendin g for only 30 days following the date of the initial request. 2. Do not deny the application if DSS caused the delay. Instead , notify the household by the 30th day following the date the applicati on was filed that its applicati on is being held pending. 3. If the household is found to be eligible during the second 30 -day period, the hous ehold will be entitled to benefits retroactive to the month of applic ation. If, however, the household is found to be i neligible, deny t he application. D. Delays beyond 60 Days 1. If DSS is at fault for not completing the application process by the end of the second 30-day period, and the case file is otherwise complete, continue to process the or iginal application until an eli gibility determination is reache d. If the household is determined eligible, and DSS was at fault f or the delay in the initial 30 days, give the household benefit s retroactive to the month of application. However, if the initi al delay was the household's fault, give the household benefits retroactive only to the month following the month of applicatio n. Use the original applicatio n to determine the household's eligibility in the m onths following t he 60-day period. 2. If DSS is at fault for not completing the application process by the end of the second 30- day period, but the case file is not complete enough to r each an eligibility de termination, deny the case and notify the household to file a new application. If the case is denied, advise the household o f its possible entitlement to benefits lost as a result of DSS caused delays in accordance with DSSM 9011. If DSS was also at fault for the delay in the initial 30 days, the amount of benefits lost would be calculate d from the month of application . If, however, the household wa s at fault for t he initial dela y, the amount of benefits lost woul d be calculated from the month following the month of application. 3. If the household is at fault fo r not completing the applicati on process by the end of the second 30-day period, deny the application and require the household to file a new application. As DSS has chosen to hold an application pending only until 30 days follo wing the date of the initial re quest for the particular verification that was missing, if theTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE41 verification is not received by that 30th day, immediately deny the application. A notice of denial need not be sent if the notice of pending status informed the household that it would h ave to file a new application if verification was not received within 30 days of the initial r equest. The household will not be entitled to any lost benefits , even if the delay in the init ial 30 days was the fault of DSS. 9041 Expedited Service [273.2(i)] The following households are en titled to expedited service: 1. Households with less than $150 in monthly gross income, provi ded their liquid resources (i.e., cash on hand, checking or savings accounts, savings certificates and lump sum payments) as specified in DSSM 9059(H) do not exceed $100; 2. Migrant or seasonal farmworker households who are destitute a s defined in DSSM 9067 provided their liquid resources (i.e., cash on hand, checking or savings accounts, sa vings certificates, and lump s um payments) as specified in DSSM 9059 (H) do not exceed $100; 3. Households whose combined monthly gross income and liquid res ources are less than t he household's monthly rent or mortgage , and utilities, (includin g entitlement to a SU A, as appropriate, under DSSM 9060). 9041.1 Processing Standards For households entitled to expedited service, benefits must be available to the recipient not later than the seventh calendar day following the date an application was filed. For a resident of a public institution who applies for benefits pri or to his/her release from the institution in accordance with DSSM 9015 and who is ent itled to expedited service, the filing date is the date of release of the applicant from the institution. There are no exceptions to these requirements for weekends or holidays. The table below shows filing days, the respective days by which the data must be system- entered and the day the benefits are made available to the household. When an applicant comes in and is found eligible for expedited services, but they do not w ant the benefits because of anticipated changes (a move or new household members), we are r equired to issue the household expedited benefits. The only way we cannot expedite is w hen identity has not been verif ied or the household fails to file a completed application. 9 DE Reg. 799 (11/01/05) 9041.2 Drug Addicts an d Alcoholics, Group Living Arrangement Fa cilities For residents of drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and reha bilitation centers and residents of group living arrangements who are entitled to expedited service, benefits mu st be made available not later than the seventh calendar day following the date an application was filed. 9041.3 Out-of-Office Interviews For a household entitled to expedited service and a waiver of t he office interview, conduct the interview (unless the household cannot be reached) and complete the application proce ss within the expedited service standards. The first day of this count is the calendar d ay following application filing. If DSS conducts a telephone interview and must mail the application to the household fo r signature, the mailing time in volved will not be calculate d in the expedited service standards. Mailin g time will only include the days the applica tion is in the mail to and from the household and the days the application is in the household' s possession pending signature and mailing.Day of ApplicationLast Day to Confirm in DCISDay Benefits Made Available Monday Thursday Friday Tuesday Friday Monday Wednesday Monday Tuesday Thursday Tuesday WednesdayFriday Wednesday ThursdayTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE42 9041.4 Late Determinations If DSS in prescreening individuals or applications, fails to id entify a household as being entitled to expedited service and later discovers that the household was entitled, provide ex pedited service within the processing standards in this section. The processing standard, seven day timeframe, is calcu lated from the date that DSS discovers the household is entitled to expedited service. 9041.5 Residents of Shelters f or Battered Women and Children Residents of shelters for battered women and children who are o therwise entitled to expedited service will be handled in accordance with the time limits in DSSM 9041.1. 9041.6 Special Procedures for Expedited Service 1) Verification - To expedite the certification process, use the following procedures: In all cases, the applicant's iden tity (i.e., th e identity of t he person making the applicatio n) will be verified through a collateral contact or readily available documentary evidence as specified in DSSM 9032. Once an acceptable collateral contact has been designated, prom ptly contact the collateral contact in accordance with DSSM 9034.2. Although the household has the primary respo nsibility for providing other ty pes of verification, assist the household in promptly obtaining the necessary verification. All reasonable efforts will be mad e to verify within the expedi ted processing standards the household's residency, in accordance with DSSM 9032.6, income statement (including a s tatement that the household has no income), liquid resources and all other factors required by DSSM 9032, through collateral contacts or read ily available documentary evidence. However, benefits will not be delayed beyond the del ivery standards prescribed in DSSM 9041.1 solely because these eligibility factors have not been verified. Households that have recently moved from another state or terri tory where they were food stamp recipients and claim that they did not receive b enefits for the current month should be handled as follows: If eligible f or expedited benefits: Contact the former agency to determine if benefits were mailed and not returned, or if the benefit was received. If the former agency cannot confirm, have the client write and sign a statement that the household did not receive their benefits at the former location. Issue the expedited benefits. Follow up with the former agency to determine if the household did receive the benefits there and, if so, process a claim for duplicate issuance. 2) Social Security Numbers - Those household members unable to p rovide the required SSN's or who do not have one prior to the sec ond full month of par ticipation will be all owed to continue to participat e only if they satisfy the good cause requirements with respect to SSN's specified in DSSM 9012 , except that households with a newborn may have up to six months following the month th e baby was born to provide an SSN or proof of applicat ion for the newborn. 3) Work registration - require the applicant to register (unless exempt or unless the household has designated an authorized representative to apply on its behalf in accordance with DSSM 9016). Attempt to register other household members but postpone the registration of other household member s if it cannot be accomplished within the expedited service time frame. Attempt to verify questionable wor k registration exemptions, bu t such verification will be pos tponed if the expedited service time frame cannot be met. 4) Certification period - Househol ds certified on an expedited b asis who have provided all ne cessary verification prior to certification will be assigned a normal certif ication period . If verification was postpone d, certify these households for the month of application (the month of application and the subseque nt month for those households applying after the 15th of the month) or, assign a normal certification period to those ho useholds whose circumstances would otherwise warrant a longer certification period. For households applying on or bef ore the 15th of the month, ass ign a one-month or normal certification period. Verification requirements may be postponed until the second mon th of participation. If a one-month certification period is assigned, a notice must be given to the household that explains what postponed verificati ons must be returned. For subsequent months, the household must reapply and provide all v erification requirements that were postponed or beTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE43 certified under normal processing standards. If the household does not provide the postpone d verifications and does not appear for an interview, n o further action is taken. For households applying after the 15th of the month, assign a t wo-month certification or normal certification period of no more than 12 months. Verification may be postponed until the third month of participation to meet the expedited timeframe. If a two-month certification period is assigned, a n otice must be given to the household that explains what postponed verifications must be returned. For subsequent months , the household must reapply and provide all verification requirements that were postponed or be certified under normal p rocessing standards. If the household does not provide the postponed verifications and does not appear for an interview, n o further action is taken. When a certification period of longer than two months is assigned and verification is postpone d, households must be sent a notice advising that no benefits for the third month will be issued until the postponed verifications are provided. T he notice must also advise the household that if the verification process results in changes i n the household's e ligibility or level of benefits, DSS will ac t on those changes without advance notice of adverse action. Households which apply for initial benefits after the 15th of t he month, are entitled to expedited service, and have been determined eligible to receive benefits for the initial mo nth and the next subsequent month, shall receive a combined allotment. The combined allotments, which are the prorated bene fits for the initial month and the first full month's benefit, are both issued within the expedi ted service timeframe. Verific ation shall be postponed to m eet the expedited timeframe. Expedited benefits shall not be issued to households which have been determined ineligible to receive benefits for the month of application or the following month, or to househol ds which have not satisfied the postponed verifications requirements. There is no limit to the number of times a household can be cer tified under expedited procedures, as long as prior to each expedited certification, the household either completes the verification requirements that were postponed at the last expedited certification or was c ertified under normal processin g standards since the last expedited certification. Households requesting, but not entitled to, expedited service w ill have their applications processed according to the normal processing standards. 9042 Categorically Eligible Households [273.2(j)] Households applying for food stamps whose gross income is at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level are categorically eligible unless specifically excluded in DSSM 904 2.2 or 9042.3. The househo ld is categorically eligible because Delaware uses TANF funds to provide pregnancy preventio n information. Reduction of out-of-wedlock pregnancies is the 3rd purpose of the TANF program. The authorization to receive inf ormation and/or services for pr egnancy prevention is included on all applications for food stamps as follows: AUTHORIZATION FOR RECEIPT OF PR EGNANCY PREVENTION INFORMATION You are authorized to receive pregnancy prevention information. If you wish to receive this information you can call Planned Parenthood at 1-800-230-PLAN (7526). If you wish to ge t teen pregnancy prevention information, you may also call the Alliance for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention at 1-800- 499-WAIT (9248). You can also call the Delaware Helpline at 1-800-464-4357 for the Public Health Family Planning clinic in your area. 9042.1 Applicant TANF/GA/RCA Households Conduct a single interview at in itial certification for TANF/GA /RCA and food stamp purposes . A household's eligibility for food stamp out- of- office interview provisions in DSSM 903 0 does not relieve the househo ld of any responsibility for a face-to-face interview to be certified for TANF/GA/RCA. For households applying for both TANF/GA/RCA and food stamps, f ollow the verification p rocedures described in DSSM 9032 for those factors of eligibility needed solely for pu rposes of determin ing the household's eligibility for food stamps. For those factors of e ligibility needed t o determine b oth TANF/GA/RCA and food stamp eligibility, use TANF/GA/ RCA verification rules. Do not delay the household's food stam p benefits if, at the end of 30 days following the date the application was filed, DSS has suf ficient verification to meet the requirements in DSSM 9032, but does not have sufficient verification to meet the TANF/GA/RCA verification rules.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE44 To determine if a household will be eligible due to its status as a recipient TANF/GA/RCA/SSI household, temporarily postpone, within the 30- day proc essing standard, the food stam p eligibility determi nation if the househo ld is not entitled to expedited service and appears to be categorically eligible. Po stpone denying a potentially c ategorically eligible household until the 30th day in case the household is determined eligible to receive TANF/GA/RCA benefits. Once the TANF/GA/RCA application is approved, consider the hous ehold categorically eligible if it meets all the criteria concerning categorical eligibility in DSSM 9042. If DSS can an ticipate the amount and date o f receipt of the initial TANF/ GA/RCA payment, but the payment will not be received until a su bsequent month, vary the hous ehold's food stamp benefit level according to the anticipated receipt of the payment and n otify the household. Disregard portions of initial TANF/GA/ RCA payments intended to retroactively cover a previous month a s lump sum payments. If the amount or date of receipt of the initial TANF/GA/RCA pay ment cannot be reasonably anticipated at the time of the food stamp eligibility determination, handl e the TANF/GA/RCA pa yments as a change in circumstances and issue a notice through DCIS to explain the adverse action. Ensure that the denied application of a potentially categorical ly eligible household is easily retrievable. For a household filing a join t application for f ood stamps and TANF/G A/RCA benefits or a household that has a TANF/GA/RCA application pending and is denied food stamps, but is later det ermined eligible to receive TANF/GA/RCA benefits and is otherwise categorically eligible , provide benefits using the or iginal application and any other pertinent information occurrin g subsequent to that application. Except for residents of public institutions who apply jointly for SSI and food stamp benefits prior to their release from a public institution in accordance with DSSM 9015, pay benefits fr om the beginning of the period for which TANF/GA/RCA or SSI benef its are paid, the original fo od stamp application date, or December 23, 1985, whichever is later. Residents o f public institutions who apply jointly for SSI and food stamp benefits prior to their release from the institution are to be paid benefits from the date of t heir release from the institution. Use any available informati on to update the application and/or make mail or phone contact wit h the household or authorized representative to determine any changes in circumstances. If any information obtained from the household differs from that which DSS obtained from available information or the household provided additional chan ges in information, arrange for the household or its authorized representative to initial all changes, re-sign, and date the updated application and provide necessary verification. Any household determined TANF/GA/RCA eligible within the 30- da y food stamp processing time will be provided benefits back to the date of the food stamp application. Do no t pay food stamp benefits for a month in which such household is ineligible for receipt of any TANF/GA/ RCA benefit s for the month, unless the household is eligible for food stamp benefits as an NPA case. Pro- rate benefits accordingly. Households filing joint applicati ons that are found categorical ly eligible after being denied NPA food stamps, should have their benefits pro- rated from the date TANF/GA/RCA benefits ar e payable, or the date of the original food stamp application, whichever is later. Re-evaluate the original appli cation either at the household's request or when it becomes otherwise aware of the househo ld's TANF/GA/RCA/SSI eligibility. (Notices of denial for NPA f ood stamps should inform the household to notify DSS of sub sequent approval for SSI benefits .) Households who file joint applications for food stamps and TANF /GA/RCA and whose TANF/GA/RCA applications are subsequently denied may have their food stamp eligibility deter mined or continued on the basis of the original application and any other documented information obtained subsequent to the application which is relevan t to food stamp eligibility or level of benefits. If more than 30 days lapses between filing of the original joint application and the household's indicatio n that they want to reapply, a new applicat ion will be required. Do not require households whose TANF/GA/RCA applications are de nied to file new food stamp applications. Their food stamp eligibility should be c ontinued or det ermined on the basis of the original applicat ions filed jointly for TANF/GA/ RCA and food stamp purposes and any other documented informatio n obtained subsequent to the application which may have been used in the TANF/GA/RC A determination and which is re levant to food stam p eligibility or level of benefits. 9042.2 Categorically Eligible Households Any household in which all members receive or are authorized to receive TANF/GA/RCA and/or SSI benefits are considered eligible for food stamps because of their status as TANF/GA/ RCA and/or SSI recipients unless the entire household is institutionalized as defined in DSSM 9015 or disqu alified for any reason from receiving food stamps. Residents of public institution s who apply jointly for SSI and food stamp benefits prior to the ir release from the institution in accordance with DSSM 9015 are not categorically eligible upon a finding by SSA of potential SSI eligibility prior to such release. Consider the individua ls categorically eligible. At such time as a final SSI eligib ility determinati on has b een mad e and the individual has been released from the institution. The eligibility factors which are deemed for food stamp eligibilit y without the verification required in DSSM 9032 because of PA/SS I status are the resource, gross and net income limits,TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE45 Social Security Number information, sponsored alien information a n d r e s i d e n c y . I f a n y o f t h e f o l l o w i n g f a c t o r s a r e questionable, verify that the hou sehold which is considered cat egorically eligible: Contains only members that are T ANF/GA/RCA or SSI recipients (a s defined in DSSM 9042); Meets the household definition in DSSM 9013.1; Includes all persons who purchase and prepare food together in one food stamp household regardless of whether or not they are separate units fo r TANF/GA/RCA or SSI purposes; and Includes no persons who have been disqualified. Assume categorical eligibility at recertification in the absenc e of a timely redetermination. If a recertified household is subsequently terminated from TAN F/GA/RCA benefits, follow the p rocedures in DSSM 9089 as appropriate. Under no circumstances will any household be cons idered categor ically eligible if any member of that household is disqualified for an intentional Pr ogram violation in accordance with DSSM 2023, 2024, 2026, and 2027. These households are subject t o all food stamp eligibility and benefit provisions and cannot be reinstated in the Program on th e basis of categorical eligibility provisions. Do not include any person as a me mber in any household which is otherwise categorically e ligible if tha t person is: An ineligible alien as d efined in DSSM 9007; Ineligible under t he student provisi ons in DSSM 9010; Ineligible under the fleeing fel or probation provis ions in DSSM 2025; Institutionalized as defined is DSSM 9 015; or Ineligible because of failure to comply wit h a work requirement of DSSM 9018. For the purposes of work registration, apply the exemptions in DSSM 9018.3 to individuals in categorically eligible households. Any such individual who is not exempt from work re gistration is subject to the other work requirements in DSSM 9018.1. 9043 SSI Households [273.2(k)] To facilitate their participatio n in the Program, households in which all members are applying for or receiving SSI may apply for food stamp benefits in Social Security Administration (SSA) offices if: 1. They are not presently partici pating in the Food Stamp Progra m; 2. They have not applied for food stamps in the thirty (30) prec eding days; 3. They do not have pending food stamp applications. Households applying simultaneously for SSI and food stamps are subject to food stamp eligib ility criteria. Base benefit levels solely on food stamp elig ibility criteria until the hous ehold is considered categorically eligible. However, household s in which all members are either TANF/GA/RCA or SSI recipients o r authorized to receive TANF /GA/RCA or SSI benefits as defined in DSSM 9042 are food stamp eligible based on their TAN F/GA/RCA/SSI status as provided for in that section. Households denied NPA food stamps that have an SSI application pending will be informed on the DCIS notice of denial of the possibility of categorical eligibility if they become SSI r ecipients. 9043.1 Initial Application an d Eligibility Determination 1) Whenever a member of a household consisting only of SSI appli cants or recipients transacts business at an SSA office, the SSA will info rm the household of: a) Its right to apply f or food stamps at th e SSA office without going to the food stamp office; and b) Its right to apply a t a food stamp office if it chooses to do so. 2) The SSA will accept and complete food stamp applications rece ived at the office from SSI households and forward them, within one working day after receipt of a signed applicat ion, to the designated DSS office, along with a transmittal form. 3) SSA will complete joint SSI and f ood stamp applications for r esidents of public institutions in accordance with DSSM 9015. 4) Except for applications taken in accordance with item (3), ma ke an eligibility determinat ion and issue food stamp benefits to eligible SSI households within 30 days following th e date the application was received by SSA. Make an eligibility determination and iss ue food stamp benefits to a re sident of a public institution who applies jointly for SSI and food stamps within 30 days following the date of the applicant' s release from the institution. Expedited processing timeTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE46 standards for an applicant who has applied for food stamps and SSI prior to release also begin on the date of the applicant's release from the institution . SSA will notify DSS of the release date. If, for any r eason, DSS is not notified o n a timely basis of the applicant's release date, restore benefits in accordance with DSSM 9011 to such applicant back to the date of release. Applications will be considered f iled for normal processing pur poses when the signed application is received by SSA. Expedited processing time s tandards will begin on the dat e DSS receives a food stamp application. Food Stamp applications and supporting documentation sent to an incorrect DSS office will be sent by DSS within one working day of receipt of the application, to the correct o ffice. Applications and accompanying information must be forwarded to the agreed upon address in accordance with the time standards cont ained in (2) above. 5) Households in which all members are applying for or participa ting in SSI will not be required to see a DSS worker, or otherwise be subjected to an additional State interview. Th e food stamp application will be processed by DSS. Do not contact the household further in order to obtain information fo r certification for food stamp benefits unless: a) The application is i mproperly completed; b) Mandatory verification requi red by DSSM 9032 is missing; or c) DSS determines that certain information on the application is questionable. In no event would the applicant be required to appear at the fo od stamp office to finalize the eligibility determination. Further contact made in accordance with thi s section will not c onstitute a second food stam p verification interview. 6) SSA will refer non-SSI households to the correct f ood stamp o ffice. Process these applications in accordance with the procedures no ted in DSSM 9027 and DSSM 9028 . Applications from such households will be considere d filed on the date the signed application is taken at the correct DSS office, and the normal and expedited processing time standards will begin on th at date. 7) SSA will prescreen all applicatio ns for entitlement to expedi ted services on the day the application is received at the SSA office and will mark \"Expedited Processing\" on the firs t page of all households' applications that appear to be entitled to such processing. SSA will inform households which appear to meet the criteria for expedited service that benefits may be issued a few day s sooner if the household appli es directly at the food stamp office. 8) Prescreen all applications received from SSA for entitlement to expedited service on the day the application is received at the correc t food stamp office. All SSI households entitled to e xpedited service will be certif ied in accordance with DSSM 9041 except that the expedited processing time standard will begi n on the date the application is received at the correct DSS office. 9) Develop and implement a method to determine if members of SSI households whose app lications are forwarded by SSA are already participating in the Food Stamp Program dire ctly through DSS. 10) If SSA takes an SSI applicatio n or redetermination on the te lephone from a member of a pure SSI household, a food stamp application will also be completed during the teleph one interview. In these cases, the food stamp application will be mailed to the claimant fo r signature for return to the SSA office or DSS office. SSA will then forward any food stamp applications it receives to DSS. Do not require the household to be interviewed again in the foo d stamp office. Do not contact the household further in order to obtain information for certification for fo od stamp benefits except in accordance with (5) above. 11) To SSI recipients redetermi ned for SSI by mail, SSA will sen d a stuffer informing them of their right to file a food stamp application at the SSA offi ce (if they are members of a p ure SSI household) or at their local food stamp office, and their right to an out-of-office food stamp interview to be perf ormed by DSS if the household is unable to appoint an authorized representative. 12) DSS will provide and SSA will di stribute information to all jointly processed households. This material will inform the household of the following: Address and telephone number of the household's correct food st amp office, the remaining actions to be taken in the application process, and a statement that a household shoul d be notified of the food stamp determination within thirty (30) days and can contact DSS if it receives no notification wi thin thirty days, or has other questions or problems. It will also include the client's rights and responsibilities (includin g fair hearings, authorized representatives, out-of-office interviews, reporting changes and timely reapplication), inform ation on how to obtain food stamp benefits, and how to use food stamp benefits. 9043.2 VerificationTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE47 1) Ensure that information required by DSSM 9032 is verified pri or to certification for hou seholds initially applying. Households entitled to expedited services will be processed in accordance with DSSM 9041. 2) Verify SSI benefit payments th ough the State Data Exchange (S DX), the Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX) and/or through verification provided by the household. Information verified through S DX or BENDEX will not be reverifi ed unless it is questionable. Households will be given the opportunity to provide verification from another source if all necessary information is not available on the SDX or the BENDEX, or if the SDX/ BENDEX information is contradictory to ot her household information. 9043.3 Certification Period 1) Certify jointly processed hous eholds for up to twelve months, according to the stan dards in DSSM 9068. 2) In cases jointly processed in which the SSI determination res u lt s in den ial, an d DSS b elie ve s tha t foo d st amp eligibility or benefit levels may be affected, send the househo ld a notice of expiration advising that the certification perio d will expire the end of the month f ollowing the month in which t he notice is sent and that it must reapply if it wishes to continue to participate. The notice will also explain that its certification period is e xpiring because of changes in circumstances which may affect food stamp eligibility or benefit levels and that the household s may be entitled to an out-of-office interview, in accordance with DSSM 9030. 9043.4 Changes in Circumstances 1) Households will report changes i n accordance wit h the require ments in DSSM 9085 . Process changes in accordance with the same section. 2) Within ten (10) days of learning of the determination of the application for SSI through SDX, the household, or from any other source, take required action in a ccordance with DSSM 9085. 3) Process adjustments to SSI cas es resulting from mass changes, in accordance with provisions of DSSM 9086. 9043.5 SSI Households Applyi ng at the Food Stamp Office Allow SSI households to submit fo od stamp applications to DSS o ffices rather than through SSA if the household chooses. In such cases, all verification, including that pertaining to S SI program benefits, will be p rovided by the household, by SDX or BENDEX, or obta ined by the State agen cy rather than bein g provided by SSA. 9043.6 Restoration of Lost Benefits Restore to the household benefits which were lost whenever the loss was cau se d b y a n er r or b y DSS o r by SSA through joint processing. Such an error will include, but not be limited to, the loss of an applicant's food stamp application after it had been filed with SSA. Lost benefits will be r estored in acc ordance with DS SM 9011. 9043.7 Recertification Complete application process and approve or deny timely applica tions for recertification in accordance with DSSM 9091. Jointly processed households which have received a food stamp n otice of expiration and go to an SSA office for an SSI redetermination will be entitled to make a timely application f or recertification at the SSA office. SSA will forward the completed application, transmittal form, and any available veri fication to the design ated food stamp office. A face-to-face interview will be waived if requested by a house hold consisting entirely of SSI participants unable to appoint an authorized representative. Provide SSI households wi th a notice of expiration in accordance with DSSM 9006, except that such notification will inform househol ds consisting entirely of SSI recipients that they are entitled to a waiver of a face-to-face interview if the household is unable to appoint an authorized representative. Such households will not be requir ed to appear at a second offi ce interview, although DSS may conduct an out-of-office interview, if necessary. 9044 Providing Benefits to ParticipantsTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE48 [274.2] DSS is responsible for the timely and accurate issuance of bene fits to certified eligible households. Assist those households comprised of elderly o r disabled members which have difficulty reaching issuance offices, and households which do not reside in a permanent dwellin g or a fixed mailing address by finding authorized r epresentatives to act on their behalf or by other appropriate means. 9044.1 Newly-Certified Households All newly certified households, e xcept those that are given exp edited service, must be given an opportunity to participate no later than thirty (30) calendar days following t he date the application was file d. An opportunity to participat e consists of providing households with access to their benefits. A household has not been pr ovided an opportunity to participate within the 30-day sta ndard if the benefits are not posted to their EBT account by the 30th day. 12 DE Reg. 344 (09/01/08) 9044.2 Households Certified Under the Expedited Se rvice Process ing Timeframes Households applying fo r initial benefits after the fifteenth da y of the month under the expedited service procedures must receive their prorated allo tment for the initial month of application and their first full month's allotment at the same time if: They have completed the application; and They have been determined eligible to receive benefits for the initial month of application and the next subsequent month. 9044.3 Households Not Entit led to Combined Allotments The provision of DSSM 9044.2 does not apply to households deter mined ineligible to receive benefits for the initial month of application or the next subsequent month. Households eligible for expedite d service may receiv e benefits for the initial month under verification standards set forth in DSSM 90 41.6 Special Procedures for Expedited Service. Additionally, do not issue initial benefits of less than $10 under the provis ion Allowable Resources [273.8] Resource standards of eligibility apply to all applicant househ olds, including Public Assistance, General Assistance, and SSI households. The maximum allowed resources, including bo th liquid and non-liquid assets of all members of all applicant households may not exceed $2,000, except that, for ho useholds including a member(s) age 60 or over or disabled per DSSM 9013.1, such resources will not exceed $3,000 . Households that are categorically eligible as defined in DSSM 9042 do not have to meet th e resource limit s or definition s in this section. 9046 Countable Resources [7 CFR 273.8(c)] Count the followin g resources when deter mining eligibility for food benefit purposes for non-categorical eligible households: A. Liquid Resources 1. Cash on hand 2. Money in checking or savings accounts 3. Savings certificates4. Stocks 5. Bonds 6. Lump sum payments7. Non-deferred business or per sonal loans in month of receipt 8. The portion of the equity value of a funeral agreement that e xceeds $1,500 per household member B. Non-Liquid Resources, not spec ifically excluded under 9049. 1. Personal propertyTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE49 2. Licensed and unlicensed vehicles 3. Buildings, land, recreational properties and any other proper ty The value of non-exempt resources is the equity value, except f or licensed vehicles per DSSM 9051. The equity value is the fair mark et value minus encumbrances. C. Deemed Resources of the sponsor (and sponsor's spouse) for sp onsored aliens per DSSM 9081.2. 12 DE Reg. 1090 (02/01/09) 9047 Jointly Owned Resources [273.8(d)] Resources held jointly by sepa rate households will be considere d available in their entirety to each household, unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant household that such res ources are inaccessible to that household. (See DSSM 4002.3). If a household can demonstrate that it has access to only a por tion of the resource, the value of that portion of the resource will be counted toward t he household's resource level. In arriving at a determinati on of ownership, the following items should be considered: A statement by the claimant namin g the actual owner of the fund s. An explanation as to why a joint account was established. Information regarding who makes deposits and withdrawals. How the funds are spen t, (i.e., access capa bility of each party ). If appropriate, a change in the account designation verified by the financial institution. The resource will be considered totally inaccessible to the hou sehold if the resource cannot practically be subdivided and the household's access to the value of the resource is depe ndent on the agreement of a joint owner who refuses to comply. For the purpose of this provision, ineligible aliens or disqualified individuals res iding with the household will be considered household members. Resources will be c onsidered inaccessible to persons residing i n shelters for battered women and children if: 1. The resources are jointly own ed by such person s and by member s of their former household; and 2. The shelter resident's access to the value of the resources i s dependent on the agreement of a joint owner who still resides in the former household. When one of the owners of a joint ly owned resource is categoric ally resource eligible in a mixed household, the total resource is excluded. For example, a household may consist of two members, one receiv ing SSI and/or TANF and the other receives no assistance. They jointly own resources that are totally accessi ble to either party. Since one member receives SSI and/or TANF, the jointly owned resourc e is totally excluded in determi ning the household's resources for food stamp purposes. 9048 Inaccessible Resources [273.8] Resources that cannot be sold or disposed of for a significant return shall be identified as inaccessible. Any resource can be considered inaccessible if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. This means the household is unlikely to be able to sell the resource for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively slight or becaus e the cost of selling the house hold's interest would be greater than the value o f the resource. The determination of whether any part of the value of a vehicle is included as a resource must be made in accordance to DSSM 9051. An example of an inaccessible resource is heir property where t he heirs inherit individual fractional interests in a decedent's property. The value of the fractional interest in th e property may be less than the cost of selling the property. Therefore, it can be c onsidered inaccessible to the household. A significant return shall be any return, after estimated costs of sale or disposition, and taking into account the ownership interest of the househ old, that DSS determines are mo re than $1,500. Any significant amount of funds shall be funds amounting to mor e than $1,500. Verify the value of a resource to be excluded only if the infor mation provided by the ho usehold is questionable. This inaccessible resource provi sion does not apply to negotiab le financial instruments such as stocks and bonds.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE50 9049 Excluded Resources [7 CFR 273.8(e)] Exclude the following resources when determining eligibility fo r food benefit purposes fo r non-categorical eligible households: A. Property 1. Home the household resides in. 2. Property surrounding the home not separated by intervening pr operty owned by others, except for public rights of way such as roads. 3.

Property or work-related equipm ent essential to the employmen t or self-employment of a household member such as farmland, to ols, or machinery. 7. Property essential to the self-employment of a household memb er engaged in farming is excluded for one year from the date the household member terminates his/her self-empl oyment from farming. 8. Installment contracts for the sale of land or other buildings are exempt if the contract or agreement is producing income consistent with its fair market value. The value of the property sold under such contract or held as security in exchange for a purchase price consistent with the fair market v alue of that property is also excluded. 9. Security deposits on rent al property or utilities. 10. Property in probate and property which the household is maki ng a good faith effort to sell at a reasonable price. 11. Property (or portions of) that it is directly related to the maintenance or use of a v ehicle excluded under DSSM 9051 (1, 2, and 6). For example, property used to park a produc e truck on for sales, overnight parking and/or maintenance. B. Household goods and personal effects.C. Cash value of life insurance policies. D. One burial plot per household member. E. Value of one bona fide funeral agreement (not exceeding $1,50 0) per household member. F. Licensed vehicles per DSSM 9051. G. Governmental payments for the restoration of a home damaged i n a disaster. Examples are payments from the Individual and Family Grant program or the Small Business Admin istration. The household must be subject to a legal sanction if the household does not use the funds as intended. H. Irrevocable trust funds 1. Any funds in trust or funds transferred to a trust, and the i ncome produced by that trust that is not available to the household is inaccessible to the household if: (i) The trust arrangement is not likely to end during the certif ication period and no household member has the power to revoke the tr ust arrangement or change the name of the beneficiary during the certification period; (ii) The trustee administering the fund is either: (a) A court, or an institution, corporation, or organization whi ch is not under the direction or ownership of any household member, or (b) An individual appointed by the court who has court imposed l imitations placed on his/ her use of the funds which meet the requirements of this paragraph. (iii) Trust investments made on be half of the trust do not direc tly involve or assist any business or corporation under the control, direction or influence of a household member ; and (iv) The funds held in irrevocable trust are either: (a) Established from the households' own funds, if the trustee u ses the funds solely to make investments on behalf of the trust or to pay the educational or medical exp enses of any person named by the household creating the trust, or (b) Established from non-househol d funds by a non-household memb er.

Section 529 Qualifie d Tuition Programs Coverdell IRA 12 DE Reg. 1090 (02/01/09) 9050 Handling of Excluded Funds [273.8(f)] Excluded funds that are kept in a separate account, and that ar e not accumulated in an account with non-excluded funds retain their resource exclusion for an unlimited period o f time. The resources of students and self-employment households which are excluded as provided in DSSM 9049(9) and a re commingled in an accoun t with non-excluded funds retain their exclusion for the period of time over which they h ave been prorated as income. All other excluded monies which are commingled in an account with non-excluded funds reta in their exemption for six months from the date they are commingled. After six months from the date of commingling, all funds in the commingled account are counted as a resource. 9051 Licensed Vehicles [273.8(g)] Include as financial resources any boats, snowmobiles, and airp lanes used for recreational purposes, any vacation homes, any mobile homes used prim arily for vacatio n purposes, a nd any licensed vehicle (oth er than one used to produce income) to the extent that the fair market value of any such ve hicle exceeds the fair market value limit. (Refer to current October Cost-Of-Living Adjustment Administrative Notice for the fair market value limit.) Determine the fair market value of licensed automobiles, trucks , and vans by the value of those vehicles as listed in the NADA \"blue\" books published wi thin the last six months. Assign the average trade-in value. Do not increase the basic v alue of a vehicle by adding the value of low mileage or other factors such as optional equipment. However, vehicles wi th excessive high mileage can have the value of the vehicle decreased by using the High Mileage Tables in the front of the NADA books. A household may indicate that for some reason, such as body damage or in operability, a vehicle is in l ess than average condition. Any household which claims that the blue book value does not apply to its vehicle must be given the opportunity to acquire verificatio n of the true value from a reliable source. Also, households are to be asked to acquire verification of the value of licensed antique, custom made, or classic vehicles, if the Division is unable to make an accur ate appraisal. Do not increase the value of any vehicle if it is equipped with apparatus for the handicapped. Instead, assign a blue book value as if the vehi cle were not so equipped. If a vehicle is no longer listed in a blue book, the household's e stimate of the v alue of the vehicle will be accepted unless the Division has reason to believe t hat the estimate is incorrect. In that case and if it appears that the vehicle's value will a ffect eligibility, the household must obtain a appraisa l or produce o ther evidence of its value such as a newspaper advertisement which indicated the amount for w hich like vehicles are being so ld. If a new vehicle is not yet listed in the blue book, determine the wholesale value through some other means (e.g., contacting a car dealer whi ch sells that make of car). The entire value of any licens ed vehicle will be excluded if th e vehicle is: 1. Used primarily (over 50 percent of the time the vehicle is us ed) for income producing purposes such as, but not limited to a taxi, truck, or fi shing boat. Licensed vehicles wh ich have been previously used by a self-employed household member engaged in farming, but are no longer used over 50 perce nt of the time in farming because the household member has terminated their self-employment from farming continue to b e excluded as a resource for one year from the date the household member terminated their self-employment from farming; 2. Annually producing income consistent with its fair market val ue, even if used only on a seasonal basis; 3. Necessary for long distance travel, other than daily commutin g, that is essential to the employment of a household member (or ineligible alien or disqualified person wh ose resources are being considered available to the household); Examples would be a vehicle of a traveling salesperson or of a migrant farmwo rker following the workstream; 4. Used as the househol d's home and therefore excluded under DSS M 9049;TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE53 5. Necessary to transport a physically disabled household member (or ineligible alien or disqualified person whose resources are being considered available to the household ) regardless of the purpose of such transportation (limited to one vehicle per physically disabled household member). The vehicle does not need to have special equipment or be used primarily by or for the tr ansportation of the physically d isabled household member to be excluded. 6. Used to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when suc h transported fuel or wa ter is anticipated to be the primary source of fuel or water for the household. Do not require any further t ests concerning the nature, capabilities, or other uses o f the vehicle. 7. The value of the vehicle is inaccessible because its sale wou ld produce an estimated return of $1,500 or less according to DSSM 9048. The exclusions #1 through #3 will apply when the vehicle is not in use because of temporary unemployment, such as when a taxi driver is ill and cannot work , or when a fi shing boat is frozen in and cannot be used. Additionally, the value of property, real or personal, is exclu dable to the extent that it is directly related to the maintenance or use of a vehicle excluded under items (1), (2), or (6) above. Only that portion of real property determined necessary for maintenance or use is excludable under this provi sion. For example, a household which owns a produce truck to earn its livelihood may be prohibited from parking the truck in a residential area. The household may own a 100-acre field and use a quarter-acre of the field to park and/ or service the truck. Only the value of the quarter-acre would be excludable under this provisi on, not the entire 100- acre fi eld. Determining the value of non-excluded vehicles: Evaluate the fair mar ket value to each licensed vehicle not exc luded under 1-7 above; Count in full, regardless of any amounts owed on the vehicle, t he portion of the fair market value that exceeds $4,650. Evaluate such licensed, and all unlicensed vehicles, for their equity value which is the fair market value minus any amount owed; and Count as a resource only the gr eater of the two amounts if the vehicle has a countable fair market value of more than $4,650 and also h as a countable equity value. Only the following vehicles are exempt from the equity value te st above: 1. Vehicles excluded under items 1-7 above; 2. One licensed vehicle per household, regardless of the use of the vehicle; and 3. Any other vehicle a household member under age 18 (or ineligi ble alien or disqualified household member under age 18 whose resources are being considered availa ble to the household) drives to commute to and from employment, or to and from traini ng or education which is prepa ratory to employment, or to seek employment. This equity exclusion applies during temporary periods of unemployment to a vehicle which a household member under age 18 customarily drives to commu te to and from employment. If an individual is denied benefi ts because of the motor vehicl e license requirement, he or she must be notified that they may produce verification that their motor vehicle is not licensed from the Division of Motor Vehicles in order to determine the equity value of the unlicensed vehicle. 9052 Transfer of Resources [273.8(i)] At the time of application, hou seholds will be asked to provide information regarding any resources which any household member (or ineligible alien or disqualified person wh ose resources are being considered available to the household) had transferred within the three- month period immed iately preceding the date of application. Households which have transferred resources knowingly for the purpose of q ualifying or attempting to qualify for food stamp benefits will be disqualified from participa tion in the program for up t o one (1) year from the date of the discovery of the transfer. This disqualificatio n period will be applied if the resources a re transferred knowingly in the three-month period prior to application or if they are transferred knowingly after the hous ehold is determined eligible for benefits. An example of the latter would be assets which the household acquires after being certified and which are then transferred to prevent the household from exceeding the maximum resource limit. Eligibility for the program will not be af fected by the followi ng transfers: 1. Resources which would not otherwis e affect eligibility. For example, resources consist ing of excluded personal property such as furniture, or of money that, when added to other non-exempt househo ld resources, totaled less at the time of the tran sfer than the allowable resource limits. 2. Resources which are sold, or traded at, or nea r, fair market value.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE54 3. Resources which are transferred between members of the same h ousehold (including ineligible aliens or disqualified persons w hose resources are being considered avail able to the household). 4. Resources which are transferred for reasons other than qualif ying or attempting to qualify for food stamp benefits. For example, a parent placing fu nds into an educational trust f und described in DSSM 9049 (8). In the event that DSS establishes that an applicant household k nowingly transferred resources for the purpose of qualifying or attempting to qualify for food stamp benefits, the household will be sent a notice of denial explaining the reason for, and length of, the disqualification. The period of disqualification will begin in the month of application. If th e household is participating at th e time of the discovery of the transfer, a notice of adverse action explaining the reason for, and length of, the disqualific ation will be sent. The period of disqualification will be made effective with first allotment t o be issued after the notice of adver se action period has expired, u nless the household has requested a fair hearing and continued benefits. The length of the disqualification period will be based on the amount by which non-exempt transferred resources, when added to other countable r esources, exceeds the allowable resource limits. For example, if a one-person household with $1,750 in a bank transferred ownership of a car worth $5,000, $100 of that transfer would be considered because the first $4,650 of the car's value was exempt and an a dditional $250 of the transfe rred asset would have been applied toward the $ 2,000 resource limit . The following chart w ill be used to deter mine the period of disqualification: 9053 Resources of Non-Household and Excluded Household Members [273.8(i)] Handle the resources of non-household members (defined in DSSM as outlined in Income Eligibility Standards [273.9] [273.9(a)] Participation in the Program will be limited to those household s whose incomes are determined to be a substantial limiting factor in permitting them to obtain a more nutritious diet. Households which contai n an elderly or disabled member must meet the net income eligib ility standards for the Food Sta mp Program. Households which do not contain an elderly or disabled member must meet BOTH the net income e ligibility stand ards and the gross income eligibility standards for the Food Stamp Program. Households which are categorically eligibl e as defined in DSSM 9042 do not have to meet either the gross or net income e ligibility standards. The net and gross i ncome eligibility standards will be based on the Federal income poverty levels establishe d in Section 673(2) of the Comm unity Services Block Gran t Act [42 USC 9902(2)]. The income eligibility standard will be 130 perc ent of the Fede ral income poverty level. The net income eligibility will be 100 percent o f the Federal i ncome poverty level. The income eligibility limits are revised each October 1, to re flect the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) annual adjustment to the non-farm poverty guidelines. (Refer to the current October Cost-of-Living Adjustment Administrative Notice for t he income eligibility limits.) 9055 Defining Household Income 7 CFR 273.9 (b) DSS must consider household inco me when determini ng food benefi t eligibility.AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF RESOURCE LIMITPERIOD OF DISQUALIFICATION 0 to $ 249.99 1 month $ 250 to $ 999.99 3 months$1,000 to $2,999.99 6 months $3,000 to $4,999.99 9 months $5,000 and over 12 monthsTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE55 1.

Base a household's benefit level for the initial month of certi fication on the day of the month it applies for benefits. Applicant households consisting of residents of a public instit ution who apply jointly for SSI and food stamps prior to releas e from the public institution in accordance with DSSM 9015 will h ave their eligibility determined for the month in which the applicant household was released from the institution. Base a household's benefit level for the initial months of cert ification on the day of the month it applies for benefits. Provide benefits from the date o f application to the end of the month unless the applicant household consists of residents of a public institution. For households which apply for SSI prior to their release from a public institution, base the benefit l evel for the initial month of certification on the date of the month the household is released from the institution and provide the household benefits from the date of the household's release fro m the institution to the end of the month. Using a 30- day calendar month, households will re ceive benefits prorated from the day of application to the end of the month. A household applying on the 31st of a mont h will be treated as though it ap plied on the 30th of the month. Migrant and seasonal farmworkers will rece ive a full allotment for the month of appl ication when the household has participated in the Food Stamp Program within 30 days prior to the date of application. When certifying such a househo ld, use the first day of the month as the start date. To determine the amount of the prorated allotment, use the Food Stamp Allotment Proration Table provided by FNS. Allotments of less than $10 will not be issued for the initial month. The term \"initial month\" means the first month for which the ho usehold is certified for participation in the Food Stamp Program following any period during which the household was not certified for participation, except for migrant and seasonal farmworker households. In case of migrant and seasonal farmworker households, the term \"initial month\" means the first month for which the household is certified for partic ipation in the Food Stamp Program following any period of more than one (1) month during which the household was not certified for participation. Those households which are certified using the expedited servic e procedures in DSSM 9041, and which apply for benefits after the 15th of the month, will be certified for ben efits prorated from the day of application to the end of the application month and also for the following month. Benefits f or the second full month following the month of application shall not be issued u ntil all postponed ver ification is provide d to DSS. Do not prorate benefits for migrant/seasonal farmworker househo lds that have participated in the Food Stamp Program within 30 days prior to the date of application. If an application is held pending beyond 30 days and if the del ay is the fault of the househo ld, the first month for which an allotment will be issued to the household will be the month following the month of applic ation. This allotment will be prorated from th e date eligibility is est ablished by the househ old. 9061.2 Application for Recertification Determine eligibility fo r recertification based on circumstance s anticipated for the certificat ion period starting the month following the expiration of the current certification period. Base the level of benefits on the same anticipated circumstance s. If a household, other than a migrant farmworker household, submits an application after the household's certifi cation period has expired, that application shall be considered an initial application and benefits shall be prorate d. If a household's failure to timely apply for recertificatio n was due to agency error causing a break in participation, follow th e procedures in DSSM 9091.8. In addition, if the household submits an application for recertification prior to the end of its certification period but is found ineligible for one first month following the end of the certification period, then the first m onth of a subsequent participat ion will be considered an initia l month. Conversely, if the household submits an application for recertification prior to the en d of its certification period a nd is found eligible for the first month following the end of the certification period, t hen that month will not be an initial mo nth.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE68 9061.3 Anticipated Changes Because of anticipated changes, a household may be eligible for the month of application, but ineligible in the subsequent month. The household is entitled to benefits for th e month of application even if the processing of its application results in the benef its being issued in the subsequ ent month. Similarly, a house hold may be ineligible for the month of application bu t eligible in a subs equent month due to anticipated changes in circumstances. Even though denied for the month of application, the household does not have to re apply in the subsequent month. Use the same application for the denial for the month of application and the determinati on of eligibility for subsequent months, wi th the timeliness standards in DSSM 9028 and DSSM 9039. 9061.4 Changes in Allotment Levels As a result of anticipating changes, the household's allotment for the month of application may differ from its allotment in subsequent months. Establish a certification period for the longest possible period over which changes in the household's circumstances can be reasonably anticipated. Vary t he household's allotment from month to month to reflect changes anticipated at the time of certification unless the hou sehold elects the averaging techniques. 9062 Determining Resources [273.10(b)] Available resources at the time the household is interviewed wi ll be used to det ermine the hous ehold's eligibility. 9063 Determining Income 9063.1 Anticipating Income Take into account the income already received by the household during the certification period and any anticipated income which the household and the Division are reasonably cert ain will be received during the remainder of the certification period. Income is not to be counted at all if it is uncertain what amount is to be received or when it is to be received. As an example of uncertain income, a household anticipating inc ome from a new source, such as a new job or recently applied for public assistance benefits may be uncertain as to t he timing and amount of the initial payment. Do not anticipate this income unless there is reasonable certainty concerning the month in which the paymen t will be received and in what amount. If the exact amount of the income is not known, that po rtion of it which can be anticip ated with reasonable certainty will be considered as income. In cases where the receipt of inc ome is reasonably certain but the monthly amount may fluctuate, the income may be averaged. Households are to be adv ised to report all changes in gross monthly income as required in DSSM 9085. Impending receipt of a TANF, RCA or GA g rant will be conside red reasonably cer tain only when all technical and financial eligibilit y factors have b een satisfied and a decision of eligib ility has been reached. Use income received during the past 30 days as an indicator of the income that is and will be available to the household during the certificati on period. Do not use past inc ome as an indicator of income an ticipated for the certification period if changes in income have occurred or can be anticipated . If income fluctuates to the extent that a 30-day period alone cannot provide an accurate indication of anticipated inco me, use a longer period past time if it provides a more accurate indication of anticipated fluctuations in future incom e. Similarly, if the household's income fluctuates seasonally, it may be appropriate to use the most recent season comparable to the certification period, rather than the last 30 days, as one indicator of anticipated inc ome. Exercise particular cauti on in using income for the certification period. In many cases of seasonally fluctuating income, the income also fluctuates fr om one season in one year to the same season in the next year. Do not automatically attribute to the household amounts of any past income. Do not use past income as an indicator of anticipated income when changes in income have occurred or c an be anticipated during the certification period. 9 DE Reg. 799 (11/01/05) 9063.2 Count Income Only in the Month Received[273.10(c)(2)] Count income anticipated during the certification period only i n the month it is expected to be received unless the income is averaged.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE69 Whenever a full month's income is anticipated but is received o n a weekly, bi-weekly, or semi-monthly basis, convert the income to the monthly amount by multiplying by the appropri ate income conversio n factor as follows: Weekly - 4.33 Bi-Weekly - 2.16 Semi-monthly - 2 Income conversion procedures a lso apply to expenses billed on a weekly, bi-weekly, or semi-monthly basis. Count non-recurring lump sum pay ments as a resource starting wi th the month received; do not count as income. Wages held at the reque st of the employee will be considered in come to the household in the month the wages would otherwise have been paid by the employer. However, wages held by the employer as a general p ractice, even if in violation of the law, will not be counted a s income to the household, unl ess the household anticipates that it will ask for and receive an advance or that it will receiv e income from wages that were previously held by the employ er as a general practice and that were, therefore, not previously counted as income by the D ivision. Count advances on wages as income in the month received only if reasonably anticipated. Households receiving income on a recurring monthly or semi-mont hly basis shall not have th eir monthly income varied merely because of ch anges in mailing cycles or pay dates or bec ause weekends or holidays cause additional payments to be received in a month. 9063.3 Income Averaging [273.10(c)(3)] Income may be averaged when the h ousehold has fluctuating incom e. When averaging income, use the household's anticipation of monthly income fluctuations over the certificat ion period. Averages are recalculated at recertification and when changes in inco me are reported. Conversion of income received weekly or biweekly according to D SSM 9063.2 is not averaging income. Households which, by contract or by self-employment, derive the ir annual income in a period of time shorter than one (1) year will have that income a veraged over a 12- month period , provided the income from the contract is not received on an hourly or piecework basis. These households may include sch ool employees, share croppers, farmers and other self-employed households. However, these provisions do not app ly to migrant or seasonal farmworkers. The procedures for averaging self-employed income are described in DSSM 9075. Contract income which is not the household's annual income and is not paid on an hou rly or piecework basis shall be prorated over the period the income is intended to cover. For food stamp purposes, a contr act employee is one that has an agreement with an employer to work a certain length of time or perform a specific job. It may be either a written contract or an implied contract . Acceptable verification would be a statement from the employer or a written document, such as a copy of the contract or agreement, that shows the terms of employment. The following shows an example of contract and hourly work: A teacher's aid works 10 months of the year for $9.16 per hour and 6 hours per day. She does not sign a \"contract\" but it is implied that she will be \"rehired\" for the following school year. She will be consider ed a contract employee whose income must be annualized. An employee who is paid hourly is one that is paid based on the number of hours he works when there is no established work schedule such as a handyman who does odd jobs around the school. 9064 Determining Deductions [273.10(d)] Deductible expenses include only certain costs of dependent car e, child support payments, shelter, and medical costs as described in DSSM 9060. 9064.1 Disallowed Expenses Any expense, in whole or part, covered by educational income wh ich has been excluded under DSSM 9059 C shall not be deductible. An expense covered by an excluded reimbursement or vendor payment, except an energy assistance vendor payment made under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act (LIHEAA), is not deduc tible. For example, the portion of rent covered by exclud ed vendor payments should not be calculated as part of the household's shelter cost. However, that portion of an allowable medical expense which is not reimbursable, should be included as part of the household's medical expenses. H ouseholds entitled to the medic al deduction should have the non-reimbursable portionTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE70 considered at the time the amount of reimbursement is received or can otherwise be verified. In addition, an expense which is covered by an excluded vendor payment that has been co nverted to a direct cash payment under the approval of a federally authorized demonstrat ion project is not deductible (See DSSM 9059). A utility expense which is reimbursed or paid by an excluded payment, inc luding HUD or FmHA utility reim bursements, shall not be deductible. Expenses are deductible only if t he service is provided by some one outside the household and the household makes a money payment for the service. For example, a dependent care d eduction will not be allowe d if another household member provides the ca re or compensation for the care is provid ed in the form of an in-kind benefit, such as food. 9064.2 Billed Expenses Except as provided in DSSM 9064. 3, allow a deduction for a bill ed expense only in the month the expense is billed or otherwise becomes due, regardless of when the household intends to pay the expense. Bills are conside red due upon receipt. The date received for Program purposes, is the date m ailed plus two days for delivery. Disregard any other due dates appearin g on the bill. For example, include rent which becomes due each month in the h ousehold's shelter costs, even if the household has not yet paid the expense. Amounts carried forward from past bi lling periods are not deductibl e, even if included with the most recent billing and actually pai d by the household. A part icular expense may be deducted only once. 9064.3 Averaging Expenses [273.10(d)(3)] Households may elect to have fluctuating expenses averaged. Ho useholds may also elect to have expenses which are billed less often than monthly averaged forward over the interv al between scheduled billings, or, if there is no scheduled interval, averaged forward over the period the expense is inten ded to cover. Households reporting one- time only medical expenses during their certification period may elect to have a one-time deduction or to have the expense averaged over the remaining months of their certific ation period. Averaging would begin the month th e change would become effective. For example, if a household receives a single bill in February which covers a three- month supply of fuel oil, the bill may be averaged over February, March and April. The household may elect to have one-time only expenses averaged over the entire certification perio d in which they are billed. 9064.4 Anticipating Expenses [7 CFR 273.10(d)(4)] Calculate household expenses bas ed on the expenses a household expects to be billed for during the certification period. Anticipation of the household ex penses will be based on the mos t recent month's bills, unless the household is reasonably certain a change will occur. When the household is n ot claiming the utility standard , anticipate changes during the certification period based on last year's bills from the sa me period updated by overall price increases; or, if only the most recent bill is available, u tility cost increases or decrea ses over the months o f the certification period may be based on utility company estimates for the type of dwelling and utilitie s used by the household. Do not average past expenses, such as utility bills for th e last several month s as a met hod of ant icipating utility costs for the certification period. At certification and recertifica tion, the household shall repor t and verify all medical expens es. The household's monthly medical deduction for the certification period shall be based o n the information reported and verified by the household, and any anticipated changes in the household's medical expenses tha t can be reasonably expected to occur during the certification period. Reasonably anticipated changes are based on available information about the recipient's medical condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current ve rified medical expenses. The household shall not be required to file reports about its medical expenses during the certification period. If the household voluntarily reports a change in its medical expenses, DSS shall verify the change in accordance with DSSM 9038 and act on the change in accordance with DSSM 9085. 12 DE Reg. 1329 (04/01/09) 9064.5 Conversion of Deductions Use the income conversion procedures in DSSM 2014.3 for expense s billed on a weekly, bi-weekly, or semi-monthly basis.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE71 9064.6 Energy Assistance Payments [273.10(d)(6)] Except for payments made under th e Low Energy Assistance Act, p rorate energy assistance payments as provided for in DSSM 9057 over the entire heat ing season the payment is inte nded to cover. 9064.7 Households Entitled to the Excess Medical Deduction and the Uncapped Excess Shelter Deduction in DSSM 9060 [273.10(d)(7)] Households containing a member w ho is a disabled SSI recipient per DSSM 9013.1(b), (c), (d), or (e). Households containing a member who is a recipient of SSI benefi ts and the household is det ermined within the 30-day processing standard to be categorically eligible per DSSM 9042 or determined to be eligible as an NPA household and later becomes a categorica lly eligible household. The entitlement is for the peri od for which the SSI recipient i s authorized to receive SSI be nefits or the d ate of the food stamp application, whichever is la ter, if the household incurs such expenses. Households containing an SSI recipient as discussed above which are determined ineligible as an NPA household and later become categorically elig ible and entitled to restored be nefits per DSSM 9042, should receive restored benefits using the medical and excess shelter expense deductions from the begi nning of the period for which SSI benefits are paid, the original food stamp application date, or December 23, 1985, whi chever is later, if the hous ehold incurs such expenses. 9064.8 Child Support Deduction Child support payments are budget ed prospectively using the ave raging or conversion procedures in this section to determine the amount of the deduction. Fluctuating child suppo rt payments can be averaged according to DSSM 9064.3. Regular child support payments made on a weekly, bi-weekly, or semi-monthly basis should be converted according to DSSM 9064.5. 9065 Calculating Net Income and Benefit Levels [7 CFR 273 .10(e)] To determine a household' s net monthly income: A. Add the gross monthly income earned by all household members and the total monthly unearned income of all household members, minus income exclusions, to determine the ho usehold's total gross income. Net losses from the self-employment inco me of a farmer will be of fset in accordance with DSSM 9074. B. Multiply the total gross monthly earned income by 20 percent and subtract the amount (or multiply the total gross monthly earned income by 80 percent) and add that to the total monthly unearned income, m inus income exclusions. C. Subtract the standard deduction , as specified in DSSM 9060A. D. If the household is entitled to a medical deduction as provid ed in DSSM 9060 (C ), subtract that portion of the allowable medical costs that exceeds $35. E. Subtract monthly dependent car e expenses paid, if any, as spe cified in DSSM 9060(D). F. Subtract monthly legally obligated child support payments mad e to children living outside of the household. If the household is entitled to an excess shelter deduction, co mpute the household's excess shelter deduction in accordance with the next paragraph (G). G. Total the allowable shelter expenses to determine shelter cos ts. Subtract from total shel ter costs 50 percent of the adjusted income (the household's monthly income after all the a bove deductions have been subtracted). The remaining amount, if any, is the excess shelter cost. If there is no exce ss shelter cost, the net monthly income has been determined. If there is excess shelter cost, c ompute the shelter deduction in sub- paragraph (H) of this section. Subtract from the adjusted income in sub-paragraph (F) of this section the excess shelter cost up to the maximum amount allowed unless the househol d is entitled to the full amo unt of its excess shelter expe nses. Househo lds not subject to the excess shelter deduction limitation will have the full a mount exceeding 50 percent of their income after other applicable deductions subtracted . The household' s net monthly income has been determined. Individual shelter an d, where applicable, medical costs will be totaled and then rounded to the nearest dollar (i.e., $.01- $.49, round down and $.50- $.99 round up) before continui ng on with the benefit calcula tion. The income conversion procedures in DSSM 9 064 will also apply to medical and shelter expenses billed on a weekly or bi- weekly basis.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE72 In calculating net monthly income, round down each calculation that ends in 1 through 49 cents and round up for calculations that end in 50 through 99 cents. For example, gro ss weekly wages would be converted to the monthly amount and then rounded to the nearest dollar prior to the computation of the earned income deduc tion. Cents will be rounded from this calculation before being subtracted from the earned i ncome. 12 DE Reg. 1329 (04/01/09) 9066 Eligibility and Benefits [273.10(e)(2)] A. Households which contain an elderly or disabled member as def ined in DSSM 9013.1 will have their net income, as calculated in DSSM 9065 compared to the monthly income eligibil ity standards defined in DSSM 9054 for the appropriate household size to determine eligibility for the month. B. In addition to meeting the ne t income eligibility standards, households which do not contain an elderly or disabled member will have their gross inco me, as calculated in DSSM 9065 , compared to the gross monthly income standards defined in DSSM 9054 for the appro priate household size to dete rmine eligibility for the month. C. For households considered destitute in accordance with DSSM 9 067, determine a hous ehold's eligibility by computing its gross and net income according to DSSM 9067 and c omparing, as appropriate, t he gross and/or net income to the corresponding income eligibility sta ndard in accordance with DSSM 9054. D. If a household contains a member who is fifty-nine years old on the date of application, but who will become sixty before the end of the month of application, determine the house hold's eligibility in accordanc e with paragraph (A) of this section. E. If a household contains a student whose income is excluded (D SSM 9059 G) and the student becomes 18 during the month of application, exclude the student's earnings in the month of application and coun t the student's earnings in the following month. If the student becomes 18 during the certific ation period, the student's inc ome shall be excluded until the month following the month in w hich the student turns 18. F. Except as provided in DSSM 90 61 and 9066(H), the household's monthly allotment will be equal to the maximum food stamp allotment for the household's size reduced by 30 per cent of the household's net monthly income as calculated in DSSM 9065 . After multiplying the net income by 30 percent, round up all pr oducts before deducting from appropriate maximum food stamp allotment amount. G. If the calculation of benefits in accordance with paragraph ( F) of this section, for an initial month would yield an allotment of less th an $10 for the househ old, no benefits will be issued to the household for the initial month. H. Except during an initial month, all eligible one and two-pers on households will receive mo nthly allotments equal to the minimum benefit. I. For those eligible households with three or more members, w hich are entitled to no benefits on an ongoing basis, deny the household's participati on, on the groun ds that its net income exceeds the level belo w which benefits are issued. J. For those eligible households which are entitled to no benef its in their initial month of application in accordance with DSSM 9061, but are entitle d to benefits in subsequent mont hs, certify the household beginning with the month of application. When a household's circumstances change and it becomes entitled to a different income e ligibility standard, apply the different standard at the next recertification or whenever the Division changes the househo ld's eligibility, benefit level , or certification period, w hichever occurs first. 9067 Destitute Households [273.10(e)(3)] Migrant or seasonal farmworker households may have little or no income at the time of application and may be in need of immediate food assistance, even though they receive income at s ome other time during the month of application. The following procedures will be used to determine when migrant or seasonal farmworker households in these circumstances may be considered destitute, and therefore entitled to expedite d service, and special income calculation procedures. Households other than migrant or seasonal farmworker households will not be classif ied as destitute. 1. Households whose only income for the month of application was received prior to the date of application, and was from a terminated sou rce, will be considered destitute househol ds and shall be provided expedited service.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE73 A. If income is received on a monthly or more frequent basis, it will be considered as co ming from a terminated source if it will not be received again from the same source du ring the balance of the month of application or during the following month. B. If income is normally received less often than monthly, the n on-receipt of income from the same source in the balance of the month of application or in the following month i s inappropriate to determine whether or not the income is terminated. For example , if income is recei ved on a quarterly b asis (e.g., on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1), and the household applies in mid- January, the income should not be considered as coming from a terminated source merely because no further payments will be received in the balance of January or in February. The test for whether or not this household's income is terminated is whether the income is antic ipated to be received in April. Therefore, for households that normally received income less often than monthly, the inco me shall be considered as coming from a terminated source if it will not be received in the month in which t he next payme nt would normally be received. 2. Households whose only income for the month of application is from a new source will be considered destitute and will be provided expedited service if income of more than $25 f rom the new source will not be received by the tenth calendar day after the date of application. A. Income which is normally received on a monthly or more freque nt basis shall be considered to be from a new source if income of more than $25 has not been received from th at source within 30 days prior to the date the application was filed. B. If income is normally received less often than monthly, it wi ll be considered to be from a new source if income of more than $25 was not received within the last normal interv al between payments. For example, if a household applies in early January and is expecting to get paid every three month s, starting in late January, t he income will be considered to be from a new source if no income of more than $25 was received from the source during Oc tober or sin ce that time. Households may receive both income from a terminated source pri or to the date of application, and income from a new source after the date of application, and still be c onsidered destitute if they receive no other income in the month of application and income of more than $25 from the new s ource will not be rece ived by the tenth day after the date of application. 3. Destitute househol ds will have their eligibility and level of benefits calculated for the month of application by considering only income which is received between the first of the month and the date of app lication. Any income from a new source that is anticipated after the day of application wil l be disregarded. 4. Some employers provide travel advance to cover the travel cos ts of new employees who must journey to the location of their new employment. To the extent that these pay ments are excluded as reimbursements, receipt of travel advances will not affec t the determinat ion of when a household is destitute. However, if the travel advance is by written contract an advanc e of wages later earned by the employee, rather than a reimbursement, the wage advance will count as income. I n addition, the receipt of a wage advance for travel costs of a new employee will not affect the determination of whether subsequent payments from the employer are from a new source of income, nor whether a household will be considered de stitute. For example , if a household applies on May 10, has received a $40 advance for travel from its new employer on May 1 which by written cont ract is an advance on wages but will not receive any other w ages from the employer until Ma y 30, the household will be cons idered destitu te. The May 30 payment will be dis regarded, but the wage advance received p rior to the date of applicatio n will be counted as income. 5. A household member who changes jobs but continues to work for the same employer will be considered as still receiving income from the same source. A migrant farmworker's source of income will be consi dered to be the grower for whom the migrant is working at a particular poin t in time, and not the crew chief. A migrant who travels with the same crew chief but moves from one growe r to another will be considered t o have moved from a terminated income source to a new source. 6. The above procedures will apply a t initial application and at recertification, but only for the first month of each certification period. At recerti fication, income from a new so urce shall be disregarded in the first month of the new certification period if income of more than $25 will not be rec eived from this new source by the 10th calendar day after the date of the household's normal issuance cycle. 9068 Certification Periods [7 CFR 273.10(f)] DSS approves eligible households for a defined number of months called a certification period. The certification period is the period of time that DSS determines a household is eligible to receive benefits. At the end of the certification period, entitlement to food ben efits expires. DSS will not issue any further food benefits until the household completes a n ew application, is interviewed and provides all necessary verifications.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE74 The first month for which the ho usehold is eligible to particip ate starts the first month of the certification period. DSS wil l assign certification periods acc ording to each household's circ umstances. The certification peri ods for all househol ds shall not exceed 1 2 months, except househol ds listed in DSSM 9068.1 12-Month Ce rtification Periods Assign households subject to simplified reporting, except the e lderly or disabled households per DSSM 9068.2, a 12- month certification period. Households assigned a 12-month certification period are require d to complete and return an interim report in the 6th month of the certification period. 2 DE Reg. 2271 (6/1/1999) 8 DE Reg. 114 (7/1/2004)12 DE Reg. 462 DE Reg. 1086 (02/01/10) 9068.2 24-Month Certification Pe for Elderly or Disabled H ouseholds Assign a 24-month certification period to households where all members are elderly or disabled and have no earned income. Households assigned a 24-month certification period are require d to complete and return an interim report in the 12 th month of the certification period. 13 DE Reg. 1086 (02/01/10) 9068.3 Length of Certification Periods Assign each household the longes t certification period possible based on its circumstances. Households with unstable circumstances can be assigned a certif ication period consistent with their circumstances, but no less than 4 months. 13 DE Reg. 1086 (02/01/10) 9068.4 Shortening Ce rtification Periods Households certification perio ds will not be terminated before the assigned certification periods end except for the following reasons: DSS receives information that the household has become ineligi ble, or The household fails to respond to a Request for Contact to res olve unclear information. Households certification perio ds will not be shortened due to l oss of cash assistance or change in employment status. Close or adjust households benefit s in response to reported cha nges according to DSSM 9085. Do not use the Notice of Expirat ion to shorten a certification period. 13 DE Reg. 1086 (02/01/10) 9068.5 Lengthening Certification Periods When needed, lengthen a household's certification period after it has been assigned as long as the total months of certification do not exceed 12 months. Inform households whose certifica tion is lengthened of the new certification ending date with a notice containing the same information as th e notice of eligibility. 13 DE Reg. 1086 (02/01/10) 9069 Certification N otices to Households [273.10(g)] Provide applicants with one of the written notices listed under DSSM 9070 as soon as a determination is made, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the initial application.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE75 9070 Notice of Eligibility , Denial and Pending Status [273.10(g)(1)] If an application is approved, the client is sent a system gene rated notice. Notice of Denial If an application is denied, the applicant is sent a system gen erated notice. If NPA food s tamps were denied and the household is potentially categorically eligible, ask the househ old to inform DSS if it is approved to receive PA and/or SSI benefits. Notice of Pending Status If the application is to be held because of action needed by th e State or by the househol d, send the applicant written notice via Form 340. In cases where a househ old's application is approved on an expe dited basis without verificati on, notice of eligibility will explain that the household must p rovide the verification that w as waived. 9071 Recertification Notices [273.10(g)(2)] Households that have filed an application by the fifteenth (15t h) day of the last month of their certification period must be provided with either a notic e of eligibility or a notice of denial by the end of the current certification period. A system generated notice is iss ued even if the household's ben efit level increases or does not change. Households that have received a notice of expiration at the tim e of certification and have ti mely reapplied are to be sent a notice of eligibilit y or a notice of den ial not later than 30 days after the date of the hous ehold's initial opportunity to obtain its last allotm ent. (See also DSSM 9091.) 9072 Terminating Food Be nefits due to Substantial Ga mbling Winnings 273.12 (a) Food benefit that rec eive substantial lottery or gam bling winnings will not be eligible for the Food Supplement Program upon receipt of the winnings. 1. Substantial lottery or gambling winnings are a cash prize won in a single game with a gross value equal to or grea ter than the maximum limit for lottery an d gambling winnings for the Food Supplement Program. A. Substantial lottery or gambling winnings include, but are not limited to, cash prizes from: Scratch off tickets Video lottery Lottery drawings, such as Powerball Table games, such as blackjack or roulette Slot machines Sports betting Horse racingK e n oB i n g o Internet gambling B. DSS and DMMA will assess the v alue of lottery and gambling wi nnings before taxes or other withholdings are deducted. C. If multiple individuals share d in the purchase of a ticket, h and, or similar bet, then DSS or DMMA will use only the portio n of the winnings gi ven to a member of the food benefit household to determine if the household's winnings are equal to or greater t han the maximum limit for lotteryTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE76 and gambling winnings. D. The maximum limit for lottery a nd gambling winnings applies t o all food benefit households, including elderly or disabled households and categorically elig ible households. E. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) determines the maximum l imit for lottery and gambling winnings each year. DSS publishe s the maximum limit in the annu al October Cost of Living Adjustments Administrative Notice. 2. Food benefit households are req uired to report to DSS or DMMA when a household member receives substantial lott ery or gambling winnings. A. Households that have received substantial lottery or gambling winnings must report the total winnings to DSS or DMMA within 10 days of the date the househol d received the winnings. i. This reporting requirement also applies to households that sp ent or gave away the winnings prior to reporting to DSS or DMMA. ii. Households must report in-state and out-of-state winnings. 3. DSS and DMMA case workers must verify food benefit households ' lottery and gambling winnings. A. DSS and DMMA will accept verific ation of househo lds' lottery or gambling winnings, including, but not limited to:i. A receipt or notice from the De laware Department of Finance; ii. A receipt or form from the payer of the winnings; iii. A copy of the household me mber's bank statement; or iv. Information from a data match for lottery and gambling winni ngs. B. DSS and DMMA case workers will follow the procedures for ques tionable or unclear information per DSSM 9033 and DSSM 9085.5 when:i. Information or verification o f a household member's lottery o r gambling winnings is unclear, questionab le, or missing; or ii. A third party reports a househo ld member's lottery or gambli ng winnings without providing acceptable verification. 4. Any food benefit household with a member who receives substan tial lottery or gambling winnings will no longer be eligib le for food benefits immediate ly upon receipt and verification of the winnings. A. The DSS or DMMA case worker mu st immediately close or deny th e food benefit case for the entire household once a household member's winnings are verifie d.Note: The maximum limit for lotte ry and gambling winnings is se t to the same amount as the maximum financial resource limit for elderly or disabled food b enefit households. Note: If DSS or DMMA receives info rmation about the household's winnings from the lottery and gambling data match in the eligibility system, the household's food benefit case can be closed without contacting the househol d if the match meets the followi ng conditions: The household's reported winnings are equal to or greater tha n the maximum limit for lottery and gambling winnings; and The data match information is clear and complete. If the information received from the lottery and gambling data match is questionable, DSS and DMMA case workers will follow the procedures for unclear inform ation per DSSM 9085.5. For example, the spelling of the hou sehold member's name on the dat a match is different from the spelling of the name in the case file.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE77 B. If the DSS or DMMA case worker i ssued a request for contact t o the household and the household fails to respond or refu ses to provide sufficient inf ormation or verification about the winnings, the case worker will follo w the procedur e to close th e food benefit case per DSSM 9085.5. C. DSS or DMMA will send a notice of adverse actio n to the house hold prior to terminating food benefits for substantial lottery or gambling winnings. D. DSS or DMMA will send a notice of denial to the household if DSS or DMMA discovers during the recertification process that the household received substantial lottery or gambling winnings. E. The DSS or DMMA case worker will process an ove rpayment for t he food benefit c ase if benefits were issued to the household follo wing the household's receipt of winnings that exceeded the maximum limit for lottery and gambling winnings. 5. Households that were determine d ineligible for food benefits because of substantial lottery or gambling winnings will remain ine ligible until the household me ets the resource and income eligibility requirements for the Food Supplement Program. A. A household can re-apply for fo od benefits at any time after the household's case is closed. B. DSS and DMMA will determine e ligibility using th e regular res ource and income limits for the Food Supplement Program for households that re-apply for benefi ts after their case closed due to substantial lottery or gambling winnings.i. DSS or DMMA will count any winni ngs kept by the household as a resource at re- application. ii. The household cannot be determ ined categorica lly eligible at re-application, even if the household was previously categor ically eligible p er DSSM 9042. This requirement applies only the first time the household re-applies for food b enefits. C. If at re-application the food benefit household's composition has changed since the case closed, DSS or DMMA will consider the hou sehold to be a new food benefi t household and not a household that was closed due to substantial lottery or gamblin g winnings, regardless of who left or entered the household.i. A household that has changed aft er case closure may be determ ined categorically eligible at re-application and do es not have to m eet the condit ions in section (5)(B) of this policy. 16 DE Reg. 874 (02/01/13) 24 DE Reg. 597 (12/01/20) 9073 Special Income Circumstances [273.11] The procedures for handling income received from boarders by a household that does not own and operate a commercial boarding house are described in DSSM 9074. For all other households receiving self-employment income, including those that own and operate a commercial boarding hous e, the self-employment i ncome will be calculated according to DSSM 9074. 9074 Self-Employment DSS a lf-employment Income as Follow s (1) Averaging self-employment income.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE78 (i) Average the income over the period the income is intended to cover, even if the household receives income from other sources. If the averaged amount does not accurately refle ct the household's current circumstances, calculate the self-employment income on the basis of anticipated earnings, no t prior earnings (ii) For self-employment that has been in existence for less th an a year, average the income over the period of time the business has been in operation. Project that mon thly amount for the coming year. (2) Determining monthly income from self-employment (i) For the period of time over which the self-employment inco me is determined, add all gr oss self-employment income (actual or anticipated) and capital gains, exclude the costs of producing the self-employme nt income, and divide the remaining amount of self-employm ent income by the number of mon ths over which the income will be averaged. This amount is the monthly net self-employment income. Add the month ly self-employment income to any other earned income received by the household to det ermine the total monthly earned income. (ii) If the cost of producing self-employment income exceeds th e income derived from self-employment as a farmer , such losses must be prorated according to (a)(1) of this sectio n, and then offset against countable income to the household as follows: (A) Offset farm self-e mployment losses fir st against other sel f-employment income. (B) Offset any remaining farm self-employment losses against t he total amount of earned and unearned income after the earned income de duction has been applied. (3) Capital Gains Calculate the proceeds from the sale of capital goods or equipm ent in the same manner as a capital gain for Federal income tax purposes. If the self-employment income is calculated on an anticipated b asis, count the amount of c apital gains the household anticipates receiving during the months over which the income i s being averaged . 9074.2 Self-Employment Standard Deduction for Producing Incom e The cost for producing income is a standard deduction of the gr oss income. This standard deduction is a percentage of the gross income determined annu ally and is listed in the Cost- of-Living Adjust ment (COLA) notic e each October. The standard deduction is considered the cost to produce income . The gross income test is applied after the standard deduction. The 20% earned income deduction is then applied to t he net self-employment income and any other earned income in the household. The standard deduction applies to all self-employed households with costs to produce income. To receive the standard deduction, self-employed househol ds must provide and verify the y have business costs to produce income. The verifications can include, but a r e n o t l i m i t e d t o , t a x r e c o r d s , ledgers, business records, receipts, check receipts, and business statements. The self-employed household does not have to verify all its business costs to receive the standard deduction. Self-employed households not claiming or verifying any costs to produce income will not receive the standard deduction. The self-employment standard de duction will be reviewed annuall y to determine if an adjustment in the percentage amount is needed. 9 DE Reg. 564 (10/01/05)TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE79 9074.3 Food Stamp Self-Employment Charts Types of Self- Employment Business Sale of Goods Storefront business Examples: Gift/ craft shop, restaurant,gas station, floristPotential Deductions Cost of maintaining storefront - i.e., rent, insurance, utilities, propertytaxes.

This amoun t shall be used in successive ce rtification periods during the next 12 months, except that a new average monthly amount shall be calculated over this 12-month period if the anticipated amount of capital gains changes. Add the anticipated monthly a mount of capital gains to the anticipated monthly self-employment income, and subtr act self-employment standard d eduction. Calculation I - Gross IncomeQuestions to Ask: Are business and person al funds co-mingled? Are daily/monthly ledgers maintained documenting income and disbursements? What tax returns have or will be filed? What tax year is being used? For partnerships: Is there a Contract Structure? If business named other than owners, is business incorporated? Is there a Federal or State number? Is a separate checking account maintained for business?What to look for: Business and income costs must be identifiable as separate from personal expenses to be allowed as deductions. If canceled checks are available, they should be examined with accompanying receipt andor invoices showing identifiable itemized costs. For income verification, check bank statements and sequentially numbered receipt/invoice records. Same as above. Obtain specific tax schedules, i.e., Schedule C, K or 1065 showing business deductions. Quarterlyreturns.

Income, resources and deductible expensesTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE85 2. Count all the income and resources of the ineligible househol d member(s) in the eligibility and benefit determination. 3. Apply all allowable earned inco me and deductions to the entir e household. Include all deductions t he ineligible household member would receive if he or she was included in the household size. Count the following deductions: 4. Standard 5. Medical6. Dependent care 7. Child support payment 8. Excess shelter9. Eligibility and benefit level Do not include the ineligible member when determining the house hold's size when: A. Assigning a benefit level to the household.B. Comparing the household's mon thly income with the income elig ibility standards. C. Comparing the household's resources with the resource eligibi lity limits. Ensure that no household's food benefit is increased as a result of the exclusion of one or mor e household members. 15 DE Reg. 1027 (01/01/12) 9076.2 SSN Disqualification, Chi ld Support Sanctions ible ABAWDs Determine the eligibility and be nefit level of remaining househ old members of a household containing individuals determined ineligible due to: disqualification for refusal to obtain or provide an SSN; non-cooperation with the Division of Child Support Enforcement ; or meeting the time limit for abl e-bodied adults without dependen ts. 1) Resources - The resources of such ineligible members continue to count in full to the remaining household members. 2) Income - Count a prorata share of the income of such ineligib le members as income to the remaining members. To get the prorated share, subtract the allowable income exclusion s from the ineligible member's income, divide the amount by the household size, and use all the income except for the pr orated share of the ineligible household member. 3) Deductible expenses - Allow the earned income deduction for t he prorated share of income used by the remaining household members. Divide the household's allowable child suppo rt payment, shelter (except any utility allowances), and dependent care expenses, which are either paid by or billed to the excluded members evenly among the household's members including the ineligible members. Allow all but the ine ligible member's share as a deductible child support payment, shelter (except any utility allo wances), or minor care expense for the remain ing household members. 4) Eligibility and benefit level - Ineligible mem bers will not b e included in determining their household's size when: a) Assigning a benefit level to the household;b) Comparing the household's mon thly income with the income ibility standards; or c) the household's resou rces eligibi lity limits. 11 DE Reg. 1243 (03/01/08) 9076.3 Ineligible Alien Determine as follows the eligib ility and benefit level of remai ning household members of a household containing individuals determ ined ineligible. For being an ineligible alien. 1) Resources - The resources of such ineligible members contin ue to count in their entirety to the remaining household members. 2) Income - Count a prorata share of the income of such member s as income to the remaining members. This prorata share is calculated by first subtracting the allowable exclusions from the ineligible member's income and dividingTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE86 the income evenly among the hou sehold members, including the in eligible members. A ll but the ineligib le member's share is counted as income for the remaining household members. 3) Deductible expenses - The earned income deduction applies t o the prorated income earned by such ineligible members, which is attributed to their households. That portion of the househo ld's allowable child support payment, shelter (excluding any utility allowances ), and dependent care expenses which are either paid by or billed to the excluded members, will be divided evenly a mong the household's members i ncluding the ineligible membe rs. All but the ineligible member's share is counted as a deductible child support payment , shelter (excluding any utility allowances), or dependent care expense for the remaining household members. 4) Eligibility and benefit leve l - Such ineligible members wil l not be included when determining their household's size for the purposes of: a) Assigning a benefit level to the household;b) Comparing the household's mo nthly income with the income el igibility standards; or c) Comparing the household's r esource eligi bility limits. Reduction or Termination of Benefits Within the Certific ation Period Whenever an individual is determined ineligible within the hous ehold's certification period, determine the eligibility or ineligibility of the r emaining household me mbers based, as much as possible, on inform ation in the case file: a) Excluded for Intentional Program Violation Disqualification - If a household's benefits are reduced or terminated within the certification period because one of its m embers was excluded because of disqualification for intentional Program violation, notify the remaining members of their eligibility and benefit l evel at the same time the excluded member is notified of h is or her disqualification. Th e household is not entitled to a notice of adverse action, but may request a fair hearing to contest the reduction or terminat ion of benefits, unless the household has already had a fair hearing on the amount of the claim as a result of a consolidati on of the administrative disqualification hearing with the fair hearing. b) Disqualified or determined ineligible for reasons other than intentional Program violation - If a household's benefits are reduced or terminated within one certification per iod for reasons other than an intentional Program violation disqualification, issue a notice of adverse action in accordanc e with DSSM 9006, informing the household of th e ineligibility, the reason for the ineligibility, the eligibility and benefit l evel of the remaining members and the action the household must take to end the ineligibility. 9077 Treatment of Income and Resources of Other Non-Household M embers 9077.1 Handling Income and Resources For all other non-household members, defined in DSSM 9013.2 and DSSM 9013.3, who are not specifically mentioned in DSSM 9076, the income and resources of such individuals are not to be considered available to the household with whom the individual resides. Cash payments from the non-househ old member to the household are considered under the normal income standards per DSSM 9055. Vendor payments are exc luded as income. When the earned income of one or more household members and the earned income of a non- household member are combined into one wage, determine the income of the household m embers as follows: 1) If the household's share can be identified, count that portio n due to the household as earned income. 2) If the household's share cannot be identified, prorate the ea rned income among all those whom it was intended to cover and count that pror ated portion to the household. Child support received by an ineligible student for a child is budgeted when determining benefits. If the child support includes monies for the whole family, such as alimony, the income must be prorated. Only the income of the ineligible studen t is disregarded. If the household shares deductibl e expenses with the non-househ old member, deduct only the amount actually paid or contributed by the hous ehold as a household expense. If the payments or contributions cannot be differentiated, prorate the expenses evenly among persons actually paying or co ntributing to the expense and deduct only the household's prorata share. Do not include such non-household m embers when determining the size of the household for the purposes of: Assigning a benefit level to the household; Comparing the household's monthly income with the income eligi bility standards; or Comparing the household's resources with the resource eligibil ity limits.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE87 9077.2 Deductible Expenses If the household shares deductibl e expenses with the non-househ old member, deduct only the amount actually paid or contributed by the household as a household expense. 9078 Residents of Drug/Alcoholi c Treatment and Rehabilitation P rograms and Group Living Arrangements 9078.1 Residents of Drug/Alcoholic Treatment and Rehabilitation Programs Narcotics addicts or alcoholics who regularly participate in pu blicly operated or private non- profit drug or alcoholic treatment and rehab ilitation programs on a resident basis may v oluntarily apply for the Food Stamp Program. Resident addicts and alcoholic s and their children, will have t heir eligibility determined as one household. Certify residents of addict/alcoholic tre atment centers by using the sa me provisions that apply to all other applicant households except that certification must be accomplished through an autho rized representative who i s employed by the program. Prior to certifying any residents, verify that the treatment ce nter is authorized by FNS as a retailer if the center wishes to use food stamp bene fits through a wholesaler, or, if it is n ot authorized by FNS as a reta iler that it is un der Part B of T itle XIX of the Public Health Servic e Act (42 USC 300X et seg.) Each treatment and reh abilitation center must provide DSS with a list of current participating residents on a periodic basis. This list will include a st atement signed by a responsi ble center official attesting to the validity of the list. The agency will conduct periodic r andom on-site visits to the cent er to as sure the accuracy of the listings and that the age ncy's records are consistent and current. Prior to certifying any residents for food stamps, verify that the treatment center is authorized by FNS as a retailer or is funded under part B of Title X IX of the Public Health Service A ct. The following provisions apply to residents of treatment center s: 1) When expedited processing stan dards are necessary per DSSM 90 41, eligibility for the initial application will be processed on an expedited ba sis, and DSS will complete verif ication and documentation requirements prior to issuance of a second food stamp allotment. When normal processing stand ards apply, complete the verification and documentation requirements prior to making an eligibility determ ination for t he initial application. 2) Changes and recertif ications will be processed by using the s ame standards that apply to all other food stamp households. 3) Resident households will be aff orded the same rights to notic es of adverse action to fair hearings and to entitlement to lost be nefits as are all other food stamp househ olds. 4) The organization or institution may be penalized or disqualif ied if it is determined adm inistratively or judicially that food stamp benefits were misappropriated or used for purch ases that did not contribute to a certified household's meals. Promptly notify FNS when DSS has reason to believe that an organization or institution is misusing food stamp benefits in its possession. Take no action prior to FNS action against the organization or institution. Establish a claim fo r overissuances of food stamp benefits held on behalf of resident clients as stipulated in DSSM 7000 of this section if any overissuances are discovered during an investigation or hearing procedure for redemption violations. If FNS disqualifies an organization or institution as an authorized retail food sto re, suspend its authorized representative status for the same period. 9 DE Reg. 799 (11/01/05) 9078.2 Residents of Group Living Arrangements (GLA) Who Receive Benefits Under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act Disabled or blind residents of a group living arrangement who a re covered under the Food Stamp Act's definition of a disabled person in DSSM 9013.1, (b through k) may voluntarily a pply for the Food Stamp Program. The GLA must determine if a residen t may apply on his or her own behalf base d on the resident's physical an d mental ability to handle his or her own affairs. Residents may apply through the use of th e facility's authorized repr esentative per DSSM 9016.1. Their eligibility will be determine d as one-pers on households. Residents can apply on their own behalf or through an authorized representative of their choice. Certify these resid ents using the same provisions that apply to all other households. Prior to certifying any residents for food stamps, verify that the group living arrangement is authorized by FNS or is certified by DHSS and that the center is a nonprofit organizati on.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE88 Shelter and Medical Expenses for Group Home Residents Room and medical costs which can be separately identified are a llowable shelter and medical expenses. Normally the group home will identify the par t of the payment that is being charged for se parate costs. If the amount the resident pays for room and meals is combined into one amount, the amount which exceeds the food stamp maximum allotment for a on e-person household can be allow ed as an identified shelter expense. For example, a resident is charged $350 a month for room and me als. If the maximum food stamp allotment is $120 for a one-person household, then $120 is subtracted from the $3 50 monthly charge. The remainder $230 is allowed as the shelter cost. If more than one resident applies as part of the same food stam p household, the food stamp maximum allotment amount for a one-person househo ld would be deducted from the ro om and board payment for each person. For example, two residents apply as one food stamp household. They each pay $350 a month for room and meals. If the maximum food stamp allotment for one-person household is $1 20, each resident has the $ 120 amount subtracted from the $350 payment. The remainder $230 for each person is used f or the shelter costs, a $460 monthly room charge. Some group homes charge a basic rate for room and board and the y have higher rates depending on the amount of medical care that may be needed. In such instances, if a person is charged a higher rate, the basic rate minus the food stamp maximum allotment amount fo r a one-person household may b e used to determine the shelter costs for that person, and the difference between the basic rate and t he higher rate m ay be determined to be medical costs. For example, a resident is charged a higher rate of $500 a mont h for room, meals and medical care. If the maximum food stamp allotment for one-person households is $120, the $12 0 is subtracted from the basic rate of $350 which leaves $230 for the shelter cost. The $350 basic rate is subtracted f rom the $500 higher rate to determine the medical costs of $150. If the amount paid for medical an d shelter costs cannot be sepa rately identified, no deduct ion is allowed for the costs. These procedures apply to residents making their own payments a nd to those instances where a protective payee is handling the payments but is using the resident's own funds. Each group living arrangement sh all provide DSS with a list of currently participating residents on a periodic basis. This list will include a statement si gned by a responsible center of ficial attesting to the validit y of the list. DSS will conduct periodic random on-site visits to assure the a ccuracy of the li st and that the Division's record s are consisten t and current. Processing standards, processing of changes and recertification s and household rights are the same as in DSSM 9078.1 when the facility acts as the resident's authorized repr esentative. If the resident has made applicat ion on his/her own behalf, the household is responsible for reporting changes per DSSM 9085. If the group living arrangement is acting as author ized representative, the group living arrangement must notify DSS of all changes and must return any household's benef it which is received after the household has left the group living arrangement. When the household leaves the f acility, the group living arrang ement either acting as an authorized representative or retaining use of the food stamp benefits on behalf of the resid ents will provide residents with their EBT card. The departing household will receive its full allotment if issued and if no f ood stamp benefits have been spent on behalf of that individual household. These procedures are applicable at any time during the month. If the food stamp benefits have already been issued and any portion spent on behalf of the individual, and t he household leaves the facilit y prior to the 16th day of the month, the facility will provide the household with its EBT car d and one-half of its monthly allotment. If the household leaves on or after the 16th of the month and the food stamp ben efits have already been issued and used, the household does not receive any food stamp benefits. If a group of reside nts have been certif ied as one household and have returned the food stamp benefits to the fa cility to use, th e departing r esidents will be given a prorata share of one-half of the household's allotment if leaving prior to the 16th of the month , and will be instructed to obtain EBT cards. Once the resident leaves, the group livin g arrangement no longer acts as his/her authorized representative. The group living arr angement will, if possible, provide the hou sehold with a change repo rt form and will advise the household to return the form to the appropriate DSS office with in ten (10) days. If a resident or a group of residents apply on their own behalf and if they retain use of their own food stamp benefits, they are entitled to keep the food stamp benefits when they lea ve. If a group of residents have applied as one household, a prorata share of the remaini ng food stamp benefits will be pr ovided to any departing household members. The group living arrangement will, if possib le, provide the household wit h a change report form and will advise the household to return the form to the appropriate DSS office within ten (10) days. T he group living arrangement will return to DSS any food stamp benefits not provided to departing residents at the end o f each month. These retur ned food stamp benefits will include those not provided to dep arting residents because they left on or after the 16th of the month or they left prior to th e 16th and the f acility was unable to prov ide them with food stam p benefits.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE89 The same provisions applicable to drug and alcoholic treatment centers in DSSM 9078.1 regarding misrepresentation or fraud and overissuances and institutional disqualification a lso apply to group living arrangements when acting as an authorized representative. A resident applying on his/her own behalf will be responsible for overissuances as would any other household. The group living arrangement may purchase and prepare food to b e consumed by eligible residents on a group basis if residents normally obtain their meals at or from a central loca tion. If residents purchase and/or prepare food for home consumption, the group living arrangement will en sure that each resident's food stamps are used for meals intended for that resident. If the resident retains use of his/her own coup on allotment, coupons may be used either to purchase meals prepared by the facility or to purchase fo od to prepare meals f or their own consumption. 9079 Replacement of Electronic Be nefit Transfer (EBT) Food Bene fits 9079.1 Replacing Food Benefits I ssued by Electronic Benefit Tra nsfer (EBT) Food stamp benefits issued by EBT can only be replaced under tw o conditions: Unauthorized use of the account based on the cond itions listed under DSSM 9079.2; and Food purchased with food stamp benefits that was destroyed in a household misfor tune or disaster. The primary payee (cardholder) is responsible for the security and safeguarding of the EBT card and Personal Identification Number (PIN), inc luding the carefu l selection of authorized representatives. 9 DE Reg. 799 (11/01/05) 9079.2 Unauthorized Use of the Account The reason DSS issues food stamp b enefits by EBT is to minimize the loss and theft of client benefits. DSS will replace benefits issued by EBT due to th e unauthorized use of the account onl y if the loss occurred: after a report o f a lost or stolen EBT c ard is made to the e-F unds Customer Support number at 1-800-526-9099; because of DSS local office card/PIN issuance error; or because of an unlawful or othe r erroneous action on the part o f DSS or the EBT contractor. DSS will not replace food stamp b enefits withdrawn from an EBT account before a report of a lost or stolen EBT card is made to the e-Funds Customer Support Unit. DSS will replace food stamp benefi ts withdrawn from an EBT acco unt after a report of a lost or stolen EBT card is made to the e-Funds Customer Support Unit. Before a replacement is i ssued, DSS will verify the ti me/date of the report to e- Funds and the time/date of the loss of benefits. DSS will not replace EBT issued benefits that were misused by a n authorized representative. Affidavit for Replacement of EB T Food Benefits. The affidavit w ill attest to the loss and mus t be made within ten days of the report of the loss. If the household does not sign and retu rn the affidavit within ten days of the report of the loss DSS will deny the request for replacement of benefits. 9079.3 Food Destroyed After It Was Purchased with Food Stamp Be nefits DSS will replace food benefits us ed for food that was destroyed in a household misfortune or disaster. The household may be entitled to a replacement of the actual va lue of the loss not to exceed the amount of the household's monthly allotment at the time of the loss. The household must report the hous ehold misfortune or disaster to DSS within ten days of the loss. DSS will verify the fact of the household's misfortune or disas ter. Disasters can include fire, floods, or hurricanes. Household misfortunes can include a breakdown in the refrigerat or or freezer or the loss of electricity causing food to spoil. In verifying a household's misf ortune or disaster DSS will acce pt statements from community agencies, the Red Cross, fire departments, home visits, or other acceptable collateral c ontact. There is no limit on the number of times a household may receiv e replacement of food destroyed in a household misfortune or disaster. If a household is eligible for emergency benefits under a disas ter program, the household cannot receive both the emergency benefits and replacem ent benefits for the same time p eriod.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE90 Replacements of destroyed food cannot be used to offset food st amp overpayment claims. A household member, or authorize d representative, must sign and return to the food stamp office an Affidavit for Replacement of EBT Food Benefit s. The affidavit will attest to the loss and must be made within ten days of the report of the loss. If the household does not sign and return the affida vit within ten days of the report of the loss DSS will deny the request for replacement of benefits. 9079.4 Affidavit for Replacement of EBT Food Benefits A household member, or authorized representative, must sign an Affidavit for Replacement of EBT Food Benefits attesting to the loss and submi t the affidavit to DSS within te n days of the report of the loss. The household will not receive a replacement if the affidavit i s not received by DSS within ten days of the report of the loss. If the tenth day falls on a weekend or holiday, DSS will consid er the affidavit as received timely if it is received on the next business day. DSS will provide replacement bene fits within ten days of the re ported loss or within two working days of receiving the affidavit, whichever is later. 9080 Shelters for Battered Women and Children [273.11(g)] Prior to certifying its residents under this paragraph, determi ne that the shelter for battered women and children meets the definition in DSSM 9015 (4) and document the basis of this determination. Shelters h aving FNS authorization to redeem as wholesalers will be con sidered as meeting the definit ion and the Division is not required to make any further determination. Many shelter residents have rece ntly left a household containin g the person who has abused them. Their former household may be certified for participation in the Program, an d its certification may be based on a household size that includes the women and children who have just left. Shelter re sidents who are included in such certified households may nevertheless apply for and (if o therwise eligible) participate in the Program as separate households if such certified household which includes them is the household containing the p erson who subjected them to abuse. Shelter residents who are included in such certifie d households may receive an ad ditional allotment as a separate household only once a month. A full new application is required since the shelter resident w ould constitute a new househo ld. However, information previously verified need not be r e-verified if the worker is sa tisfied that it remains valid. Eligibility is determined solely on the resources and income ac tually available to the applicant. The rationale for allowing a resident of a shelter for battered women to particip ate as a new household is the assumption that she is in fact cut off from her old household. Benefits for the shelter resid ent household shall be from the date of application to the end of the month. Shelter residents who apply as separate households will be cert ified solely on the basis of their income and resources and the expenses for which the y are responsible. They will be certified without regard to the income, resources, and expenses of their former household. Jointly held resources wil l be considered inaccessible in accordance with DSSM 9047. Room payments to the shelter will be considered as shelt er expenses. Any shelter residents eligible for expedited ser vice will be ha ndled in accordance with DSSM 9041. Take prompt action to ensure that the former household's eligib ility or allotment reflects th e change in the household's composition. Such action will include acting on the reported changes in acco rdance with DSSM 9085 by i ssuing a notice of adverse action in accordance with DSSM 9006. The battered spouse has to be in a shelter to get additional Fo od Stamps under this section. The spouse cannot stay at the home, even if t he abuser has left th e dwelling, and get additional Food Stamps. 9081 Households Containing Sponsored Alien Members 9081.1 DefinitionTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE91 \"Date of entry \" or \" Date of admission \" means the date established by the Immigration and Naturalizat ion Service as the date the sponsored alien was admitted for permanent residence. \"Sponsor \" means a person who executed an affidavit(s) of support or sim ilar agreement on behalf of an alien as a condition of the alien's entry or admission into the United Sta tes as a permanent resident. \"Sponsored alien \" means an alien for whom a person has executed an affidavit of support [INS Form I-864 or I-864A] on behalf of the alien accordin g to section 213A of the INA. 9081.2 Deeming of Sponsor's Income and Resources DSS will consider the income and resources of the sponsor and t he sponsor's spouse towards the sponsored alien only if the sponsored alien is an e ligible alien acco rding to DSSM 9 007.1. DSS will deem the income and res ources o f sponsor and sponsor's spouse, if he or she has executed INS Form I-864 or I-864A, as the unearned income and resources of the sponsored alien. The deeming of the sponsor's inc ome and resources shall continu e to apply to an alien until: The alien has become a United St ates citizen through naturaliza tion; The alien is credited with 40 qualifying quarters of coverage d uring which time the alien did not receive any Federal means-tested public welfare benefit, or The sponsor dies. The income and resourc es of sponsors and sponsor's spouses are deemed as follows: 1. The monthly income of the sponsor and sponsor's spouse deemed to be that of the alien will be the total monthly earned and unearned incom e (including income exclusions provided for in DSSM 9059) of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse (if living with the sponsor) at the time the h ousehold containing the sponsored alien member applies or is recertified, reduced by: (A) A 20% earned income amount for that portion of the income determined as earned income of the sponsor and the sponso r's spouse. (B) An amount equal to the mo nthly gross income eligibility li mit for a household equal in size to the sponsor, the sponsor's spouse, and any other person who is claimed or co uld be claimed by the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse as a dependent for Federal income tax purposes. 2. If the alien has already reported gross income information on his/her sponsor due to TANF's sponsored alien rules, that income amount may be used for FSP deeming purposes. However, limit the allowable reductions to the total gross income of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse prior to a ttributing an income amount to the alien to amounts listed above in #1 in this section. 3. Actual money paid to the alien by the sponsor or the sponsor' s spouse will not be consi dered as income to the alien unless the amount paid exceeds the amount attributed to t he alien under paragraph 1 above. Only the amount paid that actually exceeds the amount deemed would be considered inc ome to the alien. 4. Resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse to be deeme d to be that of the alien will be the total amount of their resources as d etermined in accordance with DSSM 9045 reduced by $1,500. 5. If a sponsored alien can demonstrate to the Division's satisf action that his/her sponsor sponsors other aliens, then the income and resources deemed under the provisions of pa ragraph 1 and 4 of this Section will be divided by the number of such aliens that appl y for or are participating in th e program. 9081.3 Exempt Aliens The provisions of this Se ction do not apply to: 1) Children under 18 years of age regardless of when they entere d the United States; 2) Immigrants whose deeming period had ended; 3) Sponsored aliens who are ineligible for food stamps because o f immigration status will not have the sponsor's income deemed to other eligible members of the alien's househol d. 4) An alien who is participating in the Food Stamp Program as a member of his or her sponsor's household or an alien whose sponsor is participating in the Food Stamp Program separa te and apart from the alien; 5) An alien who is sponsored by an organization or group as oppo sed to an individual; 6) An alien who is not required to have a sponsor under the Immi gration and Naturalization Act, such as, but not limited to, a refugee, a parolee, one granted asylum, and a Cub an or Haitian entrant. 7) An alien whose sponsor has not signed a legally binding affid avit of suppor t, the INS Form I-864-A;TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE92 8) A battered alien spouse, alien parent of a battered child, or child of a battered alien, for 12 months after a determination is made that the battering is substantially conne cted to the need for benefits, and the battered individual does not live with the batterer. Afte r 12 months, do not deem the b atterer's income and resources if the bat tery is recognized by a court or the INS and had a substantial connection to the need for benefits, and the alien does not live with the batterer; 9) An indigent alien that has been determined unable to obtain f ood or shelter taking into account the alien's own income plus any cash, food, or housing, or other assistance pro vided by other individuals, including the sponsor(s). Indigent alien determination: (A) Inquire about sponsored alien status if an alien is a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). (B) If the LPR is an eligible sponsored alien, make an indigence determination. An eligible sponsored alien is an alien elig ible to receive food stamps ac cording to DSSM 9007.1. (C) Determine if the eligible sponsored alien's total household income by adding the eligible alien's household's own income, the cash contributions of the sponsor and others, a nd the value of any in-kind assistance the sponsor or others provide. Accept whatever dollar value, if any, is given for any in-kind assistance provided by the person(s) providing the assistance. In-kind assistanc e includes, but is not limited to , food, housing, clothing, or transportation. Compare the total household income as determined above the 130 percent of the poverty income guidelines for the household size. (D) If the total income does not exceed the 130 percent of the p overty income guidelines for the household size, the alien is indigent. If the alien is indigent, then process the case as normal and d eem only the actual amount of the cash support received from the sponsor. The cash support does not include t he value of the in- kind assistance. (E) If the alien is not indigent, then the eligible sponsored al ien must provide information on the total amount of the sponsor's income and resources and follow the regular sponsor d eeming procedures. (F) If the alien is indigent, only deem the income actually prov ided to the alien for the period beginning on the date the determination was made and ending 12 months after such date . (G) Each indigence determination is renewable for additional 12 month periods. (H) The names of each eligible sponsored alien determined to be indigent and the sponsor(s) n ames are to be sent to the Food Stamp Policy Administrator after a determinati on is made. 9081.4 Sponsored Alien's Responsibility The alien is responsible for obtaining the cooperation of his/h er sponsor for providing DSS at time of application or recertification with the information and/or documentation neces sary to calculate deemed inco me and resources until the alien becomes a citizen or work s 40 qualifying quarters. The a lien is also responsible for providing information about other aliens for whom the alien's sponsor has also signed an agreemen t to support to enable DSS to apply the proration provisions in DSSM 9081.2(E). If such information about other aliens for whom the sponsor is responsible is not provided to DSS, attribute the deemed income and resource amounts to the applicant in their entir ety until such time as the information is provided. The alie n is also responsible for rep orting the required information about the sponsor and sponsor's spouse should the alien obtain a different sponsor du ring the certification period and for reporting a change in income should the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse change or los e employment or become deceased during the certification period. Handle such change in accordance with th e timeliness standards and procedures in DSSM 9085. 9081.5 Awaiting Verification Until the alien provides information or verification needed to calculate deemed income and resources, the sponsored alien is ineligible f or benefits. DSS will determine the eligi bility of any remaining household members. The income and resources (excluding the deemed income and resou rces of the alien's sponsor and the sponsor's spouse) of th e ineligible alie n will be counted a ccording to DS SM 9076.2. If the sponsored alien refuses to cooperate in providing inform ation or verification, other adult members are responsible for providing the information or ver ification required. Once the information or verifica tion is received, DSS will act on the information as a reported change in household size according to DSSM 9085. If the same sponsor is responsible for the entire household, th e entire household is ine ligible until the household provides the needed sponsor i nformation or verification.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE93 DSS will assist aliens in obtaining verification. 9081.6 Demands for Restitution Exclude any sponsor who is participating in the Food Stamp Prog ram from a demand made under 8 CFR 213a.4(1)[Affidavit of Support on Behalf of Immigrants] for the value of food stamp benefits issued to an eligible sponsored alien he or she sponsors. 9082 Reduction of Public Assistance Benefits [273.11(j)] Do not increase food stamp benefits when a household's benefits received under another means-tested Federal, State or local welfare or public assistance program (such as but not limited to TANF, RCA or GA) have been decreased (reduced, suspended or terminated) due to failure to perform an action re quired under the assistance program or for fraud. Under no circumstances can the food stamp benefits be allowed to increas e. Actions not considered a failure to perform f or this rule inclu de: Reaching a time limit fo r time-limited benefits; Having a child that is not e ligible because of family cap; Failing to reapply or complete t he application process for con tinued assistance under another program; Failing to perfo rm an action that the individu al is unable to perform; or Failing to comply with a pure ly procedural requirement. A procedural requirement which wo uld not cause a sanction is a step that an individual must take to continue to receive benefits in the assistance program such as providing verificati on of circumstances. A substantive requirement, which would cause a sanction, is a b ehavioral requirement in the assistance program designed to improve the well-bei ng of the recipient family, suc h as participating in job search activities. The following conditions apply: 1. The rule applies to individua ls who fail to p erform a requi red action while receiving assistance. 2. The rule does not apply to individuals who fail to perform a required action at the time the individual initially applies for assistance. 3. The rule applies to individuals who fail to perform a requi red action during an application for continued benefits as long as there is no b reak in participation. 4. The individual must be certified for food stamps at the tim e of the failure to perform a required action for this rule to apply. 5. Assistance benefits shall be considered reduced if they are decreased, suspended, or terminated. 6. If the means-tested assistance program fails to verify an i ndividual's failure to perform a required action, this rule will not apply and DSS will not be held respon sible as long as DSS made a good faith effort to get the information. 7 . D S S , n o t t h e i n d i v i d u a l , i s responsible for obtaining infor mation about sanctions from other programs and changes in those sanctions. 8. The rule applies for the duration of the reduction in the a ssistance and cannot continue beyond the sanction of the assistance program. 9. When a TANF case closes, t he food stamp sanction will remai n in place for one year or until the individual no longer is considered a mandatory Employment and Training partic ipant. 10. DSS must restore lost benefit s i f i t i s l a t e r d i s c o v e r e d t h at the reduction in the public assistance was not appropriate. 10 DE Reg. 1704 (05/01/07) 9083 Homeless Food Stamp Households [273.11(h)] Permit homeless food stamp households to use their food stamp b enefits to purchase prepared meals from homeless meal providers authorized by FNS.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE94 9084 Pre-Release Applicants Permit a household which consists of a resident or residents of a public institution which applies for SSI under SSA's Pre- release Program for the Institutionalized to apply for foo d stamp benefits jointly with their application for SSI prior t o their release from the institution. Certify such households in accordance with 273.12] Certified food stamp households are required to report the foll owing changes in circumstances: Simplified Reporting Requirements The following reportin g requirements are for all households: Households are required to report income changes only when the monthly income exceeds 130 percent of the pov- erty income guideline for the household size that existed at th e time of certification or recertification. When a household's monthly income exceeds 130 percent of the p overty income guidelin e, the household is required to report that change within ten days after the end of the month that the household determines the income is over the 130 percent amount. Households will not have to report any changes i n the househol d composition, residence and resulting changes in shelter costs, acquisition of no n-excluded licensed vehicles, w hen liquid resources exceed $2000.00 or changes in the legal child sup port obligation. Additional reporting requirement for ABAWD individuals: Adults living in a home without any minor children, who are ge tting food benefits because they are working more than 20 hours a week, must r eport when they start working less than 20 hours a week. An applicant household must report all changes related to its f ood benefit eligibility and bene fits at the certification interview. Households assigned a 12-month ce rtification period are require d to complete and return an interim report in the 6th month of the certifi cation period. DSS w ill close the food bene fit case when a household fails to complete and return the interim report. Households assigned a 24-month certification period are require d to complete and return an interim report in the 12th month of the certifi cation period. DSS w ill close the food bene fit case when a household fails to complete and return the interim report. Only the reporting requirements in this Section can be imposed by the Division. 10 DE Reg. 560 (09/01/06) 12 DE Reg. 462 (10/01/08) 13 DE Reg. 1086 (02/01/10) 9085.1 Report Form [273.12(b)] Provide each household applying for benefits or being recertifi ed for benefits with Form 130 with which to report changes listed above within 10 d ays. Provide a postpaid return envelope. Send a new form to the household whenever a change is reported via a form. 9085.2 DSS Responsibilities: Action on Changes [273.12(c)] Take prompt action on all changes to determine if the changes a ffect the household's eligibi lity or allotment. Even if there is no change in the allotm ent, document reported changes in the case file, provide anot her change report form to the household, and notify the househ old of the effect of the change , if any, on its benefits. Document the date of receipt of the report form or the date a change is reported by phone or in per son. If a household reports a change in income which is expected to continue for at least one month beyond the month in which the change is reported, act on the changeTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE95 according to DSSM 9085.3 and 9085.4. If DSS fails to take acti on on a change within the ti me limits specified in DSSM 9085.3, restore the lost benefits. PA households have the same reporting requirements as any other food stamp household and shall use the change report form. PA households who report changes to their workers for PA purposes will be considered to have reported the change for food stamp purposes as well. 9085.3 Processing Changes Which Increase Benefits [273.12(c)(1)] For changes which result in an increase in a household's benefi ts, make the change effective no later than the first allotment issued ten (10) days a fter the date the change is rep orted to the Division. For changes which produce an increase in benefits as the result of the addition of a new household member who is not a member of another certified h ousehold or as the result of a d ecrease of $50 or more in the household's gross monthly income, make the change effective not later than the first allo tment issued ten (10) days after the date the change is reported. These chan ges must take effect n o later than the mon th following in which th e change is reported. For example, a $30 decrease in i ncome reported on the 15th day of May would increase the household's June allotment. If the same decrease were reported on May 28, and t he household's normal issuanc e cycle was on June 1, the household's allotment would have to be increased by July. If the change is reported after the 20th of a month and it is t oo late for the Division to a djust the following monthly allotment, issue a supplement by the 10th day of the following month or, if possible, in t he household's normal issuance cycle in that month. For example, a household reporting a $100 decrease in income at any t ime during the month of May would have its June allotment increased. If the household repo rted the change after the 20th of May and it is too late to adjust the benefit nor mally issued on June 1, issue a supplemen t for the amount of the increase by June 10. Verify changes which result in an increase in a household's ben efit in accordance with the verification requirements in DSSM 9038, prior to taking action on these changes except in th e case of newborn infants. W hen a household reports the birth of a newborn, add the newbo rn to the household when the b aby comes home according to DSSM 2006. Allow the household ten (10) days from the date the change is reported to provide verification required by DSSM 9038. If the household provides verification within this period, take action on the changes within the timeframes specified above. The timeframes will run from the date the change was reported, not from the date of verification. If, however, the household fails to provide the re quired verification within ten (10) days after the change is reported bu t does provide the verification at a later date, then the timeframes specified in the first and se cond paragraphs of this section for taking action on changes will run from t he date the verification is provided rather than from the date the change is reported. In cases where DSS has determined that a household has refused to cooperate as defined in DSSM 9029, the household's eligibilit y will be terminated following the notice of adverse action. 9085.4 Decreases in Benefits [273.12(c)(2)] If the household's benefit level decreases or the household bec omes ineligible as a result of the change, issue a notice of adverse action (see DSSM 9006) within ten (10) days of the d ate the change was reported unless one of the exemptions to the notice of adverse action in DSSM 9006.3 applies. When a notice of adverse action is used, make the decrease in the benefit level effective no later than the allotment for the month following the month in which the notice of adverse actio n period has expired, provided a fair hearing and continuation of benefits have not been requested. When a notice of adverse action is not used due to one of the e xemptions in DSSM 9006.3, make the decrease effective no later than the month following the change. Verifi cation which is required by DSSM 9032 must be obtained prior to recertification. 9085.5 Unclear Information When information about changes i n a household's circumstances a re unclear and DSS cannot determine the effect on the household's benefit, DSS mu st clarify and verify the change s as follows: DSS must issue a written request for contact (RFC) which clearl y advises the household of the verification it must provide or the actions it must ta ke to clarify its circumstance s.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE96 Allow the household at least ten (10) days to respond and to cl arify its circumstances either by telephone or by correspondence, as directed by DSS. If the household fails to respond to the RFC, or does respond b ut refuses to provide suffici ent information to clarify its circumstances, DSS will terminate the case and issue a notice o f adverse action explaining the reason for the action. Inform the household t hat a new application must be filed if th e household wishes to continue to receive benefits. When the household responds to the RFC and provides sufficient information, process the changes according to DSSM 9085.3 and DSSM 9085.4. 9085.6 Failure to Report [273.12(d)] If a household fails to report a change as required under DSSM 9085 and, as a result, receives benefits to which it is not entitled, file a claim against the household in accordance with DSSM 7000. If the discovery is made within the certification period, the househol d is entitled to a notice of adverse action in advance if the household's benefits are reduced. A household is not to be held liable for a claim beca use of a change in household circumstances which it is not required to report. Do not terminate individuals for failure t o report a change unless the individual is disqualified in accordance with the disqualificat ion procedures specified in DS SM 2023. 9086 Mass Changes [7 CFR 273.12(e)] Certain changes are initiated by the State or Federal governmen t which may affect the entir e caseload or significant portions of the caseload. These changes include adjustments to income eligibility standa rds and the shelter care deduction; adjustments to the maximum food stamp allotment and standard deduction; annual and seasonal adjustments to utility standards, p eriodic cost- of- living adjustments to RSDI, SSI, and other Federal benefits; periodic adjustments to TANF, RCA or GA payments; and o ther changes in the eligibility and benefit criteria based on legislative or regulatory changes. See Administrative Notice: A-15-99 October 1999 Cost of Living Adjustments12 DE Reg. 1329 (04/01/09) 9086.1 Federal Adjustments to El igibility Standards, Allotments , Deductions and State Adjustments to Utility Standards DSS will implement these changes for all households at a specif ic point in time. Adjustments to Federal standards shall be implemented prospective ly regardless of the household' s budgeting system. Annual and seasonal adjustments in State utility standards shall also be implem ented prospectively for all households. Although notices of adverse action are not required for such ch anges [see DSSM 9006.3(1)], individual notices may be sent and the various changes will be publicized through the new s media, at issuance off ices and at other sites. Households whose certification periods overlap a seasonal varia tion in the utility standard will be advised at the time of initial certification of when the adjustme nt will occur and wha t the variation in the bene fit level will be, if known. 9086.2 Mass Changes in Public Assistance If the Division makes mass change s to public assistance grants and has at least 30 days advance knowledge of the amount of the public assistance adjustment, food stamp benefits will be recomputed to be effe ctive in the same month as the public assistance (TANF, RCA or GA) change, or, if the Divi sion does not have at least 30 days advance knowledge, the food stamp change will be effecti ve not later than the month fo llowing the month in which the public assistance change was made. 9086.3 Mass Changes in Federal BenefitsTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE97 Monthly reporting households must report the change on the appr opriate monthly report, but are not required to report these types of changes outside the monthly report. Handle the information provided on the report in accordance with normal procedures. Households no t subject to monthly reporting are not responsible for reporting these changes. 9087 Notices for Mass Changes [273.12(e)(4)] When DSS effects a mass change, all households whose benefits a re reduced or terminated (unless the action is the result of an adjustmen t to a Federal benefit ) must be notified. The household must be notified by the date it is scheduled to r eceive the changed allotment. However, the notice should be given as much before t he household's scheduled issuan ce date as reasonably possible, but not earlier than the time required for advance notice of adverse action. At a minimum, DSS must inform the household of: The general nature of the change; Examples of the changes effect on the household's allotment; The month in which the change will take effect; The household's right to a fair hearing; The household's right to continue benefits and under what circu mstances benefits will continue pending a fair hearing; The liability the hous ehold will incur for any overissued benef its if the fair hearing decision is adverse. 9088 Continuation of Benefits [273.12(e)(6)] A household requesting a fair hearing due to a mass change is e ntitled to continued benefits at its previous level only if it meets three criteria: 1) The household does not specifi cally waive its right to a cont inuation of benefits; 2) The household requests a fair hearing in accordance with DSSM 9006; and 3) The household's fair hearing is based upon improper computati on of food stamp eligib ility or benefits or upon misapplication or misin terpretation of Federal law or regulatio n. 9089 TANF, RCA and/or GA Food Stamp Households [273.12(f)] TANF, RCA and/or GA households have the same reporting requirem ents as any other food stamp households. Whenever an TANF, RCA and/or GA household reports a change, adj ustments must be made in t he household's eligibility status or allotment for the months determined appropriate given the household's budgeting cycle. Notify households whenever their benefits are altered as a resu lt of changes in the TANF, RCA and/or GA benefits. If the TANF, RCA and/or GA benefits are terminated but the househo ld is still eligible for food stamp benefits, advise household members of food stamp work registration requirements, if applicable, as their Food Stamp Employment and Training registration exemption no longer applies. Whenever a change results in the reduction or termination of a household's TANF, RCA and/or GA benefits within its food stamp certification period, and DSS has sufficient informa tion to determine how the change affects the household's food stamp eligibility and benefit level, take t he following ac tions: If a change in household circumstances requires both reduction or termination in the TANF, RCA and/or GA payment and a reduction or termination in food stamp benefits, issue a single notice of adverse action for both the TANF, RCA and/ or GA and food stamp actions. If the household requests a fair hearing within the period provided by the notice of adverse action, continue the household's food stamp benefit on the basi s authorized immediately prior to sending the notice. If the fair hearing is requested for both programs' benefits, conduct the hearing according to TANF, RCA and/or GA procedures and timeliness standards. The household must reapply for food stamp benefits if the food stamp certification period expiresTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE98 before the fair hearing process is completed. If the household does not appeal, make the change effective in accordance with the procedures in DSSM 9085.2. If the household's food stamp b enefits will be increased as a r esult of a reduction or termination of TANF, RCA and/or GA benefits, the household's food stamp benefits must continue at the previous basis. If th e household does not appeal, make the change effective in accordance with the procedures spe cified in DSSM 9085.2, except calculate the time limits for action from the date the TANF, RCA and/or GA notice of adverse action period expires. Whenever a change results in the termination of a household's T ANF, RCA and/or GA benefits within its food stamp certification period, and DSS does not have sufficient informat ion to determine how the change affects the household's food stamp eligibility and benefit level (such as when an absen t parent returns to a househ old, rendering the household categorically ineligib le for TANF, RCA and/or GA, and DSS has n o information on the income of the new household member), take the following action: 1) Where a TANF, RCA and/or GA notice of adverse action has been sent, wait until the household's notice of adverse action period expires or until the household requests a fair hearing, whichever occurs first. If the household requests a fair hearing and its TANF, RCA and/or GA benefits ar e continued pending the appeal, the household's food stamp benefits will be continued at the same basis. 2) If an TANF, RCA and/or GA notice of adverse action is not req uired, or the household decides not to request a fair hearing and continuation of its TANF, RCA and/or GA benefi ts, send the household Form 105 requesting the verification needed to determine the household's continued food stamp eligib ility. Give the househo ld at least ten (1 0) days to provide the necessary verifications. Take the necessary action to adju st or terminate the food stamps based on the rules regarding processing reported changes per DSSM 9085. 9090 Procedures for Reducing. S uspending or Canceling Food Stam p Benefits [271.7]; [273.10(e)(2)(vi)] Under the Food Stamp Ac t of 1977, the Secret ary of Agriculture may not spend more money f or food stamp allotments than is appropriated by Congress. If the Secretary of Agricult ure determines that there is not enough money available to provide full benefits to all cert ified households, USDA is requ ired to reduce the value of the benefits issued to those households. This section estab lishes the procedures to be used if such an action is necessary . Such action may be a suspension or cancellation of allotments for one or more months , a reduction in allotment leve ls for one or more months, or a combination of these three acti o n s . A t s u c h t i m e a s a d e c i s i on is made to implement reduction, suspension, or cancellation procedures, FNS will notify DSS of t he date of act ion and all relevant details. 9090.1 Notification of Eligible Households Reductions, suspensions, and ca ncellations of allotments will b e regarded as Federal adjustments to allotments. As such, DSS will notify h ouseholds of r eductions, suspensions, an d cancellations of allotments in accordance with the notice provisions of DSSM 9086, excep t that DSS will not provide notic es of adverse action to house holds affected by reductions, suspensions, or cance llations of allotments. 9090.2 Restoration of Benefits Households whose allotments are reduced or cancelled as a resul t of the enactment of these procedures are not entitled to the restoration of t he lost benefits at a future da te. However, if there is a surplus of funds as a result of the reduction or can cellation, FNS will direct DSS to provide affec ted households with restored b enefits unless it is determined that the amount of surplus funds is too small to make this prac ticable. 9090.3 Effect of Reductions, Susp ensions and Cancellations on t he Certification of Eligible Households Except as provided in DSSM 9090. 4, determinations of the eligib ility of applicant househol ds will not be affected by reductions, suspensions, or cancellations of allotments. DSS w ill accept and process applicat ions and deter mine eligibility during a month(s) in which a redu ction, suspension, or cancella tion is in effect. If an applicant is found to be eligible for benefits and a reduction is in effect, the amount of benefits w ill be calculated by reducing the maximum food stamp allotment amount by the appropriate percentage for the applican t's household size and then deducting 30 percent of the household's net food stamp income from the reduced maximum food stamp allotment amount. If the applicant is found toTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE99 be eligible for benefits while a suspension or cancellation is in effect, no benefits will be issued to the applicant until issuance is again authorized by FNS. 9090.4 Expedited Service Households eligible to receive expedited processing who apply f or program benefits during months in which reductions or suspensions are in effect, will have their cases processed i n accordance with the expedi ted processing provisions of DSSM 9041. However, if a suspension is still in effect at the time the issuance is to be made, the issuance will be suspended until the suspension is ended. In the case of a canc ellation, the deadline for completing the processing for expedited service will be five day s or the end of the month of application, whichever date is l ater. All other rules pertaini ng to expedited service contained in DSSM 9041 will be applicable to these cases. The reduction, suspension, or cancellation of allotments in a g iven month will have no effect o n the certific ation periods assigned to households. Those participating households whose ce rtification periods expire during a month in which allotments have been reduced, sus pended, or cancelled will be r ecertified according to the provisions of DSSM 9091. Households found eligible to part icipate during a month in whic h allotments have been reduc ed, suspended, or cancelled will have certification periods a ssigned in accord ance with the provisions of DSSM 9061. 9090.5 Fair Hearings Any household that has its allotment reduced, suspended, or can celled as a result of an order issued by FNS in accordance with these rules may request a fair hearing if it di sagrees with the action, subj ect to the following conditions: 1) DSS will not be required to hol d fair hearings unless the req uest for a fair hearing is based on a household's belief that its benefit level was computed incorrectly under th ese rules or that the rules were misapplied or m isinterpreted. 2) DSS will be allowed to deny fa ir hearings to those households who are merely disputing the fact that a reduction, suspension, or cancellation was ordered. Since the reduction, suspension, or cancellation would be neces sary to avoid an expenditure of funds beyond those appropriated by Congress, households do not have a right to continuation of benefits pending the fair hearing. A household may receive retroactive benefits in an appropriate am ount if it is determined that its benefits were reduced by more than the amount by which DSS was directed to reduce benefi ts. 9091 Recertification [273.14] No household may participate bey ond the expiration of the assig ned certification period without a determination of eligibility for a new period. Ho useholds must apply for recerti fication and comply with the interview and verification requirements per DSSM 9030 and DSSM 9038. The joint processing requirements in DSSM 9042 for TANF, RCA an d / or General Assistance households continue to apply to applications for recertifications. 9091.1 Notice of Expiration All households must be provided with a notice of expiration at the end of its certification prior to the start of the last month of its certification period. When a household is certified for one month or when the certifi cation action is not completed until the second month of a two-month certification, provi de a notice of expiration at th e time of certification. All other households must be provided a notice of expiration at least one day before the last month, bu t no earlier than the next to the last month of the certificati on period. The form for notifying a household of the expiration of its cer tification must contain th e following information: A) The date the current certification period ends.B) The date by which the househol d must file an a pplication for certification to receive uninterrupted benefits. Households certified for one month or certified in the second m onth if a two-month certification period shall be provided a notice of expiration at the time of certification. All other households must be provided a notice of expiration before the first day of the las t month of the certification per iod. The notice of expiration (Form 31 0) contains the following info rmation:TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE10 A. The date the current certification period ends. B. The date by which the household must file an application for recertification to receive uninterrupted benefits. C. The consequences of failure to comply with the notice of expi ration, D. The household's right to request an application and have DSS accept an application as long as it is signed and contains a leg ible name and address. E. The household's right to file the application by mail or thro ugh an authorized representative. F. The address of the office wher e the application must be filed . G. The household's right to request a fair hearing. H. The fact that any household consisting only of SSI applicants or recipients is entitled to apply for food stamp recertification at an offi ce of the Social Security Admin istration. I. Notice that the h ousehold must appear for any interview sch eduled on or after the date the application is timely filed in o rder to receive uninterrupted benefits. J. Notice that the household is responsible for rescheduling an y missed interview and for providing required verificat ion information. 9091.2 Application Form All households must complete an application form in order for D SS to obtain all information needed to determine eligibility and benefits for a ne w certification period. A hou sehold's signature and date is required at all recertifications regardless of the type of application used. The type of applic ation used can be updating the online version, completing a long version hardcopy, completing the short review form, or upd ating an initial long version hardcopy application. The recertification process can only be used for households which a pply before the end of their current certification period except for the provisions under DSSM 9091.8. 9091.3 Interview A face-to-face recertification interview will be held with a me mber of each applying household or its authorized representative at least once every 12 months for households cer tified for 12 months or less. Face-to-face interviews can be waived per DSSM 9030. DSS will conduct a telephone intervie w or a home visit for households for whom the office interview is waived. Schedule the Interview on or after the date the application was filed if the interview has not been previously scheduled, or the household has failed to appear for any interviews schedu led prior to this time and has requested another interview. Schedule the interview so that the household has at least ten ( 10) days after the interview in which to provide verification before the certification period expires. If a household misses a scheduled interview, send the household a notice of missed interview. If the household miss es its scheduled interview and requests another interview, s chedule a second interview. 9091.4 Verification Information provided by the hous ehold shall be verified accordi ng to DSSM 9038. Inform households of what required verification must be provided a nd of the date by which the veri fications must be returned. The household must be allowed at least ten (10) calendar days to provide required verificatio n. Households whose eligibility is not determined by the end o f the current certification period due to the time period allowed for returning verifications shall receive their benefits for t he full month, if eligible, within five (5) working days after the hous ehold submits the missing verification and benefits cannot be prorated. 9091.5 Timely Application for Recertification A household submitting a timely a pplication for recertification and meeting all other processing steps in a timely manner has a right to receive uninterrupted benefits. Households reporting required changes in circumstances that are certified for one month or certified in the second month of a two-month certification period shall have 15 days fr om the date the notice of expiration is received to file a time ly application for recertification. Other households reporting required changes in circumstances th at submit applications by the 15th day of the last month of the certification period shall be considered to have m ade a timely application for recertification.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE101 For households consisting only of SSI applicants or recipients who apply for food stamp rece rtification at SSA offices according to DSSM 9043, an application shall be considered file d for normal processing purposes when the signed application is recei ved by the SSA office. Households which timely reapply do not lose their right to unin terrupted benefits for failure to submit any requested verification prior to the date the househo ld submits a timely a pplication for recertification. 9091.6 Timely Processing Provide uninterrupted benefits to any household determined elig ible after the household has: 1. Timely filed an application, 2. Attended an interview, unles s waived per DSSM 9030, and 3. Submitted all necessary verification within the ten (10) day timeframe. Notify households that were cert ified for one month or certifie d for two months in the sec ond month of the certification period and have met all required application procedures of thei r eligibility or ineligibility. Pr ovide eligible households an opportunity to receive benefits no later than 30 calendar days after the date the household received its last allotment. Other households that have met all application requirements sha ll be notified of the ir eligibility or ine ligibility by the end of their current certification pe riod. Provide households dete rmined eligible an opportunity to participate by the household' s normal issuance cycle in the month following the end of its cur rent certification period. Any household not determined elig ible in sufficient time to pro vide for issuance in that timeframe due to the time period allowed for submitting any missing verification must receive an opportunity to participate, if eligible, within five (5) worki ng days after the household supplie s the missing verification. 9091.7 Delayed Processing Caused by DSS If an eligible household files an application before the end of the certification period but DSS does not complete the recertification process within th e 30 days after the date of th e application, continue to process that case and provide a full month's allotment for the first m onth of the new certification period. 9091.8 Delayed Processing Caused by the Household If the household files an application by the end of the certifi cation period, but fails to take a required action, deny the application at the end of 30 days . The household has 30 days a fter the end of the certification period to complete the process and have its application treated as an application for recertification. If the household takes the required action before the end of th e certification period, reopen the case and provide a full month's benefits for the initial month of the new certification period. If the household takes the required action after the end of the certification period but withi n 30 days after the end of the certification period, reopen the case and provide benefits retr oactive to the date the househo ld takes the required action. If the household files an application within 30 days after the end of the certification period, the application shall be considered an application for recertification. Prorate benefit s from the date of the applicati on. If a household's applicati on for recertification is delayed beyond the first of the month of a new certification period due to agency error, prorate the benefits from the date of the new application and then restore benefits back to the date the hou sehold's certification period should have started if not for the agency error. 9091.9 Expedited Service for Recertification Do not apply expedited service pr ovisions of DSSM 9041 to house holds which apply for recertification before the end of its current certification period. 9092 Simplified Food Stamp Program - Work For Your Welfare DSS was approved by Food and Nutrition Service, under the Unite d States Department of Agriculture, to operate a S i m p l i f i e d F o o d S t a m p P r o g r a m ( S F S P ) . T h e S F S P p e r m i t s a s t a t e to substitute certain TANF and RCA rules and procedures for food stamp rules. Delaware's SFSP component is the Work For Your Welfare program rules.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE10 Households in which all members, or one or more members, receiv e TANF or RCA may participate in the SFSP. Non- Public Assistance (NPA) househol ds will not participate in the SFSP. The SFSP will follow all the regula r food stamp rules for deter mining eligibility and certif ying household s. Under the SFSP, the changes in the food stamps rule s that will affect Wor k For Your Welfare TANF or RCA households who receive food stamps are: replacing food stamp Work For Your Welfare penalties with the TANF or RCA Workfare program requirements and penalties, and replacing food stamp work exempt ions with TANF or RCA exemptio ns. The three TANF or RCA work exemptions are: a) A single, custodial parent cari ng for a child under 12 months of age; or b) An individual determined unemployable by a health care profes sional; or c) A parent caring for a disabled family member in the home who does not attend s chool full time. The SFSP allows Delaware to require single, custodial parents w ho are receiving TANF or R CA and caring for children age 12 months and older to participate in Work For Your Welfare . The SFSP also allows Delaware to use the food stamp allotment along with the TANF o r RCA grant to determine the num ber of hours of Work For Your Welfare participation. DELAWARE'S WORK FOR YOUR WELFARE PROGRAM Work for Your Welfare is defined as a work experience program i n which participants work to earn their benefits. Those in Workfare must participate for a predetermined number of hour s each week. Required Hours of Participation: One-parent household s will be required to w ork the maximum part icipation hours of 30 hours per week. Two-parent households will be required to work the maximum part icipation hours of 35 hours per week. If the household receives subsidized c hildcare assistan ce, the maximum participation hours incr ease to 55 hours per week. Determine the required hours of work experience participation: 1. The pre-sanctioned TANF grant is divided by the current state minimum wage, and the result is rounded down. 2. The food stamp allotment is di vided by the current state mini mum wage, and the res ult is rounded down. 3. The two results (#1 and #2), added together, are the maximum monthly number of hours for which the family/household is required to participate in work experience. The family/household may have to participate in other activities to the maximu m hours of participation. 4. The monthly number of hours ( #3) is divided by 4.33 to get a weekly number of hours, rounded down. 5. Compare the weekly number of hours (#4) to the maximum requir ed for a one or two-parent household. Use the lesser number for the weekly number of hours. 6. The weekly number of hours (#5) is divided by 5 to get the da ily participation requirement, rounded down. (This step is needed to give th e Contractor and Client an idea of how to schedule the work on a daily basis to assure that the Client is able to meet the re quired work exper ience hours o f participation.) Work For Your Welfare If the participant does not meet the required number of work ex perience hours, the penalty will be the closure of the entire TANF case for a minimum of one month and a mandatory fou r consecutive weeks of participation. SUMMARY OF THE SIMPLIFIED FOOD STAMP PROGRAM: The simplified food stamp program increases the age at which a child exempts a single, custodial parent from work requirements in Work for Your Welfare to under 12 months. If the participant does not meet the required number of work e xperience hours, the penalty will be the closure of the entire TANF case for a minimum of one month and a mandatory fou r consecutive weeks of participation. When a TANF case closes, the fo od stamp sanction will remain i n place for one year or unt il the individual no lon- ger is considered a mandatory Em ployment and Training participa nt. 10 DE Reg. 1704 (05/01/07)TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE103 9093 Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT ) is the method by which Delawa re Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) issues food benefits to participa nts. The EBT card is a plastic card called the Delaware Food First Card. The card is used with a Personal Identification Num ber (PIN) at grocery retailer s to purchase food. Delaware uses an EBT contracto r to manage the EBT cards. Client /case file and benefit information are transmitted through an interface between the EBT contractor and the Divisio n's data processing systems. EBT did not change the way that eligibility determinations are made for food benefits. EBT affected the way that food benefits are delivered to participants. EBT provides greater pr ivacy and security for thos e receiving food benefits. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.1RESERVED 12 DE Reg. 1092 (02/01/09) 15 DE (01/01/12) 9093.2Using EBT for Food Benefits 7 CFR 274.4 The household may use its EBT card in any grocery store, conven ience store, farmers' market, etc., anywhere in the United States, authorized by FNS to accept the card. The benefi ts may be used the same as ca sh to purchase any food or food product prepared for human consumption. Households cannot use benefits to purchase alcoholic beverages, tobacco, soap and paper products, and hot foods or hot foods prepared fo r immediate consumption. Households can use benefits to buy seeds and plants for use in gardens to produce food for per sonal consumption by the eligible household. EBT benefits are available 24 hours a day, seven days per week including weekends and holidays. DHSS issues benefits on a daily and monthly basis. DHSS issues monthly bene fits on the same day each month for each household based on a staggered issuance schedule. The EBT contractor post s benefits in the household' s account by 6 a.m. the day after benefits are app roved in DCIS II. There is no minimum dollar amount per transaction. There is no maximum limit on the number of transactions a household can make. Stores cannot impose transaction fees on fo od benefit households using their EBT card. Households can check their food benefit account balances withou t making a purchase or stan ding in a checkout line. Households receive printed receipts at the time of transactions . When transacting food benefits by EBT, the household cannot rec eive change. When a household returns food to a store, the store will credit the household's EBT account with t he amount of the refund. The household cannot receive a cash refund for r eturned food. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.3Food Benefit EBT Adjustments 7 CFR 274.2 The EBT contractor makes adjustments to EBT accounts to correct system errors. A system error is an error resulting from a malfunction at any point in the redemption process, for example, errors made at the grocery store. Adjustments are initiated by the client or store and may result in a debit or c redit to the household. DHSS will emphasize to clients that they should review their tr ansaction slips before leaving the store. If there is a mistake, the client should discuss the problem with the store c lerk or manager before leaving the store. Problems discovered later must be resolve d through the EBT contractor Cu stomer Service Unit. Client-Initiated Adjustments An EBT credit adjustment occurs when the EBT contractor returns benefits to a household's account after the store deducted the benefits in error. For example, a household member uses an EBT card to purchase gr oceries. Due to a system error, the store debited the purchase amount from the household's EBT account twice.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE10 The household has 90 days from t he date of the problem transact ion to contact the EBT cont ractor Customer Service at 1-800-526-9099 and inform the customer service representativ e that a problem has occurr ed. The household will need to tell the customer service representative the date, time and location of the transaction and the amount of food benefits that were debited in error. If the request is a legitimate r equest, the EBT contractor will return the funds to the househo ld's EBT account within 10 business days from the date the h ousehold filed the report with the EBT contractor Customer S ervice Unit. A business day is any calendar day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a federa l holiday. If the household's request is not legitimate, the EBT contracto r will deny the credit adjustment. The household may request a fair hearing. The EBT contractor will take no action to credit the household's EBT account unless the hearing decision is in the household's favor. Retailer-Initiate d Adjustments A retailer-initiated adjustment occurs when the retailer does n ot receive a credit for an EBT purchase amount when the household made the purchase. The store needs the adjustment to get credit for the purchas e made by the household. For example, a household uses the EBT card to purchase $200 wor th of groceries. The credit to the store's account does not go through and the $200 remains in the household's acc ount. DHSS must act upon all adjustments to debit a household's accou nt no later than 10 business days from the date the error occurred, by placing a hold on the adjusted amount in the household's account. If there are insufficient benefits to cover the entire adjustment, DHS S will place a hold on any rema ining balance that exists and the whole amount will be debited from the household's acco unt when the next month's bene fits become available. DHSS will send an adequa te notice as defined in DSSM 9094 to th e household informing it of the account adjustment. The household has 90 days from t he date of the notice to reques t a fair hearing. If the household disputes the adjustment and requests a hearing within 10 days of the notice, DHSS will make a provisional credit to the household's account by releasing the hold on the adjustment balance within 48 hours of the request by the household, pending resolut ion of the fair hearing. If th e household does not request for a hearing within 10 days of the notice, DHSS will re lease the hold on th e adjustment balanc e, and credit this amount t o the retailer's account. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.4Account Balances An EBT food benefit account does not close when a food benefit DCIS case closes. The former recipient remains entitled to the account balance. A s long as benefits remain in the EBT food benefit account, the former recipient may have cards issued or reissu ed and be able to se lect or change PINs. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.5Manual Transactions 7 CFR 274.8(d) Sometimes circumstances cause the client or store clerk to ente r the transaction manually instead of swiping the EBT card through the POS machine. This happens when the card's magn etic stripe becomes scratched, worn or demagnetized. Until the client can get a new card iss ued, the client can stil l use the card at a retailer. The clerk keys the card number in manually to complete the transaction. Only the client should enter his/her PIN. The client should never reveal the PIN to a store clerk when enteri ng a manual transaction. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.6Manual Vouchers 7 CFR 274.8(d) Retailers use a manual voucher process when the EBT contractor system or the terminals are not working and cannot accept the EBT card for a food benefit purchase. Retailers do not have to use the manual p rocess, but most will not turn away a sale.TITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE105 Retailers that do not have POS terminals, for example, farmers' markets and street or route vendors also use manual vouchers. The manual voucher is a paper form on which the retailer writes the card number, the cardholder's name, the store FNS number, and the dollar amount of the sale. The client must sign the voucher. The retailer must call in manual vouchers to the EBT contractor to get an authorization for the amount of the transaction. The retailer calls in to make sure that the money is in the client's account. If the client has enough fun ds in the account to cover the transaction, the retailer subtra cts the whole amount of the transact ion from the client's account. Retailers use manual vouchers when the EBT contractor system is down. Since the retailer cannot confirm whether the client has an available ba lance, the client is limited to a $40.00 purchase. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.7EBT & Timely Application Processing 7 CFR 274.2(b) DHSS must provide eligible households that complete the initial application process an opportunity to participate as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days following the date the household filed the application. With EBT, FNS has issued guidelines saying that the opportunity to participat e is the date the money is posted to the account plus two days when mailing the EBT card. DHSS mails most EBT cards. Cli ents may pick up a card at the local office after notifying the worker not to have the card mailed. To avoid these timeline ss errors, staff will need to take the action to approve a case on or befo re the 26th day at the latest. When it is not possible to proce ss the case on or before the 28th day because the client did not turn in the verifications or worker time constraints, docu ment the case record. The error may still count but the explanation will be there. 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.8EBT Benefits and Claim Issues When the EBT contractor posts t he EBT benefits to the household 's account, the household is considered in receipt of those benefits. If the household receives benefits it was not entitled to, DHSS/ARMS will establish a claim. DHSS/ARMS establishes a claim even if the household has not used the bene fits in the EBT account. As long as the benefits are in the account, the household has access to those benefits and owes th e State the amount of the claim. ARMS must allow a household to pay its claim using benefits fro m its EBT benefit account ac cording to DSSM 7004.3. Benefits not used for 230 days are stale and ARMS can use the s tale benefits to credit a household's claim with the consent of the household. The EBT contractor will expunge be nefits not used for 365 days from the household's account and credit the amount to a household's outstanding claim. 12 DE Reg. 1092 (02/01/09) 15 DE Reg. 1030 (01/01/12) 9093.9Aging Periods and Expungement Process 7 CFR 274.2(h)(2) Benefits remain available to the household for 365 days from th e date of availability. The E BT contractor sends reports to DHSS that show accounts with no activity. The EBT contracto r provides DHSS with a report for the following periods of time: Period 1: 60 days Period 2: 90 days Period 3: 230 days Period 4: 365 days A household will get a notice at Periods 1, 2 and 3 if the hous ehold has not used benefits for 60, 90 or 230 days. Stale benefits are benefits not used by these time periods. The noti ce will tell the ho usehold the follo wing information: The account has not been used in the past 60, 90 or 230 daysTITLE 16 HEALTH AND SAFETY DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE10 To call the EBT contractor cust omer service unit to get the ba lance on the account Stale food benefits not used fo r 230 days can be applied to an y existing claim with the client's permission Food benefits that a re not used by day 3 65 will be removed fro m the account forever Food benefits remov ed from th e account on day 365 will be appl ied to any remaining food benefit claim On day 230, DHSS will generate n otices to clients with outstand ing claims. The notice tells the household that ARMS will apply benefits not u sed for 230 da ys to the outstanding cl aim unless the household cont acts ARMS within 10 days. On day 250, households that do not contact ARMS to stop the rep ayment will have their stal e benefits applied to the outstanding claim. On day 365, the EBT contractor system will e xpunge (remove from the account) any remaining stale benefits and send DHSS a report of those benefits expunged.
