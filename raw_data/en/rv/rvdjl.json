IV therapy is the administration of fluids intravenously, or directly into the bloodstream. It's more effective in delivering essential vitamins and nutrients because it bypasses the gut and delivers a potent dose of energizing, immune-boosting nutrients, helping your body repair at a cellular level. Never had an IV therapy session? Our Forum Health providers ensure you are always comfortable during your IV therapy session and a qualified provider is nearby should you need anything during your infusion. Some IVs require medical clearance before administration, and others can be done on a walk-in basis. Benefits of IV Therapy - Feel better, FAST! Rapid delivery, and immediate absorption and distribution of substances throughout the body. - Give your body what it needs! IV therapy ensures increased bioavailability, so a greater proportion of the administered substance reaches its target and is available for use by the body. - Rehydrate with potent electrolytes. Replenishing fluids, salts, and essential minerals help support proper bodily functions, which can be beneficial when dealing with chronic conditions, illness and more. - Enhance recovery with a boost of vitamins, antioxidants, and amino acids to increase energy, support immune function, and help in recovery from fatigue or illness. - Customize your IV to your needs.
