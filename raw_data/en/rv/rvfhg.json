For many, energy drinks provide a pick-me-up in the afternoon or keep them going during a night shift at work. But over the years, ample research has revealed that energy drinks are, in fact, horrible for you. Instead of chugging a sugary energy drink at your desk or before you head to the gym, consider one of the several healthy alternatives to energy drinks. Some alternative beverages can help you stay awake without compromising your health. While they might not taste exactly like the sugary, soda-like energy drinks that you're used to, these best alternatives for energy drinks will keep you healthier in the long run. Why choose a healthy alternative instead of an energy drink? It's really no surprise that energy drinks are horrible for you, even the sugar-free versions. A study from the Harvard School of Public Health shows that even though energy drinks are very appealing to people who need a pick-me-up during the day, they can have a lot of bad effects on your health. Because of the high sugar and caffeine content, energy drinks can cause stomach irritation, increased stress, high blood pressure, aggressive behaviors, cigarette abuse, and even increased one's risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. So there's just no way a quick jolt of energy is worth these damaging effects! Even though some energy drinks advertise unique ingredients that are typically healthy, like ginseng root, guarana seed extract, and vitamin B, there's really no evidence that they help with mental alertness when added to an energy drink. The regular consumption of sugary, caffeine-filled energy drinks can impact your heart health even more. Another study suggests that energy drinks can be linked to heart arrhythmias. It also says that many energy drinks have ingredients like taurine and L-carnitine that lower the risk of heart disease, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. For these very serious reasons, it's best to stick with a healthy alternative to energy drinks. Boost your energy with Ens Supergreens - Buy Now!

Green Tea When most people think of tea, they think of it as coffee's less exciting, boring sister. But in reality, black and green teas can be a lot of fun as they contain quite a bit of caffeine. Green tea can boost your energy while bringing certain healthy substances to your body.

Yerba Mate can improve mental focus and boost energy, enhance performance, and protect against specific conditions as it is high in antioxidants like xanthines, saponins, polyphenols, and more. The superfood comes from South America, but it is now very popular worldwide because it is a great alternative to energy drinks. It can be brewed as strongly as coffee, but it isn't as acidic or addictive, so you don't need to worry about falling into an unhealthy habit. Yerba Mate is easy to prepare, inexpensive, and can be found at grocery stores. You can consume it hot or cold; it is rich in antioxidants, and it can boost energy and mental focus.

Bottom Line: While it shouldn't be consumed multiple times per day, a glass of yerba mate can provide a boost of energy once you hit your usual afternoon slump. 4. Fresh Juice Not be confused with the containers of orange or apple juice you find at the store. Juices that are freshly squeezed and not from concentrate can give you a boost of energy without caffeine. Depending on how much free time you have, you can even make your juice at home with a juicer and tons of fresh fruit and veggies. A common misconception is that caffeine is needed to help your body produce energy. But in reality, our bodies make energy from the foods we consume, so it's important to stay away from sugary snacks, as a crash usually follows these. When looking for a healthy fresh juice, look for one that contains ingredients like leafy greens, as this means you'll be getting vitamins A, K, and C, and iron. Citrus juices can also be very tasty and help your immune system because they are high in vitamin C. Greens powder can also be mixed into a glass of fresh juice for added health benefits.

Coffee When consumed in moderation, coffee isn't bad for you. In small amounts, it's still considered to be better than sugary energy drinks. So instead of pouring a cup of coffee multiple times daily, try to have one cup in the mornings without added sweeteners or creams high in calories. It is much healthier to eliminate any added processed sugar and replace it with honey or agave syrup. So while you may not be crazy about black coffee or a healthier version of coffee at first, be patient, as it can take months to form a new habit. Coffee can boost energy levels, it tastes delicious when mixed with your choice of milk, and it can be consumed cold or hot. However, high caffeine content can make people feel anxious or jittery, it can cause digestive issues, it's easy to become addicted to coffee, and if you don't make it at home or work, it can get expensive.

Matcha powder can be blended into milk or dairy alternatives, but to reap all the benefits, it is best to mix it with hot water. Matcha contains antioxidants like polyphenols and can boost energy and give a glow to the skin. It is delicious when prepared correctly and may even improve cardiovascular health.

On top of its energy-boosting effects, ginseng tea may help lower stress, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. In a [randomized controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23613825/) with 21 men and 69 women, ginseng helped reduce chronic fatigue and promote better energy.

Bottom Line: Ginseng comes in two varieties: Asian/Korean and American, and gives you a natural energy boost without the use of artificial substances.

Compared to energy drinks that can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, chia seed water is nutrient-dense and delivers a subtle energy boost. Chia seeds have the ability to absorb up to 12 times their weight in water, forming a gel-like consistency that helps keep you hydrated for longer periods. Chia seed water can also be customized by adding various fruits, herbs, and natural sweeteners to create a delicious and healthy drink. Bottom Line: Chia seed water provides sustained energy and hydration with powerful nutrients. While an excess of chia seeds can cause stomach discomfort, at a safe dose, it's a great alternative to energy drinks in the morning.
