EIMD/DOMS can result in decrements in endurance and resistance exercise performance. Although m any treatments have been investigated for the prevention and alleviation of EIMD/DOMS, success has been limited. PCSO -524 has been found to attenuate symptoms of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma, and thus may be a viable treatment for EIMD/DOMS and may attenuate related exercise performance decrements. PURPOSE : The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not PCSO -524 supplementation could attenuate loss of range of motion, force loss, swelling, perceived pain through algometry and biochemical markers of inflammation, intracellular muscle proteins and oxidative stress after eccentric muscle damage. METHODS: Subjects were t hirty-two hea lthy, untrained males aged 18 -26 who had not participated in a resistance training program in the past sixty days and did not exercise for more than three times per week for 30 minutes each session. Subjects supplemented for four weeks with either PCSO -524 (400 mg/day) or placebo, a fter which time p articipated in a 20- minute downhill run (DHR) at -16% grade . Functional measures of DOMS w ere measured by algometry , midline thigh girth, and maximal voluntary contraction , following supplementation and 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours following eccentric exercise . Biochemical indicators of muscle damage such as Creatine Kinase -MM, Myoglobin, Slow skeletal troponin I, Fatty Acid Bind ing Protein 3, Interleukin -6, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha, 8 -hydroxy -2' -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), and Cardiac Troponin I was measured pre -supplementation, post -supplementation and following DHR at 0, 2, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. RESULTS : PCSO -524 attenuated maximal voluntary contraction force loss significantly at 96 hours (F = 8.140 p < .001). PCSO -524 attenuated loss of range of motion at 96 hours compared to baseline (F = 8.236 p < .05) for the PCSO -524 group but did not change 5 for the placebo group . There was no significant change in muscle swelling from baseline as measured by thigh girth for either PCSO -524 or placebo. There was no significant change in perceived muscle soreness as measured by algometry for either PCSO -524 or placebo. There was significant attenuation of creatine kinase MM in the blood following EMD immediately (t = 4.467, p < .001; 95% CI = 63.0 - 169.2), 2 (t = p < .001; 95% CI = 76.1 - 178.6), 24 (t = p < .001; 95% CI = 562.5 - 775.6), 48 (t = p < .001; 95% CI = 493.2 - 706.7), (t < .001; 95% CI = 359.8 - 567.5), and 96 hours (t = 11.935, p < .001; 95% CI = 574.4 - 811.6). Significant attenuation of occurred 24 (t = 4.334, p < .001; 95% CI = 22.9 - 63.7), 48 (t = 6.402, p < .001; 95% CI = 67.7 - 131.1), 72 (t = 5.340, p < .001; 95% CI = 119.0 - 266.3), and 96 hours (t = 3.272, p < .01; 95% CI = 49.0 - 212.3) compared to placebo. Significant attenuation of skeletal muscle troponin I occurred in the PCSO -524 group compared to placebo 2 (t = 2.562, p < .05; 95% CI = 0.9 - 8.0), 24 (t = 3.561, p < .01; 95% CI = 4.4 - 15.4), 48 (t = 4.095, p < .0 01; 95% CI = 4.7 - 14.0), 72 (T = 3.222, p < .01; 95% CI = 2.5 - 11.2), and 96 hours (T = 2.177, p < .05; 95% CI = 0.3 - 10.4) post EIMD. No significant effect of supplementation status on fatty acid binding protein appearance in the blood (F = .418 p = . 523) post EMID. Significant attenuation of Interleukin -6 was observed 24 (t = 3.619, p < .01; 95% CI = 3.7 - 13.3), 48 (t = 3.993, p < .001; 95% CI = 5.8 - 17.8), 72 (t = 3.621, p < .01; 95% CI = 5.0 - 17.9), and 96 hours (t = 3.076, p < .01; 95% CI = 3.1 - 15.35) post EMID compared to placebo. A significant effect of time on TNF alpha concentration in the blood (F = 132.012 p < .001) was observed 24 (t = 4.633, p < .001; 95% CI = 11.1 - 28.5), 48 (t = 4.942, p < .001; 95% CI = 10.6 - 25.7), 72 (t = 4.747, p < .001; 95% CI = 11.3 - 28.5), and 96 hours (t = 6.349, p < .001; 95% CI = 16.8 - 32.8) post EIMD. No significant effect of time on 8 -OHdG concentration in the blood (F = 1.018 p .419) was observed in either the PCSO -524 group or placebo after EIMD. No significant effect of time was observed on cTn1 concentration in the blood (F = .420 p = .889) in either PCSO -524 or placebo after EIMD. CONCLUSIONS : Four weeks of PCSO -524 supplementation does not improve swelling as determined by thigh girth; perce ived pain by the use of algometry; appearance of Fatty Acid Binding Protein, 8 -hydroxy -2' -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), and Cardiac Troponin I in the blood in 6 untrained males after downhill running compared to placebo. Four weeks of PCSO -524 supplementation is effective at attenuating maximal voluntary contraction force loss; loss of range of motion; and reducing the appearance of creatine kinase -MM; skeletal m uscle troponin I; interleukin -6; and Tumor Necrosis Factor - alpha in the blood in untrained males after downhill running . 7 Table of Contents Acknowledgements ________________________________ ___________________ 3 Abstract ________________________________ _____________________________ 4 Chapter 1: _______________ 9 Statement Problem ________________________________ ________________________________ _______ 15 Hypotheses ________________________________ ________________________________ _________________________ 17 ________________________________ ______________________ 18 Definition of terms ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________ PCSO -524 ________________________________ ________________________________ ______________________ 20 Process of Muscle Damage ________________________________ ____ 23 Strategies to minimize EMID ________________________________ ________________________________ ___ 29 Exercise related muscle damage and free radical mechanisms ___________________________ 30 Inflammatory process ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________ 32 Strategies to minimize Inflammation ________________________________ ________________________ EPA and DHA supplementation on Inflammati on ________________________________ _________ 36 Muscle Damage Exercise Models ________________________________ _____________________________ 38 Maximal force loss and Muscle damage ________________________________ ______________________ 39 DOMS ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________ Decisions on the Hypotheses ________________________________ ________________________________ ___ 65 8 Chapter 5: Discussion Maximal Voluntary Contr Fatty acid ________________________ 87 References __________________________ 88 9 Chapter 1 : Introduction Exercise -induced muscle damage (EIMD) is an event that occurs after unaccustomed eccentric exercise and sustained metabolically demanding activitie s, resulting in a temporary rise in passive muscle tension, decrease in muscle force production (Ebbeling & Clarkson, 1989 ), increased perceptions of muscle soreness (Miles & Clarkson, 1994 ), local ized swelling (Howell, Chleboun, ) (Howatson & Someren, (Kazunori Nosaka & Clarkson, 1995 ) (McHugh et al., 1999 ) and greater concentrations of intramuscular proteins in blood (Howatson & Van Someren, 2008 ) (Stephan Sorichter et al., 1997 ). While the causes of muscle damage are unclear, literature points to mechanical damage , oxidative damage and a combination of both. Mechanical damage to the muscle results from the disruption of contractile filaments of muscle tissue especially following eccentric exercise (D. J. Newham, D. A. Jones, & P. M. Clarkson, 1987 ). Myofibril s tructural changes post -eccentric exercise are evidenced by broadening or total disruption of z -lines (Cheung, Hume, & Maxwell, 2003 ) (Garrett & Kirkendall, 2000 ), myofilament loss, redu ced numbers of mitochondria, extracellular matrix disruption due to inflammation (Stauber, Clarkson, Fritz, & Evans, 1990 ). While the exact mechanism of loss of force is unknown , it has been hypothesized that the cause may lie in the tendon attachments, elastic muscle elements or loss of function of the excitation contraction coupling (Warren et al., 1993 ). Force loss is immediate , but temporary , with more intense bouts of exercise correlated to greater losses in magnitude requiring a longer duration until force production is restored to baseline levels (D. Newham, D. Jones, & P. Clarkson, 1987 ). Additionally , training status appears to play a role in the extent of muscle damage with untrained subjects experienc ing a greater degree of EIMD/DOMS than trained individuals (Proske & Morgan, 2001 ). 10 Muscle damage results in increased swelling due to an influx of fluid into the muscle cell as evidenced by MRI (Shellock, Fukunaga, Mink, & Edgerton, 1991 ). Swelling is most pronounced 6 days post -muscle damaging exercise , and is thought to occur either due to connective tissue injury, increased capillary permeabi lity, muscle cell protein degradation, or a combination of factors. (Mair et al., 1992 ) (Takahashi et al., 1994 ). Swelling is thought to be responsible for the increase in the sensation of pain due to fluid influx into the damaged muscle and subsequent increase in pressure on nociceptors (Crenshaw, Thornell, & Friden, 1994 ). Muscle damage result s in increased levels of intracellular proteins in the blood such as skeletal muscle troponin 1, fatty acid binding protein, myoglobin (Mb) and inflammatory mediators such as interleukin -6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-). It is thought that intracellular proteins diffuse out of the cell into the surrounding tissue and capillaries due to either sheer stress or free radical damage to the membrane following eccentric exercise (W. Evans & Cannon, 1991 ). These pro teins attract macrophages and T -cells, which release inflammatory mediators that amplify the initial muscle injury through increased release of activation of phospholipases, proteases, and reactive oxygen species causing inflam mation (MacIntyre, Reid, & McKenzie, 1995 ) (P. Calder & Grimble, 2002 ). These mediators , in addition to cytokines, such as IL -6, coordinate the immune response at the site of injury. IL-6 is a pro -inflammatory cytokine involved in lipid peroxidation which degrades the cell membrane (Hinson, Williams, & Shacter, 1996 ). TNF- is another important mediator of the inflammat ion process with elevated expression in injured muscle fibers (R. A. Collins & Grounds, 2001 ) and necessary for muscle repair (Y.-P. Li, 2003 ). Treatment strategies have sought to minimize inflammation inhibiting the inflammatory pathways and immune cell activation by the use of NSAIDs and antioxidants such as fish oil (P. Calder & Grimble, 2002 ) . NSAIDs inhibit inflammatory pathways , such as COX -2, while f ish oil , which contains n-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaeoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and the inflammatory cascade (Dubois et al., 1998 ; Trebble et al., 2003 ). However inflammation may provide a vital role in muscle repair as performance is inhibited when the inflammatory process is impa ired (Almekinders, 1999 ). Free radicals can also 11 be generated from inflammatory cells responding to increases in markers of cellular d amage such as TNF-, Myoglobin (M b) and creatine kinase (CK) released into the blood from ruptured cells. Inflammatory cells increase rates of tissue destruction and remodeling through the recruitment of macrophages through increased concentrations of cytokines and interleukins (Tiidus, 2008 ). Therapies seeking to minimize EIMD/DOMS have typically inhibited COX2 enzyme s with the use of over the counter non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ) such as Tylenol or NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin formation w hich are important mediators for the inflammatory response (Burian & Geisslinger, 2005 ). Studies have found that NSAID supplementation post - eccentric muscle exercise can improve contractile function and reduce circulating levels of inflammatory cells and intercellular muscle enzymes (Howatson & Van Someren, 2008 ; , 1995 ). However , chronic NSAID use has been linked to gastric bleeding, fluid retention , hypertension and acute renal failure if taken too close to exercise (Boulter, Noakes, & Hew -Butler, 2011 ; Derry & Loke, 2000 ). While metabolism of the components in fish oil such as EPA and DHA are less inflammatory and used in the same metabolic pathway as NSAIDs, studies are inconclusive on whether fish oil supplementation on EIMD/DOMS treatment is effective (Macaluso et al., 2013 ). For example, 1.8g/day omega 3 supplemen tation proved effective in ameliorating delayed onset muscle soreness in untrained males after eccentric knee exercise (Bakhtiar Tartibian, Behzad Hajizadeh Maleki, & Asghar Abbasi, been shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation at 1.8g/day for 30 days was not effective in attenuating the acute phase inflammatory response or functional measures of muscle damage after 50 repetitions of elbow flexion exercise in 22 healthy male subjects (Lenn et al., 2002 ). In addition to the immune system , metabolic processes such as the electron transport chain within the mitochondria generate free radicals which damage the muscle sarcolemma phospholipids through lipid peroxidation , causing a loss of membrane integrity ultimately leading 12 to cell death (Davies, Quintanilha, Brooks, & Packer, 1982 ). Lipid peroxidation can be quantified by using fatty acid binding protein which selectively binds to the products of lipid peroxidation and is involved in intracellular membrane transfer (B. A. McMahon & Murray, 2010 ) (Weisiger, 2002 ). It has been found that preventing free radical formation resulted in decreased sensations of muscle damage with t he ex tent of cellular damage quantified using 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8- OHdG ) as a marker of DNA oxidative damage (A. R. Collins, Dusinsk\u00e1, Gedik, & 8-OHdG produ ction results from the interaction between free radicals and DNA which may result in purine -pyrimidine base substitution mutations linked to inflammation (de Souza -Pinto et al., 2001 ). Treatment of o xidative d amage can be minimized through consumption of food and supplements rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E, C and beta carotene (Powers, Ji, & Leeuwenburgh, 1999 ). These compounds react with the free radicals and neutralize them, thus preventing damage to the cell membrane (Machlin & Bendich, 1987 ). Additionally, damaging reactions can be attenuated with consumption of foods rich in n-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid ( EHA) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) due to the ir ability to be preferentially oxidized instead of the phospholipids that comprise the membrane (Thompson et al., 2001 ). DHA is an n-3 PUFA that is a structural component of the phospholi pid bilayer that can be synthesized from alpha -linolenic acid or obtained directly from fish oi l. DHA is a carboxylic acid with a 22 -carbon chain and six cis double bond s with the first double bond located at the third carbon from the omega end (Guesnet & Alessandri, 2011 ). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an n-3 PUFA which acts as a precursor for prostaglan din-3, thromboxane and 2008 ). The number and placement of the double bonds in the EPA and DHA contribute to it's anti-inflammatory properties compared to n-6 PUFAs (arachidonic acid) when oxidized by free radicals during lipid peroxidation (Mori et al., 2000 ). Supplementing with n-3 PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA , have been used to treat inflammation in patients with certain chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma (James & 13 Cleland, 1997 ; Mickleborough, Lindley, Ionescu, & Fly, 2006 ). Cellular membrane incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, decrease release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as subfamily of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids that are signaling molecules that mediate inflammation, fever and pain and derived from either n- 3 or n -6 PUFAs from the phospholipids of the cell membrane . While products of both n-3 or n -6 PUFAs are generally considered inflammatory, n-3 PUFAs are less inflamma tory than n-6 PUFAs (De Meester, Watson, & Zibadi, 2013 ). Prostaglandin proceeds along cyclooxygenase -1, and cyclooxygenase -2 pathways while leukotriene biosynthesis proceeds along the 5, 12, and 15 -lipoxygenase pathway s in response to cytokines, growth factors and other inflammatory stimuli (Ballou, Botting, Goorha, Zhang, & Vane, 2000 ). Prostaglandins contribute to pain by directly activating pain receptors by increas ing levels of cyclic AMP an d enhanc ing nociceptor sensitization (Rueff & Dray, 1993 ). It has been shown that d iets high in n-3 PUFAs reduce the effect of inflammatory disease s such as asthma and arthritis b y affecting eicosanoid production (Harizi, Corcuff, & Gualde, 2008 ) (Kremer 1985 ) (P. Calder & Grimble, 2002 ). Chemical analysis has elucidated that the New green -lipped mussel (NZGLM) known as Perna canaliculus , different fatty acids (Wolyniak, Brenna, Murphy, & Sinclair, 2005 ). The EPA and DHA composition is approximately 13% EPA, 21% DHA, 30% cholesterol and contains up to 91 polyunsaturated fatty acid including palmitic 2005 ). PCSO -524 (Lyprinol/Omega XL) is a supplement manufactured from the New Zealand Green Lipped Mussel that has been shown to reduce airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in asthmatics , 14 attenuate colon inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome , decrease joint inflammation in rheumatoid art hritis patients, and reduce ADHD symptoms in children (Kean et al., 2 013; Mickleborough, Vaughn, Shei, Davis, & Wilhite, 2013 ; Tenikoff, Murphy, Le, Howe, & Howarth, 2005 which have been shown to possess greater anti-inflammatory properties than EPA and DHA alone by quenching the lipid pero xidation processes in the cell by the free radical scavenging properties of the furan ring in Dehalococcoides bacterial strains (Teixeira, Cox, & Egmond, 2013 ; White et al., 2005 ). Free radical scavengers reduce pro-inflammatory lipid peroxidation products such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) acid in human neutrophils , inhibit the COX -1 and COX -2 enzymes, prevent interleukin tumor necrosis factor and interferon synthesis. (Wakimoto et al., 2011 ). Ingestion of PCSO - 524 in osteoarthritic patients reduce d perceptions of pain compared to fish oil (Zawadzki, Janosch, & Szechinski, 2013b -inflammatory activity in rat paw edema assays at a concentration lower than fish oil , whic h contain ed abundant EPA (M. Whitehouse, 2001 ). PCSO -524 has been shown to be more effective than fish oil in reducing symptoms of experimentally induced inflammatory bo wel disease (Tenikoff, et al., 2005 ). This suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect s of PCSO -524 may not be solely due to the EPA and DHA content, since t he n-3 PUFA content of PCSO -524 compared to fish oil is significantly lower (Tenikoff, Murphy, Le, Howe, & Howarth, 2005). Since none of the fatty acids are unique to PCSO -524, it is possible that that additional ingredients such as the 91 polyunsaturated fatty acids and furan components act together with n-3 PUFAs to attenuat e the inflammat ory response (Wakimoto, et al., 2011 ). 15 Important to this study, runners supplemented with PCSO -524, experienced less DOMS following a 30 -kilometer run than placebo (Baum, Telford, & Cunningham, 2013 ). However, Pumpa et al. (2011) demonstrated that 8 week s of supplementation with 200 mg /day of PCSO - 524 did not affect performance measures (Visual analogue scale, algometry, and force production) and biochemical markers (IL -6 C reactive Fallon, Bensoussan, & Papalia, 2011 ). Therefore, the data are equivocal as to whether PCSO -524 can attenuate the functional and biochemical markers of muscle damage. Statement of the Problem It has been shown that EPA and DHA supplementation attenuate acute tissue inflammation and minimize DOM S. DOMS and inflammation are two of the symptoms of EIMD which when exacerbated through chronic training m ay result in greater tissue damage and decreased strength gains. PCSO -524 is a marine extract from the New Zealand Green Lipped Muscle , and has been shown effective in attenuating inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , and irritable bowel syndrome. PCSO 524's effectiveness in reducing inflammation may be due not only to its EPA and DHA content, but also its furan fatty acids and up to 91 different lipids which are though t to integrate into the membrane and provide a less inflammatory substrate and absorb react ive oxygen species thereby minimizing tissue damage . To date, there has been no research investigating the ability of PCSO -524 (Lyprinol\u00ae/Omega XL\u00ae) to attenuate the functional and biochemical measures of EIMD/DOMS in untrained males after a continuous bout of eccentric aerobic exercise. Hypotheses Hypothesis 1: The percent change in force production from baseline for subjects that consumed PCSO -524 will be higher compared to those that consumed placebo . Hypothesis 2: The percent change in quadriceps range of motion from baseline for subjects that consumed PCSO -524 will be higher , compared to placebo. 16 Hypothesis 3: The percent change in size of the midline of the quadriceps will be less in subjects that supplemented with PCSO -524 than placebo. Hypo thesis 4: The percent change in the perception of pain at the quadriceps from baseline measured by algometry in subjects that supplemented with PCSO -524 will be less than compared to placebo. Hypothesis 5: Supplementing untrained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of creatine kinase in the blood post eccentric muscle damage compared to placebo. Hypothesis 6: Supplementing untrained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of myoglobin in the blood post eccentric m uscle damage compared to placebo. Hypothesis 7: Supplementing untrained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of skeletal muscle troponin I in the blood post - eccentric muscle damage compared to placebo. Hypothesis 8: Supplementing un trained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of fatty acid binding protein in the blood post - eccentric muscle damage compared to placebo. Hypothesis 9: Supplementing untrained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of interleukin -6 in the blood post eccentric muscle damage compared to placebo. Hypothesis 10: Supplementing untrained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of TNF alpha in the blood post eccentric muscle damage compared to placebo. 17 Hypothesis 11: Supplementing untrained men with PCSO -524 for 4 weeks will lessen the appearance of cardiac muscle troponin I in the blood post - eccentric muscle damage compared to placebo. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether chronic PCSO -524 supplementation in untrained males attenuates exercise induced muscle damage following eccentric muscle exercise; specifically reduction in range of motion, perceived muscle soreness, cytokines, muscle proteins, and inflammatory mediators. Delimitations Untrained males were recruited from the Indiana University classifieds and tested in a laboratory setting with environmental conditions carefully controlled . Muscle damaging exercise was performed in a laboratory setting on a treadmill at a predetermined speed. Subjects were asked to refrain from consuming fish oil , NSAIDS, or marine related products during the course of the study . Additionally, subjects were requested not to consume alcohol or caffeine for at least 24 hours prior to lab testing . Additionally subjects maintained their normal diet and were asked not to exercise more than 30 minutes a day, three days a week while refraining from performing any eccentric exercise . Blood draws were per formed at the same time during subsequent days. Limitations Since personal histories w ere self-reported , subjects could have misrepresented their background or exercise habits in order to gain access to the study. Additionally , since supplementation was performed away from the lab and self reported, subjects might not have consumed the required number of capsules during the supplementation period. Subject pain perception might have varied between visits and while spots were ma rked to ensure consistent measurement, some subjects repeatedly washed markers off which may have resulted in mark s not being reapplied in exactly the same location on subsequent days. For range of motion the goniometer relied on a correct point of view a nd alignment, even slight variations of the instrument may result in large deviations. 18 Assumptions Subjects did not change their diet or exercise habits throughout the study. Subjects did not change their perception of pain throughout the study. The trea dmill protocol was a valid and sufficient method in inducing exercise induced muscle damage. Subjects w ere motivated to complete the study and were rested and hydrated prior to their visit . Algometry tests were subjective and the amount of pain perception by each subject did not vary between lab visits. Blood draws were performed in such a way that no significant hemolysis occurred. Definition of terms 8-OHdG: 8 -Hydroxyguanosine is a nucleoside marker of oxidative stress. Its appearance is thought to be the result of DNA damage as a result of free radical exposure (Wu, Chiou, Chang, & Wu, 2004 ). Akt/mTOR/S6K1 : A signaling cascade which plays an important role both in cell survival (Gingras et al., 2007b ). COX: prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane. These products contribute to pain and inflammation (Seibert et al., 1995 ). DAG: Diglycerol A G lycer ide consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. DAG is a second messenger signaling lipid, that is produced by the hydrolysis of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5 -bisphosphate (PIP2) trisphosphate (IP3) (Hardie, 2003 ). NF-B: A protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA. NF-B is though t to be involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, and free radicals. NF-B regulates the immune response (Shih, Tsui, Caldwell, & Hoffmann, 2010 ). 19 p70s6k: a serine/threonine kinase -1 in the PI3 kinase pathway and is activated by mTOR inducing protein synthesis at the ribosome. Physical exercise has been shown to phosphorylate p70s6k which results in protein synthesis (Pearson et al., 1995 ). PCSO -524: A marine lipid extract from the New Zealand green -lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus). The extract contains 30 polyunsaturated fatty acids including the essential n -3 PUFAs such as DHA and EPA, furan fatty acids and up to 91 polar lipids a l., 2011 ). PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol a minor phospholipid component of cell membranes. PIP2 is enriched at the plasma membrane where it is a substrate for a number of important signaling proteins in the IP3/DAG pathway (Czech, 2000 ). PIP3: Is a phospholipid that resides on the plasma membrane that activates downstream signaling components, such as protein kinase AKT, which activates downstream anabolic signaling pathways required for cell growth and survival (Czech, 2000 ). PLA2: A class of enzymes that recognize and catalytically hydrolyze the sn -2 acyl bond of phospholipids releasing arachidonic acid that undergoes modification into active compounds by cyclooxygenase enzymes resulting in formation of eicosan oids that include prostaglandins and leukotrienes that pro and Insel, & Dennis, 1999 ). PUFA: Fatty acids have 2 or more cis double bonds that are separated from each other by a single methylene bridge. Fatty acid notation can be is X:Y where X is the length of the carbon chain and Y is the number of methylene bridges in the compound (C. M. Williams & Burdge, 2006 ). 20 ROM: Range of Motion is the angular distance that a limb may normally travel while attached to another (H. M. Clarkson, 2000 ). ROS: Chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen which are formed as the byproduct of metabolism and play important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis and increase dramatically during time s of cellular stress which can cause damage to cellular str uctures (Kane et al., 1993 ). Chapter 2 : Literature review PCSO -524 The green -lipped mussel is native to New Zealand and an integral part of the diets of coastal indigenous tribes and is thought to contribute to a lower incidence of arthritis compared to inland tribes due to its anti -inflammatory properties. Recen t attempts to purify the compound to create a supplement for arthritis sufferers proved difficult due to the instabilit y of the active components resulting in products with no anti -inflammatory capacity (Galliard, 1970 ). Purification was finally achieved through the use of supercritical fluid extraction and the resulting compound is known as PCSO -524 . PCSO -524 is consumed in capsule form under the tradename Lyprinol\u00ae and Omega XL\u00ae with each capsule containing 50 mg PSCO -524 lipid extract, 100 mg olive oil and 0.225 mg vitamin E (d --tocopherol). PCSO -524 contains a multitude of lipid classes including triglycerides, sterol esters, polar lipids, free fatty acids, and sterols. Ninety acid have and 7,11,14,17 -eicosatetraenoic Omega fatty acids were the most abundant fatty acids in PSCO -524 with 20:5) and 87 mg/mL docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) present in the purified extract (Murphy, Mooney, Mann, Nichols, & Sinclair, 2002 ; Wolyniak, et al., 2005 ). 21 PCSO -524 has been investigated with positive effects in both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, osteo arthritis in rats , inflammatory bowel disease models in mice and acute inflammation such as muscle soreness after a 30 kilometer run in humans (Baum, et al., 2013 ; Lello, Liang, Robinson, Leutenegger, & Wheat, 2012 ; Tenikoff, et 2005 ; Zawadzki, Janosch, & PCSO -524 supplementation in asthmatic children aged 6 to 13 years old . 71 children participated in the 16 -week, double b lind placebo -controlled study and receive d either 2 capsules daily Lyprinol \u00ae or placebo and were maintained on an as-needed inhaled corticosteroid. The study found that PCSO -524 supplementation decreased the percentage of children reporting trouble with their asthma symptom s at three months of treatment (97% vs. 76% p = 0.057). PCSO -524 attenuated mild an d moderate asthma exacerbations. The study found that PCSO -524 has a positive effect for asthma suffer ers and should be considered a nutritional supplement for children with moderate asthma and possibly a supplement to conventional asthma therapy. Zawad zki at al. (2013) demonstrated that PCSO -524 supplementation attenuates pain to a greater extent compared to fish oil supplementation alone. 47 patients completed the randomized blind study with 22 patient s supplementing with 1200 mg/day (4 capsules) PCSO - 524 and 25 subjects supplementing with fish oil (4 capsules; 150 mg/capsule ; total n-3 PUFA 18% EPA and 12% DHA). Patients supplemented with PCSO -524 showed a statistically significant improvement compared with patients who took fish oil. PCSO -524 supplementation resulted in lower pain scores within four weeks, improvement in health and disease, and increase d blood cell count. Patients that supplemented with f ish oil showed significantly less improvement and a greater level of physical di scomfort during the study. Investigating the potential of PCSO -524 supplementation on DOMS symptoms , Baum et al. (2013) found after a 30 kilometer run by 32 nonprofessional distance runners , compared to no 22 changes in the control group while runner s supplemented with PCSO -524 had significant attenuation of muscle soreness following their post -treatment run compared to the pre -treatment run. Median baseline pain scores for the control group did not differ from post -treatment pain scores in the PCSO -524 group. Runners that trained under 3 times a week experienced the greatest benefit in attenuated DOMS perception suggesting that PCSO -524 supplementation may be effected by training status and suited for untrained rather than trained athletes due to l ack of conditioning . Additionally, other studies found that subject -training status was important for the study outcome as evidenced by Pumpa et al. (2013) w ho showed PCSO -524 was ineffective at attenuating the symptoms of DOMS effective in 20 well-trained male subjects. Each group of 10 subjects consumed an olive oil capsule (placebo) or 200 mg of PCSO -524 daily for eight weeks. After the supplementation period, muscle damage was induced with each subject performing 5 bouts of 8 minutes runnin g downhill at a 10% gradient with 2 min utes level walking between bouts at 80% maximal heart rate . The results suggest that PCSO -524 supplementation at 200 mg/day was ineffective at attenuating the symptoms of DOMS with n o significant differences between groups on functional measures such as perception of pain , algometry and biochemical markers such as Interleukin -1, Interleukin -6, Interleukin -10, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, tumor necrosis factor -, and myoglobin spaced 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after muscle damage (Pumpa, et al., 2011 ). PCSO -524' s effectiveness may have beneficial effects on muscle damage and recovery processes by mini mizing the inflammatory response and DOMS that occurs following EIMD in untrained individuals. There are numerous histological changes that occur inside the muscle cell after it has been damaged, including toxic intracellular proteins which leak out of the cell into the microenvironment which attract macrophages which re lease reactive oxygen species causing further damage to both injured and healthy muscle cells. Additionally there is an increase in cytosolic calcium due to increase d sarcoplasmic reticulum permeability resulting in 23 Phospholipase A2 activation which cleave s unsaturated membrane phospholipids to initiate the arachidonic acid cascade which is an eicosanoid precursor including -lipoxygenase. The arachidonic acid cascade culminate s in membrane damage if lipid peroxidation is excessive . Additionally elevated levels of calcium cause rapid damage of force generating myofilamen ts (Duncan, 1988 ). PCSO -524 's anti-inflammatory ability inhibition of and 5 - lipoxygenase inhibiting leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin producti on has been demonstrated in both human polymorphonucleocytes and neutrophils (M. W. Whitehouse et al., 1997 contains acids pro duced from activated neutrophil and cellular metabolic processes and have antioxidant ef fects (Ishii, Okajima, Koyamatsu, Okada, that furan fatty acids have a tetraalkyl -substituted furan ring, which is susceptible to oxidation, and the subsequent ring opening generates dioxoene, which is highly reactive and further converted to other compounds. Dioxenes are extr emely reactive, causing total inhibition of products of the arachidonic acid pathway at concentrations as low as 20 M (Graff, Gellerman, Sand, & Schlenk, 1984). These naturally but rarely detected fatty acids show a potent radical -scavenging ability and are essential constituents of plants and algae and have recently started to become appreciated as a key link between the cardio protective effect s of a diet high in EPA and DHA (Spiteller, 2005 ). For example , PCSO -524 had greater anti - inflammatory activity in a rat model of adjuvant -induced arthritis than the same dose of EPA and DHA alone. (Wakimoto, et al., 2011 ). Process of Muscle Damage Muscle damage , which can occur as a result of eccentric muscle action, is postulated to follow five phases: the initiating event, early structural changes, necrosis and degeneration, regeneration, and protection from further insults. Muscle damage has been shown to be localized and only affect a small percentage of muscle fibers in skeletal muscle (H Kuipers, Drukker, 24 Frederik, Geurten, & Kranenburg, 1983 ). Initial events in muscle damage can be observed in the first hours following eccentric exercise with the affected site experiencing muscle swelling, contractual protein loss such as desmin and troponin, followed by phagocytic cell invasion (Armstrong, 1990 ; Stephan Sorichter, et al., 1997 ). The first phase of exercise induced skeletal muscle injury is the initiating event. Wh ile this phase is poorly understood, hypothetical postulations have centered on either physical or metabolic events. The role that physical da mage plays into the initiating event has been postulated to be caused by three facto rs. First, force production due to eccentric exercise generally exceeds maximal isome tric force by 100% (Woledge, Curtin, & Homsher, 1985 ). Secondly, the area of force to active fiber ratio during e ccentric contractions compared to isometric contractions is greater (T. A. McMahon, 1984 ). Finally , it has been shown that the number of cross bridges decreases as lengthening velocity of muscle increases (1984). The metabolic initiating mechanism follows that the mus cle is not damaged by mechanical but by disruption of metabolic processes such as lack of ATP availability that induces intracellular calcium overload. Support for this theory has been offered by studies that have induced structural changes similar to exercise induced muscle damage in resting muscle in rats after ischemia (M\u00e4kitie & Ter\u00e4v\u00e4inen, 1977 ). However, studies have shown that grea ter energy expenditure in rats do es not correlate with increasing muscle damage suggesting that muscle damage does not correlate with metabolic demands (J Komulainen, Takala, & Vihko, 1995 ). The initial event also produces temporary force loss, which occurs immediately after the initial event and lasts several days following muscle -damaging exercise (Clarkson, Nosaka, & Braun, 1992). The cause of force loss has been attributed to damage to the sarcoplasmic reticulum delaying the restoration of normal calcium level s and as a consequence impaired force generation (Clarkson, et al., 1992). The second hypothesis to explain force loss is the loss of overlap between the actin and myosin filaments due to the longer distance that sarcomeres must travel durin g downhill running (Eston, et al., 1995). Force loss during eccentric exercise is 25 correlated to the relative muscle length with greater force losses occurring at longer muscle lengths (Newham, et al., 1988). Regardless of whether the initiating event is physical or metabolic, the next step in the initiating event is disturbance in intracellular calcium homeostasis. For example , downhill walking was shown to concentrate calcium in damaged muscles of rats (Duan, Delp, Hayes, De lp, & Armstrong, 1990 ). Cytosolic calcium accumulation has been shown to be the result of either membrane damage through micropuncture or passive muscle stretch in rats (Armstrong et al., 1993 ; Carpenter & Karpati, 1989 ). Increased free cytosolic calcium accumulation has been implicated in disruption of mitochondrial ATP production and sarcoplasmic reticulum , incr eased protease and phospholipase activity & Warren, 1991 ; Reddy, Etlinger, Rabinowitz, Fischman, & Zak, 1975 ). After accumulation of intracellular calcium, muscle swelling is one of the most visible responses to muscle damage after the initial event. Swelling is the result of an influx of water into the muscle cell and exacerbated after eccentric muscle damage (Jan Friden, Sfakianos, Hargens, & Akeson, 1988 ). Regulation of water volume is complex and depends on increase d capillary permeability , which allow s serum proteins to leak into the cell. The resulting water influx and resulting muscle swelling is a prerequisite for fiber necrosis and is proportional to the magnitude of muscle damage (J. Komulainen & Vihko, 1995 ). Swelling has been implicated in the perception of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) a fter exercise. It has been suggested that swelling creates an increase in local tissue pressure in tight compartments (Bobbert, Hollander, & Huijing, 1986 ). However , it has been show n that DOMS preceded cellular water influx in mice after eccentric exercise suggesting that swelling is not the cause of DOMS (Bar PR, 1994 ). Early structural changes are observable almost immediately after exercise cessation. Changes to the muscle include myofilament disruption through Z line streaming which has been hypothesized to result from fracturing of much thinner actin myofilaments (J Friden, Sjj\u00f6str\u00f6m, & Ekblom, 1981 ) cell cytoskeleton disruption through fracturing of desmin linker proteins which occur s within 15 minutes of eccentric exercise in rabbits (Lieber, Thornell, & Friden, 1996 ). For example, desmin loss after eccentric rabbit dorsiflexion exercise was observed in a significant portion of muscle fibers across the muscle that is rapidly repaired up to 72 hours following eccentric exercise (J Friden & Lieber, 2001). Additional changes in histological manifestation s of exercise induced muscle damage include enlarged mitochondria (Gollnick & King, 1969), myofibril rupture (W. T. Stauber, Fritz, & Dahlmann, 1990), and subsarcolemmal vacuolization (Kuipers, et al., 1983) with short perio ds of eccentric exercise producing no changes to the ultrastructure or the metabolic processes of the mitoc hondria. During this period, t he mitochondria l energy production decreases as evidenced by an increase in hydrogen ion concentration between the inner and outer membrane and a mitochondrial temperature decrease (Jennings & Ganote, 1976; Kloner, Ganote, Re imer, & Jennings, 1975). Secondary changes to the muscle ultrastructure occur as soon as two hours post eccentric muscle damage and include proteolytic and lipolytic breakdown of muscle proteins and membrane lipids which are mediated by the damaged muscle cell (Armstrong, 1990 ). Following autolytic destruction, neutrophils invade the a rea and phagocytize dead tissue and release cytotoxic factors such as reactive oxygen species which accelerate tissue destruction and alter the basement membrane permeability promoting further in vasion of inflammatory cells to the damaged area (Movat, Cybulsky, Colditz, Chan, & Dinarello, 1987 ; 1978 ). In addition to neutrophils, monocytes differentiate, invade and phagocytize dead tissue after 24 hours of strenuous exercise in humans (Hikida, Staron, Hagerman, Sherman, & Costill, 1983 ). These changes cause an efflux of proteins into the extracellular space such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase following exercise (Armstrong, et al., 1983). These cytoplasmic enzymes are large and are normally una ble to cross the cell membrane (Maughan et al., 1989). The increase in intracellular protein concentration in the blood may result from the disruption of the sarcolemma, allowing the intercellular proteins to diffuse down their concentration gradients and out of the cell (Maughan, et al., 1989). These events , while 27 traumatic for the cell , may benefit tissue regeneration b y producing regeneration component s that help tissue reconstruction through necrotic fiber phagocytosis and autophagocytosis of surviving fibers (Salminen, 1985 ). Degeneration necrosis of the muscle tissue is followed by the regeneration phase that occurs four to six days after the initial damage. Muscle cell repair begins with satellite cell activation in exercised muscle with growth factor s controlling myoblast -myotube fusion that result s in myofiber maturation and proliferation of mitochondria mu scle in rats, maximal satellite cell proliferation occurs 24 hours after an acute bout of eccentric exercise (Darr & Schultz, 1987 ). Additionally, the muscle adapts as evidenced by an increase in sarcomere number in muscle fibers leading to a shift in the optimum length of the muscle for active tension protecti ng the muscle against future injuries (Proske & Morgan, 2001 ). The damage repair process appears to provide resistance to future insults in both animal s and human s (P. M. Clarkson, Byrnes, Gillisson, & Harper, 1987 ; Schwane & Armstrong, 1983 ). It is believed that t raining creates a minimization of morphological changes, reduced inflammation, preservation of maximal force as evidenced by decreases in plasma levels of intracellular muscle protein s, and DOMS attenuation compared to the untrained state (J Friden, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, & Ekblom, 1983 ; Sacco & Jones, 1992 ). These adaptations appear to be the result of improved coordination and reorganization of the muscle fiber contractile apparatus due to increases in sarcomere length, synthesis of Z band proteins and reinforcement of intermediate filaments such as desmin (1983) . Quantifying muscle damage has proceeded through a number of indirect methods such as estimation of pain, decrease in maximal muscle force, and impaired range of motion (P. M. Clarkson, Nosaka, & Braun, 1992 ; Stauber, et al., 1990 ; Stauber WT & B., 1988 ). It has been 28 show n that muscle damage correlates well with some intracellular protein s such as troponin, fatty acid binding protein, myoglobin, and creatine kinase. Troponin is a protein found only in cardiac and skeletal muscle that is integral to muscle contraction and is an often -used diagnostic marker of myocardial infarction and heart muscle cell death. The binding of calcium to troponin causes a conformational change exposing binding sites allowing myosin -actin cross bridge formati on, a llowing contraction of the muscle . Troponin isoforms differ between muscle tissues with cTN1 the predominate form in cardiac muscle and sTN1 found in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle troponin I has been used very rarely in exercise studies due to th e difficulty of ELISA preparation. However the advent of commercially avail able kits has made perform ing these assay s much easier and much less time consuming . The first study to use skeletal troponin I as an indicator of muscle damage was Storichter et. al. (1997) who found it to be a highly reliable indicator of muscle damage (Stephan Sorichter, et al., 1997 ). Fatty Acid Binding Protein 3 (FABP3) is a 15 kilo Dalton cytoplasmic protein with highest concentrations found in cardiac and type I skeletal muscle fibers. FABP3 plays a role in fatty acid metabolism by transporting fatty acids from the cell membrane to mitochondria for oxidation and plays a role in regulatin g cell growth and proliferation (Kleine, Glatz, Van Nieuwenhoven, & Van der Vusse, 1992 ). FABP3 is released from cardiac my ofibrils following cardiac muscle damage by ischemic episode s and is used with troponin to et. al. (2008) found that F ABP3 was the most useful individual biomarker for skeletal muscle damage based on concordance, sensitivity, and predictive value and had greater diagnostic value than creatine kinase and aspartate transaminase (Pritt et al., 2008 ). Myoglo bin is an iron and oxygen -binding protein found in cardiac, type I and type II skeletal muscle tissue and any appearance in the blood is attributed to muscle cell membrane rupture. 29 Myoglobin is a diagnostic marker for muscle injury, making it a potential marker for myocardial infarction . However since myoglobin is cleared from the kidney this assumes the rates for production and clearance are equal. Unequal rates affect the myoglobin plasma concentration resulting in an over or underestimation of the extent of EMID/DOMS (Tiidus, 2008 ). Creatine Kinase has been used as a marker of muscle damage and is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of creatine and consumes adenosine triphosphate to create phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate and has many different isoforms found in a variety of tissues (Goldblatt, 1969 ). Typical measured values of creatine kinase in the blood are between 10 - 120 micrograms per liter (mcg/L) which peaks 12 -24 hours post eccentric muscle damage (Byrnes et al., 1985 ). A specific isoform of creatine kinase, CK -MM is found in skeletal muscle and has been shown to be an indicator of muscle damage in males after eccentric biceps contractions despite no change in total creatine kinase Hellsten , & Clarkson, 1988 ). Creatine kinase 's ability to accurately estimate the extent of EIMD/DOMS has been called into question by recent studies . For example , there are large differences b etween older and younger men in the extent of muscle damage determined by muscle biopsy following eccentric exercise despite no significant difference in creatine kinase activity (Manfredi et al., 1991 ). Further, Van der Meulen et. al. (1991) found that creatine kinase levels overestimate tissue damage as determined by musc le biopsy i n rats after a downhill run (Van der Meulen, Kuipers, & Drukker, 1991 ). Strategies to minimize EMID Since muscles are subjected to extreme stress during eccentric exercises , minimization of damage has center ed on increasing membrane flexibility to maintain a balance between a rigid, ordered inflexible structure and completely fluid nonviscous liquid. Membrane flexibility enhance s and increase s membrane integrity retain ing toxic cellular contents inside the cell and thereby attenuating the inflammation response. Unsaturated fatty acids increase membrane flexibility while saturated fatty acids increase rigidity. It has been shown that incorporation of n-3 PUFA s into the ER of yeast cells increased resistance to cellular stress (Deguil et al., 2011 ). Forces 30 found in exercising mu scle such as shear stress exert various metabolic effects on endothelial cells by up regulating genes controlling membrane fluidity through fatty acid catabolism and membrane incorporation (Qin et al., 2007 ). Cell membranes have optimal fluidity for function and act as shock absorbers thereby distributing force evenly minimizing fractured cells and cytoplasmic leakage (Chien, 2008 ). Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs has resulted in a decrease in intracellular biomarkers and inflammatory biomarkers in resting men suggesting increased membrane integrity (Richard J Bloomer, Douglas E Larson, Kelsey H Fisher -Wellman, Andrew J Galpin, & Brian K Schilling, 2009 ). Exercise related muscle damage and free radical mechanisms There are many potential sites for free radical generation during exercise as well as many enzymes that assist in free radical ne utralization in skeletal muscle . Sin ce the mitochondria is a large producer of reactive oxygen species , oxidative skeletal muscle fibers are subjected to large changes in oxygen flux during aerobic exercise which has been thought to increase skeletal muscle tissue damage (Sen, 1995 ). Minimization of reactive oxygen species is enhanced in skeletal muscles through incorporation of antioxidants and enzymes in skeletal muscle tissue. Current lite rature suggests free radical generation is increased during exhaustive aerobic exercise but does not significantly cause damage to the surrounding muscle tissue. However skeletal muscle is very susceptible to secondary damage caused by the immune system during eccentric exercise and secondary tissue damage caused by the re sulting immune response (Reznick, Packer, Sen, Holloszy, & Jackson, 1998 ). DNA in muscle cells is under the continuous assault of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxide radicals, which can interact with DNA causing damage which lead s to mutation s and if severe enough, cell death. DNA's vulnerability to reactive oxygen species result s from pr evalence of double bonds in DNA bases that radicals can easily add to and labile hydrogen atoms that can be abstracted through the deoxyribose sugar backbone, leaving a radical formation at the reacted carbon on the DNA strand which re acts with molecular oxygen leading to a DNA strand break (Povirk, 1996 ). In order to maintain proper function , DNA is repaired by v arious protein kinases resulting in 8 -Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) which is most often used to assess the extent of 31 DNA damage in skeletal muscle (Park & Ames, 1988 ). For example Hartman el. (1994) found that DNA damage in rats by running on a treadmill for 45 minutes peaked at 24 hours af ter running and returned to normal levels 72 hours (Hartmann, Plappert, Raddata, Gr\u00fcnert -Fuchs, & Speit, 1994 ). Regular exercise such as swimming and distance running has been shown to decrease levels of nuclear 8 -OHdG along with increases of plasma antioxidant concentrations (Inoue, Mu, Sumikawa, Adachi, & Okochi, 1993 ; Pilger et al., 1997 ). It seems that DNA damage from radicals can only be detected when exercise is exhaustive such as marathons and ultramarathons (Gomez -Cabrera et al., 2006 Kimura, & Higuchi, 2000 ). Sacheck al el (2003) studied 12 weeks of vitamin E (1000 IU/day) supplementation on biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy men. Muscle damage was induced at -15% downhill running for 45 min at 75% VO 2max and b lood samples were obtained at baseline, 0, 6, 24, and 72 h ours postexercise to determine the extent of DNA damage. The study found that leukocyte 8-OHdG concentrations were unaffected by exercise in both control and experimental groups. Prostaglandin metabolism generate s reactive oxygen species through intermediates activated during excessive contractile activity (A McArdle, Edwards, & Jackson, 1991 ). A precursor to prostaglandins , arachidonic acid, can be activated through lipoxygenase enzymes and generates reactive oxygen species which have been implicated in skeletal muscle damage in female Wistar rats (Jackson, Wagenmakers, & Edwards, 1987 ). However the role of prostiglandins in exercise muscle dam age is not clear. Kuipers et. a l. (1985) used F lurbiprofen (90 mg/day) , a cyclooxygenase -inhibiting drug, to assess the role of prostaglandin metabolism on subjective symptoms of soreness and eventual structural changes in muscle during a 30 minute cycle ergometry session at 80% VO2max . Muscle biopsies taken at baseline, immediately after, and 24 h ours after exercise were used to examine muscle structural changes in conjunction with plasma levels of muscle enzymes. No significant enzyme release was noticed in any of the subjects and structural changes were restricted to th e mitochondria. No 32 statistical difference in subjective soreness was observed between groups suggesting that at this workload and mode of exercise prostaglandin metabolism does not play a major role in exercise - induced muscle soreness and structural damage . It has been suggested that failure of muscle calcium homeostasis following exercise results in the free radical formation through activation of calcium dependent proteases such as Calpain and phospholipase A2 which cleave intracellular muscle and membrane phospholipids respectively . Additionally the mitochondria eventually fail to produce ATP resulting in increased superoxide production from metabolic free radical generation due to calcium overload (Anne McArdle & Jacks on, 1997 ). However these mechanisms are not believed to be the primary cause of muscle damage as failure of calcium homeostasis occurs secondary to an increase in free radical activity in biological tissue (Anne McArdle & Ja ckson, 1997 ). The most likely cause of muscle tissue damage after endurance exercise by reactive oxygen species occurs by invading macrophage s and other phagocytic white cell s from the blood and interstitial space (Armstrong, 1986 ). The phagocytic process result s in substantial amounts of oxygen radical release and has been shown to be essential for efficient preparation of muscle tissue regeneration and destruction of necrotic tissue (Fantone & Ward, 1985 ). Since this response is non specific and occurs in biological tissue , an increase in reactive oxygen species does no t necessarily correlate with an increase in tissue damage and must be used in consort with other markers of muscle damage such as inflammatory markers and intracellular proteins to assess the extent of post exercise damage (Cannon et al., 1991 ). Inflammatory process Inflammation is a general response to tissue injury such as muscle damage and designed t o minimize further damage and promote healing. Symptoms of inflammation include pain, swelling, redness, and reduced function. The process of inflammation (figure 1) follow ing muscle damage is characterized by an influx of fluid and neutrophils into the tissues within the first few hours following injury. 33 Figure 1: Proposed inflammatory sequence: taken from Garrett et al. (2000) Next macrophages are recruited to the injured site, remove cellular debris , and secrete chemokines and cell adhesion molecu les that aide in the amplification and ultimately termination of the inflammatory response. Cytokines serve as emergency signal ling molecules that coordinate signaling among many different types of cells including leukocytes, stem cells, progenitor cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. TNF-, IL-1, and IL important . TNF -is a 212 -amino acid -long transmembrane protein that regulates immune cells and has been shown to induce cell death, fever, and inflammation with 34 disregulation resulting in various inflammatory diseases such as cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (Brynskov et al., 2002 ; Locksley, Killeen, & Lenardo, 2001 ). TNFand IL-1 are produced first by macrophages re sident in the injured tissue and are strong inducers of IL-6 production (Mastorak os, Chrousos, & Weber, 1993 ). IL-6 is a signaling protein when produced by monocytes or macrophages and elicits a pro-inflammatory response while muscle production elicits an anti-inflammatory response and is independent of a preceding TNF-alpha response or NF-kB activation (Brandt & Pedersen, 2010 ). Plasma concentration s of IL -6 increase up to 100 - fold from baseline post eccentric exercise resulting in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL -6 during recovery (Bente K Pedersen, 2013 ). Muscle biopsies showed IL-6 produc tion increased within the muscle immediately after strenuous exercise such as high intensity interval or marathon running (Nehlsen -Cannarella et al ., 1997 ; Papanicolaou et al., 1996 ). Neutrophils are the first leukocyte population to respond to the cytokine \"alarm call\" and are responsible for debris phagocytosis by bind ing to compliment immunoglobulins; release lysosomal proteases which degrade intramuscular proteins ; and damage lipid membranes with reactive oxygen species produced by NADPH oxidase (Epstein & Weiss, 1989 ). These actions, if left uncontrolled can cause disease since they can target both diseased and hea lthy tissue. These destructive processes are regulated by acute phase proteins such as C -reactive protein which are produced in the liver in response to eccentric exercise (Colley, Fleck, Goode, Muller, & Myers, 1983 ). The m agnitude of tissue damage is correlated with C -reactive protein release with 88 k ilometer ultra marathon runners experiencing levels equivalent to a small cardiac infarction (Strachan, Noakes, Kotzenberg, Nel, & De Beer, 1984 ). Accumulations of n eutrophils in muscle fibers have been reported after high force eccentric contractions within minutes after injury w ith resolution occurring with in five to seven days (Fielding et al., 1993 ; Round, Jones, & Cambridge, 1987 ). Neutrophil activity is modified by exercise with oxidative capacity decreased and phagocytic capacity increased in response to strenuous exercise (Pyne, 1994 ; Rincon, 1994 ). Leukocyte recruitment into injured tissue from the vasculature is accomplished through cell adhesion molecules , which arrest leukocyte 35 movement in the vasculature and facilitate cell invasion. During strenuous exercise it has been found that cells leave circulation more readily due to the up regulation of certain cell adhesion molecules such as VCAM -1 and ICAM -1 (L. Smith et al., 2000 ). After macrophage infiltration the final phase in the inflammatory process is necrosis , which releases intracellular contents into the microenvironment resultin g in an exacerba ted inflammatory response (Cohen, 1993 ). Necrosis is circumvented by apoptosis which is a sequential destruction of the cell where membrane integrity is never lost and the microenvironment is protect ed from harmful intracellular components such as hydrogen peroxide, enzymes, and neutrophil granules with cytokines such as IL -6 promoting cells apoptosis in neutrophils resulting in eicosanoid an cytokine production (Afford, Pongracz, Stockley, Crocker, & Burnett, 1992 ; Epstein & Weiss, 1989 ). Strategies to minimize Inflammation As far back as the Grecian times, myrtle leaves and willow bark were used to minimize the undesirable effects of inflammation (McMurry, 2004 ). In modern times, athletes have sought to minimize inflammation and maximize training by using NSAIDs. NSAIDs minimize inflammation by acting as non -selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). COX catalyzes prostaglandin and thromboxane fo rmation from arachidonic acid which is an unsaturated fatty acid precursor cleaved from the cell membrane by phospholipase A2. Arachidonic acid is non polar and as a consequence readily diffuses in and out of cells and serves as both an intra and intercel lular messenger (J. Williams, Errington, Lynch, & Bliss, 1989 ). Prostaglandins also serve as signaling molecules that mediate the inflammatory process and are released from skeletal muscle that has been subjected to excessive contractile a ctivity (A McArdle, et al., 1991 ). Prostaglandin metabolism generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can lead to membrane destruction (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 1985 ). Additionally, extracellular arachidonic acid leaking fro m damaged muscle cells can serve to activate neutrophils resulting in tissue destruction by lipid peroxidation through ROS formation . Lipid peroxides form due to the generation of ROS by the mitochondria and pro -oxidant enzymes on the neutrophils such as 36 NADPH oxidase that degrade the lipids of the cell membrane as evidenced by increased concentrations of intracellular lipid peroxides , which are products normally formed from polyunsaturated fatty ac ids reacting with free radicals (Jenkins, Martin, & Goldberg, 1983 ). It is believed that ROS activate s the NF -kB pathway which initiates the third phase of phagocytic destruction by the immune system (Whitehead, Yeung, & Allen, 2006 ). NF -kB is a transcription factor that regulates pro inflammatory cytokine expres sion such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL - Boriek, 2003 ) (Whitehead, et al., 2006 ). TNF-alpha can ca use a positive feedback loop in the mitochondria leading to a chain reaction of ROS production causing increased lipid peroxidation and inflammation (Reid & Li, 2001 ). ROS can be produced by inflammatory cells and can be decreased by the release of nitric oxide by vascular endothelial cells (Privat et al., 1997 ). While multiple version s of the COX enzyme exist, only COX2 is believed to play a role in inflammat ion. NSAID treatment has been successfully used to minimize inflammation and DOMS in athletes following eccentric muscle damage (J. M. Peterson et al., 2003 ). However , inhibiting the inflammatory process with NSAIDs may not be beneficial to long term training performance and can lead to satellite cell quiescence and attenuated performance gains following training (Mikkelsen et al., 2009 ). EPA and DHA supplementation on Inflammation DHA, EPA, a nd arachidonic acid are all involved in maintaining cell membrane structure and function with arachidonic acid being the main components in terrestrial mammals (Sargent, Bell, McEvoy, Tocher, & Estevez, 1999 ). Altering the percentage of these components changes the membrane structure. N-3 PUFA supplementation increases membrane fluidity allowing more Figure 2: Inflammatory pathways taken from Calder (2002) 37 efficient nutrient exchange (Freeman et al., 2006 ; Kidd, 2007 ). In neurons increase d membrane fluidity is associated with faster neural transmission and more efficient biochemical performance resulting in improved higher brain functions including sense of well -being, reactivity, attention, cognitive performance, and mood (G. Fontani et al., 2005 ). In addition to reducing free radical production and membrane fluidity, supplementation can attenuate eicosanoid production by replacement of n-6 PUFAS with less inflammatory n-3 PUFAs . Eicosanoid production regulates inflammation and originates from 20 -carbon n-3 PUFAs . Inflammatory cells contain high proportions of n-6 PUFAs incorporated into the phospholipid membrane and low proportions of other 20 -carbon PUFAs and as a consequence w hen lipid peroxidation occurs arachidonic acid is the major substrate for eicosanoid synthesis. The relative proportion of these fatty acids in the membrane can be altered through dietary modifications. Increases in dietary consumption of n-6 PUFAs or pre cursors such as linoleic acid have increase d inflammation compared to n-3 PUFAs through increased arachidonic acid and inflammatory mediator production such as PGE2 and LBT4 (Kelley, Taylor, Nelson, & Mackey, 1998 ; L. D. Peterson et al., 1998 ; F Thies et al., 2001 ). Despite the increase in inflammatory mediators, production of TNF-, IL-1, or IL -6 by mononuclear cells did not increase or alter superoxide production (F. Thies et al., 2001 ). Increased dietary consumption of n-3 PUFAs such as DHA and EPA increased the composition of these fatty acids in the phospholipid membrane and decreas ed the percentage of n-6 PUFA in the phospholipid membrane. Additionally the same study found a decrease in eicosanoid mediator production of PGE2, thromboxane B 2, LTB 4, and 5 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (Caughey, Mantzioris, Gibson, Cleland, & James, 1996 ; Endres et al., 1989 ; Lee et al., 1985 ). Omega fatty acids can also act as a substrate for both COX and 5 -LOX, giving rise to eicosanoids such as LTB 5, LTE 5, and PGE3. These compounds have different structures than thos e formed from arachidonic acid and as a consequence are less inflammatory than those formed from arachidonic acid (Goldman, Pickett, & Goetzl, 1983 ; Lee, et al., 1985 ; Sperling et al., 1993 ; von Schacky, Kiefl, Jendraschak, & Kaminski, 1993 ). Additionally , EPA can generate anti-inflammatory compounds such as D and E series resolvins from COX2 (C. 38 N. Serhan, Arita, Hong, & Gotlinger, 2004 ; Charles N Serhan et al., 2000 ). In addition to their anti inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFA's can enhance endogenous antioxidant defense systems and EPA incorporate into the phospholipid bilayer of cells where they displace arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid causes ROS generation through ). These inflammatory pathways can be inhibited by DHA and EPA administration and the chemoattractants derived from EPA are less potent tha n those derived from arachidonic acid (Kim & Chung, 2007 ; Mayer et al., 2003 ). Recently, it was shown that EPA and DHA attenuated TNF- stimulated monocyte protein gene expression by interacting with key gene inflammatory pathways such as ERK and NF -B (Encarnacion et al., 2011 ; Epstein, Barnes, & Karin, 1997 ). EPA and DHA supplementation reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis through the reversal of inflammatory and oxidant pathways in patients with kidney disease, heart failure , diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (An, Kim, Cho, & Vaziri, 2009 ; Bouzidi et al., 2010 ; Matsumoto, Nakayama, Ishida, Kobayashi, & Kamata, 2009 ; Peake, Gobe, & Coombes, 2011 ; Woodman et al., 2002 ). Despite anti -inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFA supplementation has not improved performance of endurance athletes compared to placebo (Nieman, Henson, McAnulty, Jin, & Maxwell, 2009 ). Muscle Damage Exercise Models Damage in ske letal muscle can be elicited through eccentric exercise by downhill running. For aerobic endurance exercise downhill running is commonly used in literature as a noninvasive way of eliciting muscle damage. Variations of maximal oxygen up take and gradient have been used as a way to achieve damage during the down hill run . Literature suggests that steeper gradient s and longer duration s have been highly correlated with increased skeletal muscle damage (Tiidus, 2008 ). Studies have varied speed and gradient with the most reliable method to elicit symptoms of EIMD/ DOMS ha ve been to have subjects run at a -16% gradient for at least 20 minutes (Stephan Sorichter, et al., 1997 ; Tiidus, 2008 ). 39 The mech anism of action is debated however it is thought that during the eccentric phase of movement of downhill running, the muscle a bsorbs energy by stretching and absorb s mechanical energy and as a consequence result s in increase d force production (LaStayo, Ewy, Pierotti, Johns, & Lindstedt, 2003 ; Lindstedt, LaStayo, & Reich, 2001 ). Muscle damage occurs during running while the muscles are lengthening after the foot touches the ground and center of mass is decelerating (Armstrong, Ogilvie, & Schwane, 1983 ). During downhill running, the joint angle is greater and the muscle has to work eccentrically at a greater length requiring more work at its longer length resulting in greater knee extensor muscle group strain compared to level running (Newham, Jones, Ghosh, & Aurora, 1988 ). Additionally, downhill running contributes to an increase in intramuscular pressure in a non -compliant muscle compartment, compared with concentric exe rcise that affect s nerve nocioreceptors creating a sensation of pain which is thought to cause the sensation of DOMS (Eston, Mickleborough, & Baltzopoulos, 1995 ). Maximal force loss and Muscle damage Skeletal muscle injury results from trauma and can affect the performance of contractions themselves, especially eccentric contractions. Muscle injury results in impaired muscle function that include s decreased joint range of motion, increased swelling, and prolonged strength loss. Strength losses following eccentric exercise in excess of 40 -50% baseline values with complete recovery occurring up to 30 days from the initial insult . Because of the impl ications of long lasting injuries on training and performance, athletes have sought to minimize injuries by utilizing various techniques such as supplementing with n-3 PUFAs . The cause of muscular force loss post ec centric exercise has been debated with one theory suggesting force loss was a result of a physical disruption or alteration of force -generating and transmitting structures in muscle such as the actin or myosin filaments. Evidence to support this theory has traditionally come from histological lesions associated with this type of injury such as A band disruptions and z -line streaming which result in decreased force production (Tiidus, 2008 ). While there is some evidence to support the theory, it has been shown the myofilament disrup tion 40 typically accounts for 34% of strength loss in single fiber prepa ration models indicating that there is a more significant factor that affects force loss after eccentric exercise (Reznick, et al., 1998 ). Another theory has focused on the inability to activate the actin and myosin microfilaments through the excitation contraction coupling. The excitation contraction -coupling pathway begins with acetylcholine release by the alpha -moto r neuron at the neuromuscular junction. An action potential is generated which passes along the plasmalemma until it goes deep into the fiber via the t-tubule. T -tubular membrane depolarization induces calcium release from the s arcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, where it binds to troponin to initiate the actin myosin cross bridge s. Warren and coworkers found that disruption of calcium homeostasis affects force production after muscle damage in mouse soleus muscles. After injury, muscles were injected with caffeine that promo ted calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum thereby increasing intracellular calcium levels. Any observed force loss after caffeine injection would be interpreted as intrinsic dysfunction of the sarcoplasmic re ticulum or excitation contraction coupling rather than a physical disruption of the actin and myosin microfilaments. The study found that after post muscle damage the caffeine -elicited force produced by the injured muscles was not statistically different from the non damage control muscle suggesting that force loss was due to failure of the excitation -contraction coupling (Warren, et al., 1993 ). Linker proteins such as desmin have been proposed as a cause of the loss of force in skeletal muscle post eccentric exercise. Desmin connects the sub -sarcolemmal cytoskeleton with the z disk and laterally connects the z disks together which maintain s cellular structural integrity during contraction (Z. Li et al., 1997 ; Paulin & Li, 2004 ). There is little evidence to suggest that force loss immediately after exercise is caused by desmin loss since th e rate of protein degradation of myofilament protein content is not altered until 6 hours post muscle damaging exercise (Ingalls, Warren, Williams, Ward, & Armstrong, 1998 ; Lowe, Warren, Ingalls, Boorstein, & Armstrong, 1995 ). While not a cause of immediate force loss, there is a progressive loss of contractile 41 protein content beginning 1 day and continuing until 5 days after muscle damage suggesting a later role in force loss (Lowe, et al., 1995 ). Rajabi et al. (2013) showed that 30-day n-3 PU FA supplementation (2000 mg/day) attenuated force loss post eccentric muscle damage in 20 healthy subjects compared to control. Leg presses were performed at 75% of one -repetition maximum with 4 sets of 20 repetitions with a 180 second rest period between sets. Voluntary contractile force was measured immediately, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. The results showed that there were significant differences between the control and treatment group s 48 and 72 hours post muscle -damaging exercise with the treatment group experiencing attenuation in force loss compared to control (Rajabi, Lotfi, Abdolmaleki, & Rashid -Amiri, 2013 ). These results are contra dicted by Pumpa et. al. (2012) who found that force attenuation after muscle damaging exercise was unaffected by PCSO -524 supplementation compared to control . Twenty well-trained male s were randomly assigned to consume PCSO -524 (200 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks prior to a downhill tre admill run. Maximal force was measured by isometric torque at 60\u00ba/second for 8 maximal force contractions on the right and left legs, countermovement jump and squat jump . The results found no significant decrease for time or group effects in force production following exercise induced muscle damage for both the countermovement jump and squat jump suggesting that PCSO -524 was ineffective at attenuating force loss compared to placebo . The study also showed that there was a non - significant decrease in force production after the downhill run in both placebo and treatment groups in the left leg and a decrease in force production in the treatment group. DOMS Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOM S) is transient perception of muscular pain and i s often combined with tenderness and stiffness that result s from muscle trauma especially from intense or unaccustomed eccentric exercise such as downhill running, resistive cycling, and ballistic stretching (L. L. Smith, 1991 ). The causes of DOMS have been debated and re search has 42 centered on nocicepto r compression by muscle spasm s; excessive lactic acid accumulation; disrupted z-lines; connective tissue inflammatory cell infiltration and resulting nociceptor activation from edema; and excessive calcium accumulation leading to inhibition of ATP generation, and activation of protease and phospholipase enzymes (Armstrong, 1984 ; de Vries, 1966 ; KT Francis & Hoobler, 1987 ; Gulick & Kimura, 1996 ; Hough, 1902 ). While non e of thes e theories is thought to be entirely responsible for DOMS, current literature suggests an integrated theory beginning with disruption of structural proteins in muscle fibers, particularly at the weakened z -lines during eccentric exercise damages the sarcolemma inhibiting cellular res piration and increasing lypolytic and proteolytic enzyme activation . These enzymes disrupt the plasma membrane allowing intracellular contents to leak into the interstitial space that attracts monocytes that differentiate into macrophages within 12 hours of muscle damage. The macrophages produce prostaglandin (PGE 2), which sensitizes nerve endings to mechanical, chemical or thermal stimulation. Additionally the products from active phagocytosis and cellular necrosis such as histamine, potassium and kinins in addition to elevated pressure from tissue edema further activate nociceptors within the muscle (Smith Jr & Jackson, 1990 ). One of the limitations in using DOMS in muscle damage asse ssment is the high rate of non responders with one stud y reporting that one -third of subjects undergoing maximal eccentric contractions experienced no \"meaningful'' muscle soreness (Sayers & Clarkson, 2001 ). DOMS can affect a thletic performance and may result in altered muscle function and joint mechanics which may lead to a reduction in performance and less than optimal training intensity. Significant reductions in joint range of motion have been reported after repetitive eccentric resistance exer cise (Kennon Francis & Hoobler, 1988 ). Significant reductions in strength and power para meters during DOMS with peak torque deficits occurring 24-48 hours after DOMS - inducing exercise and are more profound and persistent during eccentric testing and may require up to 8 -10 days to return to baseline levels. Evans et al. (1990) found isokineti c eccentric peak torque of the elbow flexors decreased immediately after (44%), 24 hours (39%) and 48 hours 43 (32%) following repetitive eccentric contractions using an isokinetic dynamometer set at 60\u00b0/sec ond. By 14 days, eccentric peak torque had returned to normal (D. Evans, Smith, Chenier, Israel, & McCammon, 1990 ). Treatment of DOMS typically involves treatment with NSAIDs which inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase pathway and prevent endoperoxide and prostaglandin production reducing the inflammatory response attenuating muscle edema and intramuscular pressure which are thought to be contributing factors to DOMS (S. Hasson, Wible, Reich, Barnes, & Williams, 1992 ; S. M. Hasson et al., 1993 ). Omega -3 fatty acids also inhibit prostaglandin production by acting as less inflammatory substrates for the COX enzymes thereby reducing membrane destruction and immune response. Recently, Tartib ian et al. (2009) examine d the effect of 30 days of n-3 PUFA supplementation on the effects of DOMS after eccentric exercise. 27 men were randomly assigned to one of the experimental n-3 PUFA (324 mg EPA and 216 mg DHA ), placebo , and control groups. Knee range of motion was determined using goniometry , self -reported levels of lower extremity pain, and thigh circumference. Measurement s were taken at baseline , immediately after, 24 and 48 hours after 40 minutes of bench stepping. The results found that while no differences were observed for pain and ROM at baseline , immediately after, and 24 hours after exercise, differences were evident in perception of pain and R OM 48 hours after exercise with the n-3 PUFA group experiencing attenuated pain and loss of ROM . Differences in thigh circumference, were evident at 24 and 48 hours after muscle damaging exercise, and there was no difference before and immediately after exercise with the control group experiencing a greater in crease in thigh circumfer ence . The authors concluded that n-3 PUFA supplementation at this dose can effectively reduce the symptoms of DOMS and inflammation (B. Tartibian, B. H. Maleki, & A. Abbasi, 2009 ). 44 Chapter 3 : Methods Subjects Forty untrained males aged 18 -26 participate d in th is study , and were recruited from the local Bloomington, Indiana population , with 34 subjects completing the study . Reasons for subject withdrawal included person al issue (1), failure to show (1) inability to obtain blood (3) and removed for outliers for DOMS data (2). Since the menstrual cycle has been shown to affect muscle damage, females were not included in this s tudy (Sipaviciene, Daniuseviciute, Kliziene, Kamandulis, & Skurvydas, 2013 ). Subjects exercised less than 3 times a week for 30 minutes a session and had a BMI u nder 30 kg/m2, blood pressure of less than 140 mmHg /90 mmHg, fasting blood glucose of less than 100 mg/dL; and total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL . Additionally , subjects did not have a history of asthma or exercise -induced asthma, COPD, interstitial lung diseases, or cystic fibrosis, dyspnea, performed eccentric endurance exercise or participated in a strength training program 60 days prior to enrolling in the study, consumption of n-3 PUFAs or anti - inflammatory medication, history of hip or knee pain , seafood allergies, a familial or personal history of cardiovascular disease, ankle edema, tachycardia, known heart murmurs, shortness of breath or diabetes . Additionally subjects were no t enrolled if they came from a family that ha d a history of heart disease, tobacco use, or dyslipidemia. S ubjects were not allowed to consume fish oil or fish oil products during the study or exercise for more than 3 times a week for 30 minutes a session . Diet was monitored to ensure no significant dietary changes occurred during the study. Subjects also documented mood and exercise activity during the study. Study Design The study lasted over 7 weeks and was divided into pre and post supplementatio n phases (Figure 4 ). The pre supplementation phase consisted of baseline measures of muscle damage and blood biomarkers. 143 subjects were screened and 40 qualified and were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group with a randomization ratio of 1:1 . 34 subjects completed the study with 2 subjects being excluded and 6 subjects dropped for failing to comply with the requirements of the study . 45 Figure 3: Flowchart of subject participation through the study Subjects entered the study on their normal diet and after completing the baseline measures were randomly assigned to supplement for 29 days with either 8 capsules of Omega XL \u00ae (1 capsule contains 50 mg of n 3 PUFA and 100 mg olive oil) or placebo capsules (1 capsule contains 15 0 mg olive oil). PCSO -524 contains stabilized lipids from the New Zealand green -lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, in combination with olive oil, vitamin E, sterol esters, sterols, polar lipids, triglycerides and f ree fatty acids (including 13% EPA, 21% DHA) (Murphy, Mooney, Mann, Nichols, & Sinclair, 2002). The placebo group of 16 subjects consume d 8 capsules/day containing olive oil for four weeks. A between -subject design was used to avoid the influence of the repeated bout effect associated with a within -subject design (McHugh, Connolly, Eston, & Gleim, 1999). Testing was performed in a laboratory setting during the baseline and post supplementation periods with supplementation occurring away from the labora tory. Tests were conducted in the human performance and exercise biochemistry laboratories at Indiana University, Bloomington. An independent investigator not involved in data collection and having no contact with the subjects used a comput erized random number generator (Random, http://www.random.org/ ) to create t he randomization sequence with a 1:1 placebo/control allocation. 46 Figure 4: Schematic diagram of study protocol showing the pre and post supplementation sequential phases of t he study . Subjects perform ed a cycle familiarization time trial during the first lab visit. On the second visit (week 2 ), subjects performed a treadmill VO 2 max test. For the VO 2 max test, subjects selected a comfortable pace to run at and rested for 5 minutes while being monitored for expired O2 and CO2. The test commenced at 0% grade and a speed of 1.6 k ph less than the selected speed f or 2 minutes after which time , the speed was increase d to the predetermined speed chosen by the subject f or 2 min utes. After 2 minutes the slope of the treadmill was increased to 4% for 2 minutes while maintaining a constant speed . Slope was increased 2% every 2 min utes until exhaustion. On the third visit ( week 3 ), subjects were evaluated for baseline measures of muscle force, range of motion, muscle swelling, muscle pain and algometry . Additionally a blood draw establish ed baseline measures of intracellular muscular proteins and inflammatory markers . All blood draws were taken from t he antecubital vein of the arm and collected into red top Vacutainer\u00ae tubes. The tubes were placed on ice for at least 30 min utes before centrifugation at 20\u00b0C at 3000 RPM for 15 minutes. Serum was allocated to storage tubes and stored immediatel y at -80\u00b0C i n multiple aliquots . 47 During t he 26 day supplementation period , half of the subjects supplemented with the placebo, which was an olive oil capsule, and the treatment group supplemented with the Omega XL\u00ae capsules. Both groups consume d 8 capsules a day (4 in the morning, 4 in the evening) . Dosage was carefully chosen based on studies that showed an effect with 400 mg n-3 PUFA /day (Tecklenburg -Lund et al., 2010 ). On the fifth visit, (47th day of the study) , functional measures of exerc ise-induced muscle damage were assessed and blood drawn prior to the downhill muscle damaging exercise. After the muscle damaging exercise, subjects rest ed for 2 hours. After two hours blood was drawn . Muscle force, range of motion, muscle swelling, knee exten sor pain, algometry and blood was collected 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after muscle induced damage. Measurements Maximal Voluntary Contraction Muscle force protocol required subjects to contract their quadriceps at a knee angle o f 80\u00b0. Subjects were secured into a chair and their leg secured to a force transducer ( Dillion, Fairmont, MN) with a non -compliant strap. Data was measured in volts and converted to force by a regression equation (Biopac AcqKnowledge, Goleta, CA). Subje cts were familiarized with the equipment by performing three warm up contractions (two submaximal, 1 maximal) separated by 10 seconds of rest. After the last maximal contraction subjects were instructed to rest for 5 minutes followed by 3, 3 second maximum voluntary contractions of the quadriceps, interspersed with 10 -second rest intervals between contraction s with the highest peak torque from the 3 contractions recorded. Subjects were verbally encouraged during the maximal contractions. Range of motion Range of motion has been show n to be an accurate method of determining the extent of muscle damage (P. M. Clarkson, et al., 1992 ). Subjects were instructed to lay prone on a massage table with both knees fully extended. Subjects flex ed their left knee with no help from the investigator and the angl e measured with a goniometer (Prestige Medical, Northridge , CA) using universal 48 landmarks (lateral epicondyle of the femur, lateral malleolus and greater trochanter) that were marked to ensure consistency on subsequent measures. Three measurements were averaged and reported in degree s. This method has been validated previously (Watkins, Riddle, Lamb, & Personius, 1991 ). Thigh Girth Limb circumference has been proposed as a functional measure of muscle damage (Tiidus, 2008 ). Limb circumference was assessed from the midpoint of the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the domin ant leg with an anthropometric tape (Idass, Glastonbury, UK) . Subjects were standing fully relaxed in the anatomical position. Subjects were instructed to bear the majority of their weight on their dominant leg with three averaged measurements taken on their non dominant leg . Measurement sites were marked to ensure consistency and measurements were reported in millimeters. Algometr y Pressure a lgometry can be used to quantif y muscle tenderness. The validity and sensitivity of pressure algometry has be en established in literature (Kosek, Ekholm, & Nordemar, 1993 ). Pressure was measured at five specific sites on the quadriceps with a digital algometer (Force One, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT. ). The same investigator performe d all measurements throughout the study. Specific sites for assessment were determined using established literature and landmarks (Pumpa, et al., 2011 ) involving two anatomical points ( anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and sup erior pole of the patella (SPP)) . All measurements were taken on th e right side with the subject in the supine position . A longitudinal axis was created between the ASIS and the SPP from which the sites were marked with a permanent marker to ensure accuracy at each time point. The measured sites were : 15 cm distal to the ASIS, 4 cm proximal to the SPP, midpoint of the ASIS and SPP along the axis, then 2 cm lateral and 2 cm medial of this midpoint. Subjects were instructed to let the investigator know when the pressure transformed into pain at which point the amount of force was recorded in newtons . 49 Muscle damaging exercise An established protocol was used to illicit muscle damage in trained athletes (Stephan Sorichter, et al., 1997 ) by downhill running on a treadmill (A.R. Young Company, Indianapolis, IN.) modified to run in reverse at a -16% gradient . Before the test, 5 minutes of warm up preceded 20 minutes of running, followed by a 5 minute cool down period. Once the test commenced, subjects were not permitted to stop and treadmill speed was adjusted so the subject could maintain a heart rate that corresponded to 70% VO2 max. Blood assays Indirect markers of muscle for the plc.

An automated plate washer (Biotek ELx405, Winooski, VT) was used to wash the 96 -well microplates during the pre -assay preparations. All assays were analyzed using a Powerwave XSTM specificity with no detectable cross reactivity to any of the other intracellular constituents present in human serum. Concentrations on all biomarkers were analyzed and reported. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS 21 (IBM, Armonk, New York) with s tatistical significance assessed at a level of p < 0.05. Data were analyzed with a repeated measures design. Normality was assessed with Shapiro -Wilks test and Levene's test check ed homogeneity of variance between groups. Mauchly's test was conducted to determine if sphericity was violated. If sphericity was violated, the ANOVA was corrected with a Greenhouse -Geisser adjustment factor. A Fisher protected least -square s difference post-hoc test was used to detect differences 50 in group means (p < 0.05) where a significant F ratio was found. Data are presented as mean plus or minus standard deviation with reliability presented as a 95% confidence interval . Sample size was determined using a post-hoc power analysis of existing literature using G*Power version 3.0.5 (Universit\u00e4t Kiel, Germany) (Faul, E rdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007). Effect sizes were presented as mean differences between groups divided by standard deviation. Previous literature suggests that an experiment -wise error rate of 0.05 require d at least 15 subjects within each treatment gr oup (Fontani et al., 2005), (Guezennec, Nadaud, Satabin, Leger, & Abbasi, 2009), (Tartibian, Maleki, & Abbasi , In previous studies, ingestion of n -3 PUFA (n=9-15) for 30 days compared to placebo/control (n=9 -15) significantly reduced inflammatory markers and perceived pain following eccentric exercise, with effect sizes ranging from 0.64 -0.75 for a study power of 0.82 and 0.84 respectively. Additionally, following 30 days n-3 PUFA supplementation (n=10), compared to placebo (n=10), a number of inflammatory markers were decreased directly after 5 days of military survival boot camp for effect sizes ranging from 0.61 -0.75 for a study power of 0.84 (Santos, et al., 2012). It is calcula ted that a sample size of 20 per group will provide a 96% power to detect differences in the series of proof of concept studies outlined in this proposal. Study power was maintained at 80% because fewer than five subjects withdrew or dropped from either side of the study (Adams et al., 1 993). 51 Chapter 4: Results Subjects 32 untrained males participated in the study (PCSO -524: n=16, placebo: n=1 6) out of 40 that were recruited for the study.

Maximal Voluntary Contraction Strength loss after eccentric exercise is a common indicator of exercise induced muscl e damage and has been used as a valid and reliable indirect marker of muscle damage after eccentric exercise in 50% of eccentric muscle damage studies in humans (Tiidus, 2008 ). After eccentric muscle damage there can be up to a 50% loss in strength compared to baseline with restoration occurring up to 10 days after muscle damaging exercise. Multiple hypotheses exist for the cause of force loss after eccentric exercise which include disruption of the myofilaments due to histological lesion s as evidenced from muscle biopsies ; attenuated neural activation patterns; and overstretched sarcomeres due to non uniform sarcomere length (P. M. Clarkson, et al., 1992 ). Force loss after eccentric muscle damage, measured by maximal voluntary contractions of the quadriceps, wa s significantly different between groups at 96 hours for the PCSO -524 group compared to placebo suggest ing PCSO -524 supplementation has a protective effect on muscle damage during eccentric exercise by increasing force production post muscle damage . These results are similar to Clarkson et. al. (1992) who investigated 2 bouts of high force eccentric exercise which resulted in substantial decrease s in baseline force production immediately after eccentric exercise (P. M. Clarkson, et al., 1992 ). Supplementation of n -3 PUFAs, the principle ingredient in PCSO -524, has been shown to 69 affect muscle strength by increasing grip strength in older adults (Robinson et al., 2 008) by potentially increasing protein anabolism through the Akt -mTOR -S6K1 pathway (Gingras et al., 2007a ). Additionally, n -3 PUFA supplementation has been shown to maintain muscle mass during muscle atrophy due to increases in amino acid delivery and anti-inflammatory action (P. C. Calder, 2009 ; Fujita, Rasmussen, Cadenas, Grady, & Volpi, 2006 ). Another mechanism that n -3 PUFAs may attenuate force loss during conditions of atrophy is through altered signaling pathways. I ncorporation of n-3 PUFAs into the muscle phospholipid bilayer has been shown to increase PIP3 potency increasing phosphorylation of p70s6k, a crucial protein in the maintenance of muscle mass after resistance exercise (Alessi et al., 1997 ; Baar & Esser, 1999 ). The effect of PCSO -524 supplementation on force production has been previously observed in Pumpa et. al. (2012) who investigated maximal voluntary contraction by counter movement and vertical jumping following downhill running and showed there was a non significant decrease in height and no significant difference between time points suggesting there was no affect fo r time or treatment in this study (Pumpa, et al., 2011 ). Similarly , Kreider found that n -3 PUFA supplementation failed to promote strength gains in 23 experienced, resistance -trained subjects during a randomized double -blind study with either placebo (olive oil) or 6 gram s/day of n -3 PUFAs (conjugated linoleic acids) for 28 days. Despite a controlled training regimen there was no significant difference in strength compared to control (Kreider, Ferreira, Greenwood, Wilson, & Almada, 2002 ). The lack of significant effects in both these studies may be explained by training status and supplementation period. The findings of Pumpa et. al. (2012) and Kreider et. al. (2002) may have been influenced by the use of trained subjects. Trained subjects have been shown to attenuate the clinical signs of muscle damage and decrease the amount of intracellular muscular proteins in the blood compared to untrained individuals (Appell, Soares, & Duarte, 1992 ; Ortenblad, Madsen, & Djurhuus, 1997 ). The current study attempts to rectify this limitati on by studying the effect of PCSO -524 in untrained individuals whose muscles are less resilient to muscle damage (Tiidus, 70 2008 ). Range of Motion Inflammatory m uscle swelling and myofibril disruption has been postulated to cause muscle stiffness and reduced range of motion. Onset of reduced range of motion is gradual peaking around 3 day s after eccentr ic muscle damage, and exhibits a similar time course to muscle swelling and therefore might be a result of reduced range of motion. Cli nical studies suggest that range of motion is decreased after post -traumatic edema and joint range of motion can be affected by muscle size w hich can vary between i ndividual s (Airaksinen, Partanen, Kolari, & Soimakallio, 1991 ). Modification of the arachidonic acid pathway through the use of less inflammatory substrates such as n-3 PUFA s or the inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis by blocking COX e nzymes has been shown in literature to attenuate inflammation , thereby increasing range of motion (Bjordal, Ljunggren, Klovning, & Sl\u00f8rdal, 2004 ; P. Calder & Grimble, 2002 ). Kjeldsen -Kragh et. al (1992) found that subject consumption of 3.8 gram s EPA /day and 2.0 grams of DHA /day for 16 weeks was effective at decreas ing morning stiffness despite a significant increase in morning stiffness in the placebo group (Kjeldsen -Kragh et al., 1992 ). Further, Tartibian et. al. (2009) found 30 days of n-3 PUFA supplementation at 324 mg EPA /day and 216 mg DHA /day attenuated loss of range of motion compared to placebo 48 hours after eccentric exercise (B. Tartibian, et al., 2009 ). These data are in agreement with the present study , which found that while there was initially no significant difference between the placebo and PCSO -524 group s immediatel y after eccentric exercise, range of motion increased over time with significant increase s in the range of motion of the PCSO -524 group 96 hours after muscle damaging exercise. Despite this theoretical basis of n-3 PUFA supplementation, there have been inconsistent results of eicosanoid pathway inhibition by the use of n-3 PUFA or NSAID supplementation on range of motion. Lenn and colleagues used 1.8 g /day n -3 PUFA with a 30 day supplementation period and failed to show a significant difference in relaxed arm angle after 50 maximal isokinetic eccentric 71 elbow flexion contractions at any time during the study (Lenn, et al., 2002 ). Tokmakidis reported a sim ilar effect with the NSAIDS (Tokmakidis, Kokkinidis, Smilios, & Douda, 2003 ). Similar findings were observed by Barlas et . al. (2000) and Stone et . al. (2002) who showed no effect of eicosanoid inhibition on loss of ROM (Barlas et al., 2000 ; Stone, Merrick, Ingersoll, & Edwards, 2002 ). The lack of significant findings in these studies differs from the present study that showed statistically significant differences in ROM 96 hours post eccentric exercise . The lack of significant effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in the studies conducted by (Lenn et. al. ( 2002 ), Barlas et. al. ( 2000 ), and Stone et. al. ( 2002) may be attributed to training status . For example, Tartibian et. al. (2009 ) used untrained males and found 324 mg EPA and 216 mg DHA /day for 30 days attenuat ed loss of range of motion and found the attenuation effect increase d gradually post eccentric muscle damaging exercise with the first significant difference between placebo and n -3 PUFA groups observed at the last time point measured in the study at 48 hours post eccentric muscle damaging exercise (B. Tartibian, et al., 2009 ). Thigh girth Swelling occurs within the muscle shortly after exercise and t high circumference has been used as an indicator of exercise induced muscle damage caused by eccentric exercise due to muscle swelling and inflammation by influx of fluid into the muscle tissue (K. Nosaka & Newton, 2002 ). Swelling peaks 4 to 5 days post eccentric muscle damage with an initial increase in swelling occurring 0 -1 hours post muscle damage in some studies. N-3 PUFA supplementation is hypothesized to attenuate inflammation by inhibiting the eicosanoid pathway since n-3 PUFAs are less inflammatory substrates than n-6 PUFAs and as a consequence, attenuate macrophage free radical production . Diets rich in n-3 PUFA s found in the components in fish oil attenuate reactive oxygen species generation , production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1b and IL -6 by macrophages which lead to an attenuated response from the immune system (P. C. Calder, 1998 ). Increased consumption of n- 72 3 PUFAs such as EPA and DHA, result in the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs phospholipids in the membrane of the inflammatory cell at the expense of the more proinflamatory arachidonic acid. Because less substrate is available for synthesis of eicosanoids from arachidonic acid, fish oil supplementation decreases production of PGE 2, thromboxane B2, LTB4, 5 - hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and LTE4 by inflammatory cells (P. Calder & Grimble, 2002 ). Supplementat ion with n-3 PUFAs after eccentric exercise reduces muscle swelling 48 hours after exercise (Lenn, et al., 2002 ). However reduction in swelling by arachidonic acid pathway inhibition has not always been observed consistently in literature . For example, there was no effect on arm circumference after eccentric arm exercises after supplementation of 2,000 mg EPA and 1,000 mg DHA per day (Jouris, McDaniel, & Weiss, 2011 ). Similarly, Reynolds failed to demonstrate attenuation o f thigh circumference following acute hamstring injuries by NSAID (300 mg/day) n of inflammatory compounds has been demonst rated in a number of studies by supplementation of in hibitors such as n-3 PUFAs or NSAID s suggesting that inhibition of eicosanoid production reduces swelling (Tiidus, 2008 ; Yang et al., 2010 ). One reason for the lack of observed difference in the present study might be that swelling was being affe cted by gravity. Clarkson et. al. (1996 ) observed that the location of swelling in the muscle appears to change over time by using MRI and found that fluid began to accumulate in the lower portions of the extremities hypothesize d to be due to the effects of gravity (Kazunori Nosaka & Clarkson, 1996 ). The lack of significant time effects for both groups might be explained by examining other parts of the muscle for swelling rather than the mi dpoint. In the present study the increase in TNF - concentration is strong ly linked to inflammation and it can be assumed muscle swelling might not be noticed since the effects of edema would be most noticeable in the distal end of the leg rather than the midpoint . 73 Some studies have found a poor correlation between the biochemical inflammatory markers and muscle swelling indicating that the two events might occur by two independent processes and suggests that the mechanism for muscle damage is not the underlying mech anism of exercise - induced biomarker increase which would corroborate with the findings in the present study (Kazunori Nosak a & Clarkson, 1996 ; Sprenger et al., 1992 ). Algometry Delayed -onset muscle soreness is a hallmark manifestation of exercise -induced muscle damage a claim first made by Hough (1902). Typically, DOMS develops between 24 and 48 hours after eccentric muscle damage and peaks within 72 hours postexercise (P. M. Clarkson, et al., 1992 ). The dull pain that signals DOMS is hypothesized to be caused by activation of afferent neurons by swelling and the subsequent pressure activate s the mechanoreceptors. Another possible cause is the increased histamines, bradykinins, and prostaglandins produced by the inflammatory cells and breakdown of myocellular components that activate nociceptors that are sensitive to chemical signals (P. M. Clarkson, et al., 1992 ). Algometry has been proposed as a reliable and effective way o f quantifying pressure pain threshold s and muscle damage (Potter, McCarthy, & Oldham, 2006 ). Further , algometry is a reliable measure and enhanced when bei ng performed by one examiner and can be used to evaluate the develop ment and decline of experimentally induced muscle tenderness over consecutive days (Nussbaum & Downes, 1998 ). Omega 3 fatty acids attenuate prostaglandin production and reduce inflammatory mediators by replacing arachidonic acid in the cell membrane. After muscle damage , concentrations of calcium activated PLA 2 increase, resulting in greater prostaglandin and leukotriene production. Additionally the antioxidants in PCSO -524 such as furan fatty acid s and vitamin E are powerful free radical scavengers, which minimize damage caused by NADPH oxidase in macrophage s. DOMS has been attenuated by antioxidant supplementation such as Vitamin & Goldfarb, 2006 ). PCSO -524 supplementation has been beneficial in reducing perceive d muscle soreness in athletes after a 30 kilometer run (Baum, et al., 2013 ). Additionally , n-3 PUFA supplementat ion reduced the arachidonic /eicosapentaeno ic acid ratio in the cell membrane and 74 the number of positive tender points in patients affected by musculoskeletal pain (Giuliano Fontani et al., 2010 ). The benefits of n-3 PUFA supplement ation are well documented in literature for the prevention of muscle pain . Studies have found 1000 mg/day supplementation of EPA/DHA was enough to cause a increase in the tender point measured with algometry (Guimar\u00e3es, Guimar\u00e3es, & Raposo, 2011 ). Additionally the n-3 PUFAs found in PCSO -524 have been associated with decrease d neuropathic pain with a study finding that between 2400 -7200 mg/day of EPA and DHA was sufficient to attenuate the perception of pain by tender point algometry (Ko, Nowacki, Arseneau, Eitel, & Hum, 2010 ). These finding s were corroborated with Pumpa et. al. (2012) who showed supplementation of the n-3 PUFA rich compound PCSO -524 was ineffective at showing statistically significant differences in tender point algometry in trained athletes at the midpoint of the quadriceps following a downhi ll run. This failure to f ind difference s might have been the result of using trained athletes, since training confers a protective effect and as a consequence trained athletes are more resistant to muscle damage due to the repeated bout effect (Tiidus, 2008 ). The current study attempts to rectify the limitations in the Pumpa study by using untrained athletes whose muscles are more susceptible to the symptoms of EIMD/DOMS following downhill running. The present study found that there was a significant effect fo r time, suggesting that muscle damaging exercise in the present study was effective at inducing muscle damage (F = 3.287 p < .05) and the effect was effective for both the placebo and treatment groups (F = .206 p = .935). However PCSO -524 supplement ation at the dosage and supplementation period was not effective in creating a significant difference between the control and placebo (F = .025 p = .877). These results assume that all participants were affected in the same way, however some participant s claimed that their hamstrings, a muscle not measured, was more tender than their quadriceps. Flexibility can determine which muscles are recruited and running gait can be 75 affected causing other muscle groups to compensate for weaker or stiffer muscles wh ich can lead to damage (Hartig & Henderson, 1999 ). Creatine Kinase - MM Blood proteins such as creatine kinase have been proposed as indirect indicators of muscle damage and are routinely studied after strenuous exercise. It is believed that after eccentric exercise the membrane of the muscle cell is damaged causing the re lease of creatine kinase, an enzyme that catalyzes phosphocreatine from creatine. Creatine kinase is found and cells consuming ATP rapidly such as skeletal, and smooth muscle, photoreceptor cells of the retina and neurons in the brain. Due to multiple sources, increases in creatine kinase can be trigger ed by any number of events and increases have cor responded poorly with measures of EIMD/DOMS. For example, an animal model, Kuipers et. al. (1985) reported that creatine kinase activity showed a poor correlation with a histological assessment of muscle damage (H. Kuipers, Keizer, Verstappen, & Costill, 1985 ). Another study found that creatine kinase activity was much greater than actual tissue damage evaluated from tissue biopsy calculated by creatine kinase appearance and disappearance rates (Van der Meulen, et al., 1991 ). An additional confounding problem is the large variability between subjects following the s ame exerc ise. For example, Newham et. al. found that subjects who performed an eccentric exercise session had CPK activities ranging from 500 U/L to 34,500 U/L creatine kinase with variability unrelated to general fitness level and physical characteristics of the subjects (Newham, Jones, & Edwards, 1983 ). A possible reason for these discrep ancies is that creatine kinase is cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system and any imbalance in production or clearance can lead to misestimating the effect of muscle damage after eccentric exercise. A novel first for this study was the use of an isoform of creatine kinase only found in skeletal muscle after downhill running . The lack of significance of other studies in difference in creatine kinase after eccentric e xercise may be to the use of the widely popular creatine kinase MB which 76 is found in multiple location s including muscles and the brain and can be released for multiple reasons other than muscle damage . The isoform in this study utilized the isoform CK -MM that is the major isoform of creatine kinase expressed in skeletal muscle cells w ith other forms such as CK-MB playing a minor role (F. S. Apple, Rogers, & Ivy, 1986). Other studies have confirmed the efficacy of CK -MM as a reliable indicator of muscle damage in both athletes and diseased individuals (F. Apple, et al., 1988; Page, Jac kson, Coakley, & Edwards, 1989). The present study has shown that PCSO -524 can significantly attenuate CK-MM levels compared to placebo following downhill running (F = 191.321 p < .001). Significant differences were observed immediately, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the downhill run (p < .05) with maximal values observed at 72 hours and 96 hours for the PCSO -524 and placebo groups respectively which is in agreement with previously published literature which suggest s creatine kinase increases 24 hours after muscle damaging exercise and peaks within 3 -5 days (Tiidus, 2008). The results in the present study differ from the Pumpa et. al. (2012) study which failed to show a significant difference in creatin e kinase concentrations for trained athlete s supplemented with PCSO -524 compared to placebo after a downhill run . One explanation for the failure to show significance may be due to the creatine kinase isoform in the study was specific to both muscle and brain and not just skeletal muscle as in the present study . Another reason for the differences observed between studies may be due to a greater supplementation of PCSO -524 per day, (200 mg PCSO -524 /day) in the Pumpa study in comparison to present study (400 mg PCSO -524 /day). Myoglobin Myoglobin is a heme protein of striated muscle and is rapidly released after muscle damage. Myoglobin is involved in oxygen binding , storage and diffusion in cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers. It accounts for up to 5 to 10% of all cytoplasmic proteins wit h the highest concentration located close to the contractile apparatus and the intracellular membranous or fibular structures. 77 Since myoglobin is only found in skeletal muscle cells, it's appearance in the blood is hypothesized to be due to ruptured cell m embranes following eccentric muscle action and the amount of protein released into the blood is correlated with the magnitude of muscle damage (Van Nieuwenhoven et al., 1995) . In skeletal muscle, myoglobin is found mainly in slow -twitch fibers with current myoglobin assays unable to discriminate between myoglobin released from the heart or from skeletal muscle, and theref ore myoglobin is not muscle specific (Delanghe, Chapelle, & Vanderschueren, 1990 ). Use of myoglobin has been problematic since production has not always been correlated with actual m uscle damage . Some studies have correlated myoglobin with muscle damag e through verification with muscle biopsy (Dawson et al., 2002 ) and through disruption of the muscle membrane (Driessen -Kletter, Amelink, B\u00e4r, & Van Gijn, 1990 n-3 PUFAs has been used to attenuate the effects of muscle damage on myoglobin appearance in the blood (Tartibian, Maleki, & Abbasi, 2011 ). The effect observe d was similar to the present study with the appearance of myoglobin in the blood increasing until 48 hours after eccentric muscle damaging exercise with levels in the study of myoglobin for control (393.4 +/ - 133.2) and treatment 200.1 +/ - 120.4) not statistically different than control (346.2 +/ - 42.2) and treatment (246.8 +/ - 45.6) in the present study at 48 hours post muscle damaging exercise. Additionally , the study findings are in agreement wit h other studies that have found elevated myoglobin levels 24 to 96 hours post eccentric muscle damage (Tiidus, 2008). The findings of the present study agree with previous studies that show that n-3 PUFA supplementation has been effective in attenuating muscle damage post eccentric muscle exercise (Lenn, et al. , 2002). The findings in the present study that PCSO -524 significantly decreased myoglobin release following exercise induced muscle damage is in disagreement with Pumpa (2012) who found no difference between treatment and placebo groups of trained athl etes during downhill running with supplementation of 200 mg PCSO -524 /day at any time point in the study (Pumpa, et al., 2011). The maximal values for myoglobin concentration were much earlier than the present study (6 78 hours versus 72 hours) after muscle damaging exercise might be attributed to excessive myoglobin clearance by the kidney. Ritter et al (1979) found that myoglobin clearance is altered after exercise training with significant increases in clearance and decrea ses in total myoglobin plasma concentration i n 16 male subjects following strenuous physical evaluation tests. The present study attempts to rectify this deficiency by using untrained individuals which are more susceptible to EIMD/DOMS (Ritter, Stone, & Willerson, 1979 ). Another explanation for the discrepancy between the present study and the study conducted by Pumpa et al (2012) may be explained by the muscle damaging protocol used in the Pumpa study was not severe enough to illicit muscle damage in trained athletes . Since trained subjects experience the repeated bout effect, which protects against subsequent muscle damage , the magnitude of damage is important in eliciting EIMD/DOMS . The current study utilizes a protocol that has been shown to illicit muscle damage in trained individuals by using a greater slope ( -16% vs. -10%) and longer dur ation of exercise (20 minutes continuous) in contrast to the study conducted by Pumpa and colleagues. The protocol w as successful in inducing muscle damage and myoglobin release as evidenced by a significant treatment effect for time (F = 373.835 p < .001). Troponin - I (Skeletal) Skeletal troponin I (sTnI) has been proposed as an alternative to commonly used muscle damage mark ers such as creatine kinase and myogl obin al., 1997). Current biomarkers such as creatine kinase are highly variable both within subjects and between subje cts making them a poor estimator of exercise induced muscle damage. Both creatine kinase and myoglobin are actively cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system and myoglobin through the kidney, and alterations in the rates of clearance and production can lead to differences in the blood that do not accurately reflect the extent of muscle damage (Tiidus, 2008 ). Skeletal muscl e troponin I is located on the force -producing units of the sarcomere, which is responsible for binding with calcium caus ing tropomyosin to shift revealing the myosin binding sites which are responsible for force production. Since this protein is unique to skeletal muscle cells, any 79 appearance in the blood is believed to be indicative of muscle damage (S Sorichter, Puschendorf, & Mair, 1999 ). The cardiac isoform of STN1 has been used as a reliable diagnostic marker for patients suffering from heart attack . Due to the unique specificity to skeletal muscle sTnI has been suggested as a possible gold standard of measuring the extent of muscle dama ge (Stephan Sorichter, et al., 19 97). The current study is novel in that it is the first to measure the appearance of STN1 in the blood after muscle damaging exercise . The results of the study found that the downhill run at -16% for 20 minutes was sufficient to induce elevation of sTnI serum levels with the placebo group experiencing s tatistically elevated levels of sTN1 compared to the PCSO -524 group. Differences in sTnI levels were observed at 2 , 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after eccentric muscle damaging exercise. L evels of sTnI wer e greatest 24 hours after eccentric muscle damage and (PCSO from a study conducted by Sorichter et. al . (1997) who found that maximal values occurred 6 hours after muscle damaging exercise. This difference might be explained since the study used train ed athletes rather than the current study that used untrained subject s who are subject to the repeated bout effect. While the maximal values of stN1 are similar it is entirely possible that the subjects in the current study experienced much higher concentrations than measured at 24 hours since blood was not taken 6 hours after exercise. The data from the present study indicate s the downhill running eccentric exerc ise protocol was successful in induc ing muscle damage as evidence by appearance in the blood. There are differences among reported sTnI levels in the literature that maximal values in trained individuals appear 6 hours post exercise and can be influenced by gender and mode of exercise . For example after a downhill run S orichter (2001) noted that median values for females were much lower than for males (8.2 mg/ L; M: 22.0 mg/L) (S Sorichter et al., 2001 ). The resting baseline values of stn1 are similar to those in literature 8.7 \u00b1 3.0 sTnI which are similar to Soricther et. al. (1999). Additionally mode of exercise showed differ ing amounts of STN1 release 80 with k nee extensor exercises having a 4 fold increase compared to downhill running and it is not understood as to the reason for the increase between the two modes of exercise (D. S. Willoughby, VanEnk, & Taylor, 2003 ). Fatty acid Binding Protein An adequate supply of long -chain fatty acids for metabolism by skeletal muscle is important as fatty acids are important building blocks for membrane phospholipids which are the main substrate for energy production, especially in slow -twitch oxidative muscle fiber s and serve as signaling molecules for in flammatory processes such as arachidonic acid (Van Nieuwenhoven et al., 1995 ). During times of cellular stress , concentrations of these molecules are elevated to maintain homeostasis . FABP 3 can serve as the cytosolic equivalent of albumin in plasma by carrying fatty acids thereby increasing the overall rate of utilization inside the cell and transfer of fatty acids from the intracellular mem brane (Weisiger, 2002 ). While there are isoforms of fatty acid binding protein , FABP3 has been proposed as a n isoform for reliably monitoring ske letal muscle damage due to a high concentr ation in skeletal muscle tissue. FABP 3 expression in skeletal muscle is altered in response to physiological stimuli such as endurance training and in certain pathophysiologic al conditions, such as metabolic situations , which increase fatty acid oxidation and result in elevated FABP 3 concentrations (Pritt, e t al., 2008 ; Storch & Thumser, 2000 ). Damaged muscle cell membranes leak FABP3 into the interstitial space and capillaries. FABP3 has been shown to be a reliable and early diagnostic indirect marker of skeletal muscle damage (Pritt, et al., 2008 ). Additionally , Fabp3 had gr eater diagnostic value than when combined with other markers of muscle damage such as creatine kinase -MM (Pritt, et al., 2008 ). The present study is novel in that it assesses the effectiveness of PCSO -524 supplementation on attenuation of muscle damage which was evaluated by FABP3 after exercise induced muscle damage in humans. The present study found that there was a significant effect for time and appearance of FAB3 in the blood (F = 6.346 p < .001) suggesting that muscle damage had occurred and the effect was consistent in both groups (F = 1.582 p = .142). While no statistical 81 significant differences were observed between control and pl acebo, maximal values occurred two hours after eccentric muscle damage. Pairwise comparisons revealed that there was signific ant increase s immediately after downhill running in both groups and these results are consistent with literature suggesting that increases in plasma concentrations occur 1 -24 hours post muscle damage (Schmitt et al., 2003). However there was no difference between groups when comparing PCSO -524 to placebo groups. This may suggest that the constituents in PCSO - 524 were unable to c ontrol lipid peroxidation compared to control. The lack of observed difference between control and PCSO -524 groups might have been due to increased rates of fatty acid metabolism during exercise that can affect availability and appearance in blood. Othe r studies have paired fatty acid binding protein with other biomarkers such aspartate aminotransferase to improve diagnostic value (Pritt, et al., 2008 ). Interleukin - 6 Interleukin -6 is produced in response to working skeletal muscle and intensity and exercise duration can affect IL-6 release . Muscle -derived IL -6 is responsible for glucose homeostasis by exerting an effect on adipose tissue and the liver during exercise a nd mediating exercise induced lipolysis. Muscle -derived IL -6 also inhibit s pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor TNF-alpha that is produced by adipose tissue and inflammatory cells and play s a role in pathogenicity in diabetes and coronary artery disease . IL-6 can have many sources, including production by immune cells and the skeletal muscle itself. IL-6 stimulates the immune system and is produced by T cells and macrophages during infection and after trauma leading to inflammation (van der Poll et al., 1997 ). Additionally it has been shown that IL -6 is produced by the muscle with evidence supporting levels of other biomarkers such as creatine kinase and myoglobin w ere poorly correlated to IL-6 appearance in the blood (B. K. Pedersen, Steensberg, & Schjerling, 2001 ). It has been proposed that the large and immediate increase in IL -6 concentration in the blood in response to exhaustive exercise is independent of muscle damage, while muscle damage itself is followed by repair mechanisms which include invasion of macrophages which trigger a smaller magnitude of IL-6 release which is followed by a 82 second and much larger wave of IL -6 releas e related to muscle contractions (B. K. Peder sen, et al., 2001 ). Studies have found that antioxidant treatment with vi tamin C and vitamin E, failed to attenuate muscle damage and suggests IL-6 is not related to muscle damage and may be a horm one action used in homeostatic maintenance of injured myofibrils (Petersen et al., 2001 ). Other studies have found that exercise -induced destruction of skeletal muscle fibers may trigger local production of IL -6 after prolonged running (Ostrowski, Rohde, Zacho, Asp, & Pedersen, 1998 ). Supplementation with n -3 PUFAs protect s muscle cell membrane integrity and attenuate s inflammation by inhibiting the arachidonic acid pathway in macrophages (Machado et al., 2012 ). the present study of PCSO -524 attenuated IL-6 compared to placebo . This suggests that the muscle damaging exercise was successful in disturbing IL -6 levels from baseline. Current literature suggests that peak values for IL -6 occur between 8 and 72 hours post exercise, concurrent with this study which found significant increases in IL-6 concentrations from baseline detected between 24 and 48 hours for both placebo and treatment groups (Bruunsgaard et al., 1997 ; Phillips, Childs, Dreon, Phinney, & Leeuwenburgh, 2003 ). Other studies have found significant effects between 4 and 6 hours but no difference at 24 hours and beyond. However the protocols of muscle damage were not as robust as the one employed in this study with more severe bouts of eccentric muscle damage lead ing to larger and delayed IL -6 release (Febbraio & Pedersen, 20 02; Steensberg et al., Willoughby, McFarlin, & Bois, 2003 ). PCSO -524 reduced the appearance of IL -6 compared to placebo , with the majority of IL-6 production occurring in muscle rather than monocytes (Febbraio & Pedersen, 2002 ). This protective effect may be due to PCSO -524 forming several potent anti -inflammatory lipid mediators such as resolvins and protectins which together suppress the activi ty of nuclear transcription factors, such as NF -B, and reduce pro -inflammatory enzymes and cytokine production (Kang & Weylan dt, 2008 ). These findings were contradicted by Pumpa et. al. (2012) who found no difference between 83 placebo and treatment groups and appearance of IL -6 in plasma. It appears that training status affect s the appearance of IL -6 with trained athletes showing a much lower training response than untrained subjects (Fischer, 2006 ). Additionally , the source of the IL -6 increase must be questioned as the maximal increase in the present study is 20 times greater than the Pumpa study (52.9 pg/ml +/ - the maximal value in the present study occurred much later (48 hours) than the Pumpa study (immediately after ex ercise). This sug gests that IL-6 production in the present study was induced by the damage d muscle as the findings correlate with other studies regarding magnitude and timing of IL -6 production after eccentric exercise (Ostrowski, et al., 1998 ). TNF - alpha Measurement of TNF- following post eccentric muscle damage has been used as an indirect measurem ent of muscle damage . Measurement of TNF -provides a quantitative measure of early phases of atherosclerosis and inflammation (Tiidus, 2008 ). Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs has been shown to decrease expression of TNF -alpha and reduce the proinflammatory effects associated with muscle damage (Lenn, et al., 2002 ) however the mechanism for attenuation remain s unclear. Additionally, n-3 PUFA and PUFA analogs TNF - secretion macrophages. Activated macrophages induce transcription of COX2 genes causing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation (Wadleigh, Reddy, Kopp, Ghosh, & Herschman, 2000 ). It is postulated that in creases in the n-3 PUFA content of the macrophage membrane decrease the excitability of the macrophages attenuating the immune response by modulating eicosanoid signaling (Norris & Dennis, 2012 ). Alternatively, the antioxidants in PCSO -524 such as vitamin E and furan f atty acids minimize the formation of reactive oxygen species attenuating lipid peroxides and as a consequence tissue damage (Reznick, et al., 1998 ). TNF- was significantly increased following eccentric muscle damage in the present study with the PCSO -524 group experiencing a greater attenuation in TNF- production compared to 84 placebo . The placebo group experienced a maximal increase in TNF - 24 hours after eccentric muscle damaging exercise (65.80 +/ - 14.8) compared to PCSO -524 (46.0 +/ - 8.6). While there were no differences at baseline every point after eccentric muscle damage was greater for the control compared to PCSO -524 which suggests that PCSO -524 supplementation has a protective effect by attenuating the immune response as evidenced by a decrease in TNF- production. The levels of TNF - observed in the present study are significantly higher than levels of TNF- observed in other exercise studies . Signorello et al (2003) observed baseline values in rest ed subjects before exercise of 9.32 ng/dl +/- 2.35 ng/dl and after 5 minutes of treadmill running was 11.5 ng/dl +/- 2.45 ng/dl (Santo Signorelli et al., 2003 ). Similar ly Pumpa et al (2012) obtained values between 7 and 9 pg/ml which are significantly lower than the present study . This discrepancy may be due to the use of train ed individuals , which attenuate s TNF- release with lower levels observed in higher trained athletes (Kvernmo, Olsen, & Osterud, 1992 ). Additionally , the time course data in the present study suggests that muscle damage occurred since there was greater than a 60% increase in TNF- concentration within the first 24 hours, which can be correlated to other markers of muscle damage (Mackinnon, 1999 ). This effect was not observed in the Pumpa study with the concentration of TNF- peaking immediately post exercise suggesting that the eccentric exercise was not severe enough. To overcome these obstacles, the present study used a much steeper incline that has been shown to induce muscle damage. Second, the use of untrained subjects in the present stud y helped maximize the treatment effect of downhill running since trained runners muscles are more difficult to damage due to the repeated bout effect (McHugh, 2003 ). 8 - Hydroxyguanosine Both DNA damage and inflammation have been observed after exhaustive exercise suggesting that exercise -induced DNA damage might either be a consequence of inflammatory processes or involved in inflammation and immunological alterations after strenuous prol onged exercise. It 85 appears that reactive oxygen species appear to be effectors which link inflammation with DNA damage. DNA damage has been shown to be present after endurance events lasting over 4 hours such as ultramarathons and marathons (Umegaki, Da ohua, Sugisawa, Kimura, & Higuchi, 2000) (Gomez - Cabrera et al., 2006) (Gomez -Cabrera, et al., 2006 ; Mastaloudis, et al., 2004 ). Studies investigating DNA damage after short duration submaximal and maximal test s in the laboratory have shown no DNA damage (Neubauer, Reichhold, Nersesyan, Konig, & Wagner, 2008 ). For example, DNA damage was not observed after intense treadmill running in either moderately or well trained athletes (Peters, Van Eden, Tyler, Ramautar, & Chuturgoon, 2006 ; K Umegaki, Higuchi, Inoue, & Esashi, 1998 ). Further Sato et al. (2003 ) showed that moderate exercise does not result in DNA dam age measured by 8 -OHdG (Sato, Nanri, Ohta, Kasai, & Ikeda, 2003 ). Researchers using a similar method of inducing muscle damage in the present study using eccentric exercise by do wnhill running at -16% for 45 minutes found that while subjects experienced similar increases in serum biomarkers indicative of muscle damage 8 -OHdG serum levels were unaffected by exercise (Sacheck, Milbury, Cannon, Roubenoff, & Blumberg, 2003). The lack of damage associated with exercise depends on the balanced between oxidant producing mechanisms such as increases in aerobic metabolism and the rate of free radical removal by antioxidant systems (Jacob & Burri, 1996 ). In exercise lasting up to 40 minutes consumption of antioxidant levels in a typical athlete's diet provide s sufficient protection against the effects of free radical production without additional supplementation of antioxidants or n-3 PUFAs. Therefore , we can assume in the present study subjects were properly protected from DNA damage by their current diets (Watso n et al., 2005 ). The lack of change in 8 -OHdG post muscle damaging exercise in the current study is consistent with literature finding no significant changes in DNA damage after short bouts of exercise. There was not a significant effect of time on 8 -OHdG concentration in the blood (F = 1.018 p .419), the lack of interaction between time and treatm ent suggests that thi s effect is consistent between 86 placebo and PCSO -524 groups (F = 1.005 p = .429). Finally the test of between -subjects effects indicates there is no significant effect of supplementation status on 8 -OHdG appearance in the blood ( F = 3 .250 p = .081) which suggest s the supplement had no effect on DNA damage after exercise. Troponin - 1 (Cardiac) Heart troponins such as cTn1 are used as specific markers to detect damage to myocardial tissue. Since creatine kinase, fatty acid binding pro tein and myoglobin are also found in cardiac muscle they have been used as indicators of muscle damage following myocardial infarction . In order to rule out cardiac tissue as a source of these proteins in the current study , there must be no significant increase following muscle -damaging exercise otherwise any increase in these proteins cannot be attributed to skeletal muscle alone. In the present study, there was no significant effect of time on cTn1 concentration in the blood (F = .420 p = .889). Additionally the lack of interaction between time and treatment suggests that this effect is consistent between p lacebo and PCSO -524 groups (F = .381 p = .912), finally the test of between -subjects effects indicates there is no effect of supplementation status on cTn1 appearance in the blood (F = 2.220 p = .148). Established literature suggests that cardiac muscle damage occurs when levels of cTN1 are above 10 m/L (Hedstr\u00f6m et al., 2007 ). Since all values for all subjects are under this level for all tim e points, it can be assumed any increases in muscle intracellular proteins can be attributed to disruption of skeletal muscle fibers and not cardiac muscle. Future directions The present study demonstrated that supplementation of PCSO -524 attenuated -MM, and IL -6 and attenuated loss of range of motion and enhanced maximal voluntary contraction post muscle damaging exercise . Further research could look into inducing muscle damage to a greater extent by having subjects run at a steeper grade or run for a longer duration. Additionally, it might be helpful to look at the protective effect that PCSO -524 can play in strength train ing rather than endurance training. 87 Conclusion In conclusion, the present study has shown that a lipid extract known as PCSO -524 attenuates skeletal muscle damage in untrained men as measured by indirect biochemical measures of muscle damage such as sTN1 , CK-MM, TNF -alpha and myoglobin , range and enhanced maximal force production from baseline . This study supports data from other studies (Tartiban et. al (2009) and Bloomer et. al (2009 ) that chronic n-3 PUFA supplementation provides a protective effect against EIMD following eccentric exercis e in untrained males (R.
