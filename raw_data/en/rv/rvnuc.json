Even if there's no scientific evidence to back up their alleged powers, there is, at the very least, [scientific evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/22/placebo-effect-patients-sham-drug) to support the power of the placebo effect and so we can think of worse things than an addiction to crystals. (Also, if they're good enough for [Adele, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Campbell](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/25-famous-people-on-crystals.html), they're good enough for us.) As we've been collecting these stones without any idea of what we're meant to do with them, we asked Heather Askinosie, crystal healer & co-founder of [Energy Muse](https://www.energymuse.com/), to help us out. Here, four crystal-based rituals that will help attract love, abundance and good health into your life as we head into the new year. 4 Crystal Rituals For Love, Money & Health To Attract Love Crystal: [Rose Quartz](https://www.energymuse.com/rose-quartz-stone.html) and [Aventurine](https://www.energymuse.com/aventurine-stones.html) Crystal Meaning: Rose Quartz is a gemstone of unconditional love that opens your heart to every type of love. Aventurine aids in the manifestation of love by stimulating the flow of energy through your heart chakra Affirmation: I am love and I attract and receive the love I am looking for. Ritual: 1. Collect a Rose Quartz stone and a Aventurine stone 2. These two crystals balance the feminine and masculine energies in two people and should be placed on your night stand. 3. When you go to bed each night, hold your two crystals over your heart and close your eyes 4. State your affirmation and feel the energy of two people. Those two people being you and your new found love. Visualize it. 5. Repeat this ritual every night. To Increase Self-Love Crystal: Picture Jasper and [Pink Opal](https://www.energymuse.com/pink-opal-stone.html) Crystal Meaning: Picture Jasper is a nurturing and protective stone. Pink Opal is powerful crystal for emotional healing and promotes compassion. Affirmation: I love myself unconditionally. Ritual: 1. Collect a Picture Jasper crystal and a Pink Opal crystal. 2. Hold your stones in your hands and stand in front of a mirror. 3. Look at yourself directly in the eyes and state one characteristic you love about yourself - I love my smile, I love my crazy eyebrows, I love my freckles etc. 4. Keep your crystals by a mirror and repeat this simple ritual everyday. Nurture yourself with a compliment and train yourself to see the beauty you hold. To Attract Abundance Crystal: [Citrine](https://www.energymuse.com/citrine-stone.html) Crystal Meaning: Citrine helps you acquire prosperity, wealth and abundance Affirmation: I am abundant in all aspects of my life. Ritual: 1. Collect two Citrine tumbled stones. 2. Hold them in your hands, close your eyes and state your intention. 3. Carry one gem in your purse/wallet 4. Place one on top of a symbol of what you would like to attract into your life. For example, if you would like to manifest more money into your company, place the Citrine on top of your business cards. Or, if you would like to manifest a new home, place your Citrine on top of a picture of the home. Your Citrine crystals are your touch-stones. They hold the energy of your intention for you. 5. Every now and then, touch your crystals, feel the energy within them and remind yourself of your intention. To Improve Health Crystal: [Amethyst](https://www.energymuse.com/amethy-stones-1402.html) & Blue Lace Agate Crystal Meaning: Amethyst is a natural stress reliever that also encourages inner strength, spirituality and intuition.

As you get ready for sleep, lay down on your bed and place the Amethyst stone on your Third Eye Chakra (the place in-between your brows) and the Blue Lace Agate right above it 3. Close you eyes and ask your internal self, \"What do I need to do to have optimal health? What do I need to know?\" 4. Quiet the mind and listen to your intuition. 5. Take action the next morning on what it is you heard your intuition say "}
