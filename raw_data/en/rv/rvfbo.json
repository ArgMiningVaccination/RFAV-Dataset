Two interventions with a substantial evidence-base are Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) and Tai chi/Qigong (TCQ). However, these interventions have never been directly compared. Objectives: (1) To compare MBCR and TCQ to each other and a waitlist control condition using an innovative, randomized, preference-based comparative effectiveness trial (CET) design that takes into account potential moderating factors that might predict differential response. (2) To investigate the impacts of MBCR and TCQ on a range of biological outcomes including immune processes, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress hormones, cellular aging, and gene expression. Methods: The study design is a preference-based multi-site randomized CET incorporating two Canadian sites (Calgary, AB and Toronto, ON). Participants (N total = 600). Participants with a preference for either MBCR or TCQ will get their preferred intervention; while those without a preference will be randomized into either of the two interventions. Within the preference and non-preference groups, participants will also be randomized into immediate intervention groups or a wait-list control. Outcome measures to be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 6-month follow up include psychological outcomes (mood, stress, mindfulness, spirituality, post-traumatic growth), QOL, symptoms (fatigue, sleep), physical function (strength, endurance), and exploratory analyses of biomarkers (cortisol slopes, cytokines, blood pressure/heart rate variability, telomere length, gene expression), and health economic measures. Hypotheses: The investigators theorize that both MBCR and TCQ will improve outcomes amongst survivors relative to treatment as usual, particularly if patients have a strong preference for a particular intervention. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that MBCR may be superior to TCQ on measures related to stress and mood. Conversely, TCQ may be superior to MBCR in improvement of physical and functional measures. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |Cancer||Behavioral: Mindfulness Based Cancer for Cancer Health A Preference-Based Multi-Site Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial (CET) of Mindfulness-Based Cancer (MBCR) vs. Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ) in |Actual Study Date |Actual Primary Date :||December | Experimental: Preference: MBCR (im) | with a preference for 'Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR)' randomized to immediate treatment | Behavioral: Mindfulness Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) | Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is a standardized group program which focuses primarily on the challenges faced by people living with cancer. It is an 8-week program consisting of weekly group meetings of 1.5 to 2 hours. Home practice of 45 minutes per day (15 min yoga; 30 min meditation) is prescribed. As the weeks progress, different forms of meditation are introduced, beginning with a body scan sensory awareness experience, progressing to sitting and walking meditations. Gentle Hatha yoga is incorporated throughout, as a form of moving meditation.

Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Several components of sleep quality are assessed including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Higher scores on the PSQI indicate worse sleep quality. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Brief Pain Inventory [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]The BPI allows participants to rate their pain along dimensions of pain severity and how much their pain interferes with daily experiences and functioning. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue (FACT-F) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]The FACT-f allows participants to report how fatigue impacts function along the dimensions of physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional-wellbeing, functional well-being, and fatigue. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - POMS - Subscale scores (6) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]The Profile of Mood States (POMS): Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Vigor, Fatigue and Confusion, which will be summed to generate a Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score (primary outcome). The POMS has been widely used in clinical populations, including cancer patients. We will examine each of the subscales as well to determine the relative magnitude of changes. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Symptoms of Stress Inventory (C-SOSI-32) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Measures physical, psychological and behavioural responses to stressful situations. There are eight subscales entitled Depression, Anger, Muscle Tension, Sympathetic Arousal, Cardiopulmonary Arousal, Cognitive Disorganization, Neurological/GI and Upper Respiratory. A Total Stress Symptom score will be calculated by summing all the items. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]A general cancer quality of life measure including subscales for Physical Well-Being, Social Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being and a Breast Cancer Symptom subscale, as well as the Total QL score will be used to assess overall quality of life. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness therapy-Spiritual Well-being (FACIT-sp) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]A 12-item questionnaire designed for people with cancer or other chronic illnesses. Subscales include Meaning, Peace and Faith, but can be summed to a Total Score. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory-Revised (PTGI-R) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Measures an individual's perception of positive changes following a traumatic life experience. Subscales include Relating to Others, New Possibilities, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change and Appreciation of Life, which are summed to form the Total Score. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Average Diurnal Cortisol Slope [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Measure of adrenal function and stress hormones. At each assessment, saliva will be collected 4 times across the day (waking, 12:00, 17:00 and bedtime) over 3 days so that circadian fluctuations in salivary cortisol can be assessed through the calculation of an average diurnal slope of the line. Abnormal slopes are associated with disease stages and cancer progression. Abnormal slopes associated with disease stages and cancer progression. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess changes in slopes over time. - Telomere length (TL) & Telomerase [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]TL is a marker of cell aging associated with cancer risk and disease progression. TL will be measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in triplicate. A T/S ratio is calculated that compares the TL in cells to a pooled reference sample. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Heart Rate (HR)/Heart Rate Variability (HRV) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]HRV is a measure of the degree of variability between heart beats which reflects parasympathetic influence on the cardiac pacemaker by way of the tenth cranial nerve. Both low HRV and higher heart rate are predictors of shorter survival in metastatic breast cancer and are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Blood Pressure [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Elevated BP is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; many forms of chemotherapy and RT to the chest wall can damage the heart muscle and make cancer patients more vulnerable to heart disease after cancer treatment. Therefore it's important to monitor cardiovascular risk factors. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Timed Up and Go Test [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Subjects are given verbal instruction to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back, and sit down. The average time (sec) of 3 trials will be recorded. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Maximal Walking Speed [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Participants walk in a straight line as fast as possible, without running, on a premeasured 11 meter course. The time taken to walk 5 meters, from the 3 meter to 8 meter mark is used to calculate maximal walking speed (meters/second). Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Maximum Grip Strength [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]The dominant hand will be measured using a hand-grip dynamometer. Measurements are recorded to the nearest 0.5 kg, repeated three times and averaged. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Single Leg Standing [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Three 30 sec trials are completed for eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, and the greatest duration (sec) for each condition is used for analysis. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Cytokine Production [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Luminex multiplex assays, basic 48 cytokines (includes inflammatory and regulatory cytokines and chemokines) A range IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, which have a variety of important inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions in cancer will be examined. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess change over time. - Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Assesses the impacts of these interventions on health care costs and utilization. - EQ-5D-5L [ Time Frame: pre-intervention, within 3 weeks of completion of the intervention, 6-month follow up from intervention completion ]Evaluates the impact of the intervention on health and other medical interventions across time.
