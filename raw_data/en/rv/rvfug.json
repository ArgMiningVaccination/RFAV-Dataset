[Ibuprofen](https://www.drugs.com/monograph/ibuprofen.html) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation caused by many conditions such as [headache](/cg/acute-headache.html), [toothache](/cg/dental-cavities.html), [back pain](/cg/back-pain.html), arthritis, menstrual cramps, or minor injury.

These conditions can occur without warning while you are using this medicine, especially in older adults. Do not take more than your recommended dose. An ibuprofen overdose can damage your stomach or intestines. Use only the smallest amount of medication needed to get relief from your pain, swelling, or fever. Before taking this medicine You should not use ibuprofen if you are allergic to it, or if you have ever had an [asthma](/cg/asthma.html) attack or severe allergic reaction after taking [aspirin](/aspirin.html) or an NSAID.

Taking an NSAID during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy can cause serious heart or kidney problems in the unborn baby and possible complications with your pregnancy. Do not give ibuprofen to a child younger than 6 months old without the advice of a doctor. How should I take ibuprofen? Use ibuprofen exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition.
