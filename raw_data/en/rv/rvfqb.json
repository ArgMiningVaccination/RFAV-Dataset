Rogier Hoenders, progress in treatment options in the last century, the results of pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia are frequently unsatisfactory. Therefore some patients use natural medicines, although it is unclear whether natural medicines are effective and safe. We assessed the evidence for natural medicines with and without antipsychotics in treating symptoms or reducing side effects of antipsychotics in schizophrenia. Method: A systematic review until April 2013. Only RCTs with a Jadad score of 3 or higher were included. Results: 105 RCTs were identified. Evidence was found for glycine, sarcosine, NAC, some Chinese and ayurvedic herbs, ginkgo biloba, estradiol and vitamin B6 for improving symptoms of schizophrenia when added to antipsychotics (glycine not when added to clozapine). Inconclusive or no evidence was found for omega-3 fatty acids, D-serine, fatty acids without antipsychotics might be beneficial in the prevention of schizophrenia. In one large study, ayurvedic herbs seemed effective without antipsychotics. Other agents without antipsychotics (vitamin B3, vitamin C, sarcosine, glycine, Protilerin) were not effective or had only been tested in single or small trials. Ginkgo and vitamin B6 seemed to be effective in reducing side effects of antipsychotics (tardive dyskinesia and akathisia). The evidence for reducing side of antipsychotics by omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin and DHEA appeared to be inconclusive. All natural agents produced only mild or no side effects. Conclusion: High-quality research on natural medicines for schizophrenia is scarce. However, there is emerging evidence for improved outcome for glycine, sarcosine, NAC, some Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs, ginkgo biloba, estradiol and vitamin B6, all with only mild or no side effects. Most study samples are small, the study periods are generally short, the studies only cover a modest part of the world's population and most results much progress in treatment options in the last century, the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders is often unsatisfactory as expressed in long-lasting positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms and problems in social and occupational functioning. Psychotic symptoms are often only partially resolved (Rummel-Kluge, 2010), and especially cognitive and negative symptoms seem refractory to present pharmacological options (Buckley & Stahl, 2007). Newer (second-generation) antipsychotics are in general equally effective as first-generation antipsychotics in treating positive symptoms, the promise of greater efficacy against negative symptoms of newer antipsychotics has not been fulfilled (Leucht et al., 2012). Many patients continue to suffer persistent symptoms and symptom relapses during treatment with antipsychotics, particularly when they fail to adhere to prescribed medications (Van Os & Kapur, 2009). Besides, patients often experience undesired treatment (side) effects, most commonly weight gain, sexual dysfunction, glycaemic and lipid dysfunction, extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS) and sedation (Stahl, 2008). As a result, many patients with psychotic disorders use non-conventional medicines or treatments in the hope of decreasing undesired treatment effects or in search for a more successful recovery. Nonconventional medicine includes lifestyle changes, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (Hoenders et al., 2013). Complementary medicine comprises forms of diagnostics, treatments and prevention strategies that are based on theories accepted in biomedicine and are substantiated by some scientific evidence (two or more RCTs), but for various reasons - cultural or practical - do not form part of biomedicine (Hoenders et al., 2011). Alternative medicine comprises forms of diagnostics, treatments and prevention strategies that make use of other than the basic concepts of biomedicine. Sofar, there is little proof for the efficacy of the latter treatments and / or there is considerable controversy about the scientific validation (Lake, 2007). Part of complementary medicine refers to natural medicine: using only agents that are produced by a living organism (plant, tree, seed, vegetable, fruit, animal, human), instead of non-natural (i.e. chemical) agents: agents that cannot be found in nature and that can only be obtained from laboratory experiments (Porter, 1998). Some patients prefer natural medicines as they assume that natural is better than chemical and causes fewer side effects. This is obviously not (always) true as the natural environment contains agents that can be toxic to humans and it is the molecular structure and dosage of a substance rather than its source that determines its effect on human health (Topliss et al., 2002). Besides, herbal medicines can cause undesired effects including interactions with prescription medication (Ernst, 2003a). Hazra et al. (2010) reported a lifetime and one-year prevalence rate of CAM use of 88% and 68% respectively in Canadian psychotic outpatients. A major difficulty these patients encounter is the heterogeneity in treatment options with CAM, ranging from possibly interesting agents to useless, or even dangerous, ones (Ernst, 2003a). For instance, the concomitant use of antipsychotics and Chinese herbs has been found to induce significantly improved clinical outcomes compared to only antipsychotics. However, a small but significant number of patients treated concomitantly with Chinese herbs have a greater risk of developing worse outcomes (Zhang, 2011). In recent years the preferences and views of patients have received more attention in making choices in treatment (e.g. shared decision making (Elwyn The introduction of patient's choice in deciding which antipsychotic to choose has been proposed (Morrison et al., 2012). However, it is difficult for both patients and doctors to make informed decisions, in the absence of reliable information on the emerging evidence for CAM or natural medicine. Considering its high usage in psychotic patients, there is an urgent need for objective information. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of evidence for the efficacy and safety of most used and most studied natural medicines for symptoms of schizophrenia or other psychotics disorders, or for side effects of antipsychotics. As the majority of psychosis is related to schizophrenia, in this paper we will use 'schizophrenia' to refer to all forms of psychosis. Method Literature search and study selection Studies were identified by a literature search in Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane, through April 2013. The search terms (MeSH Thesaurus and free search terms) used were: schizophrenia, psychosis, psychoses, psychotic (disorder), schizophreniform AND (R)CT, review AND complementary medicines, herbs, vitamins, supplements (search terms, in alphabetical order: ascorbic acid, Ayurveda, brahmyadiyoga, vitamin B3, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc). We used search terms for the most used and most researched agents. A total of 1204 hits (abstracts) were retrieved after systematic deduplication (table 1). Table 1. Sources of literature retrieval and in cluded number of studies before and after duplicate findings were removed. Database Trials Reviews Total Medline 432 541 973 Cinahl 55 16 71 PsycINFO 200 97 297 Cochrane 166 15 181 Total 853 669 1522 Total deduplicated 1204 Next, abstracts about the following topics were included: (i) effects of natural medicines on schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms, (ii) effects of natural medicines for side effects of antipsychotics, (iii) effects of natural medicines in the prevention of the development of psychotic disorders. Exclusion criteria were: (i) non-randomized (controlled) trials, (ii) studies that explore the effects of natural medicines (i.e. mechanism studies), (iii) animal studies, (iv) other disorders or no disorder, (v) conference abstracts, (vi) book chapters, (vii) clinical trial registrations, (viii) comments, addenda, corrigenda and letters, (ix) papers in non-English languages (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, German and Spanish), and (x) duplicate hits which had not been removed systematically. Second, two co-authors whether papers - based on the abstracts - should (possibly) be included or not. Consultation followed about dubious cases and in case of discordance. Thereupon, 386 studies remained of which the full papers were retrieved and studied. Of these, another 151 were excluded (81 were not a RCT and 70 for different reasons). A flow chart of the study selection is presented in Fig. 1. We found 122 reviews and checked whether we had included the RCTs in their reference lists that matched our inclusion criteria. We added 8 RCTs with a Jadad score of 3 or higher that were not found through our original search. 16 RCTs were excluded because of a Jadad score less than 3. Finally, 105 randomized controlled trials were included. The reviews are not shown in our results table, but their conclusions will be contrasted to our results in the discussion section. Risk of bias assessment Two assessors (co-authors AABV and NKV) independently rated the methodological quality of the RCTs found in our original search and those found by checking the reference lists of the reviews. We used the Jadad scale for reporting randomized controlled trials (Jadad et al., 1996). This scale consists of three questions about the methodological quality: whether the study is described as (i) randomized, (ii) double- blind, and (iii) whether (non-) completers are adequately described. The first two questions are each followed by two sub-questions, for which either one point extra may be gained or lost, the total score of the risk of bias assessment thus amounting to a maximum of 5 points (see table 2). RCTs scoring 3 points or higher were included in the study, under the condition that the three main questions were assigned 1 point each. Interrater agreement on the Jadad scores between the assessors before consensus discussion amounted to 0.80. Besides, HJRH independently rated a random selection of 17 papers (15%) from the selected RCTs. Interrater agreement of all three authors was 0.71. Any disagreements between the assessors on the Jadad scoring were resolved through consensus discussion between these three authors. The 105 RCTs exceeding the consensus Jadad score of 3 were included for the current review and are presented in table 3. Based on the hypothesized mechanism, they were divided in six groups: omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, eastern herbs, glutamate agonists, antioxidants, and 'other substances'. For each of the 105 studies that fulfilled the previously mentioned selection criteria the following assessments were made: which natural agent was used; was this combined with antipsychotics, and if yes, which antipsychotics and what dosage; the effect of the natural agent on negative, positive, cognitive, depressive and general symptoms and on side effects of antipsychotics; possible adverse side effects of the natural agent; number of participants in the study; control group characteristics; number of drop-outs; study duration; Jadad for assessing the quality of ra ndomized controlled trials as expressed by a score from 0 (low quality) to 5 (high quality) (Jadad et al., 1996). Item Description Scoring Randomization Was the study described as randomized (this includes the use of words such as randomly, random, and randomization)? 1 point Was the method to generate the sequence of randomization described and appropriate (table of random numbers, computer generated, etc)? + 1 point Was the method to generate the sequence of randomization described inappropriate (patients were allocated alternately, or according to date of birth, hospital number, etc.)? - 1 point Blinding Was the study described as double blind? 1 point Was the method of double blinding described and was it appropriate (identical placebo, active placebo, dummy, etc.)? + 1 point Was the study described as doubl e blind but the method of blinding was inappropriate (e.g., comparison of tablet vs. injection with no double dummy)? - 1 point An account of all patients Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? 1 point Results A total of 105 RCTs on the effectiveness of natural medicines for schizophrenia that matched our inclusion criteria were identified (see Fig. 1). Based on the hypothesized mechanism, these RCTs were divided into six groups (Table 3). (i) Omega-3 fatty acids Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential for brain functioning (Tsalamanios et al., 2006). They have multiple important biological roles, including membrane functioning, neurotransmission, signal transduction, and eicosanoid synthesis. A growing body of research suggests that PUFA level reduction is related to schizophrenia (Berger et al., 2006). Concordant with these findings, omega-3 PUFA may have positive effects in the treatment and prevention of schizophrenia (Peet, 2008; Emsly et al., 2003; Freeman et al., 2006; Amminger et al., 2010). Ten RCTs were included (table 3). In studies combining antipsychotics with omega-3 PUFA, one (out of seven) studies on negative symptoms in schizophrenia found some positive effect (in patients using clozapine), three (out of seven) found some positive effect on positive symptoms, one (out of three) on cognitive symptoms, none (out of three) on depressive symptoms, and five (out of nine) on general functioning. Two (out of two) studies on omega-3 PUFA without antipsychotics reported a decrease of positive symptoms, and one of these reported less use of antipsychotics in the second phase of the trial compared to the control group. Three (out of six) reported less side effects of antipsychotics (EPS and or dyskinesia). Two studies reported less use of antipsychotics in the omega-3 PUFA group. Some non- severe side effects of omega-3 PUFA were reported, such as mild gastrointestinal problems and increased bleeding time. (ii) Glutamate Besides dopamine, glutamate is thought to play a role in schizophrenia (Tsai & Lin, 2010). Based on the hypothesis that the glutamatergic system may ( NMDA) receptor modulators may compensate for alterations in the glutamate system (Singh & Singh, 2011). Agents with co-agonistic properties (glutaminergic) source of glycine). The glycine transporter-1 (GlyT-1) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the concentration of glycine within synapses at a sub-saturating level. Sarcosine is a GlyT-1 inhibitor meaning that the presence of sarcosine results in increased glycine concentrations. Lower cerebral glycine levels are suggested to be found in patients with schizophrenia. The administration of sarcosine is therefore proposed to relief symptoms of schizophrenia when added to non-clozapine antipsychotics (Lane et al., 2006). Whereas the mechanisms of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are only beginning to be understood, it is likely that NAC is exerting benefits beyond being a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, also modulating glutamatergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways (Dean et al., 2011). We included ten RCTs on glycine, six on D-serine, nine on D-cycloserine, one on D-alanine, five on sarcosine and two on NAC. Glycine improved negative symptoms when combined with antipsychotics in six (out of seven) studies, but not when combined with clozapine (two studies). Positive symptoms improved in one study, worsened in another (with clozapine) and did not change in six (out of eight) studies; cognitive improvement was shown in four, and no change in two (out of six) studies; depressive symptoms diminished in five (out of five) studies; general improvement was shown in four (out of nine) studies. One (out of one) small study (N=8) on glycine suggested improvement of negative as well as positive, depressive and general symptoms when provided without concomitant antipsychotic drugs. No severe side effects of glycine were reported, except some mild gastrointestinal complaints. D-serine was shown to improve positive, negative, cognitive and general symptoms in two (out of six) studies when added to antipsychotics. The three largest - most recent - studies with highest Jadad score did not show a significant effect of D- serine on any symptom. In five out of six studies D-serine did not improve side effects of antipsychotics. Insomnia, weight gain, palpitations and other side effects of D- serine were reported. D-cycloserine showed an improvement of negative symptoms in three (out of eight) studies when added to antipsychotics; some improvement of positive symptoms in one and worsening in another study (out of seven); little or no effect on cognitive, depressive or general symptoms and no improvement of side effects of antipsychotics was shown. Five (out of five) studies found no improvement of side effects of antipsychotics. No studies were reported on D-cycloserine without antipsychotics. No side effects of D-cycloserine were reported. The only study on D-alanine reported positive effects when added to antipsychotics on negative, positive, cognitive and general symptoms, but no effect on depressive symptoms. No effect on side effects of antipsychotics, was found. Side effects of D-alanine (insomnia and nausea) were reported. All three studies combining sarcosine with antipsychotics (not clozapine) found positive effects on almost all symptom domains. When combined with clozapine (two studies) no treatment effects were found. Also when given without antipsychotics (one study), sarcosine did not improve symptoms. Sarcosine four out of four studies. Adverse effects of sarcosine included weight gain, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, and sedation. One large study (N=140) on NAC added to antipsychotics reported improved positive symptoms but no improvement of negative cognitive or general symptoms and no improvement of side effects of antipsychotics, whereas one small study (N=9) found some improvement of cognitive symptoms. No adverse effects were reported. (iii) Eastern (Chinese and Ayurvedic) herbs Eastern herbs are provided in the context of treatment with complete systems of medicine that evolved over thousands of years, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda. These treatments consist of a treatment including herbal compounds, massage, diet, acupuncture and the regulation of lifestyle (Clifford, 2003; Kaptchuck, 2000). Most clinical studies have been performed on acupuncture (outside the scope of this review) and on the herbal compounds of these medical systems. Many studies on these eastern herbs were found, but only five got a Jadad score of 3 or higher. One old study (1956) on resperpine found 'clinical improvement' after 11 weeks compared to placebo, in 80 patients not treated with antipsychotics, but with electroconvulsice therapy (ECT). Several side effects were edema, diarrhea, epigastric pain, salivating, pseudo- Parkisonian state, severe headaches, deep pains in limbs. Three (out of four) more recent studies found significant effects on general functioning of adding Ayurvedic herbs (bacopa monnieri and nardostachys jatamansi; one study) or Chinese herbs (mixture of 13 Chinese herbs; 2 studies) to antipsychotics. The Ayurvedic herbs were compared to 10 mg of olanzapine in a 76 weeks non-inferiority study including 200 patients. It found no statistically significant difference between both groups looking at improvement of positive, negative and general symptoms. The Ayurvedic group developed less weight gain. Two large studies by Chen (2008, N=200; 2009, N=120) on a mixture of 13 Chinese herbs found improvement of general functioning (both studies) and cognitive and depressive symptoms (in one of two studies) when added to risperidone (max 8 mg/day). One study (Xiao et al., 2011) found no effect of Chinese herb sarsasapogenin compared to placebo when added to risperidone on positive, negative, cognitive or general symptoms in 90 patients during 8 weeks. Many different non-severe adverse effects were reported (e.g. gastrointestinal, drowsiness and insomnia). (iv) B vitamins In his paper in Science, Nobel laureate Linus Pauling proposed a way of understanding and treating psychiatric disorders by correcting malfunctions in the body's chemistry, calling this approach 'orthomolecular psychiatry' (Pauling, 1968). His idea was partly built on studies by Osmond (1962) and Hoffer (1963; 1964) reporting good results when treating patients with schizophrenia with large doses of vitamins, especially vitamin B3. Hoffer published two more positive results with B vitamins (Hoffer, 1971; Hoffer, 1972). However, attempts to replicate his findings seem to have failed (Wittkopp, 1972; Ban, 1975). The contradicting findings may be explained since vitamine B is suggested to be only effective in early psychosis and not in chronic schizophrenia (Hoffer, 1965). One of the proposed mechanisms is abnormal one-carbon metabolism due to vitamin deficiencies (Hoffer, 2008). Variable levels of components of one-carbon metabolism (folic acid and vitamin B12) and consequently altered in medicated patients as well as medication-na\u00efve first- episode psychotic patients (Kale et al., 2009). Folate status in patients with schizophrenia correlates inversely with negative symptoms (Goff et al., 2004). We found 20 RCTs on B vitamins added to antipsychotics including one on B3 without antipsychotics. B1 showed some effect on general functioning in one study and on positive and negative symptoms in another. B3 showed improved general functioning in three (out of nine) studies. B6 improved general functioning in four (out of five) studies. In one study general functioning improved after administration of B9. One study reported no effect of B11. Another study showed a positive effect of combined B6, B9 and B12 on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. B6 improved extra-pyramidal side effects of drugs (tardive dyskinesia (TD) and neuroleptic induced akathisia (NIA)) in four (out of four) studies. In one study on B3 in 57 children without antipsychotics, cognition and general functioning did not improve after six months. Most B vitamins induced modest side effects, especially skin flushing and abnormal liver function induced by vitamin B3 and B6. (v) Antioxidants Oxygen is essential in life, but it also generates reactive molecules (called free radicals) throughout the body. These free radicals are potentially harmful as they can damage essential molecules such as DNA and the enzymes necessary for proper functioning of cells. Antioxidants may capture these reactive free radicals and convert them back to less reactive forms of the molecules (Singh et al., 2010). There is a growing body of evidence that oxidative damage (maybe due to defective enzyme systems) may contribute to the course and outcome of schizophrenia ( Mahadik & Mukherjee, 1996; Fendri et al., 2006; Mahadik, Evans & Lal, 2001) and is already present in patients with first episode psychosis (Flatow et al., 2013). Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an antioxidant vitamin and plays an important role in protecting free radical-induced damage in the body. It is present in brain tissue and dopamine-dominant areas in higher concentrations compared to other organs (Harrison & May, 2009). Ginkgo biloba, an extract of the leaves of the ginkgo biloba tree) is also suggested to have antioxidant properties (Maclennan et al., 2002) and has been found to improve brain circulation at the microvascular level (Kubota et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2008), therefore it might improve outcome in schizophrenia. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics is associated with a variety of movement disorders, including tardive dyskinesia (TD). Both dopamine-receptor super-sensitivity and oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity in the nigrostriatal system are suggested to be involved in its pathogenesis (Kulkarni & Naidu, 2003). The pineal hormone melatonin is potent antioxidant and attenuates dopaminergic activity in the striatum and dopamine release from the hypothalamus (Shamir, 2001). Thus, treatment with antioxidative agents may have a beneficial effect for both treatment of psychotic symptoms as well as prevention of TD. Vitamin E has been suggested for TD because it is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that decreases free radical formation (Herrera, 2001). We found 2 RCTs on vitamin C: one found improved general functioning and reduced side effects (reduced serum malondialdehyde (MDA); a lipid peroxidation product) when added to olanzapine (10 mg), quetiapine (200 mg) or ziprasidone (40 mg) after 8 weeks. One study without antipsychotics found no effect on cognition or motor functioning after 10 days. Both studies reported no side effects of vitamin C. Three out of four studies on ginkgo biloba found improved positive general functioning, four out of four no improvement of negative symptoms when added to antipsychotics. All four improved side effects of antipsychotics (behavioral toxicity, symtoms of nervous system, TD). No side effects of ginkgo were reported. One study of melatonin for tardive dyskinesia reported a decrease of TD and no side effects. Six (out of twelve) studies on vitamin E for reducing extra-pyramidal symptoms, while using antipsychotics, showed a decrease of TD (5 studies) and EPS (1 study), those with shorter duration of TD seemed to improve more; no side effects of vitamin E were reported, except mild diarrhea in two studies. Five (out of five) reported no effect on general functioning. (vi) Other substances Agents that did not fit in the five categories mentioned above were classified in this residual category. Sixteen high-quality RCTs have been five) studies on DHEA added to antipsychotics, showed improvement of negative symptoms, one (out of three) on positive symptoms, one (out of two) on cognition, two (out of three) on depression and one (out of three) on general functioning. Two (out of four) improved side effects of drugs. One (out of one) small study (N=12) on protilerin (thyrotropin releasing hormone) found improved general functioning. Three (out of three) studies on estradiol found improved general functioning, two (out of three) improved positive symptoms, one out of one improved cognition and none (out of three) improved negative symptoms. One (out of one) small study (N=14) on inositol found no effect on positive or negative symptoms. Two (out of two) studies on GHB found no general improvement. One (out of one) very small (N=6) study on des-tyr-gamma-endorphin found improvement on general and positive symptoms. No serious side effects induced by any of these agents were reported. Discussion This review suggests emerging evidence for the beneficial effects of various natural medicines for schizophrenia. Glycine, sarcosine, NAC, some Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs, ginkgo biloba, estradiol and vitamin B6 seem effective for symptoms of schizophrenia when added to antipsychotics (glycine not when added to clozapine). We found inconclusive or absent evidence for omega-3 fatty acids, D-serine, D- alanine, des-tyr-gamma-endorphin when added to antipsychotics. Omega-3 without antipsychotics might be beneficial in the prevention of schizophrenia. Reserpine without antipsychotics seemed effective in one old study. Ayurvedic herbs were reported to be as effective as olanzapine in a recent large study. Other agents as monotherapy (vitamin B3, vitamin C, sarcosine, glycine, protilerin) do not seem effective or have only been tested in single or small trials. For alleviation of side effects, ginkgo and vitamin B6 seem effective for TD and NIA. The evidence for diminishing some side effects of antipsychotics by omega-3, melatonin and DHEA is (still) inconclusive. With regard to the safety of natural compounds, all those were found to produce only mild or no side effects. However, most study samples were small, duration was generally short and studies were not designed or powered to identify side effects. They only covered a modest part of the globe's need replication. There is promising but inconclusive evidence for improved outcome by omega-3 fatty acids combined with antipsychotics in schizophrenia, either on symptoms or on side effects of antipsychotics. Earlier reviews report similar conclusions (Tsalamanios et al., 2006; Irving et al., 2011; Boskovic et al., 2011). Most promising evidence for omega-3 is found for preventing transition to first episode psychosis in high-risk individuals. Amminger et al. (2010) found a reduction of the transition rate from 27.5% to 4.8% by prescribing omega-3 fatty acids in people thought to be at risk on developing schizophrenia. However, before conclusions can be drawn, replication of these findings are needed. A randomized controlled multicenter phase III clinical trial of omega-3 PUFA is now in progress (Amminger & McCorry, 2012). There is some evidence for glycine and sarcosine combined with antipsychotics in reducing negative symptoms, but not when combined with clozapine and also not as monotherapy. No evidence was found for D-cycloserine and D-serine on clinical improvement. Our results concur with two recent reviews (Tsai & Lin, 2010; Singh & Singh, 2011) and are in line with a recently updated Cochrane review (Tiihonen & Wahlbeck, 2006). Conflicting results from studies on drugs targeting the glutamate/NMDA system may be explained by complicated dose- effect relationships, as recently found in studies with the Glyt-1 transporter antagonist bitopertin (Umbricht et al., 2013). By adding Chinese or Ayurvedic herbs to antipsychotics, general functioning seems to improve. Reserpine might improve outcome, but many side effects are reported. There is controversy concerning the frequently mentioned suggestion that resperine can induce depression (which lead to the monoamine hypothesis of depression; Baumeister et al., 2003). The Mundewadi (2008) study suggests equal effects of Ayurvedic medicine as monotherapy (bacopa monnieri and nardostachys jatamansi) compared to olanzapine but this study needs replication. A Cochrane review (Rathbone et al., 2007) states that 'the results suggest that combining Chinese herbal medicine with antipsychotics is beneficial'. Another Cochrane review (Agarwal, 2010) concludes that 'Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials'. These results need further exploration and pharmacological differentation as Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs include hundreds of species combined in thousands of different combinations prescribed in a fundamentally different way than Western medicines are (Kaptchuck, 2000; Cliffort, 2003). The combined approach using knowledge from conventional medicine as well as Chinese medicine seems promising as it can lead to innovation (Van der Greef, 2011) and possibly to improved outcomes (Zhang, 2011). Inconsistent beneficial outcomes of studies on B vitamins were identified, especially when given as a combination of B1, B3, B6, B9 and/or B12 with antipsychotics. One review (Kleijnen and Knipschild,1991) concluded that no adequate support for efficacy of B vitamins in schizophrenia can be identified. Most studies with positive effects in our review, however, were published after 1990. Most convincing evidence was found for vitamin B6 added to antipsychotics, that appears to be effective in diminishing general psychopathology and TD. The findings on the efficacy of vitamin C for schizophrenia in only two RCTs were inconsistent, so definite conclusions cannot be drawn. The efficacy of vitamin E on TD remains inconclusive as only half of studies in our review found some positive result. Even so, a meta-analysis by Boskovic et al Perhaps this is due to the finding that those with a short history of TD tend to improve more than those with a longer history of TD. A Cochrane review in 2011 (Soares & McGrath) came to a similar conclusion: 'small trials of limited quality suggest that vitamin E may protect against deterioration of TD. There is no evidence that vitamin E improves symptoms of this problematic and disfiguring condition once established'. Ginkgo biloba is a promising agent that seems to benefit patients with schizophrenia in several ways when added to antipsychotics. Several studies in this review suggest evidence for improving symptoms in various domains including effect on positive symptoms and the reduction of side effects of antipsychotics. Singh et al. concludes in another review: 'ginkgo as add-on therapy ameliorates the symptoms of chronic schizophrenia' (Singh et al., 2010). On melatonin, there is preliminary evidence from one study for an effect of melatonin to diminish TD. As TD is difficult to investigate with its fluctuating symptom severity, this finding needs replication before more definite conclusions can be drawn. Some inconsistent evidence was found on improved outcomes by several hormones (DHEA, PREG and testosterone) in schizophrenia, not allowing final conclusions. A Cochrane review on DHEA / testosterone (Elias & Kumar, 2007) arrived at a similar conclusion. For estradiol, a Cochrane review (Chua et al., 2005) found no convincing evidence over placebo. Since then, two more recent studies indicate that estradiol improves positive and general (but not negative) symptoms of schizophrenia when added to antipsychotics. Therefore, the use of estradiol in schizophrenia warrants further study. There is a need for more high-quality efficacy and (cost-) effectiveness research on natural medicines for schizophrenia. Especially, more large scale RCTs are needed, as most of the studies we included were performed with fewer than 50 participants. Most obvious candidate agents are glycine, sarcosine, Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs, ginkgo biloba, vitamin B6, and omega-3 fatty acids. Limitations This review provides a general overview of the effects of different natural agents in treatment of schizophrenia and the treatment of undesired effects of antipsychotics. A limitation of this review is its wide scope, allowing only general descriptions of included studies in six domains. Second, we have only discussed the most well- known and most studied natural agents, as identified with our search strategy. There may be more natural agents investigated for their effects on schizophrenia or on side effects of antipsychotics, that we did not identify. A third limitation is that our search excluded papers in other languages than English, although more studies exist, mainly in Japanese and Chinese. Presumably this might have led to an underestimation of the effects of some natural agents. For instance, Pataracchia (2008) reports on six double-blind trials showing positive results of combining vitamin B3 and vitamin C in the treatment of schizophrenia, but none were published in journals that are included in the databases we assessed. Saku (1991) reports in English about 45 studies (published in Chinese) on the efficacy of Chinese herbs for schizophrenia and psychosis, with and without modern antipsychotics. Beneficial results were reported in studies combining Chinese herbs with low dosage modern antipsychotics. Fourth, we do not know to which extent our findings are influenced by publication bias, for instance in favor of the publication of studies with positive results. Fifth, in the included RCTs there was not much specific information about the was continued during study: no information on frequency and type of counselling / therapy and no specific information on dosage and or type of antipsychotics (other than: '..was kept stable during this study..'). Also the dosage of the natural agents and the clinical details on included patients in the study was often not clear (e.g. first or chronic psychosis, treating symptoms or preventing relapse), limiting firm conclusions. Sixth, we only mentioned whether the effects in the studies were significant compared to the control groups. We did not show effect sizes, as the data published in many included studies did not allow to calculate effect sizes. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the results is debatable. Seventh, we did not set a time frame to our search, allowing the inclusion of some rather old studies (some dating more than 50 years ago). Older studies provide data in ways not always in agreement with more modern conventions, although we did assess the quality of all studies. Finally, for this last purpose, we used Jadad, not the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Therefore possible bias may be less easily identified. Clinical implications Clinicians need to be aware of the frequent use of natural medicines without medical prescription, while some patients assume that natural is better than chemical and causes fewer side effects. Although beneficial effects may occur, this is certainly not always the case. Some natural compounds that may be suggested in treatment of schizophrenia are toxic to humans (Topliss et al., 2002), and some herbal medicines can cause side effects or can interact with medication (Ernst, 2003a). Only 3% of the user population is aware of the potential risks of interactions between herbs and prescription medication (Walter & Rey, 1999). So, from a medical perspective it is important to know what patients buy and try. Another concern is the reports on contamination of herbs, for instance from Asia, with heavy metals. However, after investigation of 334 samples, Harris et al. (2011) conclude that 'the vast majority (95%) of medications in this study contained levels of heavy metals or pesticides that would be of negligible concern'. Because of these concerns, patients want their medical doctors to advice them on complementary (or natural) medicines (Gray et al., 1998; Hoenders et al., 2006). The World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2003) and European Parliament (EP, 1997) have advised their member states to: 'formulate national policy and regulation for the proper use of CAM and its integration into national health care systems in line with the provisions of the WHO strategies on Traditional Medicines; establish regulatory mechanisms to control the safety and quality of products and of CAM practice; create awareness about safe and effective CAM therapies among the public and consumers.' Respecting patients' opinions and informing them may also improve the therapeutic relationship (Stevingson, 2006) and thus enhance treatment outcome (Koenig, 2000; Nikles et al., 2005; Gill, 2013), as this has been shown to be dependent on the quality of the therapeutic alliance (Wampold, 2001; Driessen et al., 2010; Baldwin et al., 2007). Further research Research in this area is hampered by a lack of funding. Less than 1% of research budget is spent on non-conventional medicine (Ernst, 2003b). It is unlikely that pharmaceutical companies will provide research grants for natural agents that cannot easily be patented. Other obstacles are national and international biodiversity rules and regulations and lack of standardization of formulation, production and identification of active ingredients from plant products (Ganzera et review provides clinicians and patients with an overview of the results of high- quality scientific studies on the efficacy and safety of natural medicines in schizophrenia and related psychoses. Some agents seem effective and safe. From a clinical perspective however, many questions remain unanswered: what dosage is safe and effective? Are there any interactions with conventional medication? How does one relate to the fact that natural agents can be bought anywhere without prescription? How to assess questions of quality and insurance? We intend to try to answer some of these questions in a subsequent paper focusing on the clinical application of natural medicines in psychiatry. Conclusion High quality research on natural medicines for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders is scarce. However, there is emerging evidence for glycine, sarcosine, NAC, some Chinese and ayurvedic herbs, ginkgo biloba, estradiol and vitamin B6 for improving symptoms of schizophrenia when added to antipsychotics. There is inconclusive or absent evidence for omega-3, D-serine, D-cycloserine, when added to antipsychotics. Omega-3 without antipsychotics might be beneficial in the prevention of schizophrenia. Ayurvedic herbs seem as effective as olanzapine in one large recent study. Other agents without antipsychotics (vitamin B3, vitamin C, sarcosine, glycine, protilerin) do not seem effective or have only been tested in single or (very) small trials. Ginkgo and vitamin B6 seem effective for side effects of antipsychotics (TD and NIA). The evidence for improved side effects of antipsychotics by omega-3, melatonin and DHEA is (still) inconclusive. All agents produce only mild or no side effects. However, most study samples are small, duration is generally short, they only cover a modest part of the globe's geography and most results ffects of natural medicin es in psychotic disorders Study1 Also AP?
