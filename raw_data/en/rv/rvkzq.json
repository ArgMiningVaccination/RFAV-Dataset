Autism refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. Autism is also known autism spectrum disorder (or ASD). There is not one autism, but a spectrum or subtypes. The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors are involved. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association merged four distinct autism diagnoses into one umbrella, which is Autism Spectrum Disorder. The four are 1 autistic disorder 2 childhood disintegrative disorder 3 pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) 4 Asperger Syndrome What are some features of autism? Developmental delays can appear early. Once those delays are identified, early intervention can improve outcomes later in life for people with autism. Each person with autism has strengths and challenges. There is a range of how they think, learn, and problem-solve. Some require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently. Some individuals on the spectrum have sensory sensitivities (sight, touch, taste, sound, smell) and medical issues. Seizure disorders and sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and attention issues sometimes accompany autism. Statistics and insights into who is affected by autism spectrum disorder Most children are diagnosed at age 4, but it can be reliably diagnosed as early as age 2. Signs usually appear by the age of 2 or 3. According to both Autism Speaks and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 44 children in the US has been identified with autism spectrum disorder, according to 2018 data. It affects 1 in 27 boys, and 1 in 116 girls. It is approximately 4 times more common among boys than girls. Autism spectrum disorder occurs in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Minority groups tend to be diagnosed later and less often. Early intervention makes a big difference. There is no medical detection for autism. Highlights from the interview Many parents struggle with their child's identity (autism diagnosis, ADHD, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc). These struggles impact us as parents and how we feel we are parenting. We talk about our struggles in this episode so that other parents don't feel alone. Marginalized people are people first. Ex: people with autism. Person-first language is encouraged. Having a stay-at-home Dad in the family Christina's husband is a full-time, stay-at-home Dad. When he started staying home, Alex make significant developmental progress. Going from a two-income household to a one-income household was a challenge, but the support was more valuable than the second income. She feels peace of mind. Alex's needs are met, and he is making progress. Is there a link between vaccines and autism? There is no evidence of a link between autism and vaccinations. Benefits vs perceived harm need to be considered, and better messengers are needed to talk about the benefits. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventible communicable diseases were seen after [Dr. Andrew Wakefield's Vaccine-Autism Myth](https://time.com/5175704/andrew-wakefield-vaccine-autism/) was published. How to get a child evaluated for a diagnosis of autism You will know something is wrong if your child is missing milestones, like talking or playing with others. For parents concerned that their child may have autism, start with a pediatrician, and get a referral to a developmental pediatrician, child psychiatrist or psychologist, or pediatric neurologist for an evaluation. Waiting lists can be years long. Start today. Pediatricians may also have lists of resources, like therapy providers or a dentist skilled at treating children who are on the autism spectrum. Need an evaluation for services (not a diagnosis)? Contact your local Early Intervention (Help Me Grow) program for kids ages 0-3 years. After age 3 years, contact your local public school. An evaluation can qualify your child for services. When you don't know your options, getting help can be a lonely journey. A diagnosis of autism can lead to treatment and support. Support and services for the family are also available. Juggling a child with special needs, a career, self-care, another child, and a husband is hard to do. Christina talked about riding the \"struggle bus.\" Some days are harder than others, but it's ok to ask, \"How are you?\" She'll tell you! The more we speak up and speak out, the more it becomes socially acceptable to talk about having a child with challenges. People with challenges need a place in this world and people who accept them. Recommendations from Christina - Know your legal rights to services once your child has a been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. - Understand what services your child qualifies for and what needs to paid for out of pocket. - Include your child in activities with and without typical peers for social-emotional development. - Have realistic expectations. - Don't let the things you can't control steal your joy. How has having a child with autism affected Christina's career? - Motivates her to take on alternative projects to earn additional income to pay for therapies. - Motivates her to help underserved communities and individuals of color and advocate for marginalized communities. Empathy is one of her superpowers! - Motivates her personally and professionally. She wants to spend as much time as possible with her family. What are some of the \"gifts\" autism has brought you and/or your family? - The gift of time. They spend a lot of time together. - Lots of videos! Videos are a feedback tool for modeling behavior. They are fun to look back on too! - Being present and in the moment. - Her husband is home more than he would be if he and Christina were both working parents. For anyone who is struggling, please know that You are strong. You are capable. You are enough. Every day. Use your voice. You never know who's listening and may need to hear your message!
