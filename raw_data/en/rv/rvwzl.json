During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Japanese economy continued to show a gradualrecovery supported by improved corporate earnings,increased private-sector capital investment and otherfactors. However, consumer spending grew at a slower pace, and the operating environment waschallenging overall. The global economy recoveredsteadily as a result of economic expansion in theUnited States and China, but the sharp rise in crudeoil prices and other factors created a mood ofuncertainty about the future. In this operating environment, the Meiji Seika Group devoted its efforts to expanding sales andrestoring profits. We made qualitative improvementsby implementing business structure reforms centeredon our main businesses of food, pharmaceuticalsand health care, and aggressively reinforced ourmarketing activities and market competitiveness. The past fiscal year was the second year of our current medium-term management plan, Challenge2005. In this plan, we have stated the following asour management objectives: Create profits in existing businesses Strengthen the ability of internal systems to respond to change Generate growth by developing new business areas2Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.TOOURSTAKEHOLDERS Focusing on Aggressive Management to Achieve the Objectives ofChallenge 2005 Naotada Sato, PresidentQBased on these objectives, the Meiji Seika Group worked in unison to increase earnings. As a result,although consolidated net sales for the fiscal yearended March 31, 2005 decreased 1.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a5364.0 billion, operating incomeincreased 10.6 percent to \u00a58.7 billion. However, weimplemented the one-time amortization ofunrecognized retirement benefit obligations andreorganized production bases as part of themanagement structure reforms we have promotedover the last several years. Consequently, we posteda net loss of \u00a58.2 billion, compared to net income of\u00a50.3 billion in the previous fiscal year. In the year ending March 31, 2006, the final year of Challenge 2005, we will build on the positiveresults of the qualitative improvements and structuralreforms of the past two years by taking a moreaggressive management approach in order topromote our business development plan even further. WHAT ARE YOUR STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF CHALLENGE 2005? Challenge 2005 consists of a structural reform plan and business development plan. Businessreforms to date have included the one-timeamortization of the unrecognized amount ofretirement benefit obligations, expansion of ouroutplacement support program and restructuring ofour production bases. These reforms are alreadybeginning to yield positive results, and we plan toimplement our business development plan evenmore forcefully as we shift to an aggressivemanagement stance. Specifically, in the year ending March 2006, the Meiji Seika Group will work toexpand business with three key themes: (1) focusingactivities under the watchwords \"Health,\"\"Summer\" and \"Overseas,\" (2) strengtheningexisting core businesses, and (3) strengthening ourcorporate capabilities. (1) Focusing Activities under the Watchwords \"Health,\" \"Summer\" and \"Overseas\"Health: In July 2005, we reorganized and integrated the Food Company and Health Care Company tocreate the Food & Health Care Company. Thepurpose of this change was to further strengthenand accelerate business development. This businesswill work to maximize the potential of Meiji Seika'sprimary strengths \u2014 its operations in both food andpharmaceuticals. Moreover, related markets arecontinuing to expand, and therefore we believe thatsuccess in this area will be the key to the Meiji SeikaGroup's future growth.3Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.Challenge 2005 Objectives (For the year ending March 2006) 2006 20052004Consolidated Net Sales (Billions of yen) 368.9400.0 364.0 200620052004Consolidated Ordinary Income (Billions of yen) 8.216.0 8.5 200620052004Consolidated Net Income (Loss) (Billions of yen) 0.37.0 (8.2)continually working to expand the chocolate business toward our targets of\u00a590 billion in sales and a 30 percentmarket share. In the PharmaceuticalCompany, we will expand the range of drug indications and speed up research anddevelopment to solidify our business foundation witha specialization in anti-infectives and central nervoussystem drugs. (3) Strengthening our Corporate Capabilities As I stated earlier, one of the watchwords we will be focusing our activities under is \"Health,\" and inJuly this year we established the Food & Health CareCompany. This reorganization will allow us to quicklyreflect customer needs and market information invarious sales and development initiatives, and toaggressively build our products over the medium andlong term by concentrating management resourcesin the area of functional healthfoods. Moreover,through close collaboration between the Food &Health Care Company and the PharmaceuticalCompany, we will maximize synergies in both thefood and pharmaceutical businesses. We also aim toestablish a distinctive business model in the healthcare field by deploying our expertise and knowledgefrom the pharmaceutical business in areas such asacquiring Food for Specified Health Use approval anddeveloping functional ingredients. Two other objectives are establishing a new production system and raising efficiency indistribution. We plan to achieve these objectivesSummer: Strengthening revenues in summer has been a long-term issue for the Meiji Seika Group,whose main product lines, chocolate and antibiotics,are particularly strong in winter. We will work toreduce the seasonal fluctuation in revenues byenhancing our lineup of products for summer,primarily confectioneries and healthfood products,and entering the chilled foods business.Overseas: We will substantially increase our overseas activities, particularly in China. In the foodbusiness, we will expand the facilities of GuangzhouMeiji Confectionery Co., Ltd. and commencebusiness operations in earnest, centered on MeijiSeika (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. In the pharmaceuticalbusiness, Meiji Lukang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,which was established as a production base forethical drugs, will begin full-scale production. Inaddition, we will improve the management system atShantou Meiji Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., which willcarry out sales activities with its own medicalrepresentatives. (2) Strengthening Existing Core Businesses In its core chocolate and cocoa business, Meiji Seika is aggressively expanding into product areasthat are clearly differentiated by higher added value,such as chocolate products for summer. We are 4Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.

To offset this, we are working to achieve the objectives of Challenge 2005 under a\"summer\" theme by introducing chill-and-serve chocolate products specifically for thesummer season and enhancing our sales promotion efforts. When chilled, PORTEPASSIONFRUIT and FRAN HIYASHI CACAO offer a delicious new chocolate flavor andAPOLLO SHARISHARI ICHIGO, the first product of its kind, has the texture of chocolatesherbet. Meiji Seika will continue working to increase summer season demand forchocolate and enhance profitability. FOOD&HEALTHCARECOMPANY FOOD&HEALTHCARECOMPANY CONFECTIONERY FOOD XYLISH In 2005, we added the breath-freshening ingredient rosemary to all products in the XYLISH lineup.Targeting health-conscious people in their 40s and 50s, THEOBRO is a high- quality cocoa with three times the cacao polyphenol content of conventional cocoa.CHO-PAN This new product offers a delightful new taste in the form of a chocolate cup filled with rich nut-flavored praline chocolate and topped with a crispy double-baked pie crust.MILK CHOCOLATE Launched in 1926, MILK CHOCOLATE is the representative core brand of Meiji Seika, with the top share of the chocolate market in Japan. GINZA CURRY First marketed in 1994, this original retort-pouch curry was developed to differentiate itself from competing brands.KARL Introduced in 1968, the long-selling KARL brand helped to open up the snack market in Japan.THEOBRO By consolidating the former Food and Health Care Companies we have established a unique business model under the watchword \"health.\">>>FOOD Chill-and-serve ICHIGO FOOD AND HEALTH RESEARCH LABORATORY Strategic Positioning In the food business, last year's record hot summer and changes in business terms and conditions for confectionery wholesalers sinceApril 2004 resulted in a 2.4 percent year-on-year decrease inconsolidated net sales to \u00a5232,755 million. Sales of main confectionery products were favorable due to successful efforts to boost demand for core products MILK CHOCOLATEand BLACK CHOCOLATE through promotion of the health appeal ofcacao polyphenol. A homemade chocolate sales campaign andenhancement of the product lineup through the introduction of newproducts such as CHO-PAN also contributed to sales. In candy, sales of core brand CHELSEA were constrained by a challenging market, but concentrated investment on renewal ofgummy products KAJU GUMMY and POIFULL resulted in firm sales. Chewing gum sales were supported by a large increase in sales of XYLISH, our main chewing gum brand. As for snacks, sales of corebrand KARL were firm. Sales of main food products were likewise strong. Solid performance of core products MILK COCOA and THEOBRO, supported by the May2004 launch of OISHII COCOA, contributed to results. In retort-pouchcurry products, GINZA CURRY performed well.Future Initiatives Through the integration of the Food and Health Care Companies we will concentrate management resources on functional healthfoods to establish a unique business model with an increasedemphasis on health. We will work toward continued expansion of our chocolate business by strengthening marketing activities for the summer seasonas well as developing year-round products. Specifically, we willpromote the development of such products as chocolate that isdelicious cold, as well as a chilled chocolate for the high-end market.We will enhance the competitiveness of our candy lineup by addinggummy products containing collagen. This will broaden the targetconsumer base by appealing to health-conscious customers. Inaddition, we will introduce other candy products that are not onlydelicious but also offer specific health benefits. We aim to expand the business with a thorough understanding of customer needs. To do this, we will establish a customer informationdepartment that uses market and retail shop information toundertake trend-based marketing.9Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.The Food and Health Research Laboratory is an important organization because it supports our top share in the chocolate market. It offers feedback for new productdevelopment based on Meiji Seika's unique know-how accumulated over many years ofunrivaled research, especially in the area of cacao quality evaluation. The Food and HealthResearch Laboratory's R&D activities are also characterized by an emphasis on productdevelopment and proximity to the market. For example, it developed CHO-PAN andUSUMAKI ALMOND, two products with completely new textures that contributed to salesin fiscal 2004. These products were big hits owing to an accelerated development processmade possible through close collaboration with marketing divisions to quickly reflectconsumer needs. Aiming to create products with high added value, the Food and HealthResearch Laboratory is also focused on developing new applications for cacao polyphenol,fructo-oligosaccharide and similar ingredients in food products to respond to the recentrise in health consciousness among consumers. >> >>We follow a unified development processfrom ingredients tofinal product basedon a theme ofcreating leadingproducts in the areaof health.Our goal to establish uniquebusiness model withan emphasis onhealthfood products.Pursuing beauty and healthSAVAS Since its launch in 1980, SAVAS has continued to meet the needs of top athletes and has achieved a solid position as a premium sports nutrition brand. SAVAS is special because ofthe approach we take in developing it: We start by responding to athletes' desire to buildbodies that help them win. Through sports science research we create products that meettheir practical sports nutrition needs. In this way, the SAVAS brand has gained athletes'trust. From 2004, SAVAS products have been certified as safe by the Japan Anti-DopingAgency, thus strengthening that trust even further. ISODINE We are reinforcing and expanding the ISODINE brand lineup with new products in response to the rise in self- medication and easing of regulations regarding pharmaceutical sales.MEIOLIGO The first oligosaccharide food product to be certified as a Food for Specified Health UseAMINO COLLAGEN Its delicious taste and high quality ensure a strong position in the growing market for basic food products that contribute to beauty.LOLA A line of chewable supplements that focuses on delicious tasteHelping athletes win10 Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.

Growing health-consciousness among consumers drove an increase in sales of main healthfood products, backed by theprovision of core brand SAVAS to top athletes as nutritionalsupport and aggressive sales promotion activities to increaseconsumer brand awareness. Sales of Amino Collagen increasedsignificantly, but sales of LOLA declined due to intensifiedcompetition. OTC drug sales were firm despite increasing price competition for all products in the core ISODINE brand lineup. We initiatedpositive steps to establish and expand the presence of theKARADANAVI line of products in the marketplace. In addition, salesof mini-drink KATSUJIN 28 grew strongly due to effective in-storesales promotion activities that increased customer awareness.Future Initiatives Consolidation of the Health Care and Food Companies will allow us to make greater use of our strengths in the confectionerybusiness. Moreover, it will further enhance coordination with thePharmaceutical Company in such areas as Food for Specified HealthUse. Specific measures envisioned include employing categorymanagement to enhance sales promotion activities. For example,SAVAS will be under the \"sports\" category, Amino Collagen andcassis products will fall under the \"beauty\" category, andKARADANAVI, cacao polyphenol products and the \"lifestyle-related disease prevention\" category. Inaddition, we will maximize the combined synergies of our food andpharmaceutical businesses through staff interaction and othercooperative enhancements that make use of the know-how of ourpharmaceutical business. Examples of this include the developmentof functional materials through the use of pharmaceuticalingredients and the development of Food for Specified Health Usebased on know-how accumulated through clinical development. The SAVAS Sports and Nutrition Laboratory (SNL) began operations in 1991. As Meiji Seika's team responsible for spreading the concept of sports nutrition, SNL has providedstaff support at successive Olympic Games, 2002 FIFA World Cup Japan/Korea and otherevents, and is developing a finely-tuned nutritional support and management system forindividual contestants. Through such activities, SNL staff obtain valuable feedback directlyfrom top athletes, which facilitates the development of new products. SNL's strength liesin the promotional benefits of helping professional athletes. Serious amateur athletesidentify with SNL's efforts in this regard, and this drives sales. To help promoteunderstanding of sports nutrition, SNL also plans and publishes Penta , a magazine targeting sports-minded individuals, and hold related seminars. SNL is working in otherways to broaden its support base, such as developing SAVAS products for children.SAVAS SPORTS AND NUTRITION LABORATORY 11Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.

We are aiming to launch it in the Japanese market by fiscal 2007. It will be the world's first carbapenem antibiotic for oral administration. ME1211 is an oral carbapenem prodrug with a wide antibacterial spectrum covering both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It also exhibits potent activity againstPRSP (penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae ), thus making it a promising candidate for use in the area of pediatric respiratory tract infections. Clinical developmentof this pharmaceutical was based on PK/PD (Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic) analysis,a first in Japan.

Strategic Positioning In the year ended March 2005, the Pharmaceutical Company achieved consolidated net sales of \u00a5109,530 million, a year-on-year increase of 0.9percent, despite an increasingly challenging business environment in theindustry, where drug prices decreased an average of 4.2 percent in April 2004. In the area of anti-infectives, sales of our main product MEIACT increased compared to the previous fiscal year due to the launch ofMEIACT MS Fine Granules for pediatric use. OMEGACIN performed well,supported by positive market development efforts, and sales of SWORDwere also favorable. However, the negative effects of drug pricereductions and other factors resulted in a decline in sales of HABEKACINand FOSMICIN. With respect to central nervous system (CNS) drugs,aggressive dissemination of scientific information through the deploymentof dedicated medical representatives (MRs) supported an increase in salesof both the antidepressant DEPROMEL and the anti-anxiety drug MEILAX.A severe outbreak of pollen allergies during the fiscal year resulted in asignificant increase in sales for the anti-allergy drug EBASTEL, but sales ofthe topical antiseptic ISODINE were down because of intensifiedcompetition and the effects of drug price reductions. Strong sales of coreproduct ORYZEMATE, a herbicide that protects rice against blast,supported growth in agricultural chemicals, while the acquisition of theveterinary drug businesses of the Daiichi Pharmaceutical Group in June2004 contributed to a large increase in veterinary drug sales.Future Initiatives The business environment of the pharmaceutical industry remains severe due to pervasive medical cost containment measures resultingfrom ongoing medical care system reforms and the aging of Japanesesociety. We will therefore move steadily toward becoming apharmaceutical company specializing in anti-infectives and centralnervous system drugs. In the prescription drugs business, we willenhance our marketing capabilities and concentrate managerialresources on our main product lines \u2014 MEIACT, DEPROMEL,HABEKACIN and OMEGACIN. In the area of central nervous systemdrugs, we will focus marketing efforts on major customers in variousways including deployment of dedicated MRs. We will also accelerateour research and development efforts. For example, we will expand therange of indications for DEPROMEL to include social anxiety disorder, afirst in Japan, and expedite the market launch of the world's first oralcarbapenem antibiotic, ME1211, for which Phase IItrials have been completed. In addition, we will work toward full-scale development ofour pharmaceutical business overseas, which is part of our main policyfocus for the year ending March 2006. Particular activities includeenhancing our business foundations in China through production andsales base upgrades such as completion of a new factory at MeijiLukang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. We will also reinforce sales of MEIACTin Europe, the Middle East and Asia. >> >>MEIBIS GENOME ANALYSIS SYSTEM Meiji Seika undertakes R&D with the aim of being a drug manufacturer that specializes in anti-infectives and central nervous system drugs. In the area of anti-infective drugdiscovery research, we have developed an original system for analyzing genomes ofpathogenic bacteria that has shortened the R&D process. This system, called MEIBIS,identifies mutations in antibiotic genes. Using MEIBIS has shortened the gene analysisprocess from over one year to roughly one month. The recent appearance of bacteriastrains resistant to existing antibiotics such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) has accelerated development of new antibiotics. The results obtained using the MEIBIS genome analysissystem are contributing significantly to the discovery of new drugs that are effectiveagainst such antibiotic-resistant strains. Meiji Seika will continue working to speed up thedrug discovery process and fulfill its responsibilities as a drug manufacturer that specializesin anti-infectives.

Kaisha, Ltd.SIX-YEARSUMMARY Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries Years ended March 31FINANCIAL STRATEGY The Meiji Seika Group's fundamental policy regarding distribution of profits is to take a long-term perspective in using internal capital resources to fund capital investment in Japanand overseas, research and development expenses, and other operating requirements toexpand the Group's businesses and strengthen the Group's financial structure whileproviding reasonable, stable shareholder returns. During the fiscal year ended March 31,2005, the Meiji Seika Group raised capital externally for purposes including adding toemployee retirement benefit plan assets. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES As of March 31, 2005, the Meiji Seika Group encompassed Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (Meiji Seika), 21 consolidated subsidiaries and one affiliate accounted for using the equity method.The 13 domestic subsidiaries include 10 companies in the food business, 2 companies in thepharmaceutical business, and 1 company in the health care business. The 8 overseassubsidiaries include 3 companies in the food business, 4 companies in the pharmaceuticalbusiness and 1 company in other businesses. Meiji Seika liquidated consolidated subsidiaryMEIJI KAIHATSU CO., Ltd. as of March 14, 2005. OVERVIEW During the year ended March 31, 2005, a moderate recovery continued in the Japanese economy. However, personal consumption did not improve. As a result, the operatingenvironment remained challenging. In this environment, the Meiji Seika Group worked in each of its three main business segments \u2014 food, pharmaceuticals and health care \u2014 to reform and strengthen itscorporate structure, aggressively conduct marketing activities and strengthen marketcompetitiveness to expand sales and enhance profitability. As a result, consolidated net salesdecreased 1.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a5364,018 million, but operating income increased10.6 percent year-on-year to \u00a58,717 million. As part of the structural reforms that the MeijiSeika Group has been implementing over the past several years, the Meiji Seika Groupamortized unrecognized retirement benefit obligations as a lump sum, reorganizedproduction bases, and executed other initiatives. Consequently, net loss for the fiscal yeartotaled \u00a58,240 million, compared to net income of \u00a5348 million for the previous fiscal year. REVIEW OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Food Company As in the previous fiscal year, the downturn in the Meiji Seika Group's markets and the trend toward lower prices continued. In addition, record-setting summer heat stifled therecovery in consumption of confectioneries, resulting in an extremely challenging operatingenvironment. Given these conditions, the Meiji Seika Group worked to expand sales bydeveloping clearly differentiated new products that anticipate consumer needs and trendsand by implementing total marketing measures for each of its core brands. However, due tofactors including a change in confectionery wholesaler terms and conditions from April 2004,net sales for the Food Company decreased 2.4 percent year-on-year to \u00a5232,755 million,while operating income increased 7.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a56,399 million. Regarding the performance of main consolidated subsidiaries, sales of MEIJI FOOD MATERIA CO., LTD. decreased as a result of changes in the terms and conditions governingtransactions with primary customers for core sugar products. In addition, sales of MEIJICHEWING GUM CO., LTD. remained strong because of its well-developed strengths inproduct development and enhanced marketing. Overseas, Meiji Seika (Singapore) Pte., Ltd. performed well because of aggressive sales promotion activities in its markets. Sales of D.F. Stauffer Biscuit Co., Inc. in the United Statesrecovered steadily in a highly competitive market.

However, many companies have entered the market, and the business environment has become challengingbecause of competition in product development and marketing. In addition, the market forover-the-counter (OTC) drugs has stagnated and prices are falling, which has resulted in atrend toward business amalgamation among companies. This has further intensifiedcompetition for market share, resulting in an increasingly difficult operating environment. Under these conditions, the Meiji Seika Group developed products that respond to diversifying consumer needs and conducted marketing activities to increase the brandstrength of core products. As a result, net sales of the Health Care Company increased 1.1percent year-on-year to \u00a519,104 million. Operating loss totaled \u00a5117 million, compared tooperating income of \u00a5712 million for the previous fiscal year. Domestic consolidated subsidiary MEIJI SPORTS PLAZA, Ltd. operates sports club facilities. Competition with other sports clubs has intensified, but sales remained firm because of theopening of new facilities and aggressive efforts to attract customers and increase customersatisfaction. Pharmaceutical Company Conditions in the pharmaceuticals market became increasingly challenging. Measures to contain health care costs included an industry-wide downward revision in drug pricesaveraging 4.2 percent in April 2004. Competition in new product development intensified,and research and development expenses increased. In addition, the markets for agriculturalchemicals and veterinary drugs were highly challenging. These markets contracted, whichintensified competition, and government regulations became more stringent in areas such asthe appropriate use of anti-infective veterinary drugs. Given these conditions, in the ethical pharmaceuticals business the Meiji Seika Group limited its product lineup to and concentrated managerial resources in the core areas of anti-infective and central nervous system drugs. In particular, the Meiji Seika Group increased thenumber of medical representatives (MR) specializing in the central nervous system sector andpromoted various other measures to strengthen competitiveness. The Meiji Seika Group alsopromoted expansion in its agricultural chemical and veterinary drug businesses in ways suchas acquiring the veterinary drug operations of Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in June 2004. As a result, net sales of the Pharmaceutical Company increased 0.9 percent year-on-year to \u00a5109,530 million. Operating income decreased 8.4 percent year-on-year to \u00a53,516million. Regarding the performance of domestic consolidated subsidiaries, results at Kitasato Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd. were strong due to substantial growth in sales of influenzavaccine and other products. However, sales decreased at FUJI-AMIDE CHEMICAL CO., LTD.despite aggressive sales promotion activities because of factors including increased pricePharmaceutical Company Net Sales and Operating Income (\u00a5 Billions) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Net sales Operating income117.9 110.7 103.0108.5 8.3 6.3 2.33.8109.5 3.519Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.

Overseas, Thai Meiji Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. increased sales as a result of aggressive sales promotion activities in its local markets. In addition, P.T. Meiji Indonesian PharmaceuticalIndustries in Indonesia performed strongly as a result of favorable local sales and exports.However, sales decreased at Tedec-Meiji Farma S.A. in Spain because of lower prices for itscore products. Office Building Leasing and Other Businesses In the building leasing business, although supply and demand conditions for space in large buildings in the Tokyo metropolitan area improved, rents decreased and the scale of tenantcompany businesses contracted. As a result, the occupancy rate at the core Solid Squareoffice building decreased, and the operating environment remained challenging. MEIJI KAIHATSU, CO., LTD. operated sports and leisure facilities. Although it aggressively implemented sales measures, the slump in consumer spending made future recovery inperformance unlikely, and its facilities were aging. The Meiji Seika Group dissolved thissubsidiary in November 2004, and liquidated its operations on March 14, 2005. As a result, net sales of Office Building Leasing and Other Businesses decreased 13.7 percent year-on-year to \u00a52,627 million. Operating income decreased 62.6 percent to \u00a596million. INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, net sales decreased 1.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a5364,018 million. Cost of sales decreased 3.5 percent year-on-year to \u00a5206,231 million, andthe ratio of cost of sales to net sales improved 1.2 percentage points to 56.7 percent. As aresult, gross profit increased 1.6 percent year-on-year to \u00a5157,786 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 1.2 percent year-on-year to \u00a5149,069 million. The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales increased 1.1 percentage pointsto 41.0 percent. Research and development costs, which are included in selling, general andadministrative expenses and manufacturing expenses, increased 1.0 percent year-on-year to\u00a516,852 million. As a result, operating income increased 10.6 percent year-on-year to\u00a58,717 million. The ratio of operating income to net sales increased 0.3 percentage points to2.4 percent. Other expenses, net totaled \u00a5214 million, compared to other income, net of \u00a5361 million in the previous fiscal year, a negative year-on-year change of \u00a5576 million.

Extraordinary losses totaled \u00a523,779 million, compared to \u00a56,306 million for theprevious fiscal year. The main reason was the lump-sum amortization of unrecognizedretirement benefit obligations totaling \u00a513,295 million in conjunction with managementstructure reforms. In addition, expenses incurred due to revision of the workforce andorganization of the parent company totaled \u00a57,337 million.

Net loss totaled\u00a58,240 million, compared to net income of \u00a5348 million for the previous fiscal year. Net lossper share totaled \u00a521.53, compared to net income per share of \u00a50.79 for the previous fiscalyear. DIVIDEND POLICY The Meiji Seika Group's fundamental policy regarding distribution of profits is to take a long-term perspective in enhancing internal capital resources, expanding businesses andstrengthening the Group's financial structure while providing reasonable, stable shareholder SG&A Expenses and SG&A Ratio (\u00a5 Billions / %) SG&A 2002 2003 2004 2005137.1142.0 143.1149.1 147.438.239.240.4 39.941.0Office Building Leasing and Others Net Sales and Operating Income (\u00a5 Billions) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Net sales Operating income7.2 0.46.3 0.44.6 0.42.6 0.13.0 0.3 20 Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.returns. In the year ended March 31, 2005, net sales were essentially unchanged from the previous fiscal year. However, the Meiji Seika Group recorded a net loss due to theextraordinary loss on amortization of unrecognized retirement benefit obligation as part ofmanagement structure reforms. Based on the policy of maintaining stable dividends forshareholders, the Meiji Seika Group deployed unappropriated retained earnings to pay cashdividends per share for the year ended March 31, 2005 totaling \u00a57.00. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION As of March 31, 2005, total assets increased 3.0 percent from a year earlier to \u00a5339,848 million. Current assets increased 3.7 percent, or \u00a55,644 million, from a year earlier to\u00a5160,255 million. Total fixed assets increased 2.4 percent, or \u00a54,143 million, to \u00a5179,592million. Investments and other non-current assets increased 6.9 percent, or \u00a52,260 million,from a year earlier to \u00a535,187 million. Total liabilities increased 11.2 percent, or \u00a519,334 million, from a year earlier to \u00a5192,403 million. Current liabilities decreased 10.7 percent, or \u00a510,171 million, from a year earlier to\u00a584,880 million. Long-term liabilities increased 37.8 percent, or \u00a529,506 million, from a yearearlier to \u00a5107,522 million. Shareholders' equity decreased 6.3 percent, or \u00a59,711 million, from a year earlier to \u00a5144,837 million. As a result, the ratio of shareholders' equity to total assets decreased 4.2percentage points from a year earlier to 42.6 percent. Shareholders' equity per sharedecreased \u00a525.55 to \u00a5377.78. Due to the net loss for the fiscal year, return on average totalshareholders' equity (ROE) was not meaningful. In the previous fiscal year, ROE was 0.2percent. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS Despite the loss before income taxes, net cash provided by operating activities increased \u00a510,068 million, or 151.1 percent, compared to the previous fiscal year to \u00a516,731 millionbecause the loss before income taxes resulted from non-cash charges. Net cash used in investing activities increased \u00a511,348 million to \u00a516,772 million, primarily due to the use of \u00a518,911 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment includinga headquarters building and pharmaceutical production facilities. On an accrual basis, capitalexpenditures increased \u00a53,290 million, or 19.9 percent, to \u00a519,827 million. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled \u00a511,977 million. In the previous fiscal year, financing activities used net cash of \u00a56,028 million. The Meiji Seika Group issued bondstotaling \u00a520,000 million to add to retirement plan assets. As a result of these factors, cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2005 increased \u00a511,957 million from a year earlier to \u00a522,646 million. BUSINESS RISKS AND OTHER RISKS Factors that have the potential to exert a significant influence on investors' decisions include, but are not limited to, the following. Statements in the text concerning the futureare based on the judgment of the Meiji Seika Group's management as of March 31, 2005,the end of the fiscal year under review. (1)Extraordinary Changes in Financial Position and Business Results For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, consolidated net sales were \u00a5364,018 million, a year-on-year decrease of 1.3 percent, and operating income was \u00a58,717 million, a year-on-year increase of 10.6 percent. However, the Meiji Seika Group recorded various extraordinarylosses, including amortization of unrecognized retirement benefit obligation as part ofmanagement structure reform. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2005 therefore totaled\u00a58,240 million, compared to net income of \u00a5348 million for the previous fiscal year. (2)Procurement of Raw Ingredients In the Meiji Seika Group's food business, nearly all raw ingredients and major ingredients (cacao beans, nuts, etc.) are imported. In principle, the Group maintains a fixed level ofR&D Costs (\u00a5 Billions) 2001 2002 2003 2004 200517.718.8 17.716.9 16.7 Net Income (Loss) and Net Income to Net Sales (\u00a5 Billions / %) Net income (loss) \u2014 Net income to Net sales2001 2002 2003 2004 20055.9 2.71.9 1.6 0.8 0.16.9 (8.2)0.321Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. Note: Net income to net sales is not recorded for the year ended March 31, 2005 due tonet loss.domestic stock, and takes measures to disperse risks in producing regions. However, in the event that the Group is unable to secure a sufficient volume of ingredients for an extendedperiod of time due to political conditions in exporting countries, global demand conditions orother factors, the Group's production activities would be hindered, which could impact theGroup's business results and financial position. In addition, prices are currently trending higher for nearly all raw ingredients, and the Group is working to control costs by developing new procurement routes and promotingstreamlining. However, acceleration in this upward trend in prices in the future could affectproduction costs. (3)Changes in Exchange Rates The Meiji Seika Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts in procuring raw materials. However, changes in exchange rates could increase procurement costs, whichcould affect the Meiji Seika Group's financial position. In addition, items such as product sales, expenses and assets of overseas subsidiaries and businesses that are denominated in local currencies are translated into yen uponconsolidation. Changes in exchange rates can therefore affect the Meiji Seika Group'sbusiness results and financial position. (4)The Impact of Weather Chocolate sales account for a large percentage of the Meiji Seika Group's food business. High temperatures and changes in the weather can easily affect consumer purchasingpatterns and affect sales of chocolate and other confectioneries. Unpredictable changes inweather can therefore affect the Meiji Seika Group's business results and financial position. (5)Legal Regulations The Meiji Seika Group's food business is subject to various laws and regulations such as the Food Sanitation Law. In addition, the Group's ethical, OTC product and veterinary drugbusinesses are subject to pharmaceutical-related laws, including the Pharmaceutical AffairsLaw, and the Group's agricultural chemicals business is subject to agricultural chemical-related laws, including the Agricultural Chemicals Regulation Law. Moreover, the Meiji SeikaGroup's overall business is subject to regulations including the Product Liability Law and theAnti-monopoly Law. (6)Contamination by Foreign Substances In its food business, the Meiji Seika Group places the highest priority on using ingredients that are safe and reliable for consumers, and is working to obtain safe, reliable ingredientsthrough measures such as shifting procurement to safer countries and strengtheninginspection of suppliers. In the pharmaceutical business, the Meiji Seika Group manufacturesproducts ranging from bulk pharmaceuticals to drug preparations under management thatfollows Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of Health,Labour and Welfare. To prevent contamination incidents, the Group routinely conductsstringent production management and has incorporated the latest technology in an effort toimprove the configuration and equipment of production facilities. However, there is noguarantee against the possibility of contamination by foreign substances in any of theGroup's products. Contamination by foreign substances would have a serious impact on thereputation of the Meiji Seika Group, which could cause sales to decline and costs to rise, andthus has the potential to impact the Group's business results. (7)Occurrence of Side Effects In the pharmaceutical business, the Meiji Seika Group conducts product development, manufacturing and marketing according to various laws and standards enforced byregulatory authorities. However, unforeseen side effects have the potential to occur duringdevelopment and after product launch. The Meiji Seika Group prepares against theoccurrence of such incidents by carrying insurance coverage for various types of liability,Total Assets (\u00a5 Billions) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005341.4 336.9 317.8339.8330.1 Shareholders' Equity and Equity Ratio (\u00a5 Billions / %) Shareholders' equity \u2014 Equity ratio2001 2002 2003 2004 2005158.4 156.0152.2144.8154.546.4 46.347.946.8 42.6ROE and ROA (%) \u2014 ROE \u2014 ROA2001 2002 2003 2004 20054.5 3.7 1.7 0.22.0 1.7 0.8 0.122 Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. Note: ROE and ROA are not recorded for the year ended March 31, 2005 due to net loss.including product liability. However, because there is no guarantee that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all damages associated with such liability, unforeseen side effects havethe potential to impact the Group's business results and financial position. (8)Research and Development In the Meiji Seika Group's pharmaceutical business, the development of new products requires a variety of tests over long periods of time, which necessitates substantial expenses.In addition, the Meiji Seika Group must in some instances extend, interrupt or ceaseparticular research and development projects because of safety and efficacy issues.Therefore, progress in research and development has the potential to impact the Meiji SeikaGroup's business results and financial performance. Moreover, the launch of products thatthe Meiji Seika Group develops may be delayed if research and development does notproceed as planned. This may result in the need to introduce the products of othercompanies. Such cases have the potential to increase outlays for intellectual property rightsand licensing. (9) Intellectual Property The Meiji Seika Group owns intellectual property created through business activities including research and development. The Group also legally uses a broad range ofintellectual property that is patented by third parties. The Group uses such intellectualproperty with the understanding that it is not infringing upon the rights of third parties.However, litigation and other issues arising in connection with intellectual property have thepotential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and financial performance. (10)The Impact of Regional Upheaval or Change in Social Conditions The Meiji Seika Group conducts production and sales activities overseas, primarily in Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. The occurrence of earthquakes or other majornatural disasters in areas in which the Group operates; changes in inflation and othereconomic conditions; and wars, revolutions and other events that may cause politicalturbulence have the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and financialperformance. (11)The Impact of a Large Earthquake, Fire or Other Disaster A large earthquake, fire or other natural disaster that causes extensive damage to Meiji Seika Group's production facilities and results in an extended halt in production has thepotential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and financial performance. (12)Information Systems The Meiji Seika Group works to thoroughly implement measures to counter computer viruses and rigorously maintains its information management system. However, a systemshutdown resulting from an unknown virus or unauthorized system access, or leakage ofcustomer information, all have the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's businessresults and financial performance. OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2006 The Meiji Seika Group created and is diligently implementing a medium-term management plan, Challenge 2005, to address the challenges it faces and to rapidly restoreprofitability. For the year ending March 31, 2006, the Meiji Seika Group projects that netsales will increase 4.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a5380,000 million, operating income willincrease 83.5 percent year-on-year to \u00a516,000 million, and net income will total \u00a58,000million. In addition, we intend to work toward the Challenge 2005 goal of net sales of\u00a5400,000 million through even more aggressive business development.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (the \"Company\") and subsidiary companies have be en prepared from the consolidated financial statements in Japanese filed with the Kanto Finance Bureau as required by the Securities and Exchange La w of Japan, which are in conformity with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan. These are different in certain respects from t he application and disclosure requirements of International Accounting Standards. The consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the finan cial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in countries and jurisdicti ons other than Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications have been made to present them in a for m which is familiar to readers outside Japan. The accounts and the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are maintained in Japanese yen. Fo r the convenience of the reader, the accompanying consolidated financial statements are also presented in U.S. dollars by arithmetically translating all Japanese yen amounts by using the exchange rate of \u00a5104.21 to $1 in effect at March 31, 2005. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Consolidation policy The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and significant subsidiaries (the \"Compa nies\"), over which the Company has power of control through majority voting rights or existence of certain conditions evidencing control by the Compan y. Investments in affiliates over which the Company has ability to exercise significant influences over operating and financial policies of the investees, a re accounted for on the equity method. The consolidated financial statements consist of the Company and its 21 (22 in 2004) significant subsidiaries. On March 14, 2005, the Company liquidated consolidated subsidiary Meiji Kaihatsu Co., Ltd. and removed it from the scope of consolidation. Meiji Kaihatsu's in come and cash flow statements are consolidated up to the date of liquidation. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Ac counts of subsidiaries whose business year-ends differ by three months form March 31 have been included using financial information with appropriate adjustm ent. Investments in one affiliate are accounted for on the equity method. The difference between the cost and underlying net equity at acquisition of i nvestments in consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates is allocated to identifiable assets based on fair market value at the date of acquisition. The unal located portion of the differences is amortized over 5 years and 15 years on a straight-line basis. (b) Marketable and investment securities Marketable and investment securities are valued using the following methods. Securities that have market prices: Market valuation based on market prices at fiscal year-end. Differences in appraisals are ac counted for by incorporation of direct capital, and sales cost is calculated using the moving-average method. Securities that have no market prices: Cost method based on the moving-average method. (c) Inventories Inventories, including finished and semifinished products as well as work in progress, are valued at cost, which is determined mainly by the average cost method, except supplies and raw materials, which are stated at the lower of cost or market. (d) Income taxes The Companies provide for income taxes applicable to all items included in the consolidated statements of income regardless of when such taxes are payable. Income taxes based on temporary differences between tax and financial reporting purposes are reflected as deferred income taxes in the consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method. (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Deprecation of the assets of the parent company and domestic subsidiaries is calculated primarily by the declining balance method. However, depreciation of buildings and structures used in the leasing business that were acquired on or after April 1, 1995 is calculated by the straight-line method. Furthermore, depreciation of buildings (excluding attached fixtures) acquired on or aft er April 1, 1998 is calculated by the straight-line method. Overseas consolidated subsidiaries mainly used the straight-line method to calculate depreciation. (f) Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, which is calculated principally by the straight-line metho d. Commencing with the fiscal year under review, the Company's U.S. subsidiaries have adopted the U.S. Financial Accounting Standa rd Board's Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Accordingly, impairment studies will be conducted annually or when incidents that co uld possibly impair goodwill or other intangible assets occur to determine whether impairment has occurred. Following this standard, the U.S. subsidiaries have conducted impairment studies and determined that the fair value of their go odwill and other intangible assets lie above carrying value. Therefore, starting with the fiscal year under review, no amortization charges will be made to the consolidation adjustment account. (g) Allowance for doubtful accounts To provide for losses on doubtful accounts such as accounts receivable, the Company charges to income an amount based on actual loss experience for normal accounts, plus an amount for projected unrecoverable amounts based on assessments of individual designated accounts, such as cr edits from companies in danger of bankruptcy. (h) Reserve for retirement allowances The Company and its principal consolidated subsidiaries provide for employees' accrued retirement benefits by charging to incom e the amount recognized as having been incurred based upon the projected amounts of the liability for accrued retirement benefits and pension assets at the end o f the consolidated fiscal year.29Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.The difference at the time of accounting standard alteration (\u00a517,740 million) is being charged to income on a pro rata basis o ver seven years. The difference based on an actuarial calculation is charged to income beginning in the following consolidated fiscal year, usin g the pro rata amounts based on a specified number of years (seven) that is less than the average remaining period of employment for employees at the time t he difference arises. On April 1, 2005, the Company implemented major revisions to its human resource and retirement benefit systems that included a shift to a new retirement benefit system. As a result of this change, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss on amortization of unrecognized retireme nt benefit obligation totaling \u00a513,295 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. (i) Leases For finance lease transactions, except for leases that transfer ownership of the property to the lessee, the usual accounting m ethod governing lease transactions is applicable. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are composed of cash on hand, bank deposits available fo r withdrawal on demand and highly liquid, short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less that can be readily converted into cash and which represent a minor risk of fluctuation in value. (k) Translation of foreign currency Short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen a t the exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet date. The foreign currency translation adjustment is accounted for as a gain or loss. The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen using the average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The translation adjustmen ts are included in minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and in the foreign currency translation adjustment account in the shareholders' equity portion of t he consolidated balance sheet. From the year ended March 31, 2005, the income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into Japanes e yen using the average exchange rate for each company's respective fiscal year. Formerly, the exchange rate prevailing as of the last day of the respe ctive fiscal years was used. This change permits more accurate presentation of income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements by averaging the impa ct of short-term changes in exchange rates. The effect of this change on the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2005 was not material. (l) Per share data Net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock. 3.
