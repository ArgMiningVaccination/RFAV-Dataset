Summer is officially here! In Traditional Chinese Medicine we live with the seasons and change with the seasons. Summer is the most Yang season. It represents outward energy, expansion, movement, and activity. This is the time to use the energy we have been storing all Winter and play! The organ that corresponds with Summer is the Heart and the element is Fire. In Summer we should wake early and can stay up late, having a rest mid-day if needed. The body's Qi and energy are at their peaks this time of year and it is our chance to get things done that we have been planning all Winter and Spring. Activity and exercise are important at this time to keep the pores open and Qi flowing smoothly in the body. Bitter is the taste associated with the Heart. Bitter flavors drain and clear excess heat and fire out of the body. In TCM all food has a temperature. Cooling foods are important this time of year due to the Summer heat. They nourish Yin and generate body fluids, reduce toxins, and keep the body cool by clearing heat. This is a perfect time (and the only time) we recommended incorporating raw/cold foods into the diet. Fresh fruits, veggies, salads, and smoothies are all okay right now. Make sure to stay hydrated throughout the day. You can add in fresh mint, cucumber, and lemon to your water which are all cooling and detoxing. The emotion associated with Summer is Joy and the color is Red. Traditionally it is said that we should have a happy demeanor and not hold grudges during this time. Everything we do should come from a place of joy and be done with happiness and laughter. It is also a good time to heal emotional wounds. Summer is often the time of year we have all been waiting for. There is a more laid-back and care-free vibe that we all can benefit from after long and cold winters. Living alongside the changing seasons helps us stay healthy all year long and stay in harmony with nature, which is the basis of Chinese Medicine. Summer Foods to Incorporate: Food with cool and cold properties can clear heat, reduce toxins, and generate body fluids. In general, cooling foods tend towards the green end of the spectrum - lots of fresh veggies especially lettuce, cucumbers, and watercress which are some of the coolest. Fish and seafood are cooling as well. Here are some examples of cooling foods that will keep you balanced during the summer and help your body adjust to the long hot summer days! Watermelon Apricot Cantaloupe Lemon Peach Orange Strawberries Tomatoes Asparagus Sprouts Bamboo Bok choy Broccoli Chinese cabbage Corn Cucumber White mushroom Snow peas Spinach Summer squash Watercress Seaweed Mung means Cilantro Mint Dill Seafood, Fish Takeaway Tips for the Summer Season: Make sure to stay extra hydrated because we are losing more fluids. This is the one time it is okay to add ice to your favorite drinks and have cold smoothies. Keep a pitcher of water with slices of lemon and cucumber with you and sip it throughout the day. This is a perfect time (and the only time) we recommended incorporating raw/cold foods into the diet. Fresh fruits, veggies, salads, and smoothies are all okay right now. Eat in moderation. In summer, indigestion can easily occur, so a light and less-greasy diet is strongly recommended. Over consumption of any food, especially cooling foods, can lead to indigestion, sluggishness and possibly diarrhea. Stay away from dairy, heavy, greasy, and fried foods. Also avoid dark meats which tend to be warmer in nature. It is also a good time to heal emotional wounds. "}
