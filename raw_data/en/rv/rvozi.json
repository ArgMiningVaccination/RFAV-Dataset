Combined, they make a potent elixir that has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. Golden milk is made by simmering dairy or non-dairy milk with turmeric, cinnamon, ginger and other spices. The resulting drink is a rich, creamy, and anti-inflammatory powerhouse that is perfect for sipping on, any time of day ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/)). Curious about what happens when these two spices team up? Keep reading to learn all about the possible benefits of golden milk and how to make your own at home. What's In Turmeric And Cinnamon Tea? Turmeric is a spice that has been used in Indian cuisine for centuries. Its main active ingredient, curcumin, is a powerful [anti-inflammatory](https://betterme.world/articles/ginger-turmeric-tea-facts-benefits-side-effects/) that has been used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of conditions ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92752/)). Cinnamon is a sweet and warming spice that has also been used medicinally for centuries. Its main active ingredient, cinnamaldehyde, is a potent antioxidant which may have anti-inflammatory and [antibacterial properties](https://betterme.world/articles/barley-tea-benefits-side-effects/) ( [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20924865/)). However, not all cinnamon is the same, and the form you use can make a big difference in terms of its health benefits. Cassia cinnamon, also known as Chinese cinnamon, is the most common type of cinnamon sold in the United States. It's what you'll find in most supermarkets, and you can identify it by its dark reddish-brown color and spicy taste. Cassia cinnamon contains high levels of coumarin, a compound that can be toxic in large amounts. According to the European Food safe authority, cassia cinnamon can cause liver damage if consumed in large quantities. It's also a carcinogen\u2014 meaning it can potentially cause cancer ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466762/)). Don't worry about normal day-to-day use, but you may want to avoid consuming excessive amounts of cassia cinnamon. On the other hand, Ceylon cinnamon, also known as \"true\" cinnamon, is native to Sri Lanka. It's lighter in color and has a milder, sweeter flavor than cassia cinnamon. Ceylon cinnamon contains much lower levels of coumarin, making it a safer choice if you're looking to get the health benefits of cinnamon ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466762/)). Note that research on the health benefits of cinnamon uses the extract which is a potent source of the active compounds. Most powders you'll find in the spice aisle at your grocery store aren't as concentrated as a quality cinnamon extract. You can get cinnamon extract in capsules or liquid form at most health food stores. The turmeric and cinnamon tea recipe also contains the following spices that serve crucial functions: - Black pepper - our bodies are unable to utilize curcumin efficiently (the active ingredient in turmeric) on its own. Black pepper contains an active ingredient called piperine that helps increase the bioavailability of curcumin ( [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/)). - Coconut oil - curcumin is fat-soluble, meaning it is best absorbed by our bodies when consumed with fat. Coconut oil is a source of fat that helps increase the absorption of curcumin and pairs well with the other flavors in golden milk ( [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395784/)). - Ginger - ginger is a warming spice with powerful anti-inflammatory and nausea-reducing properties. It's the perfect addition to this recipe if you're looking to soothe an upset stomach ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019938/)). To make golden milk, you will need ( [8](https://www.thespruceeats.com/turmeric-golden-milk-recipe-4143124)): - 1 1/2 cups whole milk or milk of choice - 1 (1-inch) piece fresh turmeric, peeled and finely grated or minced, about 1 1/2 teaspoons - 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled, and finely grated or minced, about 1 teaspoon - 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract - 3 to 4 whole black peppercorns - 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for garnish - 1 pinch cardamom, optional - 1 to 2 teaspoons raw honey, to taste, optional Instructions: - Add all ingredients except for the honey or maple syrup to a small saucepan. - Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. - Once the mixture has reached a simmer, reduce heat to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes. - Remove pan from heat and strain liquid (if you had used fresh ginger and turmeric, this step is not optional). - Add honey or maple syrup to taste. - Serve immediately.

However, when inflammation becomes chronic, it is associated with a variety of health problems like obesity, heart disease, and cancer. Turmeric and cinnamon are both potent anti-inflammatories that might help reduce chronic inflammation ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92752/)) ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466762/)).

Cinnamon has also been shown to improve cognitive function. One study showed that cinnamon improved attention span and working memory in a group of young adults.

Ginger has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, which helps our bodies better regulate blood sugar levels ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019938/)). Cinnamon has also been shown to lower blood sugar levels by increasing the uptake of glucose into cells and stimulating cellular glucose metabolism, at least in test tube and animal studies ( [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20924865/)).

Curcumin has antioxidant properties, which means it can potentially protect cells from damage caused by oxidative stress ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/)). Cinnamon has also been shown (in a test tube) to reduce the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a type of molecule that contributes to [cell damage](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/8/4/100/htm) ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466762/)). 7.
