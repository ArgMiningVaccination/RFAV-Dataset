What and how you eat, perhaps not surprisingly, play a big role in its management. The foods that are part of a gastroparesis diet are easily digested, which can help you manage related digestive symptoms. The diet is also designed to help you maintain optimal nutrition, which is especially important for preventing some of the concerns that stem from flares. Renee Comet / Getty Images The Gastroparesis Diet Ordinarily, strong, spontaneous muscle contractions propel food through the digestive tract. But if you have gastroparesis, your stomach's motility is slowed to a point where it is simply unable to empty fully. The gastroparesis diet is always the first step to treating this condition after diagnosis. The easy-to-digest foods it promotes put less stress on your gastrointestinal system, reducing a range of uncomfortable symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, bloating, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the focus on nutrient density helps your body weather bouts of appetite loss that often arise during flare-ups. Without a consistent focus on good nutrition, these episodes could lead to malnutrition and unintended weight loss. Following a gastroparesis diet may also help you avoid medications and other treatments for the condition that may be associated with side effects. How It Works The exact science behind the gastroparesis diet isn't completely understood, but research shows specific types of foods can aggravate gastroparesis symptoms. Foods that provoke symptoms are usually acidic, fatty, spicy, or roughage-based. Foods that are commonly tolerated tend to be bitter, salty, bland, or sweet. In the past, gastroparesis dietary advice was based on physiological principles rather than scientific evidence. More recent clinical trials identified specific foods and food characteristics that help improve the comfort level of those living with gastroparesis. The gastroparesis diet is based on that research. While some foods are commonly problematic to most people with gastroparesis, your individual experiences may vary. It may take some time to develop a diet that works best for you. The guidelines provided here can serve as a starting point. Duration There is no cure for gastroparesis. Dietary changes and other treatments (including medications and other options) can help you manage the symptoms. Therefore, you should plan to adopt the gastroparesis diet for the long-term. As you develop a list of foods that help you manage the condition, it may be helpful to keep a food journal. You can also work with your healthcare provider to get food recommendations or ask for a referral to a registered dietitian, who can help you put together a personalized food plan. How to Keep a Food Diary What to Eat and Avoid Studies have shown that eating foods with a small particle size might help to ease symptoms of gastroparesis. Researchers have identified these specific foods as having an impact on the condition. The gastroparesis diet includes the following: Compliant Foods Soda crackers Gelatin Graham crackers Ginger ale Gluten-free foods Tea Potatoes (sweet and white) Pretzels White fish Clear soup Salmon White rice Popsicles Applesauce Non-Compliant Foods Oranges and orange juice Fried chicken Cabbage Sausage Pizza Peppers Onions Tomato juice Lettuce Coffee Salsa Broccoli Bacon Roast beef Carbonated beverages In addition to these foods, several medical sources have provided guidelines about different types of food that can provoke or reduce symptoms. Fatty Foods Dietary fat slows digestion, so following a low-fat diet is usually beneficial. Avoid: Fried non-fat dairyLeaner, softer meats like chicken, turkey, or fish You don't have to completely cut out fat on the gastroparesis diet; just limit your intake. It's okay, for example, to add a bit of sour cream, butter, or margarine to a meal, but only enough to add flavor. Fiber-Rich Foods Fiber is usually something you'd want to increase, but eating too much fiber can further slow gastric motility and make your condition worse. Avoid high-fiber foods like: BroccoliWhole grainsBrown riceDried such as: PastaSoda crackersBananasRipe melon Raw Fruits and Vegetables You don't have to give up fruits and vegetables, but you may need to avoid: Raw vegetables Harder fruits like raw apples Fruits and berries that have pulp or a lot of seeds Instead: Thoroughly steam, roast, or boil veggies until they're soft Choose fruits that are fully ripened, cooked, canned, or juiced (without the pulp) Soft Foods Meals are more likely to be digested more comfortably if they're soft. You have a lot of choices among the softer foods commonly recommended for a gastroparesis diet. Protein: Chicken or turkey (skinless)Canned tuna (packed in water)EggsTofu Grains: White bread and rollsPlain bagelsEnglish muffinsFlour or corn tortillasOatmeal or cream of wheatPuffed rice or wheat cerealRicePastaCottage cheese Dairy: Yogurt (without root or mashed potato (no skin)Sweet potato (no skin)Fruit and vegetable juices (no pulp)Canned peaches, pears, and removed)Bananas Other: Broth and low-fat pureed soupsGelatin desserts Liquid Foods According to the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, your healthcare provider may recommend that you drink your nutrition if you can't tolerate solid foods. These drinks may include liquid nutrition meals or solid foods pur\u00e9ed in a blender. Your healthcare provider may also recommend that you drink plenty of water or liquids that contain glucose and electrolytes, such as: Low-fat broths and clear soupsLow-fiber fruit and juicesSports drinksOral rehydration solutions Timing and Tips With gastroparesis, your stomach is less able to transport food into your small intestine. Instead of eating three large meals per day, try eating six or more smaller meals every two to three hours. It can help reduce the burden on your stomach. Cooking Tips You may not have time to cook five or six times each day, so plan to cook meals in bulk and divide them into small containers to be enjoyed later. You might also want to cut and freeze fruit to use in smoothies or juices. Steam vegetables in advance, then store them in microwavable containers to reheat as needed. To reduce fat in meals, use cooking methods that don't include oils or butter. Roast meat and seafood, steam vegetables, or grill foods to keep them lean. Modifications Nutritional deficiencies are not uncommon while on a gastroparesis diet. Studies have shown that many people with gastroparesis have diets deficient in calories, vitamins, and minerals. For instance, a large study published in the journal Gastroenterology tracked over 300 patients with gastroparesis to evaluate their calorie and nutrient intake. They found that, on average, study participants consumed under 1,200 calories per day\u2014equivalent to about 58% of their total caloric needs. Additionally, many study participants were deficient in important vitamins and minerals, most notably: Vitamin C Vitamin D Vitamin K Folate Calcium Iron Magnesium Potassium Unfortunately, research has also indicated that people with the condition rarely get nutritional consultation. In the study, only a third of the participants received dietary therapy. However, those who did were 1.5 times more likely to have their daily caloric intake reach 85% or more of their daily requirement. For this reason, medical experts suggest dietary therapy to address nutritional deficiencies. If you are managing another condition, such as diabetes, a registered dietitian can work together with you and the rest of your healthcare team to manage a comprehensive treatment strategy. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about any medications you're taking. Certain drugs slow gastric emptying and may make symptoms worse. Examples include: Aluminum-containing antacids Narcotic (opioid) pain medications Anticholinergic agents Bulk-forming agents How Medications Affect Your Stomach Considerations Living with gastroparesis can be easier with support and knowledge. Your healthcare team may be able to direct you to a support community affiliated with a hospital or health center near you. Talking to others, sharing experiences, and gathering tips can help you to feel less alone as you manage the condition. If a support group isn't available near you, online resources may be helpful. The International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders is a nonprofit education and research organization that provides substantial information about living with gastroparesis. Their website offers helpful guidance including travel tips, personal stories, and advice to make day-to-day living more comfortable. A Word From Verywell Changing what and how you eat can help you to stay energized and healthy when you have gastroparesis. It will probably take a bit of trial and error to find what works best for you. Unfortunately, there is no single gastroparesis diet that relieves symptoms for everyone. Stay connected to your healthcare team as you journey through the experience of experimenting with foods and meal timing. Frequently Asked Questions What's a good gastroparesis diet if I have diabetes? A lot of the approved foods on a gastroparesis diet are rich in carbs. Since this can impact blood glucose control and diabetes management, it's especially recommended that you seek advice from a dietitian. Can probiotics help gastroparesis? It is unclear whether probiotics can help gastroparesis. A small study investigating the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus gasseri on delayed gastric emptying failed to show any improvements in gastric motility. What causes gastroparesis to flare up? A gastroparesis flare-up can be caused by eating foods that delay stomach emptying. Fat, fiber, alcohol, and large meals can trigger symptoms. In addition, smoking tobacco or emotional stress can also slow digestion and cause discomfort. What does gastroparesis pain feel like? Gastroparesis pain can range from dull to sharp and is commonly felt in the upper stomach or intestinal area. This pain is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, bloating, and weight loss. 13 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
