However, there are times when even I get sidetracked and need a whole body \"refresher\" to remind me of the power of energy healing. That's why I partnered with SimonSays to create a comprehensive \"refresher\" course called Energy Healing Cleanse: Detox Your Mind, Body and Spirit. This workbook brings you some of the exercises and information from that course. I realize that many of us lead very busy lives and sometimes, despite our best efforts, we lose touch with different aspects of our lives, such as our bodies, our relationships, our finances, and our spiritual connection. The exercises in this course always light the way for a deeper understanding of who I am and what my true purpose is while here on earth. I know you'll appreciate the incredible value and energy healing wisdom reminders in this workbook. If you feel a need for an energy healing \"refresher,\" like I do from time to time, remember the power energy healing brings to your life in terms of better health, increased happiness and abundance. There's so much here for you! Dear Course Taker, You have my love and blessings, Deborah KingEXERCISE: METTA MEDITATION This meditative exercise is called metta, which means loving-kindness. Metta is a practice of learning how to forgive yourself and others and to rid yourself of that habit of self-blame. This heart-opening exercise will make you feel great while reducing your emotional toxicity. First, you start by extending loving-kindness to yourself by repeating the following phrases. Repeat after me, either silently or out loud: I am safe I am happy I am healthy I am at peace Now choose someone you're close to that you like, and do the same for them, mentally turn to that person and say: You are safe You are happy You are healthy You are at peace Next, pick someone you are neutral about, neither really liking nor disliking them, and turning to that person, say with me: You are safe You are happy You are healthy You are at peace And finally pick someone you don't like, and turning toward that person, say with me: You are safe You are happy You are healthy You are at peace EXERCISE: ABUNDANCE AFFIRMATIONS AND MANTRAS How do you move from \"poverty thinking\" to \"prosperity thinking?\" When your thoughts about money are focused on what you do not have, you can wind up with more scarcity and frustration. It's the exact opposite of how you want to feel. By focusing your energy on the positive and being grateful for what you already have, you can start a new cycle of abundance. Here are some affirmations about money that really do work. Money flows into my life with ease. I attract money like a magnet. I am wealthy at this very moment. I have great abundance. I always have enough money. Money comes to me in unexpected ways. I am financially secure. There is a mystical Hindu invocation for abundance. Reach out to the goddess Lakshmi. She is the giver of wealth\u2014the personification of prosperity and good fortune. This Lakshmi mantra is not only for prosperity, but for good health and good relationships, and also to enlighten you with understanding. It's kind of an \"all purpose\" mantra! Either silently or out loud, repeat the sound SHREEM as often as possible during the day until it becomes second nature for you. SHREEM, SHREEM, SHREEM. You are invoking the presence of the goddess of wealth and aligning your energy with hers! EXERCISE: RELATIONSHIP WITH YOURSELF AND OTHERS Ask yourself these questions: What do you appreciate most about yourself? ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ What talents and abilities those questions? Maybe you think you've messed up too badly in your life to believe you can be lovable. You don't need to keep carrying that burden of guilt and shame. If you stop demeaning yourself, stop putting yourself down, you can move on. Examine what you did that your inner critic says is so \"unforgivable\" or \"unlovable,\" and see how often it involves a relationship. As humans, we are capable of making mistakes that hurt others, but that doesn't mean that what we've done can't be forgiven. The problem is, by thinking less of yourself, by withholding self-love and self-forgiveness, you wind up feeling separated and alone. Here's how to turn off that inner critic that finds fault with everything you do and punishes you over and over again for things that happened a long time ago. Shiva and Parvati(Krishna and Radha) First, figure out what you think about yourself: \"I'm bad because . . .\" and then finish the sentence. Make a mental or written note of that sentence. Now that you know what you're thinking about yourself, ask yourself how you feel about it. It's okay to feel angry, full of fear, resentful, needy or depressed. It's only by acknowledging your feelings that they can be processed. ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Now take that repeating thought or feeling, the negative one about yourself, and form an intention to delete that internal tape that keeps demeaning you, making you feel small and unsuccessful. Every time that negative self-talk comes up in your mind again in the future, hit the delete button again. ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In its place, hear or say the Sanskrit word \"KLEEM.\" It's the seed sound of the Vedic archetype of the Hindu Goddess, Parvati, who blesses relationships. This special sound tells the universe that you are ready to fill an empty space in your energy field with the white light of self-forgiveness, filling the space with love for you. Now, if you want to attract an intimate partner, repeat the mantra: OM KLEEM KRISHNAYA NAMAHA. The vibration of this mantra calls in Krishna, the divine lover, and brings his magnetic energy to attract the partner you're wishing for.1 2 3 4EXERCISE: GETTING GROUNDED How do you learn to listen to your very wise body? The first thing to do is to get out of your head and plant your feet on the ground. When you are grounded, you will actually be able to feel your emotions and allow them to flow through you. You'll be able to bring your first chakra, or energy center at the base of your spine, into balance, and this will support your entire energy field and body. The energy center at the base of your spine is related to the element of earth, the densest of all the elements. Your legs and feet root you to the earth. Roots, like the roots of a tree, both penetrate the earth by pushing down into the soil, and are receptive, bringing up nourishment from the earth. Just like a tree, you have to be able to \"hold your ground,\" and get the support and nourishment you need from Mother Earth. Here is an exercise for getting grounded: Close your eyes. Sit with your feet on the ground. Take a deep breath in. Exhale through your mouth. AHHH. Imagine you are breathing in and out through your heart center, right there in the middle of your chest. Take in a breath and, as you exhale, send your awareness all the way down your body, down your legs, and through the bottom of your feet into the earth. Feel your energy penetrating the earth, planting your energetic roots solidly in the ground beneath your feet. As you breathe back in, inhale energy up from the earth, through the soles of your feet, up your legs, up through your torso and into your heart center. Stay connected to the earth and take a couple more breaths. See how much more stable you feel! More secure in your own being. The winds of fortune may blow, but, like the tree, you will bend and not break as long as your roots are firmly planted in the earth.1 2 3 4THE CHAKRAS Chakra 1 (muladhara)\u2014bottom of the spine. The root chakra is connected with survival of the individual as a separate being. It is the foundation of the entire energy system and relates to the earth, and being grounded. The key issues here are safety, trust, nourishment, health, home, family and tribe. Chakra 2 (sradhishthana)\u2014halfway between the sacrum and the navel. This chakra is connected to the element of water, so it relates to all bodily functions that involve fluid, like tears and blood. It is the womb of creativity and the home of the \"inner child\"\u2014both the divine child and the wounded child. It is the center of sensuality and sexuality, emotion and pleasure. A key issue here is the balance between giving and receiving. Chakra 3 (manipura)\u2014midway between the navel and the sternum. The solar plexus chakra is connected with power and mastery, and maintains your individual identity. It's connected with the element of fire. Unlike the first two chakras, this one sends its energy upward, where it fires up your metabolic processes and ignites consciousness. It is the source of your will and personal power. Chakra 4 (anahata)\u2014the heart region. The heart chakra is connected to the element of air. The heart chakra is the bridge between the first three physical chakras and the upper chakras which are nonphysical. It is also the bridge between yourself and others, so its key issues relate to love and relationships. Love, here, is an internal state, related to compassion, understanding, and care. It's all about balance within yourself as well as with the world around you. Giving and receiving love is the central function of this chakra. Chakra 5 (vishuddha)\u2014at the throat. The basic principle of the throat chakra is communication. It is associated with ether or sound, and is the portal through which you bring spirit into the physical realm by expressing your spirit. It is the seat of creativity. The key issue here is speaking your truth\u2014expressing who you are, what you feel, and what you believe in in verbal and nonverbal ways. Voice and choice, this chakra is the seat of inner guidance. Chakra 6 (ajna)\u2014the \"third eye\" between the eyebrows.The sixth chakra is connected to the element of light, and your \"third eye\" is flooded with information in the form of images. Here is where you create, receive, interpret and store visual information. It is the seat of higher seeing, as in clairvoyance, or seeing beyond this plane. It is also the source of intuition, and of ecstasy. Memory and dreams are other aspects of this chakra. Chakra 7 (sahasrara)\u2014at the top of the head. The \"crown of creation\" connects to thoughts, consciousness, and intelligence\u2014all the aspects of mind, and the whole process of knowing. Here, in the seat of enlightenment, the thousand-fold lotus opens in cosmic consciousness. Chakra 8 (padaka)\u2014located several feet above the top of the head. The \"star\" chakra protects your physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies, and acts as the root of divine energy in your energy system. Here you ascend to the level of the Bodhisattva\u2014full of compassion and totally selfless. It is the first of the transpersonal chakras. From here, you allow the light of Spirit to fill your body. It is the center of divine love. THE HINDU DEITIES Lakshmi is the Hindu goddess who is the embodiment of beauty and grace, as well as the goddess of prosperity, wealth and fortune. She is the shakti (feminine spiritual energy) of Lord Vishnu, the Preserver. When Vishnu incarnated on Earth as Rama, she also came as his wife, Sita. When Vishnu incarnated as Krishna, she was both Radha (his gopi-consort) and Rukmini (his wife). The ancient prayers that are dedicated to Lakshmi are supplications for both material and spiritual wealth. Parvati is the mother goddess in Hinduism, encompassing love, fertility, devotion, divine strength and power. She is the wife of Lord Shiva, the Destroyer, and the mother of Ganesh and Skanda. As such, she is held as the ideal householder who nurtures society. Her name means \"daughter of the mountain,\" and her father is King Himavan, the Himalayas. Parvati is the gentle aspect of Shakti, the voice of encouragement and freedom. In her fierce aspect, she is known as Durga and Kali. Krishna is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and his life on Earth was one of divine play (called lilas). He was a mischievous child and youth, a playmate and lover of the gopis (milkmaids; Krishna was a cowherd in his youth), especially Radha. As a prince, he was a friend of Arjuna and the hero and voice of wisdom in the Bhagavad Gita. In his later years as the King of Dwarka, he married Rukmini. Krishna is considered to be the embodiment of divine love, and is widely revered as a protector, hero, leader, teacher and friend. "}
