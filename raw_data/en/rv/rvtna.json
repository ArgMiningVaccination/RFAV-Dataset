Thank you for visiting my website. I am homeopath and intuitive healing mentor. I work with clients throughout the United States and Canada by phone, and also in person at my office in Austin, Texas. My passion is to bring insight, hope and healing to individuals and families impacted by chronic health and life challenges. I support clients with homeopathy and other self-help tools to assist with healing and health- empowerment. Our bodies are made to heal, but physical and emotional stress in our fast-pace world can cause our health to get out of balance. Through the years, I have helped hundreds of individuals with a variety of issues including metal toxicity, asthma, anxiety, Lyme, fungal and gut issues, ASD/Autism, PANDAS/PANS, chronic fatigue, adverse vaccine reactions, recurrent infections, and hormonal imbalance. I have a deep love and respect for individuals, children and families impacted by chronic illness. See [my story](https://energyhealinghomeopathy.com/my-healing-journey-part-one/) to learn about how I healed of interstitial cystitis, and then years later of chronic Lyme disease. I specialize in sorting out complex issues and helping individuals find solutions. I use a variety of homeopathic tools, including my signature method-Deep Healing Homeopathy. I also use drainage and support remedies as needed, including gemmotherapy extracts, biological immune support, Byron White Formulas, and custom miasmatic remedies to heal ancestral trauma and/or genetic tendencies. My experience with complex cases over 17 years has taught me to see each individual uniquely, not make assumptions or jump to protocols. I sort things out and find what works. [Deep Healing Homeopathy](https://energyhealinghomeopathy.com/services/my-approach-to-healing/) is a powerful yet gentle homeopathic method that allows gentle detoxification (unlayering) of past physical and emotional traumas. Combining detox with simple homeopathic drainage support ensures that the body's detoxification organs and glands are toned and open so that toxins and traumas can be released gently. When past physical and emotional traumas are cleared energetically, the individual's vibration naturally rises and the true, healthy version is revealed. Would you like to clear traumas of the past and find your true healthy self?
