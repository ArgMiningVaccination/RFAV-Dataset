Excludes gift vouchers Here is a Question from One of Our Customers: I have been diagnosed with cancer for about a year and half now. I have gone through chemo and radiation. I am interested in getting a crystal to fight my battle with cancer, not chemo or radiation. I have a friend who makes wraps and puts crystals in them. If you don't know what I mean, its ok, its not that important. However, I wanted to know about the crystals under the cancer category. What does general mean? Do the crystals do anything in specific? Is there a specific crystal for saliva gland cancer which i have? Answer: Dear M, I must share the standard disclaimer that I am not a doctor and cannot give out medical advice. Crystals for healing should be used as a compliment to other therapies and not as a replacement for regular medical care. Cancer is a topic I am asked about more and more often.

Combines best with Garnets, Emerald, Dioptase for enhanced healing. There you have it, our entire list of cancer healing stones. I hope I was able to answer your questions. The best rule of thumb is to use no more then 4 or 5 stones at a time. As Watermelon Tourmaline is a more readily available stone I would combine it with 3 or 4 of the others. If you have a source for the Vesuvianite use it with the Emerald, and a couple of the Garnets. I have had a lot of success with the Malachite so that is an option. Larimar would be an excellent choice for you type of cancer. While my choices are chosen from my experience, you must be the final judge on which crystals to use. You could use all and while some are clearing the negative energy, the others could be cleaning, clearing and charging. With cancer I have found that you have to clear almost every night as the energy is so dense.
