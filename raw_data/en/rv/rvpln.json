CAM includes diverse therapies outside the realm of conventional medicine. Overall, 76 percent of healthcare workers report CAM usage,compared with 63 percent of the general working population. Healthcare workers use chiropractic, massage, and acupuncture for conditions that conventional medicine does not address well, said study co-author Lori Knutson, executive director of the Penny George Institutefor Health and Healing with Allina Hospitals and Clinics in Minneapolis.While conventional providers often treat common issues such as back painwith pain medication, holistic providers address root causes, she said. The researchers used data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, analyzing responses from 14,329 working adults. Their findingsappear online in the journal Health Services Research. to read this article in its entirety, visit www.ChiroEco.com/holisticmedicine.
