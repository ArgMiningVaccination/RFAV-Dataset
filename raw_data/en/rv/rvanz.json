The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Children's Hospital Medical Center and the affiliated entities as discussed in Note 1(a). These entities are under common ownership and management. Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - 2 - We believe that the audit evidence we have ob tained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cincinnati Children's as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of their oper ations and their consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Information Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and the accompanying schedule is presented for the purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic consolidated financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic consolidated financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic consolidated financial statements or to the basic consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated October 18, 2017 on our consideration of Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Cincinnati Children's is an Ohio not-for-profit corporation pro viding pediatric healthcare servi ces, teaching and related resear ch. R iver City is a captive insurance company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Childre n's. CHSN is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's whose purpos e is to manage primary care practices in a communit y setting. NKCMS was a li mited liability corporation formed to enhance the scope and quality of pediatric care in Northern Kentucky. Effective October 31, 2015 NKCMS was dissolved. Burnet, DTPM2 L LC, BACE are wholly-owned subsid iaries of Cincinnati Children's, whose purpose is to hold land. TSHCH is a wholly-owned subsidia ry of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to acquire, hold, develop, subdivide, sell, lease, mortgage, manage and otherwise deal in real property. (b) Supporting Organizations--The Children's Hospital (TCH) and Convalescent Hosp ital for Children and Orphan Asylum (CHCOA) are both Ohio not-for-profit corporations that provide financial support to Cincinnati Children's . Certain endowment funds of these supporting organizations are restricted by the donors for specific operating purposes of Cincinnati Children's and are recorded asInterest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally , as discussed below , effective July 1, 2016, TCH a mended its purpose clause to solely support Cincinnati Children's and thus, the unrestricted net as sets of TCH are included in Inter est in Net Assets in Supporting Organizations as of June 30, 2017. Re ceipts from such restricted endowment funds and cert ain other receipts that are designated by the Boards of Trustees of the supporting or ganizations for sp ecific operating purposes are reflected as a comp onent of restricted gifts and contributions in the accompanying Consolidated Statem ents of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Upon utilization in operations, such funds are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net As sets as other-restricted net as sets used to support operations. Changes in the fair value of Interest in Net Assets of Supporti ng Organizations are recorded as a Gain (Loss) in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Other funds are contributed to Cincinnati Children's as designa ted by the Boards of the supporti ng organizations to pro vide genera l support and are reflected as r eceipts from supporting or ganizations in the acco mpanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Chan ges in Net Assets. Cincinnati Children's records in its consolidated financial statements the fair value of certain temporarily and permanently restricted net assets held by suppo rting organizations on its behalf. Effective July 1, 2016, TCH's Boa rd of Trustees amended their A rticles of Incorporation naming Cincinnati Children's as its sole-beneficiary. The impact of this amendment is Unrestricted NetAssets of TCH are recorded in Cin cinnati Children's consolidated financial statements as an increase in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations and an in crease in Temporarily Restricted Net - 7 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidat ed Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 2Assets. The impact of the amendment to the purpose clause as o f July 1, 2016, was to increase Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations and a gain i n Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations of $776,504. (c) Support Received from Supporting Organizations-- In general, the supporting organizations provide annual support to Cincinnati Children's that includes the divid end and interest earnings of the respective investment portfolios (net of operational expenses a nd any donor required reinvestment of income). On occasion, the respective Boards of Trustees of the se supporting organizations may also designate certain pledges of unrestricted principal in support of key projects at Cincinnati Children's. As of June 30, 2017, TCH had outstanding revocable pledges of $260,000. All outstanding pledges of principal support are revocable at the discretion of TCH's B oard of Trustees. As a result, such revocable pledges are not record ed as receivables in the accomp anying consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, TCH t ransferred $59,189 and $55,20 1, respectively, of temporarily restricted net assets to Cincinna ti Children's which are recorded as Gifts, contributions and other income in the Consolidated State ments of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, TCH transferred $3, 357 and $4,150, respectively, of unrestricted net assets to Cincinnati Children's, w hich are recorded as Receipts from Supporting Organizations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets . During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, Cincinnati Ch ildren's transferred $68,400 and $23,250 of unrestricted net assets to TCH to create funds designated to support divisional activitiesand strategic priorities. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, CHCOA transferred $3,283 and $2,27 2 respectively, to Cincinnati Children's which are recorded as Gifts, contributions and other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. At June 30, 2016, Cincinnati Children's had a payable to CHCOA for $20, which was repaid through a reduction in support in fiscal 2017. There was no such payab le at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, Cincinnati Children's has a receivable from CHCOA for $1,542 and $4,000, respectively, related to an irrevocable pledge to be pa id in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 in support of the renovation of the College Hill facility. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, Cincinnati Children's has a receivable from TCH of $10,587 related to the expected payment from TCH upon maturity of a life insurance policy. Additionally at June 30,2017, Cincinnati Children's has a receivable from TCH of $22 re lated to income transfers, which will be paid in fiscal 2018. (d) Concentration of Patient Account s Receivable and Revenue and Revenue Recognition--In both fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, substantially all of total net hos pital patient service revenue is derived from third-party payment programs (Medicaid, insurance companie s and various managed care agreements). - 8 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidat ed Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 3The following details the percen tage of net hospital patient se rvice revenue by payer category for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Gross Net Gross Net 1% - 1% - The following details the percentage of accounts receivable by payer category as of June 30, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Commercial insurers 2% 1% 7% 6% Self pay 1% 2% Specialty contracts are single cas e agree m ents or contracts for specialty services, such as transplants. Net hospital patient service revenue is reported at estimated n et realizable amounts from patients, third party payers and others for services rendered and include s estimated retroactive revenue adjustments due to future audits and reviews. Retroactive adj ustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an est imated basis in the period the related services are rendered, and such amounts are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become kn own or as years are no longer subject to such audits and reviews. Cincinnati Children's recognizes net hospital patient service r evenue associated with services provided to patients who have thi rd-party payer coverage on the basis of estimated contractual rates for services rendered. For uninsur ed patients that do not qual ify for charity care, Cincinnati Children's recognizes net hospita l patient service revenue on t he basis of its standard rates for services provided (or on the basis of discounted rates, if nego tiated or provided by policy). On the basis of historical experience, a significant portion of Cincin nati Children's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, Ci ncinnati Children's records a provision for bad debts related to uninsur ed patients in the period the s ervices are provided. Revenue from government (Medicai d and Medicare) programs accoun ted for approximately 26% and 25%, respectively, of Cincinnati Children's net hospital patien t service revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, r espectively. Laws and regulatio ns governing the Medicaid and Medicare programs are extremely complex and subject to interpre tation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that record ed estimates will change a ma terial amount in the near term. At June 30, 2017, Cincinnati Children's h as settled all Medicaid cost r eports through 2011 and all Medicare cost reports through 2015. - 9 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 4The following table reconciles gross patient service revenue to net hospital patient service revenue for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Charges at established on commercial contractuals (353,663) (335,402) Write-downs related to services to the poor: Including Medicaid and governmental contractuals, charity care and other uncollectible self pay 1,564,165 33,696 26,523 Net Hospital Patient Service Revenue $1,602,561 $1,611,570 Patient accounts receivable and re lated allowances for contract ual adjustments and doubtful accounts are recorded on an accrual basis at estimated collection rates to report patient accounts receivable at net realizable value. Accounts receivable are reduced by an al lowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, Cincinnati Children's performs a detail review of current accounts, analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payer sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. Management regularly reviews data abou t these major payer sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowances. For r eceivables associated with services provided to patients who have a third-party coverage, Cincinnat i Children's analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowa nce for contractuals (for exa mple, for expected unrecoverable amounts based on contract provisions on accounts for which the third-party payer has not yet paid, or for payers who are known to be having financial difficulties th at make the realization of amounts due unlikely). For receivables associated with self-pay patients ( which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and copayment balances d ue for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), Cincinnati Children's records a p rovision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates th at many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts ha ve been exhausted is charged of f against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Cincinnati Children's allowance for doubtful accounts for self- pay patients was 22.5% and 21.5% of self-pay accounts receivable at J une 30, 2017 and 2016. In add ition, Cincinnati Child ren's bad debt write-offs (before recoveries) to taled approximately $27,912 and $27,302 for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. C incinnati Children's does not maintain a material allowance for doubtful accounts from third-party payers nor does it have significant write-offs from third-party payers. Cincinnati Children's does maintain an allowance for contractual write-offs for third party payers in order to appropriately reduce receivables to net real izable value. - 10 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 5A summary of activity in Cincinnati Children's provision for do ubtful accounts for the year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 related to patient receivables is as fol lows: Balance at Beginning of Year Provision for doubtful Accounts Accounts written off, Net of recoveries Balance at End of Year Year Ended June 30, 2017 $12,684 $12,740 $(14,762) $(13,125) $12,684 The Consolidated Balance Sheet also includes $68,500 and $63,67 4 of contractual reserves related to net patient receivables as of June 30, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable related to professional services billings i s included in Other Receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. (e) Capitation Revenue - Cincinnati Ch ildren's has agreements with two Ohio Medicaid managed care companies, covering approximately 31,900 and 31,000 children, r espectively, in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, to provide for reimbursement under a variable capitation methodology for hospital services. Under these two contracts, all physician and home care services continue to be reimbursed based on provider fee schedules. The hospital services are reimbursed t hrough a variable capitation payment which represents the amount remaining after payment has been ma de for (a) Cincinnati Children's physician services, (b) Cincinnati Children's home care service s, and (c) services provided to members outside the Cincinnati Children's network. Under deleg ation agreements, Health Network by Cincinnati Children's receives fixed payments to perform the required medical management, care management and care coordination functions. Medicaid managed c are organizations retain risk for payments to providers. Subsequent to June 30, 2017, Cin cinnati Children's renegotiated both contracts providing variable capitation payments to change the reimbursement methodology to be consistent with traditional Medicaid reimbursement. (f) Grant Revenue and Other Revenue -- Grants and contributions restricted for a specific operating purpose are recorded as temporarily restricted net assets and reflected in unrestricted revenues, gains, and other support when the funds are expended in accordance wit h the specifications of the grantor or donor. Contributions for capital expenditures, recorded as tem porarily restricted net assets when received, are recorded as net assets released from restrictions used for the purchase of property and equipment when expended. Unrestricted contributions and beques ts are included in other revenue when received.

Assets limited as to use are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in investment income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. (m) Investment Income--The following details the components of inve stment income on marketable securities and funds in trust for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Interest income $23,634 $15,026 Unrealized and realized (losses) gains, ne t (2,446) 10,443 Investment income $21,188 $25,469 - 12 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 7(n) Fair Value Measurements\u2014Cincinnati Children's accounts for its assets and liabilities under ASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurements\". As de fined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to trans fer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and com parability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hiera rchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted Prices (unadjusted) in active markets for ide ntical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement d ate for assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Leve l 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These include quot ed prices for identical o r similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are a few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotat ions vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by c orrelation or other means. Level 3: Unobservable inputs, developed using Cincinnati Chil dren's estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that the market participants would use. Su ch inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the l owest priority to Level 3 inputs. Determining where an asset or liability falls within the hiera rchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. In determining fair value, Cincinnati Children's utilizes valuation t echniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. - 13 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidat ed Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 8The table below includes the major categorization for debt and equity securities on the basis of the nature and risk of the i nvestments at June 30, 2017.

Furthermore, although management believes its valuati on methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in different fair value meas urement at the reporting date. Cincinnati Children's uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of common stock and mutual funds; su ch items are classified as Lev el 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Cincinnati Children's primarily bases fair value for investmen ts in fixed income securities, including U.S. government securities, municipal bonds and corporate oblig ations on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and considers the counterparty credit rating. S uch items are classifie d as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Cincinnati Children's investment in High Yield Corporate Oblig ations is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to achieve superior fixed income returns on invested funds through exposure to highe r quality, less volatile, high yield debt securities. As set forth in the LLC agreement, the LLC will dissolve on March 29, 2040, but may dissolve earlier under certain conditions. Any Investing Member may elect to withdraw, in who le or in part from the LLC on the last business day of any month or at such other date, as determ ined by the manager. The High Yield Corporate Obligations is measured at fair value using the net a sset value per share practical expedient. ASC 825 permits entities to choose to measure many financial in struments and certain other items at fair value. Entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting da te. Cincinnati Children's elect ed to measure its high yield corporate obligation investment fund under the provisions of ASC 825. In the future, Cincinnati Children's may elect to measure certain additional financial instruments a t fair value in accordance with this standard. The guaranteed insurance contract is recorded based on discount ed cash flows, which is an approximation of fair value. Cincinnati Children's Level 3 investment is primarily in a guar anteed insurance contract. This investment is classified as Level 3 based on time restrictions for redemption. The following is a reconciliation of the roll forward of the fa ir value measurements using significant unobservable inputs for fiscal 2017: Balance at July 1, 2016 $2,321 Purchases 1,250 Unrealized gains 40 Sales (858) Balance at June 30, 2017 $2,753 The amount of total gains or losses for the period included in changes in net assets attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to assets still held at June 30, 2017 $40 - 16 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 11The following is a reconciliation of the roll forward of the fa ir value measurements using significant unobservable inputs for fiscal 2016: Balance at July 1, 2015 $3,069 Purchases 1,205 Unrealized losses (24) Sales (1,929) Balance at June 30, 2016 $2,321 The amount of total gains or losses for the period included in changes in net assets attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to assets still held at June 30, 2016 $(24) Cincinnati Children's policy is to recognize transfers in and o ut as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. For the year s ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no material transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3. (o) Property and Equipment--P roperty and equipment are stat ed at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to forty years, as follows: Land Improvements 3-25 years Buildings and Building Improvements 5-40 years E q u i p m e n t 3 - 2 5 y e a r s Amortization of assets leased under capital leases is includ ed in depreciation. Cincinnati Children's evaluates long-lived assets under the pro visions of ASC 360 \"Property Plant and Equipment\". During fiscal 2017 and 2016, Cincinnati Childr en's recorded losses of $4,404 and $3,340, respectively, related to impairment of land values based on a fair market value assessment of the estimated sales price Cincinnati Children's would expect to receive upon sale of this land. (p) Costs of Borrowing--Interest incurred on borrowed funds, net of interest earned on restricted bond funds, during the period of cons truction of capital assets is c apitalized as a compone nt of the cost of acquiring those assets. In fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, Cincinnati Children's capitalized $420 and $48 of interest related to construction in progress. Total cash pa id for interest was approximately $27,029 and $24,975 and in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Deferred bond issuance costs a nd original issue discounts are a mortized using the effective interest method over the period the relate d obligation is outstanding. (q) Temporarily Restricted Net Assets--Temporarily restricted net assets are those whose use by Cincinnati Children's has been limited by donors to a specific purpose. Temporarily restricted net assets and net assets released from donor restrictions are prim arily comprised of net assets restricted to support operations. Substan tially all of these net assets a re restricted by donors to support research, education and other advances in clinical care and prevention. The amount of temporarily restricted net assets whose use by Cincinnati Children's has been limited by donors for a specific purpose was $140,744 and $137,194 at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. - 17 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 12Temporarily restricted net assets related to assets held in end owments at supporting organizations on Cincinnati Children's behalf are either donor restricted to sup port research at Cincinnati Children's, deferred gift programs, or life insurance contracts where the r estriction is a time restriction tied to the life expectancy of the donor or unrestricted assets that are su bject to Board discretion on utilization at Cincinnati Children's. The amount of temporarily restricted ne t assets held at supporting organizations was $964,279 and $ 18,364 at June 30, 2017 and 201 6, respectively. (r) Permanently Restricted Net Assets\u2014 Permanently restrict ed net assets related to assets held at Cincinnati Children's are gifts to Cincinnati Children's restri cted by the donor to be maintained in perpetuity and are recorded in Assets Limited to Use in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Permanently restricted net assets held at Cincinnati C hildren's with expendable investment income restricted by donors was $2,719 and $1,803 at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The assets underlying such permanently restricted net assets held a t Cincinnati Children's are primarily equity securities. Permanently restricted net assets related to assets held in end owments at supporting organizations on Cincinnati Children's behalf are r estricted by the donor to be maintained in perpetuity and are recorded in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as they are held by supporting organizations. T he amount of permanently restricted net assets held at supporting organizations with expendable investment income restricted by donors was $1,483,295 and $1,359,091 at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respec tively. The assets underlying Cincinnati Children's permanently restricted net assets held by supporting organizations have been invested primarily in equity securities. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, permanently restricted net assets consisted of the following amounts with expendable investment income restricted by donors to be us ed for the following purposes: 2017 2016 Research activities $1,407,224 $1,159,700 Clinical activities $1,360,894 (s) Excess of Revenues Over Expenses--The Consolidated Stateme nts of Operations and Changes in Net Assets include \"excess of revenu es over expenses.\" Changes in unrestricted net assets which are excluded from excess of revenues over expenses include receipts from supporting organizations, transfers to supporting organizations, pension and post-retirement health liability adjustment, and contributions of long-lived assets (including assets acquired using contributions which by donor restrictions were to be used for the purpose of acquiring such assets). (t) Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liab ilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (u) New Accounting Pronouncements - - In May 2014, the FASB iss ued ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topi c 606).\" ASU 2014-09 will elimin ate the transaction- and industry- - 18 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 13specific revenue recognition guidance currently in place under generally accepted accounting principles and will replace it w ith a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 was amended by ASU 2015-14 and will be effective fo r annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 , and early adoption is permit ted. Management is still assessing the impact of adopting the new standard on the consolidated fin ancial statements and related disclosures. Furthermore, ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 were further amended i n March 2016 with ASU 2016- 08 \"Principal versus Agent Considerations,\" in April 2016 with ASU 2016-10 \"Identifying Performance Obligations and Licen sing,\" and in May 2016 with AS U 2016-12 \"Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedi ents.\" The amendments have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue standard in ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the revenue ac counting standard updates, ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and 2016-12. In fiscal 2017, Cincinnati Children's changed its accounting policy on accounting disclosures and presentation of fair value of investments using the net asset v alue per share by adopting the provisions of ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share (or Its Equiv alent). In accordance with this guidance, investments measured at net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This change was ap plied retrospectively to all periods presented. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 \"Leases.\" ASU 201 6-02 introduces a new lessee model that brings substantially all leases onto the balance sheet. Most of the existing lessor principles are retained, but ASU 2016-02 aligns many of those principles w ith the FASB's new revenue guidance. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years begin ning after December 15, 2018 with modified retrospective transition; early adoption permitted. M anagement has not yet evaluated the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the cons olidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-14 \"Presentation of Fi nancial Statements for Not-for- Profit Entities.\" The amendments focus on improving reporting in areas unique to not-for-profit financial statements. Temporar ily restricted and permanently r estricted net assets are combined into a single category called \"net assets with donor restrictions.\" D onor-restricted endowment funds that are underwater are reported in net assets with donor restrictio ns and require enhanced disclosures. Additional disclosures are require d around liquidity of financi al assets, internal transfers included in the operating subtotal, the nature of expenses, and cost alloca tion between program and support functions. Lastly, investment e xpenses netted with investment return are limited to external investment expenses and direct internal investment expenses. ASU 2016-14 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with applicatio n applied retrospectively; early adoption is permitted. Managemen t is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-14 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 \"Statement of Cas h Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash\" to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with retrospective transition , and early adoption is permi tted. Management has not yet evaluated the impact of ASU 2016- 18 on the consolidated financi al statements. - 19 - Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 14 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\" The amendment requires the service cost component of ne t benefit cost to be presented with other employee compensation costs in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost will be reported separately out side of operations. The ASU wil l be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 , with application applied ret rospectively; early adoption is permitted. Management has does not believe the impact of ASU 2 017-07 will be significant to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Losses on the Provision of Uncompensated Care- In accordance with its mission and purpose, Cincinnati Children 's maintains a policy of providing medically necessary services to ped iatric patients within its p rimary service area regardless of ability to pay. This primary service area has been defined to include the four counties in Ohio, three counties in Kentucky and one county in Indiana that geographically surround Cincinna ti. Under certain circumstances, Cincinnati Children's accepts patients from outside the primary service ar ea regardless of their ability to pay. Cincinnati Children's defines indigent patient care as services rendered to patients whose families' annual income or net worth falls below certain minimum standards. As such, losses absorbed by the Medical Center in rendering services to patients who are covered under governmental programs which are designed to aid low income families (prima rily the Medicaid program) are considered indigent patient care. The following information summarizes uncompensated care provide d during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: 2017 CHARGES Hospital Physician Total Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $1,338,432 $298,360 $1,636,792 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 24,311 1,792 26,103 Other uncollectible self pay, at established charges 14,763 6,904 21,667 Total Medicaid, charity care and other uncollectible self pay charges $1,377,506 $307,056 $1,684,562 COSTS/LOSSES Estimated costs to provide unc ompensated care $ 604,495 $126,5 07 $ 731,002 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (426,738) (35,678) (462,416) Losses provision of (177,757) (90,829) (268,586) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 38,396 - 38,396 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy $(139,361) $(90,829) $(230,190) - 20 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidat ed Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 152016 CHARGES Hospital Physician Total Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $1,308,262 $288,106 $1,596,368 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 29,290 3,682 32,972 Other uncollectible self pay, at established charges 13,703 8,438 22 ,141 Total Medicaid, charity care and other uncollectible self pay charges $1,351,255 $300,226 $1,651,481 COSTS/LOSS ES Estimated costs to provide uncompensated care $ 606,333 $ 141 ,857 $ 748,190 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (446,443) (35,006) (481,448) Losses on the provision of uncompensated care (159,890) (106,851 ) (266,742) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 31,473 - 31,473 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy $(128,417) $(106,851) $(235,269) The 2017 and 2016 cost amounts reflected in the tables above ar e calculated using cost to charge ratios calculated from prior year cost reports as the current year cos t report is not yet available. Management does not believe that the difference in the cost report year would h ave a material impact on the amounts calculated. (3) Funds in Trust- Cincinnati Children's has certain funds, which are invested and held in trust for various specified purposes. The amounts of such funds, at carrying value, and the specified purposes for which such funds may be used, are set forth below: June 30, 2017 2016 Self-insurance Funds- Professional liability (A) $ 160 $ 160 Employee health and workers' compensation (B) 140 230 Health Network Escrow (C) 3,549 2,642 Bond interest escrow funds (D) 4,827 6,111 Endowment $11,395 $10,946 (A)Cincinnati Children's has established an irrevocable trust fund for the payment of professional liability claim settlements. See Note 5 for further discussion of professional liability self- insurance.

(D)Cincinnati Children 's maintains bond interest escrow funds as r equired under the term s of the related bond i ndentures to hold interest payments until the req uired paym ent dates to bond holders. (E)Cincinnati Children's holds endowment funds related to permanently restricted as sets gifted directly to Cincinnati Children's. (4) Property and Equipment- Property and equipment consists of the following: June 30, 2017 2016 Land $ 37,935 $ 37,885 Land improvements 30,252 Buildings and building 1,164,232 $ 1,174,544 (5) Professional Liability- The Medical Center' s insurance program includes a self-insured retention for losses aris ing out of healthcare professional liability claims. The self-insured ret ention for the claims that are currently asserted is $10,000 ($25,000 in aggregate). The Medical Center annually purchases excess healthcare professional liability insurance on a claims m ade basis at varying levels. The actuarial present value of expected costs (including incurr ed, but not reported claims) for the healthcare professional liabilit y program of $40,373 and $38,483 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, has been accrued in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued healthca re professional liability losses have been discounted at a rate of 4% at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectiv ely. The costs of the Medical Center' s healthcare pr ofessional liability program, including premiums p aid for excess re-insurance, legal fees, settlements, judgm ents, and other administrative costs are incl uded in Sup plies, Drugs and Other in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the status of all healthcare professional liability claims, as well as legal proceedings, and, based upon consultation w ith a professional actuary, adjusts the accrued losses and self-insured retention funding levels to reflect its best estimate of the pr esent value of expected costs for the healthcare professional liability claims. Healthcare professional liabili ty expense amounted to $6,874 and $3,418 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. - 22 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) 17(6) Capital Lease Obligations- The Medical Center leases certa in equipment under capital lease s. The aggregate future minimum lease payments total $6,465, with $2,459 due in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2016, Cincinnati Child ren's entered into ten capital leases for cert ain equipment. Cincinnati Children' s did not enter into any capital leases in fisca l 2017.

Investments in partnerships - U.S. equities, international equities, real estate and bonds - are valued using the net asse t value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The investments in investment partnerships generally are asso ciated with liquidation restrictions that may range from 91 days to the life of the fund (up to fifteen years) and may require redemption penal ties. There were no transfers between levels in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.

SCOPE OF AUDIT All federal grant operations of Cincinnati Children's are inclu ded in the scope of Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) . Single audits under the Uniform Guidance are performed in acc ordance with the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s Compliance Suppl ement for Single Audits of Higher Learning Institutions and other Non-Profit Institutions (the \"C ompliance Supplement\"). The Department of Health and Human Services has been designated as Cincinnati Children's cognizant agency for the single audit. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation \u2014 The accompanying Supplemental Schedule of Expenditures of Fed eral Awards (the \"Schedule\") includes the federal grant activity of Cincinnati Children's under programs of the federal government for the year ended June 30, 2017, and is presented on the accrual basis of accounting. This is consistent with the basis of accounting use d in the preparation of the basic consolidated financial statement s. The information in this Sche dule is presented in accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 2 00, Uniform Guidance . Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of the operations of Cincinnati Children's, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net ass ets or cash flows of Cincinnati Children's. Cincinnati Children's did not elect to use the 10% de minimis i ndirect cost rate as allowed under the Uniform Guidance. Net Asset Balances \u2014 Negative amounts represent grants with deficit balances whic h were closed during fiscal 2017. ****** REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OV ER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Trustees of Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets and of cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements which collectively comprise Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates (\"Cincinnati Children's\") basic consolidated financial statements and have issued our report thereon dated October 18, 2017, except for Note 12, as to which the date is March 28, 2018. Internal Control over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we considered Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. - 51 - Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Cincinnati Children's consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. October 18, 2017, Except for Note 12, as to which the date is March 28, 2018 REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MA JOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Trustees Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates (\"Cincinnati Children's\") compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Cincinnati Children's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2017. Cincinnati Children's major fede ral programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Management's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Cincinnati Children's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Cincinnati Children's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Cincinnati Children's compliance. - 53 - Opinion on Each Major Federal Program In our opinion, Cincinnati Children's complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2017. Report on Internal Control over Compliance Management of Cincinnati Children's is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Cincinnati Children's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Cincinnati Children's as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and have issued our report thereon dated October 18, 2017, except for Note 12, as to which the date is March 28, 2018, which contained an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The - 54 - accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditure of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
