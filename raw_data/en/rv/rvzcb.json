Please read this Certicate carefully, and refer to it whenever you require medical services. The Certicate explains many of the rights and obligations between you and Us. It also describes how to get medical care, what health services are covered and not covered, and what portion of the health care costs you will be required to pay. Many of the provisions in this Certicate are interrelated; therefore, reading just one or two sections may not give you an accurate impression of your coverage. You are responsible for knowing the terms of this Certicate. This Health Certicate overrides and replaces any Health Certicate previously issued to you. The coverage described in this Certicate is based upon the conditions of the Group Contract issued to your employer, and is based upon the benet plan that your Group chose for you. The Group Contract, this Certicate and any endorsements, amendments or riders attached, form the Group Contract under which Covered Services are available under your health care benets. Many words used in the Certicate have special meanings. These words are capitalized. If the word or phrase was not explained in the text where it appears, it may be dened in the \"Denitions\" section. Refer to these denitions for the best understanding of what is being stated. If you have any questions about this Certicate, please call the member service number located on the back of your Identication (ID) Card or visit www.anthem.com. How to Obtain Language Assistance We are committed to communicating with Our Members about their health plan, regardless of their language. We employ a language line interpretation service for use by all of Our Customer Service call centers. Simply call the Customer Service phone number on the back of your ID card and a representative will be able to assist you.

Health CerticateM-8 Contents Contents NOTICES . . . . OF BENEFITS The Schedule of Benets is a summary of the Deductibles, Coinsurance, Copayments, maximums and other limits that apply when you receive Covered Services from a Provider. Please refer to the \"Covered Services\" section of this Certicate for a more complete explanation of the specic services covered by the Plan. All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, exclusions, limitations, terms and provisions of this Certicate including any endorsements, amendments, or riders. This Schedule of Benets lists the Member's responsibility for Covered Services. To receive maximum benets at the lowest Out-Of-Pocket expense, Covered Services must be provided by a Network Provider. Benets for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowable Amount, which is the maximum amount the Plan will pay for a given service. When you use a Non-Network Provider you are responsible for any balance due between the Non-Network Provider's charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount in addition to any Coinsurance, Copayments, Deductibles, and non-covered charges. Copayments/Coinsurance/Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum Allowable Amount, not the Provider's charge. Under certain circumstances, if We pay the Provider amounts that are your responsibility, such as Deductibles, Copayments or Coinsurance, We may collect such amounts directly from you. You agree that We have the right to collect such amounts from you. Essential Health Benets provided within this Certicate are not subject to lifetime or annual dollar maximums. Certain non-essential health benets, however, are subject to either a lifetime and/or annual dollar maximum. Essential Health Benets are dened by federal law and refer to benets in at least the following categories: \u008fAmbulatory patient services, \u008fEmergency services, \u008fHospitalization, \u008fMaternity and newborn care, \u008fMental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment, \u008fPrescription drugs, \u008fRehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, \u008fLaboratory services, \u008fPreventive and wellness services, and \u008fChronic disease management and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.

To receive maximum benets for Covered Services, care must be received from a Primary Care Physician (PCP), Specialty Care Physician (SCP) or another Network Provider to be a Covered Service, except for Emergency Care and Urgent Care. Services which are not received from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider or approved as an Authorized Service will be considered a Non-Network service, except as specied above. The amount payable for Covered Services varies depending on whether you receive your care from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider or a Non-Network Provider, except for Emergency Care and Urgent Care. Health CerticateM-22 COVERED SERVICES If you use a Non-Network Provider, you are responsible for the difference between the Non-Network Provider's charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount, in addition to any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment or Deductible. We cannot prohibit Non-Network Providers from billing you for the difference in the Non-Network Provider's charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount. All Covered Services and benets are subject to the conditions, Exclusions, limitations, terms and provisions of this Certicate, including any attachments, riders and endorsements. Covered Services must be Medically Necessary and not Experimental/Investigative. The fact that a Provider may prescribe, order, recommend or approve a service, treatment or supply does not make it Medically Necessary or a Covered Service and does not guarantee payment. To receive maximum benets for Covered Services, you must follow the terms of the Certicate, including receipt of care from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider, and obtain any required Prior Authorization or Precertication. Contact your Network Provider to be sure that Prior Authorization/Precertication has been obtained. We base Our decisions about Prior Authorization, Precertication, Medical Necessity, Experimental/Investigative services and new technology on Our clinical coverage guidelines and medical policy. We may also consider published peer-review medical literature, opinions of experts and the recommendations of nationally recognized public and private organizations which review the medical effectiveness of health care services and technology. Benets for Covered Services may be payable subject to an approved treatment plan created under the terms of this Certicate. Benets for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such service. Our payment for Covered Services will be limited by any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment, Deductible, or Benet Period Limit/Maximum. Ambulance Services See the Schedule of Benets for any applicable Deductible, Coinsurance, Copayment, and Benet Limitation information.

Treatment of a sickness or injury by medical professionals from an Ambulance Service when you are not transported will be covered if Medically Necessary. Other vehicles which do not meet this denition, including but not limited to ambulettes, are not Covered Services. Ambulance services are a Covered Service only when Medically Necessary, except: \u008fWhen ordered by an employer, school, re or public safety ofcial and the Member is not in a position to refuse; or \u008fWhen a Member is required by Us to move from a Non-Network Provider to a Network Provider.

If none of these facilities are in your local area, you are covered for trips to the closest facility outside your local area.

Any ambulance usage for the convenience of the Member, family or Physician is not a Covered Service.

The intensity of services is similar to Inpatient settings.

Intensive Outpatient Programs may offer group, DBT, individual, and family services. \u008fOutpatient treatment, or individual or group treatment - ofce-based services, for example Diagnostic evaluation, counseling, psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication evaluation. The service may be provided by a licensed mental health professional and is coordinated with the psychiatrist. Two days of partial hospitalization treatment or intensive Outpatient treatment are the equivalent of one day as an Inpatient. To assist you in obtaining appropriate and quality care, We will ask your Provider to submit a treatment plan to Us after you have been evaluated after 10 Outpatient visits. We may discuss the goals of treatment and changes in the treatment plan, including alternative courses of treatment, with your Provider in order to manage your benets effectively and efciently.

Eligibility will be continued past the age limit only for those already enrolled Dependents who cannot work to support themselves due to mental retardation or physical or mental handicap. The Dependent's disability must start before the end of the period they would become ineligible for coverage. The Plan must certify the Dependent's eligibility. The Plan must be informed of the Dependent's eligibility for continuation of coverage within 120 days after the Dependent would Health CerticateM-62 ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT normally become ineligible.

To obtain coverage for children, We may require that the Subscriber complete a \"Dependency Afdavit\" and provide Us with a copy of any legal documents awarding guardianship of such child(ren) to the Subscriber. Temporary custody is not sufcient to establish eligibility under this Certicate.

Coverage Effective Dates and enrollment requirements are described in the Group Contract. College Student Medical Leave The Plan will extend coverage for up to one year when a college student otherwise would lose eligibility, if a child takes a Medically Necessary leave of absence from a postsecondary educational institution. Coverage will continue for up to one year of leave, unless Dependent coverage ends earlier under another Plan provision, such as the parent's termination of employment or the child's age exceeding the Plan's limit. Medically Necessary change in student status. The extended coverage is available if a college student would otherwise lose coverage because a serious illness or injury requires a Medically Necessary leave of absence or a change in enrollment status (for example, a switch from full-time to part-time student status). The Plan must receive written certication from the child's Physician conrming the serious illness or injury and the Medical Necessity of the leave or change in status.

If We receive an application to add your Dependent or an Eligible Person and Dependent more than 60 days after the loss of Medicaid/CHIP or of the eligibility determination, We will not be able to enroll that person until the Group's next Open Enrollment . Application forms are available from the Plan. Late Enrollees You are considered a Late Enrollee if you are an Eligible Person or Dependent who did not request enrollment for coverage: \u008fDuring the initial enrollment period; or \u008fDuring a Special Enrollment period; or \u008fAs a newly eligible Dependent who failed to qualify during the Special Enrollment period and did not enroll within 31 days of the date you were rst entitled to enroll. However, you will not be enrolled for coverage with the Plan until the next Open Enrollment Period. Open Enrollment Period An Eligible Person or Dependent who did not request enrollment for coverage during the initial enrollment period, or during a Special Enrollment period, may apply for coverage at any time, however, will not be enrolled until the Group's next annual enrollment and may be subject to a Pre-Existing Condition waiting period, not to exceed the Exclusion Period stated in the Schedule of Benets. Pre-Existing exclusions or limitations do not apply to Members under the age of 19. Open Enrollment means a period of time (at least 31 days prior to the Group's renewal date and 31 days following) which is held no less frequently than once in any 12 consecutive months. Portability Any Pre-Existing Condition waiting period will be reduced by the aggregate of the periods of prior creditable coverage applicable to you as of your Enrollment Date under this Plan. Creditable coverage is prior coverage you had from: a group plan, Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health Service, state risk pool, state children's health insurance program, public health plan, Peace Corps service, U.S. Government plans, foreign health plans or individual health plan. Prior coverage does not count as creditable if there was a break in coverage of 63 days or more prior to enrolling for coverage under this Plan. You have the opportunity to prove that you have prior creditable coverage and We will assist you in obtaining that information if required. Pre-Existing exclusions or limitations do not apply to Members under the age of 19. Health CerticateM-66 ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT Notice of Changes The Subscriber is responsible to notify the Group of any changes which will affect his or her eligibility or that of Dependents for services or benets under this Certicate. The Plan must be notied of any changes as soon as possible but no later than within 31 days of the event. This includes changes in address, marriage, divorce, death, change of Dependent disability or dependency status, enrollment or disenrollment in another health plan or Medicare. Failure to notify Us of persons no longer eligible for services will not obligate Us to pay for such services. Acceptance of payments from the Group for persons no longer eligible for services will not obligate Us to pay for such services. Family Coverage should be changed to Single Coverage when only the Subscriber is eligible. When notice is provided within 31 days of the event, the Effective Date of coverage is the event date causing the change to Single Coverage. The Plan must be notied when a Member becomes eligible for Medicare. All notications by the Group must be in writing and on approved forms. Such notications must include all information reasonably required to effect the necessary changes. A Member's coverage terminates as specied in the Termination section of this Certicate. The Plan has the right to bill the Subscriber for the cost of any services provided to such person during the period such person was not eligible under the Subscriber's coverage. Nondiscrimination No person who is eligible to enroll will be refused enrollment based on health status, health care needs, genetic information, previous medical information, disability or age.

Delivery of Documents We will provide an Identication Card for each Member and a Certicate for each Subscriber. Health CerticateTermination M-67 8Termination Except as otherwise provided, your coverage may terminate in the following situations. The information provided below is general and the actual effective date of termination may vary based on your Group's agreement with Us and your specic circumstances, such as whether Premium has been paid in full: \u008fIf you terminate your coverage, termination will be effective on the last day of the billing period in which We received your notice of termination. \u008fSubject to any applicable continuation or conversion requirements, if you cease to meet eligibility requirements as outlined in this Certicate, your coverage will terminate on the last day of the billing period. The Group and/or you must notify Us immediately if you cease to meet the eligibility requirements. The Group and/or you shall be responsible for payment for any services incurred by you after you cease to meet eligibility requirements. \u008fIf you engage in fraudulent conduct or furnish Us fraudulent or misleading material information relating to claims or application for coverage, then We may terminate your coverage. Termination is effective 31 days after Our notice of termination is mailed, except when indicated otherwise in the Schedule of Benets. You are responsible to pay Us for the cost of previously received services based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such services, less any Copayments made or Premium paid for such services. We will also terminate your Dependent's coverage, effective on the date your coverage was terminated. We will notify the Group in the event We terminate you and your Dependent's coverage. \u008fA Dependent's coverage will terminate at the end of the billing period in which notice was received by Us that the person no longer meets the denition of Dependent, except when indicated otherwise in the Schedule of Benets. \u008fIf coverage is through an association, coverage will terminate on the date membership in the association ends. \u008fIf you elect coverage under another carrier's health benet plan or under any other non-Anthem plan which is offered by, through, or in connection with the Group as an option instead of this Plan, then coverage for you and your Dependents will terminate at the end of the billing period for which Premium has been paid, subject to the consent of the Group. The Group agrees to immediately notify Us that you have elected coverage elsewhere. \u008fIf you fail to pay or fail to make satisfactory arrangements to pay any amount due to Us or Network Providers (including the failure to pay required Deductibles and/or Copayments), We may terminate your coverage and may also terminate the coverage of all your Dependents, effective immediately upon Our written notice to the Group. \u008fIf you permit the use of your or any other Member's Plan Identication Card by any other person; use another person's card; or use an invalid card to obtain services, your coverage will terminate immediately upon Our written notice to the Group. Any Subscriber or Dependent involved in the misuse of a Plan Identication Card will be liable to and must reimburse Us for the Maximum Allowable Amount for services received through such misuse. Health CerticateM-68 Termination Removal of Members Upon written request through the Group, a Subscriber may cancel the enrollment of any Member from the Plan. If this happens, no benets will be provided for Covered Services provided after the Member's termination date. Reinstatement You will not be reinstated automatically if coverage is terminated. Re-application is necessary, unless termination resulted from inadvertent clerical error. No additions or terminations of membership will be processed during the time your or the Group's request for reinstatement is being considered by Us. Your coverage shall not be adversely affected due to the Group's clerical error. However, the Group is liable to Us if We incur nancial loss as a result of the Group's clerical error. Certication of Prior Creditable Coverage If your coverage is terminated, you and your covered Dependents will receive a certication showing when you were covered under the Plan. You may need the document to qualify for another Group health Plan. You may also need the certication to buy, for yourself or your family, an individual policy that does not exclude coverage for medical conditions that were present before your enrollment. Certications may be requested within 24 months of losing coverage. You may also request a certication be provided to you at any other time, even if you have not lost coverage under this plan. If you have any questions, contact the customer service telephone number listed on the back of your Identication Card. Continuation Federal Continuation of Coverage (COBRA) The following applies if you are covered under a Group which is subject to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, as amended. COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose coverage under your Group's health plan. It can also become available to other Members of your family, who are covered under the Group's health plan, when they would otherwise lose their health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under federal law under the coverage provided by the Group's health plan, you should contact the Group. COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of health coverage under the Group's health plan when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Specic qualifying events are listed below. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualied beneciary.\" You, your spouse, and your Dependent children could become qualied beneciaries if coverage under the Group's health plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Group's health plan, qualied beneciaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage may or Health CerticateTermination M-69 may not be required to pay for COBRA continuation coverage. Contact the Group for Premium payment requirements. If you are a Subscriber, you will become a qualied beneciary if you lose your coverage under the Group's health plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fYour hours of employment are reduced, or \u008fYour employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of a Subscriber, you will become a qualied beneciary if you lose your coverage under the Group's health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fYour spouse dies; \u008fYour spouse's hours of employment are reduced; \u008fYour spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u008fYour spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both); or \u008fYou become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your Dependent children will become qualied beneciaries if they lose coverage under the Group's health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fThe parent-Subscriber \u008fThe parent-Subscriber's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u008fThe parent-Subscriber becomes entitled to Medicare benets (Part A, Part B, or both); \u008fThe parents become divorced or legally separated; or \u008fThe child stops being eligible for coverage under the Group's health plan as a \"Dependent child.\" If Your Group Offers Retirement Coverage Sometimes, ling a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is led with respect to the Group, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired Subscriber covered under the Group's health plan, the retired Subscriber will become a qualied beneciary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired Subscriber's spouse, surviving spouse, and Dependent children will also become qualied beneciaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under Group's health plan. When is COBRA Coverage Available The Group will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualied beneciaries only after the Group has been notied that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscriber, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both), then the Group will notify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resources, external vendor) of the qualifying event. Health CerticateM-70 Termination You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a Dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Group within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. How is COBRA Coverage Provided Once the Group receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualied beneciaries. Each qualied beneciary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered Subscribers may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. How Long Will Continuation Coverage Last? In the case of a loss of coverage due to end of employment or reduction in hours of employment, coverage may be continued only for up to a total of 18 months. In the case of losses of coverage due to the Subscriber's death, divorce or legal separation, the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets or a Dependent child ceasing to be a Dependent under the terms of the Group's health plan, coverage may be continued for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the Subscriber's hours of employment, and the Subscriber became entitled to Medicare benets less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualied beneciaries other than the Subscriber lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. How Can You Extend The Length of COBRA Continuation Coverage? If you elect continuation coverage, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if a qualied beneciary is disabled or a second qualifying event occurs. You must notify the Group of a disability or a second qualifying event in order to extend the period of continuation coverage. Failure to provide notice of a disability or second qualifying event may affect the right to extend the period of continuation coverage. \u008fDisability An 11-month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualied beneciaries is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. You must provide the SSA determination of your disability to the Group within 60 days of receipt. The disability has to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. Each qualied beneciary who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11-month disability extension if one of them qualies. If the qualied beneciary is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify the Group of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. \u008fSecond Qualifying Event An 18-month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and Dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the rst 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second Health CerticateTermination M-71 qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying events may include the death of a covered Subscriber, divorce or separation from the covered Subscriber, the covered Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a Dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a Dependent under the Group's health plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualied beneciary to lose coverage under the Plan if the rst qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify the Group within 60 days after a second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. Trade Act of 1974 Special COBRA rights apply to Subscribers who have been terminated or experienced a reduction of hours and who qualify for a \"trade readjustment allowance\" or \"alternative trade adjustment assistance\" under a federal law called the Trade Act of 1974. These Subscribers are entitled to a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage for themselves and certain family members (if they did not already elect COBRA coverage), but only within a limited period of sixty (60) days (or less) and only during the six (6) months immediately after their Group health plan coverage ended. If you, the Subscriber, qualify for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, you should contact the Group for additional information. You must contact the Group promptly after qualifying for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 or you will lose these special COBRA rights. Premiums and the End of COBRA Coverage Premium will be no more than 102% of the Group rate (unless your coverage continues beyond 18 months because of a disability. In that case, premium in the 19th through 29th months may be 150% of the Group rate). Continuation coverage will be terminated before the end of the maximum period if: \u008fany required premium is not paid in full on time, \u008fa qualied beneciary becomes covered, after electing continuation coverage, under another group health plan that does not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion for a pre-existing condition of the qualied beneciary, \u008fa qualied beneciary becomes entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both) after electing continuation coverage, or \u008fthe Group ceases to provide any group health plan for its employees. Continuation coverage may also be terminated for any reason the Group would terminate coverage of a participant or beneciary not receiving continuation coverage (such as fraud). If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Group's health plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Group. For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Ofce of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benets Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa. (Addresses and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Ofces are available through EBSA's website.) Health CerticateM-72 Termination Continuation of Coverage Due To Military Service In the event you are no longer Actively At Work due to military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, you may elect to continue health coverage for yourself and your Dependents (if any) under this Certicate in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. \"Military service\" means performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis, and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, and full-time National Guard duty. You may elect to continue to cover yourself and your eligible Dependents (if any) under this Certicate by notifying your employer in advance and payment of any required contribution for health coverage. This may include the amount the Employer normally pays on your behalf. If Your military service is for a period of time less than 31 days, You may not be required to pay more than the active Member contribution, if any, for continuation of health coverage. If continuation is elected under this provision, the maximum period of health coverage under this Certicate shall be the lesser of: \u008fThe 24-month period beginning on the rst date of your absence from work; or \u008fThe day after the date on which You fail to apply for or return to a position of employment. Regardless whether you continue your health coverage, if you return to your position of employment your health coverage and that of your eligible Dependents (if any) will be reinstated under this Certicate. No exclusions or waiting period may be imposed on you or your eligible Dependents in connection with this reinstatement unless a sickness or injury is determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of military service. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 A Subscriber who is taking a period of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the Act) will retain eligibility for coverage during this period. The Subscriber and his or her Dependents shall not be considered ineligible due to the Subscriber not being Actively At Work. If the Subscriber does not retain coverage during the leave period, the Subscriber and any eligible Dependents who were covered immediately prior to the leave may be reinstated upon return to work without medical underwriting and without imposition of an additional waiting period for Pre-Existing Conditions. To obtain coverage for a Subscriber upon return from leave under the Act, the Group must provide the Plan with evidence satisfactory to Us of the applicability of the Act to the Subscriber, including a copy of the health care Provider statement allowed by the Act. Conversion A Subscriber and any eligible Dependents who have been continuously covered under this Certicate, or any group coverage it replaced, for at least ninety (90) days are entitled to an individual conversion plan under the following conditions: \u008fThe Subscriber or Member loses coverage under this Certicate as a result of: 1.termination of employment; Health 4.or attainment of limiting age. \u008fThe Subscriber or Member is not eligible for federal continuation coverage (COBRA). \u008fThe Subscriber or Member requests an individual conversion plan within thirty (30) days after the loss of Group coverage. The Subscriber or Member shall not be required to meet any additional waiting periods and shall receive credit for any applicable waiting period, Deductibles, or Out of Pocket amounts satised under this Certicate. The Deductible, Coinsurance and Copayments amounts under the conversion plan may be different than those under this coverage. Coverage under the conversion plan shall terminate for the following reasons: \u008fNon-payment of Premiums; or \u008fCancellation of the individual conversion plan by the Member or Subscriber. 9HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES Network Providers are the key to providing and coordinating your health care services. Benets are provided when you obtain Covered Service from Providers; however, the broadest benets are provided for services obtained from a Primary Care Physician (PCP), Specialty Care Physician (SCP), or other Network Providers. Services you obtain from any Provider other than a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider are considered a Non-Network Service, except for Emergency Care, Urgent Care, or as an Authorized Service. Contact a PCP, SCP, other Network Provider, or Us to be sure that Prior Authorization and/or precertication has been obtained. If a Non-Network Provider meets Our enrollment criteria and is willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation, that Provider has the right to become a Network Provider for the product associated with this Certicate. Network Services and Benets If your care is rendered by a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider benets will be paid at the Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessity, no benets will be provided for care that is not a Covered Service even if performed by a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider. All medical care must be under the direction of Physicians. We have nal authority to determine the Medical Necessity of the service. We may inform you that it is not Medically Necessary for you to receive services or remain in a Hospital or other facility. This decision is made upon review of your condition and treatment. You may appeal this decision. See the Member Grievances section of this Certicate. \u008fNetwork Providers - include Primary Care Physicians (PCP), Specialty Care Physicians (SCP), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other facility Providers who contract with Us to perform services for you. PCPs include general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians & gynecologists, geriatrician or other Network Providers as allowed by Health CerticateM-74 HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES the Plan. The Primary Care Physician is the Physician who may provide, coordinate, and arrange your health care services. SCP's are Network Physician who provide specialty medical services not normally provided by a PCP. For services rendered by Network Providers: 1.You will not be required to le any claims for services you obtain directly from Network Providers. Network Providers will seek compensation for Covered Services rendered from Us and not from you except for approved Coinsurance, Copayments and/or Deductibles. You may be billed by your Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services you receive or when you have not acted in accordance with this Certicate. 2.Health Care Management is the responsibility of the Network Provider. If there is no Network Provider who is qualied to perform the treatment you require, contact Us prior to receiving the service or treatment and We may approve a Non-Network Provider for that service as an Authorized Service. Non-Network Services Services which are not obtained from a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider or not an Authorized Service will be considered a Non-Network Service. The only exception is Emergency Care and Urgent Care. In addition, certain services are not covered unless obtained from a Network Provider, see your Schedule of Benets. For services rendered by a Non-Network Provider, you are responsible for: \u008fThe difference between the actual charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount plus any Deductible and/or Coinsurance/Copayments; \u008fServices that are not Medically Necessary; \u008fNon-Covered Services; \u008fFiling claims; and \u008fHigher cost sharing amounts. Relationship of Parties (Plan - Network Providers) The relationship between the Plan and Network Providers is an independent contractor relationship. Network Providers are not agents or employees of the Plan, nor is the Plan, or any employee of the Plan, an employee or agent of Network Providers. The Plan shall not be responsible for any claim or demand on account of damages arising out of, or in any manner connected with, any injuries suffered by a Member while receiving care from any Network Provider or in any Network Provider's facilities. Your Network Provider's agreement for providing Covered Services may include nancial incentives or risk sharing relationships related to provision of services or referrals to other Providers, including Network Providers, Non-Network Providers, and disease management programs. If you have questions regarding such incentives or risk sharing relationships, please contact your Provider or the Plan. Health CerticateCLAIMS PAYMENT M-75 Not Liable for Provider Acts or Omissions The Plan is not responsible for the actual care you receive from any person. This Certicate does not give anyone any claim, right, or cause of action against the Plan based on the actions of a Provider of health care, services or supplies. Identication Card When you receive care, you must show your Identication Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premiums under this Certicate has the right to services or benets under this Certicate. If anyone receives services or benets to which they are not entitled to under the terms of this Certicate, he/she is responsible for the actual cost of the services or benets. 10 CLAIMS PAYMENT When you receive care through a Network Provider, you are not required to le a claim. This means that the provisions below, regarding Claim Forms and Notice of Claim, do not apply unless the Provider did not le the claim. A claim must be led for you to receive Non-Network Services benets, but many Non-Network Hospitals, Physicians and other Providers will still submit your claim for you. If you submit the claim, use a claim form. A claim must be led for you to get benets. Many Hospitals, Physicians, and Other Providers will submit your claim for you. If you submit the claim yourself, you should use a claim form. How Benets Are Paid Maximum Allowed Amount General This section describes how We determine the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by Network and Non-Network Providers is based on this/your Certicate's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that You receive. Please see the BlueCard section for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Certicate is the maximum amount of reimbursement We will allow for services and supplies: \u008fthat meet Our denition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under your Certicate and are not excluded; \u008fthat are Medically Necessary; and \u008fthat are provided in accordance with all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other requirements set forth in Your Certicate. Health CerticateM-76 CLAIMS PAYMENT You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. In addition, when You receive Covered Services from a Non-Network Provider, You may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be signicant. When You receive Covered Services from Provider, We will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect Our determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services You received were not Medically Necessary. It means We have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other healthcare professional, We may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or a Non-Network Provider. A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specic product or in a special Center of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with Us. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this/your Certicate is the rate the Provider has agreed with Us to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send You a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, You may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Customer Service for help in nding a Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com. Providers who have not signed any contract with Us and are not in any of Our networks are Non-Network Providers. For Covered Services You receive from a Non-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Certicate will be one of the following as determined by Us: 1.An amount based on Our Non-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which We have established in Our discretion, and which We reserve the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with Us, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2.An amount based on the level and/or method of reimbursement used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies; or Health CerticateCLAIMS PAYMENT M-77 3.An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care, or 4.An amount negotiated by Us or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management, or 5.An amount equal to the total charges billed by the Provider, but only if such charges are less than the Maximum Allowed Amount calculated by using one of the methods shown above. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but are contracted for other products with Us are also considered Non-Network. For this/your Certicate, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the ve methods shown above unless the contract between Us and that Provider species a different amount. Unlike Network Providers, Non-Network Providers may send You a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds Our Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be signicant. Choosing a Network Provider will likely result in lower Out of Pocket costs to You. Please call Customer Service for help in nding a Network Provider or visit Our website at www.anthem.com. Customer Service is also available to assist You in determining this/your Certicate's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from a Non-Network Provider. In order for Us to assist You, You will need to obtain from your Provider the specic procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate your Out of Pocket responsibility. Although Customer Service can assist You with this pre-service information, the nal Maximum Allowed Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. For Prescription Drugs : The Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by Us using prescription drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benets Manager (PBM). Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services and depending on your plan design, You may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as Your cost share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance). Your cost share amount and Out-of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether You received services from a Network or Non-Network Provider. Specically, You may be required to pay higher cost sharing amounts or may have limits on your benets when using Non-Network Providers. Please see the Schedule of Benets in this Certicate for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call Customer Service to learn how this Certicate's benets or cost share amounts may vary by the type of Provider You use. We will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by a Network or Non Network Provider. Both services specically excluded by the terms of your Plan and those received after benets have been exhausted are non-Covered Services. Benets may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benet caps or day/visit limits. In some instances You may only be asked to pay the lower Network cost sharing amount when You use a Non-Network Provider. For example, if You go to a Network Hospital or Provider facility and Health CerticateM-78 CLAIMS PAYMENT receive Covered Services from a Non-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed by or contracted with a Network Hospital or facility, You will pay the Network cost share amounts for those Covered Services. However, You also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Non-Network Provider's charge. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Certicate's cost share amounts; see Your Schedule of Benets for Your applicable amounts. Example: Your plan has a Coinsurance cost share of 20% for Network services, and 30% for Non-Network services after the Network or Non-Network Deductible has been met. You undergo a surgical procedure in a Network Hospital. The Hospital has contracted with a Non-Network anesthesiologist to perform the anesthesiology services for the surgery. You have no control over the anesthesiologist used. \u008fThe Non-Network anesthesiologist's charge for the service is $1200. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the anesthesiology service is $950; Your Coinsurance responsibility is 20% of $950, or $190 and the remaining allowance from Us is 80% of $950, or $760. You may receive a bill from the anesthesiologist for the difference between $1200 and $950. Provided the Deductible has been met, your total Out of Pocket responsibility would be $190 (20% Coinsurance responsibility) plus an additional $250, for a total of $440. \u008fYou choose a Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery is $1500; Your Coinsurance responsibility when a Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. We allow 80% of $1500, or $1200. The Network surgeon accepts the total of $1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket responsibility would be $300. \u008fYou choose a NON-NETWORK surgeon. The Non-Network surgeon's charge for the service is $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; Your Coinsurance responsibility for the NON-NETWORK surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after the NON-NETWORK Deductible has been met. We allow the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition , the Non-Network surgeon could bill You the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total Out of Pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1450 . Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no Network Provider available for the Covered Service, We may authorize the Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You receive from a Non-Network Provider. In such circumstance, You must contact Us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. We also may authorize the Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if You receive Emergency services from a Non-Network Provider and are not able to contact Us until after the Covered Service is rendered. If We authorize a Covered Service so that You are responsible for the Network cost share amounts, You may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Non-Network Provider's charge. Please contact Customer Service for Authorized Services information or to request authorization. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Certicate's cost share amounts; see Your Schedule of Benets for Your applicable amounts. Example: Health CerticateCLAIMS PAYMENT M-79 You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no Network Provider for that specialty in your state of residence. You contact Us in advance of receiving any Covered Services, and We authorize You to go to an available Non-Network Provider for that Covered Service and We agree that the Network cost share will apply. Your plan has a $45 Copayment for Non-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for Network Providers for the Covered Service. The Non-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200. Because We have authorized the Network cost share amount to apply in this situation, You will be responsible for the Network Copayment of $25 and We will be responsible for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount. Because the Non-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500, You may receive a bill from the Non-Network Provider for the difference between the $500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount of $200. Combined with your Network Copayment of $25, your total out of pocket expense would be $325. Payment of Benets You authorize Us to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Services. Payments may also be made to, and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims sent to, an Alternate Recipient (any child of a Subscriber who is recognized, under a Qualied Medical Child Support Order (QMSCO), as having a right to enrollment under the Group's Contract), or that person's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by Us will discharge Our obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone else, except as required by a \"Qualied Medical Child Support Order\" as dened by ERISA or any applicable state law. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, We will not honor a request for Us to withhold payment of the claims submitted. Services Performed During Same Session We may combine the reimbursement of Covered Services when more than one service is performed during the same session. Reimbursement is limited to Our Maximum Allowable Amount. If services are performed by Non Network Providers , then you are responsible for any amounts charged in excess of Our Maximum Allowable Amount with or without a referral or regardless if allowed as an Authorized Service . Contact Us for more information. Assignment The Group cannot legally transfer this Certicate, without obtaining written permission from the Plan. Members cannot legally transfer the coverage. Benets available under this Certicate are not assignable by any Member without obtaining written permission from the Plan, unless in a way described in this Certicate. Notice of Claim We are not liable under the Certicate, unless We receive written notice that Covered Services have been given to you. The notice must be given to Us within 90 days of receiving the Covered Services, and must have the data We need to determine benets. If the notice submitted does not include sufcient data We Health CerticateM-80 CLAIMS PAYMENT need to process the claim, then the necessary data must be submitted to Us within the time frames specied in this provision or no benets will be payable except as otherwise required by law. If We have not received the information We need to process a claim, We will ask for the additional information necessary to complete the claim. You will receive a copy of that request for additional information, for your information. In those cases, We cannot complete the processing of the claim until the additional information requested has been received. We will make Our request for additional information within 30 days of Our initial receipt of the claim and will complete Our processing of the claim within 15 days after Our receipt of all requested information. An expense is considered incurred on the date the service or supply was given. If We are unable to complete processing of a claim because you or your Provider fail to provide Us with the additional information within 60 days of Our request, the claim will be denied and you will be nancially responsible for the claim. Failure to give Us notice within 90 days will not reduce any benet if you show that the notice was given as soon as reasonably possible. No notice of an initial claim, nor additional information on a claim can be submitted later than one year after the 90 day ling period ends, and no request for an adjustment of a claim can be submitted later than 24 months after the claim has been paid. Time Benets Payable We will pay all benets within 30 days for clean claims led electronically, or 45 days for clean claims led on paper. \"Clean claims\" means a claim submitted by you or a Provider that has no defect, impropriety, or particular circumstance requiring special treatment preventing payment. If We have not received the information We need to process a claim, We will ask for the additional information necessary to complete the claim. You will receive a copy of that request for additional information, for your information. In those cases, We cannot complete the processing of the claim until the additional information requested has been received. We will make Our request for additional information within 30 days of Our initial receipt of the claim and will complete Our processing of the claim within 15 days after Our receipt of all requested information. At Our discretion, benets will be paid to you or the Provider of services. You may not assign any payment. If other parties have paid benets under this Plan, We may reimburse those other parties and be fully discharged from that portion of its liability. Claim Forms Claim forms will usually be available from most Providers. If forms are not available, either send a written request for claim forms to Us, or contact customer service and ask for claim forms to be sent to you. The form will be sent to you within 15 days. If you do not receive the claim forms, written notice of services rendered may be submitted to Us without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim form must be included in the written notice of claim. This includes: \u008fName of patient. \u008fPatient's relationship with the Subscriber. \u008fIdentication number. \u008fDate, type and place of service. \u008fYour signature and the Provider's signature. Health CerticateCLAIMS PAYMENT M-81 Member's Cooperation Each Member shall complete and submit to the Plan such authorizations, consents, releases, assignments and other documents as may be requested by the Plan in order to obtain or assure reimbursement under Medicare, Workers' Compensation or any other governmental program. Any Member who fails to cooperate (including a Member who fails to enroll under Part B of the Medicare program where Medicare is the responsible payor) will be responsible for any charge for services. Explanation of Benets (EOB) After you receive medical care, you will receive an explanation of benets (EOB). The EOB is a summary of the coverage you receive. The EOB is not a bill, but a statement from Us to help you understand the coverage you are receiving. The EOB shows: \u008fTotal amounts charged for services/supplies received. \u008fThe amount of the charges satised by your coverage. \u008fThe amount for which you are responsible (if any). \u008fGeneral information about your appeals rights and for ERISA plans, information regarding the right to bring action after the Appeals Process. Out-of-Area Services Anthem has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter-Plan Programs.\" Whenever you obtain healthcare services outside of Anthem's Service Area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Programs, which include the BlueCard Program and may include negotiated National Account arrangements available between Anthem and other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Typically, when accessing care outside Anthem's Service Area, you will obtain care from healthcare Providers that have a contractual agreement (i.e., are \"participating providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from nonparticipating healthcare Providers. Anthem's payment practices in both instances are described below. BlueCardR\u008dProgram Under the BlueCardR\u008dProgram, when you access covered healthcare services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Anthem will remain responsible for fullling Anthem's contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare Providers. Whenever you access covered healthcare services outside Anthem's Service Area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for covered healthcare services is calculated based on the lower of: \u008fThe billed covered charges for your Covered Services; or Health CerticateM-82 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT \u008fThe negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Anthem. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare Provider or Provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modications of past pricing for the types of transaction modications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price Anthem uses for your claim because they will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, we would then calculate your liability for any covered healthcare services according to applicable law. If you obtain services in a state with more than one Blue Plan network, an exclusive network arrangement may be in place. If you see a Provider who is not part of an exclusive network arrangement, that Provider's service(s) will be considered Non-Network care, and you may be billed the difference between the charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount. You may call the Customer Service number on your ID card or go to www.anthem.com for more information about such arrangements. 11 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT Health Care Management includes the processes of Precertication, Predetermination and Medical Review. Its purpose is to promote the delivery of cost-effective medical care to all Members by reviewing the use of appropriate procedures, setting (place of service), and resources and optimizing the health of the Members We serve. These processes are described in the following section. If you have any questions regarding the information contained in this section, you may call the Precertication telephone number on the back of your Identication Card or visit www.anthem.com. Types of Requests: Precertication - A required review of a service, treatment or admission for a benet coverage determination which must be obtained prior to the service, treatment or admission start date. For emergency admissions, you, your authorized representative or Physician must notify Us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertication is not required unless there is a complication and/or the mother and baby are not discharged at the same time. Predetermination - An optional, voluntary Prospective or Concurrent request for a benet coverage determination for a service or treatment. We will review your Certicate to determine if there is an exclusion for the service or treatment. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benet coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service meets the denition of Medical Necessity under this Certicate or is Experimental/Investigative as that term is dened in this Certicate. Health CerticateHEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT M-83 Medical Review - A Retrospective review for a benet coverage determination to determine the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a service, treatment or admission that did not require Precertication and did not have a Predetermination review performed. Medical Reviews occur for a service, treatment or admission in which We have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by Us. Most Network Providers know which services require Precertication and will obtain any required Precertication or request a Predetermination if they feel it is necessary. Your Primary Care Physician and other Network Providers have been provided detailed information regarding Health Care Management procedures and are responsible for assuring that the requirements of Health Care Management are met. The ordering Provider, facility or attending Physician will contact Us to request a Precertication or Predetermination review (\"requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with the requesting Provider for the Precertication request. However, you may designate an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specic request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. Who is responsible for Precertication Services provided by a Net- work ProviderServices provided by a BlueCard/Non-Network/Non- Participating Provider Provider \u008f Member is responsible for Precertication. \u008f Member is nancially responsible for service and/or set- ting that are/is not covered under this Certicate based on an Adverse Determination of Medical Necessity or Experimen- tal/Investigative. We will utilize Our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy and other internally developed clinical guidelines, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to assist in making Our Medical Necessity decisions. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identied as appropriate medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically. Your Certicate and Group Contract take precedence over these guidelines. You are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to any documents relevant to your request. To request this information, contact the Precertication telephone number on the back of your Identication Card. Request Categories: Urgent - a request for Precertication or Predetermination that in the opinion of the treating Provider or any Physician with knowledge of the Member's medical condition, could in the absence of such care or treatment, seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Member or the ability of the Member to regain maximum function or subject the Member to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment. Prospective - a request for Precertication or Predetermination that is conducted prior to the service, treatment or admission. Concurrent - a request for Precertication or Predetermination that is conducted during the course of treatment or admission. Health CerticateM-84 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT Retrospective - a request for Precertication that is conducted after the service, treatment or admission has occurred. Medical Reviews are also retrospective. Retrospective review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, veracity of documentation, accuracy of coding or adjudication of payment. Decision and Notication Requirements Timeframes and requirements listed are based on state and federal regulations. Where state regulations are stricter than federal regulations, We will abide by state regulations. If you reside and/or receive services in a state other than the state where your contract was issued other state-specic Health Care Management requirements may apply. You may call the telephone number on the back of your membership card for additional information. Request Category Timeframe Requirement for Decision and Notication Precertication Requests Prospective Urgent 72 hours or 2 business days from the receipt of request whichever is less Prospective Non-Urgent 2 business days from the receipt of the request Concurrent Urgent when request is received more than 24 hours before the expiration of the previous authorization24 hours from the receipt of the request Concurrent Urgent when request is received less than 24 hours before the expiration of the previous authorization or no previous autho- rization exists72 hours or 2 business days from the receipt of request whichever is less Concurrent Non-Urgent 2 business days from the receipt of the request Retrospective 2 business days from the receipt of the request Predetermination Requests Prospective Urgent 72 hours from the receipt of request Prospective Non-Urgent 15 calendar days from the receipt of the re- quest Concurrent Urgent when request is received more than 24 hours before the expiration of the previous authorization24 hours from the receipt of the request Concurrent Urgent when request is received less than 24 hours before the expiration of the previous authorization or no previous autho- rization exists72 hours from the receipt of the request Concurrent Non-Urgent 15 calendar days from the receipt of the re- quest If additional information is needed to make Our decision, We will notify the requesting Provider and send written notication to you or your authorized representative of the specic information necessary to complete the review. If We do not receive the specic information requested or if the information is not complete by the timeframe identied in the written notication, a decision will be made based upon the information in Our possession. Health CerticateHEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT M-85 We will provide notication of Our decision in accordance with state and federal regulations. Notication may be given by the following methods: \u008fVerbal: oral notication given to the requesting Provider via telephone or via electronic means if agreed to by the Provider. \u008fWritten: mailed letter or electronic means including email and fax given to, at a minimum, the requesting Provider and the Member or authorized Member representative. Precertication does not guarantee coverage for or payment of the service or procedure reviewed. For benets to be paid, on the date you receive service: 1.you must be eligible for benets; 2.premium must be paid for the time period that services are rendered; 3.the service or surgery must be a covered benet under your Certicate; 4.the service cannot be subject to an exclusion under your Certicate, including but not limited to a Pre-Existing Condition limitation or exclusion; and 5.you must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your Certicate. CARE MANAGEMENT Care Management is a Health Care Management feature designed to help promote the timely coordination of services for Members with health-care related needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic medical conditions. Our Care Management programs coordinate health care benets and available services to help meet health-related needs of Members who are invited and agree to participate in the Care Management Program. Our Care Management programs are condential and voluntary. These programs are provided at no additional cost to You and do not affect Covered Services in any way. Licensed health care professionals trained in care management and familiar with the benet plan provide these services. For Members who meet program requirements/criteria and who agree to participate in a Care Management program, a licensed health care professional completes an assessment and develops an individualized plan designed to help meet their identied health care related needs. This is achieved through communication, and collaboration with the Member and/or Member's designated representative, treating Physician(s), and other Providers. The licensed health care professional remains in contact with the Member by telephone on a periodic basis to help accomplish the goals of the plan. In addition to coordinating benets, the licensed health care professional may assist with coordination of care with existing community-based programs and services to meet the Member's needs. Care coordination may include referrals to external agencies and available community-based programs and services. Voluntary Wellness Incentive Programs We may offer health or tness related program options for purchase by your Group. If your Group has selected this option, You may receive incentives such as gift cards by participating in or completing such voluntary wellness promotion programs as health assessments, weight management or tobacco cessation Health CerticateM-86 MEMBER GRIEVANCES coaching. (Use of gift cards for purposes other than for qualied medical expenses may result in taxable income to you. For additional guidance, please consult your tax advisor.) These programs are not Covered Services under Your plan but are a value added component of your plan benets. These program features are not guaranteed under your Certicate and could be discontinued at any time. Value-Added Programs We may offer health or tness related programs to Our Members, through which you may access discounted rates from certain vendors for products and services available to the general public. Products and services available under this program are not Covered Services under the Plan but are in addition to plan benets. As such, program features are not guaranteed under your Certicate and could be discontinued at any time. We do not endorse any vendor, product or service associated with this program. Program vendors are solely responsible for the products and services you receive. 12 MEMBER GRIEVANCES Grievances If you are dissatised with medical treatment you have received, you should discuss the problem with your Provider.

This Certicate, the Group Contract, the Group application, any Riders, Endorsements or Attachments, and the individual applications of the Subscriber and Dependents, if any, constitute the entire Contract between the Plan and the Group and as of the Effective Date, supersede all other agreements between the parties. Any and all statements made to the Plan by the Group and any and all statements made to the Group by the Plan are representations and not warranties, and no such statement, unless it is contained in a written application for coverage under this Certicate, shall be used in defense to a claim under this Certicate. Form or Content of Certicate No agent or employee of the Plan is authorized to change the form or content of this Certicate. Changes can only be made through a written authorization, signed by an ofcer of the Plan. Disagreement with Recommended Treatment Each Member enrolls in the Plan with the understanding that they, in consultation with their Providers, are responsible for determining the treatment appropriate for their care. You may, for personal reasons, refuse to accept procedures or treatment recommended by your Providers. Providers may regard such refusal to accept their recommendations as incompatible with continuance of the Physician-patient relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. In this event, the Provider shall have no further responsibility to provide care to you, and We shall have no obligation to have Network Providers available who will render the care. If you refuse to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Provider believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, you will be so advised. In such case, neither the Plan, nor any Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care in the case of the Provider, and to arrange care in the case of the Plan for the condition under treatment or any complications thereof. Circumstances Beyond the Control of the Plan If circumstances arise that are beyond the control of the Plan, the Plan will make a good-faith gesture to arrange an alternative method of providing coverage. Circumstances that may occur, but are not within the control of the Plan, include but are not limited to, a major disaster or epidemic, complete or partial destruction of facilities, a riot, civil insurrection, labor disputes that are out of the control of the Plan, disability affecting a signicant number of a Network Provider's staff or similar causes, or health care services provided under this Certicate are delayed or considered impractical. Under such circumstances, the Plan and Network Providers will provide the health care services covered by this Certicate as far as is practical under the circumstances, and according to their best judgment. However, the Plan and Network Providers will accept no liability or obligation for delay, or failure to provide or arrange health care services if the failure or delay is caused by events/circumstances beyond the control of the Plan. Health CerticateGENERAL PROVISIONS M-91 Coordination Of Benets This Coordination of Benets (COB) provision applies when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan. Please note that several terms specic to this provision are listed below. Some of these terms have different meanings in other parts of the Certicate, e.g., Plan. For this provision only, \"Plan\" will have the meanings as specied in the below. In the rest of the Certicate, Plan has the meaning listed in the Denitions section. The order of benet determination rules determine the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benets. The Plan that pays rst is called the Primary Plan. The Primary Plan must pay benets according to its policy terms regardless of the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan. The Secondary Plan may reduce the benets it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. The Allowable expense under COB is the higher of the Primary and Secondary Plans' allowable amounts. A Network Provider can bill you for any remaining Coinsurance, Deductible and/or Copayment under the higher of the Plans' allowable amounts. This higher allowable amount may be more than Our Maximum Allowable Amount. COB DEFINITIONS Plan is any of the following that provides benets or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. 1.Plan includes: Group and non group insurance contracts and subscriber contracts; Health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts; Uninsured arrangements of group or group-type coverage; Coverage under group or non group closed panel plans; Group-type contracts; Medical care components of long term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benets under group or individual automobile contracts (whether \"fault\" or \"no fault\"); Other governmental benets, except for Medicaid or a government plan that, by law, provides benets that are in excess of those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan. 2.Plan does not include: Accident only coverage; Specied health for of long-term care coverage benets or other xed indemnity coverage; School accident-type coverages covering grammar, high school, and college students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a twenty-four (24) hour or \"to and from school\" basis; and Medicare supplement policies. Each contract for coverage under items 1. or 2. above is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing health care benets that the COB provision applies to and which may be reduced because of the benets of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benets is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benets, such as dental benets, coordinating only with similar benets, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benets. The order of benet determination rules determine whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan. Health CerticateM-92 GENERAL PROVISIONS When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benets rst before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benets. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benets after those of another Plan and may reduce the benets it pays so that all Plan benets do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. Allowable expense is a health care expense, including Deductibles, Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering you. When a Plan provides benets in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benet paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering you is not an Allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging you is not an Allowable expense; however, if a Provider has a contractual agreement with both the Primary and Secondary Plans, then the higher of the of the contracted fees is the Allowable expense, and the Provider may charge up to the higher contracted fee. The following are non Allowable expenses: 1.The difference between the cost of a semi-private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. 2.If you are covered by 2 or more Plans that calculate their benet payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement methods, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specic benet is not an Allowable expense. 3.If you are covered by 2 or more Plans that provide benets or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense. 4.If you are covered by one Plan that calculates its benets or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method and another Plan that provides its benets or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement will be the Allowable expense for all Plans. However, if the Provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benet or service for a specic negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the Provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment will be the Allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benets. 5.The amount of any benet reduction by the Primary Plan because you have failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable expense. Examples of these types of Plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertication of admissions or services, and Network Provider arrangements. 6.The amount that is subject to the Primary high-deductible health plan's deductible, if We have been advised by you that all Plans covering you are high-deductible health plans and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 7.Any amounts incurred or claims made under the Prescription Drug program of this Plan. Closed panel plan is a Plan that provides health care benets primarily in the form of services through a panel of Providers that contract with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other Providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. Health CerticateGENERAL PROVISIONS M-93 Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES When you are covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benet payments are: The Primary Plan pays or provides its benets according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benets of under any other Plan. 1.Except as provided in Paragraph 2. below, a Plan that does not contain a coordination of benets provision that is consistent with this COB provision is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. 2.Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benets and provides that this supplementary coverage will be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are placed over base plan hospital and surgical benets, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed panel plan to provide out-of-network benets. A Plan may consider the benets paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benets only when it is secondary to that other Plan. Each Plan determines its order of benets using the rst of the following rules that apply: Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers you other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan, and the Plan that covers you as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if you are a Medicare beneciary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering you as a Dependent and primary to the Plan covering you as other than a Dependent (e.g. a retired employee), then the order of benets between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering you as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan covering you as a Dependent is the Primary Plan. Rule 2 - Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan . Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benets is determined as follows: 1.For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: \u008fThe Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan; or \u008fIf both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan. 2.For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: \u008fIf a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; Health CerticateM-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS \u008fIf a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benets; \u008fIf a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benets; or \u008fIf there is no court decree assigning responsibility for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benets for the child are as follows: \u008eThe Plan covering the Custodial parent; \u008eThe Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial parent; \u008eThe Plan covering the non-custodial parent; and then \u008eThe Plan covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent. 3.For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of item 1. above will determine the order of benets as if those individuals were the parents of the child. Rule 3 - Active Employee or Retired or Laid-off Employee . The Plan that covers you as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan also covering you as a retired or laid-off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if you are a Dependent of an active employee and you are a Dependent of a retired or laid-off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benets, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benets. Rule 4 - COBRA or State Continuation Coverage . If you are covered under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law and are covered under another Plan, the Plan covering you as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering you as a Dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benets, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benets. Rule 5 - Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . The Plan that covered you longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered you the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. Rule 6 . If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benets, the Allowable expenses will be shared equally between the Plans meeting the denition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan. EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN When this Plan is secondary, it may reduce its benets so that the total benets paid or provided by all Plans during a plan year are not more than the total Allowable expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benets it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benets paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable expense for that claim. Health CerticateGENERAL PROVISIONS M-95 Because the Allowable expense is the higher of the Primary and Secondary Plans' allowable amounts, a Network Provider can bill you for any remaining Coinsurance, Deductible and/or Copayment under the higher allowable amount. In addition, the Secondary Plan will credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. If you are enrolled in two or more Closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel Provider, benets are not payable by one Closed panel plan, COB will not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel plans. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benets payable under This Plan and other Plans. We may get the facts We need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benets payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benets. We need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benets under This Plan must give Us any facts We need to apply those rules and determine benets payable. FACILITY OF PAYMENT A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, We may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benet paid under This Plan. We will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benets in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benets provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of the payments made by Us is more than should have paid under this COB provision, We may recover the excess from one or more of the persons: 1.We have paid or for whom We have paid; or 2.Any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benets or services provided for the Member. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benets provided in the form of services. Medicare Any benets covered under both this Certicate and Medicare will be paid pursuant to Medicare Secondary Payor legislation, regulations, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, subject to federal court decisions. Federal law controls whenever there is a conflict among state law, Certicate provisions, and federal law. Except when federal law requires the Plan to be the primary payor, the benets under this Certicate for Members age 65 and older, or Members otherwise eligible for Medicare, do not duplicate any benet for which Members are entitled under Medicare, including Parts B and/or D. Where Medicare is the Health CerticateM-96 GENERAL PROVISIONS responsible payor, all sums payable by Medicare for services provided to Members shall be reimbursed by or on behalf of the Members to the Plan, to the extent the Plan has made payment for such services. For the purposes of the calculation of benets, if the Member has not enrolled in Medicare Part B, We will calculate benets as if they had enrolled. Physical Examination When a claim is pending, We reserve the right to request a Member to be examined by an applicable Provider. This will be requested as often as reasonably required. Workers' Compensation The benets under this Certicate are not designed to duplicate benets that Members are eligible for under the Workers' Compensation Law. All money paid or owed by Workers' Compensation for services provided to a Member shall be paid back by, or on behalf of, the Member to the Plan if the Plan has made or makes payment for the services received. It is understood that coverage under this Certicate does not replace or affect any Workers' Compensation coverage requirements. Other Government Programs The benets under this Certicate shall not duplicate any benets that Members are entitled to, or eligible for, under any other governmental program. This does not apply if any particular laws require the Plan to be the primary payor. If the Plan has duplicated such benets, all money paid by such programs to Members for services they have or are receiving, shall be paid by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan. Subrogation and Reimbursement These provisions apply when We pay benets as a result of injuries or illness you sustained and you have a right to a Recovery or have received a Recovery. Subrogation We have the right to recover payments We make on your behalf from any party responsible for compensating you for your injuries. The following apply: \u008fWe have the rst priority for the full amount of benets We have paid from any Recovery regardless of whether you are fully compensated, and regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses and injuries. \u008fYou and your legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable Us to exercise Our rights and do nothing to prejudice them. \u008fWe have the right to take whatever legal action We see t against any party or entity to recover the benets paid under this Plan. Health CerticateGENERAL PROVISIONS M-97 \u008fTo the extent that the total assets from which a Recovery is available are insufcient to satisfy in full Our subrogation claim and any claim still held by you, Our subrogation claim shall be rst satised before any part of a Recovery is applied to your claim, your attorney fees, other expenses or costs. \u008fWe are not responsible for any attorney fees, other expenses or costs without Our prior written consent. We further agree that the \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benets paid by Us. Reimbursement If you obtain a Recovery and We have not been repaid for the benets We paid on your behalf, We shall have a right to be repaid from the Recovery in the amount of the benets paid on your behalf and the following apply: \u008fYou must reimburse Us to the extent of benets We paid on your behalf from any Recovery. \u008fNotwithstanding any allocation made in a settlement agreement or court order, We shall have a right of Recovery, in rst priority, against any Recovery. \u008fYou and your legal representative must hold in trust for Us the proceeds of the gross Recovery (i.e., the total amount of your Recovery before attorney fees, other expenses or costs) to be paid to Us immediately upon your receipt of the Recovery. you must reimburse Us, in rst priority and without any set-off or reduction for attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benets paid by Us. \u008fIf you fail to repay Us, We shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatised portion of the amount of benets We have paid or the amount of your Recovery whichever is less, from any future benet under the Plan if: 1.The amount We paid on your behalf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by Us; or 2.you fail to cooperate. \u008fIn the event that you fail to disclose to Us the amount of your settlement, We shall be entitled to deduct the amount of Our lien from any future benet under the Plan. \u008fWe shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatised portion of the amount We have paid or the amount of your settlement, whichever is less, directly from the Providers to whom We have made payments. In such a circumstance, it may then be your obligation to pay the Provider the full billed amount, and We would not have any obligation to pay the Provider. \u008fWe are entitled to reimbursement from any Recovery, in rst priority, even if the Recovery does not fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or underlying claim for damages or fully compensate or make you whole. Health CerticateM-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS Your Duties \u008fYou must notify Us promptly of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you occurred and all information regarding the parties involved. \u008fYou must cooperate with Us in the investigation, settlement and protection of Our rights. \u008fYou must not do anything to prejudice Our rights. \u008fYou must send Us copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you. \u008fYou must promptly notify Us if you retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is led on your behalf. Right of Recovery Whenever payment has been made in error, We will have the right to recover such payment from you or, if applicable, the Provider. In the event We recover a payment made in error from the Provider, except in cases of fraud, We will only recover such payment from the Provider during the 24 months after the date We made the payment on a claim submitted by the Provider. We reserve the right to deduct or offset any amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. The cost share amount shown in your Explanation of Benets is the nal determination and you will not receive notice of an adjusted cost share amount as a result of such recovery activity. We have oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor and Subcontractor contracts. We may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider, Vendor, or Subcontractor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. We have established recovery policies to determine which recoveries are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments if the cost of collection exceeds the overpayment amount. We may not provide you with notice of overpayments made by Us or you if the recovery method makes providing such notice administratively burdensome. Relationship of Parties (Group-Member Plan) Neither the Group nor any Member is the agent or representative of the Plan. The Group is responsible for passing information to the Member. For example, if the Plan gives notice to the Group, it is the Group's responsibility to pass that information to the Member. The Group is also responsible for passing eligibility data to the Plan in a timely manner. If the Group does not provide the Plan with timely enrollment and termination information, the Plan is not responsible for the payment of Covered Services for Members.
