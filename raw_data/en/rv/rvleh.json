Bas ed on the discussion with NHAI headquarter it was decided to develop the road as 6 lane configuration as per IRC: SP:87-2019. 2.8 Traffic Management Plan The overall traffic management plan is designed and intended to specify adequate safe ty measures in advance against identified hazards and stipulated implementation of the said safety measures to ensure safe movement of traffic during the construction operations of 6 lanes from KN/TS border (Ch 202+900) to Kurnool (Ch 280+400 the state of Telangana &Andhra Pradesh. The objective of safety standards is to provide safe travel to the drivers of vehicles plying on the Project Highway at all times of the day, throughout the year and provide protection to the Project workers when they are on the work. This overall traffic management plan delineates the safety standards in terms of Construction zones, Signs and Safety measures in work zones and during normal operations. Road safe ty features, including Traffic Signs, Road Markings, Road lighting & Crash Barriers are pr oposed and designed as per relevant IRC codes and standards. During construction it is usual that the operating traffic will be affected to some extent and nearby public and commuting transportation will suffer the inconvenience, additional time, cost and distance. Contractor shall at all-time carry out construction work on the road in manner creating least interference to the free flow of traffic as per the approved Traffic Management P lan. 2.8.1 Traffic Management Practices The traffic management strategies include the following fundamental principles: i. Making the traffic safety an integral and high priority element of the project. ii. Avoid inhibiting traffic as much as possible. iii. Guide Drivers in a clear and positive way. iv. Routine inspection of traffic control element and traffic operations v. Protection to Project workers on work site. IRC SP55 is the guideline to be followed for circulating traffic during construction. Following picture gives the work zone safety criteria during construction.

The consideration of alternatives to a proposal is a requirement of the EIA report. During the scoping process, alternatives to a proposal can be generated or refined, e ither directly or by reference to the key issues identified. A comparative analysis of alternatives will help to determine the best method of achieving project objectives while minimizing environmental impacts. Various alternatives selec ted for analysis usually includes the \"no project or \"no action alternative. The relative impact of each alternative is compared against the baseline environment to select a preferred alternative. The Project road under consideration is a part of the Surat-Chennai economic corridor, starting from KN/TS Border passing through Kancharla, Ghattu, Bingidoddi, Laxmipuram in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Development of this route will reduce the distance from Surat to Chennai by nearly 280 km. The study was undertaken to studying the project scenario and without project scenario. Environmental Considerations such as Flora and fauna likely to be impacted; Land availability; and engineering alte rnatives have been undertaken in terms of alternative cross-sections of road, highway-design principles (such as embankments for soil erosion, minimum width of road ride drainage, adequacy of roadway width at cross drainage structures, minimum gradient, etc.), comparison between flexible and rigid pavements (cement- concrete built rigid pavement as being environmentally superior then traditional flexible pavement), and selection of environmental friendly road construction methods. Therefore, discussion in this chapter includes the project with alternatives related to the desig n. Besides this an evaluation has been carried out for th e 'with' and 'without' project situation -in terms of the potential environmental impacts for the justification of the project. This chapter discusses how environmental parameters were assigned due importance and were carefully considered in the analysis o f alternatives. The objective of this chapter is to highlight some of the salient issues considered for exercising options. 3.1 'With Project' And Project' Scenario 3.1.1 With Project' Scenario The 'with Project' scenario includes construction of new Six la ne expressway from Surat to Chennai. The 'with project' scenario has been assessed to be economically viabl e and will alleviate the existing conditions. It would thereby, contribute to the development goals envisaged by the Government of Telangana and Andhara Pradesh as well as Government of India, and enhance the growth potential of the state. 3.1.2 'Without Project' Scenario In the case of 'without project' scenario the existing Raichur -Kurnool road connecting NH 167 (Raichur- Mantralayam road) to Raichur and connecting Kurnool near Alampur market will be considered for travelling. Considering the present traffic volume and potential for growth in near future, the c apacity of the present road is insufficient for handling expected traffic volume and calls in for immediate improvements. The population growth, increase in traffic volumes and the economic development along the project co rridor would continue to occur and will put pressure on the existing road condition. The existing unsafe conditions and the adverse environmental consequences, in terms of the environmental quality along the roads, would continue to worsen in the absence of the proposed improvements. Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 22 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Therefore, the no-action alternative is neither a reasonable nor a prudent cours e of action for the proposed project, as it would amount to failure to initiate any further improvements and impede economic development. Keeping in view the site conditions and the scope of devel opment of the area, the 'With' and 'Without' project scenar ios have been compared as shown in Table 3.1. By looking at the table it can be concluded that \"With\" project scenario with positive/beneficial impa cts will vastly improve the environment and enhance social and economic development of the region compared t o the \"Without\" project scenario, which will further deteriorate the present environmental setup and quality of life. Hence the \"With\" project scenario with minor reversible impacts is an acceptable option tha n the \"Without\" project scenario. The implementation of the project therefore will be definitely advantageous to achieve all - round development of the economy and progress of the State. Table 3-1 : Comparison of Positive and Negative Impacts of 'With' and 'Without' Proje ct Scenario With Project Without Project Positive Impacts Negative Impacts Positive Impacts Negative Impacts The construction of new expressway will reduce the traffic congestion and wastage of fuel. Flourish in trade and Commerce. Providing better level of service in terms of improved riding quality and smooth traffic flow. Reduction in accident rate. Access to new Employment Opportunities. Employment of local workers for the execution of project Better access to health care and other social services. Improved quality of life of the local people. Better way side amenities and other facilities like bus bays/shelters, truck laid byes and service roads. Adequate underpasses flyovers for cross over. About 484.77 ha of land shall be acquired. Trees will be cut down due to development of green field alignment. Increase of traffic will lead to air and noise pollution. Removal of trees and vegetation due to construction of proposed project. Changes in land use pattern along the new green field alignment. Increase in dust pollution and noise Pollution during Construction period. However, this will be for short term. No acquisition of land or properties and hence no displacement of families. No felling of existing trees and vegetation. Travel time and fuel consumption level will be more due to bottlenecks. Increased air pollution in the close proximity of the existing roads due to slow moving traffic and congestion. Rise in noise levels due to more traffic congestion on the existing road s. Chances of accidents on existing transport infrastructure will be more in absence of the planned Expressway. Further deterioration of project road. 3.2 Location and Alignment Alternatives 3.2.1 Alignment Modifications due to Environmental Considerations The selection of the alignment options along various sections has been worked out based on continuous interaction between the engineering design team and environmental study teams. Various alignment Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 23 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. improvement alternatives (left/right) for the project road have been analyzed along entire p roject road considering rural sections, urban sections, alignment in forest areas and junction impr ovements. The factors considered for evaluation of alternatives are: Flora and fauna likely to be impacted Productive agricultural land likely to be impacted Impact on water resources and surface water bodies Environmental quality Land availability Land uses along the alignment Residential / Commercial structures Impacted Religious structures affected 3.2.2 Engineering / Technological Alternatives The formulation and analysis of engineering alternatives have been undertaken in terms of alternative cross- sections of road, highway-design principles (such as embankments for soil erosion and sl ope protections, minimum width of road ride drainage, adequacy of roadway width at cross drainage structur es, minimum gradient, etc.), comparison between flexible and rigid pavements, and selection of environmentally friendly road construction methods. 3.2.3 Criteria for Fixing Alignment for Greenfield Green field highway 1 The Greenfield alignment between two terminal stations should be short and straight as far as possible, but due to engineering, social and environmental considerations some deviations may be required. 2 The project should be constructible and easy to maintain; the Greenfield project should reduce the vehicle operation cost with respect to the existing option already available i.e. using the NH/SHs in combination to reach from point A to point B. 3 It should be safe at all stages i.e. during design, construction and operation stages. Saf ety audits at each stage should confirm the same. 4 The project initial cost, maintenance cost, and operating cost should be optimum so as to be considered economical with respect to its options. 5 The Greenfield alignment should be finalised giving due consideration to siting/location of major structures including Major/Minor Bridges, Interchanges and ROBs. The space requirement of interchanges to be kept into consideration to avoid major resettlement. 6 The alignment should follow the unused / barren land to the extent possible to reduce the cost of land acquisition. 3.2.4 Obligatory points through which Greenfield alignment options should not pass are detailed below: Habitations: Proposed alignment is fixed in such a way that traverses at a minimum distance of 120m from built up areas and avoiding important buildings and structures. However, few isolated buildings f alling along the alignment cannot be avoided due to Geometric requirements. Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, Reserve Forest and other Eco Sensitive Zones: Utmost care is taken while fixing the alignment near wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. The MOEF&CC guidelines Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 24 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. have been adhered to and the alignment has been fixed keeping it away from WLS, Sanctuaries and T iger Reserves. Water Bodies: The Greenfield alignment has been fixed taking due consideration & importance of retaining the existing water bodies as far as feasible. Railway Crossings and Important Structures: The components which increases the project cost are the presence of the Major bridges, ROBs and other structures. In order to reduce the project cost number of structures and its length were given due consideration while finalizing the Greenfield Option. 1.1.3 Option analysis Three alignment options (Figure 3.1) were studied and compared in order to finalize the proposed alignment. Alignment options were compared considering following parameters: Least impact on forest area Minimum impact on habitations Less number of structures affected Better connectivity to major towns Least distance so that lesser carbon footprint is generated Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 25 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd.

Broad aspects on various environmental parameters such as geography, climate and meteorology, geology, physiography, seismology, ecology, socio-cultural and economic development parameters which are likely to be affected by the proposed road are presented. Secondary information was compiled from relevant government agenc ies like the Forest Department, State Environment Protection and Pollution Control Boards, and Meteorological Department. Baseline conditions define the characteristics of the existing environment. They provide the basis fr om which project impact comparisons are made. Baseline analysis has taken into account: Past trends in environmental quality. Other current or proposed development programs in the project area. Environmental components to be considered in relation to highway projects are: (a) land, (b) water, (c) air and meteorological (d) biological (e) noise (f) solid waste management (g) socio economic and health environment. Hence, baseline data has been collected through actual physical surveys and observations, literature surve ys, interaction with locals, government agencies and departments. This chapter describes the baseline environment settings in the area and will throw light, its effect on day- to-day environment. 4.2 Study Area As per the EIA Guidance Manual for Highways (MoEF&CC, 2010); a study area of 15 km radius from the project road was considered for secondary data collection. Primary data has been colle cted within 500 meters on either side of the proposed alignment. Secondary data were collected from published reports, r esearch papers, working plans, consultations and discussions with govt. officials. Primary baseline e nvironment monitoring was carried out for the period of January 2021 to March 2021. 4.3 Physical Environment 4.3.1 Physiography and Jogulambha Gadwal District: The affected Gadwal district in Telangana state has typical physiographic characteristics of a plateau. It is higher in altitude in the North and North-western parts showing a rugged topography with an elevation ranging between 300 and 600 meters. The district mainly belongs to the Archaean formation. A few areas in the north-western and western part have Palaeozoic -upper pre-cambrian, lower pre-Cambrian, Mesozoic-lower tertiary and undated formations. A smaller area in the South-ea st is noticed to show the upper Precambrian formations. As regards the soils, Ustalfs gr oup predominate all over the district excepting for a smaller area along the South-western margin of the district, whe re Ustalfs and Usterts groups are noticed. Kurnool District : Kurnool district consists of two distinct physiographic provinces such as undulatory gneissic terrain with low denudational hills in the west and a sedimentary terrain with structur al plateaus and homo clinical ridges and valleys in the east. The climate of the district may be describe d as semiarid. The project site is completely green field with very few tree species. Tungabhadra flow through the pr oposed project road.

The proposed alignment follows the 'plain' and 'rolling' terrain. The elevation varies from ~283 m to ~440 m above MSL at different locations. Average elevation of the project stretch is ~300 m above MSL. Figure 4-1: Elevation Profile of the Proposed Alignment 4.3.2 Geology The geology of the area in general comprises of granites and gneisses of Peninsular gneissic complex of Archean age. The terrain around entirely covers mainly of grey and pink granites of Archean, with plains and small mounds of Pre-Cambrian granitoides with small dolerite dykes, pegmatite and quartz intrusions of basic enclaves. The area possesses few outcrops, and therefore, the lithological and structur al mapping has to be carried out to understand the geology of the concern basin. The Red, black and loamy soils are the prominent soil horizons in the study area. These soils are developed due to weathering of granitic and mafic rocks. Red soils are present in the dry upland areas while black and loamy soils are de veloped in water logged areas. The drainage in the area is dendritic type and it is controlled by undulatory topography, geographical location, physiography, climate, rainfall and drainage with a third order streams is predominant in the basin. 4.3.3 Climat ology The study of micro meteorological conditions of a particular region is of utmost importance to unders tand the variations in ambient air quality status in that region. The prevailing micrometeorology at project site plays a crucial role in transport and dispersion of air pollutants released from the project site. The persistence of predominant wind direction and wind speed will decide the direction and extent of air pollution impact zone. The principal variables which affect the micrometeorology are horizontal transport and dispersion (average wind speed and directions), connective transport and vertical mixing (atmospheric stability) and topography of the area towards local influences. The micrometeorological data recorded in the study region as well as surface meteorologica l data procured from IMD corresponding to nearest available observatories are appropriately used in this study. The hourly record of wind speed and wind direction during the study period was used for computing the r elative percentage frequencies of wind occurrences in various directions. Climate: The climate of the project area is generally hot. As per climatic conditions, the year may be divided into four seasons. The hot season is from March to May. From March onwards it is a period of continuous rise in the temperature and May is generally the hottest month of the year. The South-west m onsoons extend from June to September and the North-east monsoon follows up to the end of December. T he cold season is from December to February. The mean daily maximum temperature of the town is about 40\u00b0C and a mean daily minimum 20\u00b0C is experienced during the summer. The days are intensively very hot and the temperature may rise up to 44\u00b0C. The rainy season starts in June and ends in September. The average rainfall of the town is 642 mm annually.

The bulk of which is received through the Southwest monsoon 455 mm during the period from June to September. In all the villages, people mainly depend on Handri Niwas Suzla Shrawanti Pathkam Canal for drinking and domestic purposes and Government tap water in some. Also since rain-fed agric ulture is the major occupation of the population, the scanty rainfall affects their economy as well. Humidity: Based on long term climatological data of the district, it is found that the average relative humidity in Gondiparla is around 57% although it varies from around 45% during Summer (March) to 71% during the Monsoon (August). The most humid month of the year is August with humidity varies from 39.6% to 96.1%. The least humid month is of the year is March, with humidity varies from 17.8% to 87.8%. Wind: Wind speed and wind direction have a significant role on the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants and therefore, the air quality of the area. Ground level concentrations for the pollutants are inversely proportional to the wind speed in the down wind direction, while in upwind direction no effect be observed and in cross wind direction partial effect due to the emission sources is observed. Windrose o f Gondiparla shows that dominant wind blows from the W much of the time - about 18.04% of all hourly wind directions. Approximately 6.26% (max) of the time the wind blows from the W at speeds are more than 5 m/s. Further, at Gondiparla much of the time winds blow at speeds between 2 and 10.84 m/s - which is 27.86% of the time. About 0.94% of time winds were CALM i.e. wind speeds less than 0.5m/s.

Cloud Cover: The average Cloud Cover of Gondiparla (Kurnool district) is around 5/10th although it varies from around 1/10th during Winter (January) to 9/10th during the Monsoon (July). The cloudiest month of the year is July with cloud cover varies from 1/10th to 10/10th. The clearest sky month is of the year is January, with cloud cover varies from 0/10th to 10/10th. 4.3.4 Soil Soil is the thin layer of organic and inorganic materials that covers the earth rocky surface. T he organic portion is derived from the decayed remains of plants and animals, is concentrated in the dar k uppermost topsoil. The inorganic portion made up of rock fragments, was formed over thousands of years by physical and chemical weathering of bedrock. Productive soils are necessary for agriculture to s upply the world with sufficient food and for growth of plants/trees for supplying pure air for human growth. The study on soil quality establishes the baseline characteristics in the study area surrounding the p roject site. The study has been addressed with the following objectives to determine: The baseline characteristics of the soil. The soil characteristics of proposed project site. The impact of industrialization/ urbanization on soil characteristics. The impacts on soils from agricultural productivity point of view. Soil samples were taken from three (3) locations to assess the existing soil conditions . The sample was collected by ramming a core-cutter into the soil up to 90 cm depth. The sample collection, prese rvation, storage, transportation and analysis were carried out as per the standard methods. Soil sample was packed in a separate labeled plastic zipper bags and transported to the laboratory for further analysis. The details of the sampling locations are given in Table 4-2 and location map is presented in Figure 4.2. Table 4-2 : Soil Sampling Locations along the Proposed Project Sl.

On the basi s of pH measurements, the degree of soil acidity may be indicated. The pH of soils in the range 7. 15 to 7.65 is called normal to saline soils. Most of the essential nutrients like N, P, K, are available f or plants. Soils having pH below 7 are considered to be acidic from the practical standpoint, those with pH less t han 5.5 and which Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 34 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. respond to liming may be considered as acid soils. Based on the electrical conductivity, the soils are classified into 4 groups (Normal, Critica l for germination, Critical for growth of the sensitive crops, Injurious to most crops). The electrical conductivity in the study area varied from 258 to 285 S/cm, indicating that all the soil samples falls under normal category. The total organic carbon in the study area varied from 0.30 to 0.46 % indicating that sample f alling in low level. Other important parameters for characterization of soil for irrigation are Nitrogen, Phosphorus a nd Potassium which are known as primary nutrients whereas Calcium, Magnesium and Sulphur are known as secondary nutrients. The primary and secondary nutrient elements are known as major elements . This classification is based on their relative abundance and not on their relative importance. 4.3.5 Seismic Profile of the area Bureau of Indian Standards [IS-1893 Part 1:2002] categorizes the country into four Zone-III, Zone-IV and from Zone-II (L east active) to Zone-V (Highest Active).

In order to assess the impact on existing air environment due to the proposed projects, it is necessary to have baseline air status of various polluta nts. The prime objective of baseline air quality survey was to assess the existing air quality of the area. Thi s will also be useful for assessing the conformity to standards of the ambient air quality. Evaluation of the resultant air quality due to the proposed project requires the determination of the exist ing air quality in terms of PM 10, PM 2.5, Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NO 2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). The methodology for the monitoring instruments and techniques has been in accordance to the guidelines laid by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The equipment was placed at a heig ht of 4- 5m above ground level at each monitoring station, for negating the effects of windblown ground dust. A network of four (4) AAQ monitoring stations were selected for assessment of the existing statu s of air environment within the study zone. The selections are based on consideration of meteorological data a nd present human activity and settlement along the proposed project area.At such locations and each sampling day, continuous 24 hours sampling was conducted for PM10, PM2.5, Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO).Sampling and Analysis of air samples were conducte d as per established standard method and procedure. The 24-hourly summarized ambient air quality monitoring results for each station is presented in Table 4-6. Table 4-6 : Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Locations Sl.

Noise impacts can be of concern during construction and operational phases of the project. Factors those are important in determining noise level s include distance from the noise source, natural or manmade barriers between the source and the r eceptors, whether conditions, etc. An assessment of baseline noise level was undertaken to (a) establish the status of exposure of the major sensitive receptors, and (b) to identify the noise pollution levels in and around the site. The noise monitoring was conducted at four (4) locations as per CPCB guidelines. A sound level meter (SLM 100) was us ed for monitoring of background noise level. The measurements were carried out for 24 hours. The details of the monitoring locations and results are presented in Table 4-8 .

There are no industrial enterprises in and around the project area. It was observed that ambient noise leve ls are well within the prescribed noise standards as per Noise Rules 2000. 4.6 Water Environment The principal rivers flowing in the Kurnool district are Thungabhadra (and its tributary the Hundri) Krishna and Kunderu. Thungabhadra rises in the Western Ghats and after forming part of Northern boundary fo r some distance, separates Kurnool with Mahabubnagar while flowing in an Eastern direction and receives Hundri; thereby both these rivers fall into the river Krishna at Kundli sangam about 29 Km from Kurnool after winding North wards. The normal rainfall of the Kurnool district is 670 mm. Krishna River is the main river in Guntur district and the remaining rivers are Gundla kamma, Musi, Chandravanka and Naguleru. The Krishna river which rises in Mahabaleshwar (Maharashtra State) and flowing through Karnataka State passes through Mahbubnagar and Kurnool districts and enters Guntur district near Ganikonda hills at the South and western portion of Palnad subsequently joins Bay of Bengal. Gundlakamma river rises in Prakasam district and traverses in this district. Nagule ru River rises in the hills near Nayakurali Kanuma in Vinukonda, flows across Palnad and joins Krishna River. A stone dam is constructed across it at Dachepalle. Chandravanka River also flows across Palnad and joins Krishna River. There are other streams of minor importance in the district. The normal rainfall of the district is 852 mm. The proposed alignment is crossing 3 rivers and 53 nala/ Canal are being crossed by the proposed alignment.

Biotic factors are the community of different organisms under two broad categories i.e. flora and fauna. Biological as sessment of a study area is an essential part of EIA studies to understand the status of the living communities in the area as well as to determine the probable impacts of the proposed projects on the same. 4.7.1 Forest The Andhra Pradesh has variety of vegetation types rich in flora and fauna. Its varied t opography ranging from the hills of Eastern Ghats and Nallamala to the shores of Bay of Bengal, supports varied ecosystems. The forests in the State can broadly be divided into four major biotic provinces viz Deccan Plateau, C entral Plateau, Eastern Highland and the East Coastal Plains. As per the Champion & Seth Classification of Forest Types (1968), the forests in Andhra Pradesh belong to five Type Groups which are further categorized into 20 Forest Types. Eastern Ghats region of the State is home to dense tropical fores ts, while the vegetation becomes sparse as the Ghats give way to the Deccan Plateau, where shrub vegetation is more common. The vegetation is largely dry deciduous type with a mixture of Teak, and species of the genera Te rminalia, Dalbergia, Pterocarpus, is endemic to Andhra Pradesh and is highly valued for its rich red colour and grain pattern. The Andhra Pradesh has reported extent of recorded forest area (RFA) 37,258 sq km which is 22.86 % of its geographical area. The reserved, protected and unclassed forests are 85.78 % and 13.60 % and 0.62 % of the recorded forest area in the State respectively. The State of Telangana is endowed with rich diversity of Flora and Fauna. The State has dense T eak forests on the northern part along the banks of river Godavari. As per the Champion & Seth Classific ation of Forest Types (1968), the forests in Telangana belong to three Forest Type Groups, which are further divided into 12 Forest Types. The State Government has taken up a massive greening programme, 'Telangana Ku Harita Haram' in the State to plant and protect 230 crore seedlings over a period of 4 years. This initiative aims at achieving the twin objectives of increasing the forest cover and reduce pressure on the exist ing forest resources, through massive community participation by Vana Samrakshna Samithis (VSS) and Eco- Development Committees (EDCs) in Protected Areas and Watershed Development Committees in the Watershed areas. Telangana has reported extent of recorded forest area (RFA) 26,904 sq km which is 24.00% of its geographical area. The reserved, protected and unclassed forests are 75.65%, 22.07% a nd 2.28% of th e recorded forest area in the State respectively.

The proposed alignment is not passing through any forest area notified under Forest Conservation Act 1980. 4.7.2 Protected Area The protected areas are 9 wildlife Sanctuary, 3 National Park, 2 Tiger Reserve, 2 Zoological Parks, 4 Deer Parks and 4 Private Deer Parks in the state of Telangana. The State of Andhra Pradesh is located in East Central Peninsular India. It represents the extensive Deccan Bio-Geographic Zone. It has three important geographical zones i.e., the Coastal Plains, the Eastern Ghats and the Deccan Plateau. It has three important rivers Godavari, Krishna and Pennar which drain into the Bay of Bengal. There are 1 Tiger Reserve, 1 Elephant Reserve (Koundinya Sanctuary and Rayala Elephant Reserve), 1 Biosphere Reserve (Seshachalam), 3 National Parks and 13 Wildlife Sanctuarie s in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The proposed alignment neither passing thorough nor falling within 10.0 km radius of any eco-sensitive/ protected area notified under Wildlife Protection Act 1972. Hence, recommendations from NBWL shall not be required for the development of proposed alignment. 4.7.3 Terrestrial vegetation and flora of the core zone The project area consists of majorly agriculture fields, fallow lands, and scrub for ests. Agriculture fields observed were ( Canjanas cajan ) and apart from those commercial crops like Allium sp., Gossipium , Tobacco and also vegetables like Red chilies, Brinjal, Bhendi etc., are grown in the buffer zone. Mango i s the most common and widely grown fruit tree in the buffer zone. There are many non-cultivable w astelands sparsely covered with thorny species like Prosopis juliflora , Acacia nilotica etc., and other tree Ficus benghalensis, Ficus religiosa, Eucalyptus hybrid, Leucaena leucocephala and Calotropis procera, Cassia auriculata etc. List of Flora (trees, shrubs and perennial climbers) found in the project influence area is given in Table 4-14 .

Euphorbia hirta Euphorbiaceae Asthma weed 17 Ficus racemosa Faunal Study A linear transect of 1 km each was chosen for sampling at each site. E ach transect was trekked for 1.5 h for sampling of animals through the following methods. For sampling butterfl ies, the standard 'Pollard Walk' method was employed and all the species were recorded daily. Voucher specimens of the s pecies that could not be identified in the field were collected using of a butterfly net besides photographing them. For sampling birds, 'point sampling' along the fixed transect (fo ot trails) was carried out. All the species of birds were observed through a binocular and identified with the help of field guides and photographs. For sampling mammals, 'direct count on open width (20m) transect' was us ed. In addition, information on re cent sightings/records of mammals by the villagers and locals was also collected. In c ase of reptiles mainly lizards were sampled by 'direct count on open width transects'. 4.7.5 Terrestrial fauna of the core area and the buffer zone As the animals, especially vertebrates and the winged invertebrates move from place to place in se arch of food, shelter, mate or other biological needs, separate lists for core and buffer areas are not feasible . There are no wildlife habitats, wetlands or IBAs. As such there are no chances of occurrence o f any rare or endangered or endemic or threatened (REET) species within the core or buffer area. Primary survey carried out through physical observations, information gathered from surrounding villagers and nearby forest department. Among the Mammals, only Squirrels, Mongoose, Rats, Ba ndicoots, Monkeys were seen and feaces of Rabbits and Wild boar were observed during the s urvey in the surroundings of the site. Among the reptiles, Lizards, Garden lizards were very common. No Snakes or M onitor lizard were seen during the survey. The amphibians were also rare. Avi fauna was observed during ac tive period of the day early morning and evening hours. Birds observed during survey namely Crows, Jungle crows , Parrots, Doves, Green seeder birds, Mynas, Indian robin, Common babbler and Black drongo etc. The list of fauna observed during primary survey and based on secondary sources is given in Table 4-15. It is apparent from the list that none of the species either spotted or reported is included in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

The study was carried out to determine the engineering proper ties of the following materials, which are to be used in construction. Borrow Quarries for locating hard stone / granular materials for use in sub bases, bases, bituminous mixes and concrete works. 4.9.1 Borrow Area As the alignment is Greenfield, borrow materials should be used for construction of embankment. How ever as fly ash was readily available within 100 km radius of the road, it is proposed to us e fly ash as filling material in embankments except for RE walls. An earth cushion of 1 m width has been provided on all sides of fly ash embankment as per IRC SP 58: 2001. The investigation was also carried out for locating and ascertaining the suitability of the borrow s oil in areas along or near the project road section for design and construction of sub-grade and embankment of widening/up-gradation portion of pavement as well as foundation for various road cross-s ection elements. Details have been provided in the feasibility report. 4.9.2 Quarry & Crushers Road construction activities are closely linked with quarry sites around the work sites. The s tone materials including sand and granular ones are needed in large quantities for the pavement construction. The other area of requirement is concrete structures, which call for a good quality stone. Extensive s urvey was conducted to locate the availability of stone metal near the project site. As a result of local enquiries and discussion with the local official's stone metal was identified at various locati ons. Existing quarr ies that are already in operation with requisite environmental clearances have been recommended for this project and no new quarries have been proposed. The sources of the materials are given in Table 4- 21.

Chapter also discusses about suitable mitigation. For superimposition of the impacts, the baseline information was collected through prima ry and secondary data. The impacts on the various environmental components were assessed considering following stages of the project: Planning and design stage; Construction stage; and Operation stage The description and magnitude of likely impacts on various environmental components along with mitigation measures are presented in the following sections. 5.2 Physical Environment 5.2.1 Meteorological Parameters Impact The climate of the project area is generally hot. The hot season is from M arch to May. From March onwards it is a period of continuous rise in the temperature and May is generally the ho ttest month of the year. Though no significant change in the macro-climatic setting (regional precipitation, temperature and wind) is envisaged due to the project, however, microclimate is likely to be temporarily modified by vegetation removal and addition of increased pavement surface. An increase in daytime temperature near the r oad surface due increased pavement surface, which in turn might lead to formation of heat islands especially near the inhabited sections. This increase in the daytime temperature assumes significant especially in close vicinity of proposed highway, as the project area experiences temperatures as high as 40-46\u00b0C during summer season. Mitigation Although the impact is significant but reversible in nature and shall be compensate by avenue tree plantation alongside the proposed highway as per IRC SP- 21:2009 to compensate the micro -climatic impacts. It must be noted that the impact is unavoidable. However, it may be pointed out that the project has taken care to minimise tree felling as no tree felling shall be done beyond corridor of impact. Considering t he expressway, no slow moving traffic or pedestrians are likely on proposed highway . 5.2.2 Land 5.2.2.1 Physiography Project highway mostly follows the plain and rolling terrain. Highway construction activities involve alterations in the local topography and drainage patterns. The impacts on physiography may include de- stabilization of slopes due to cut and fill operations. Total 3 major bridges, 31 minor br idges and 1 55 culverts are proposed to avoid any impact on local hydrology.

The project does not have any direc t impact on the geological or seismic stability of the area. However, associated mining activities for construction ma terial may alter the local geology to some extent. The structure as proposed for the project are being de signed considering the seismic magnitude of the region. 5.2.2.3 Quarries Impact Existing quarries that are already in operation with the required clearances have been r ecommended for this project. No new quarries are proposed and hence no major impacts, which arise in ma king new quarries operational, are likely. In case Contractor / Concessionaire decides in opening new st one quarries stipulated GoI norms should be followed as mining in non-scientific manner may unstable the soil condition and affe ct the terrain of the area. Dust, in addition to associated health impacts also reduces visibility thereby increasing saf ety concerns. As no new quarry is proposed to be opened for this project, therefore, no new impacts are likely to arise due to quarrying operations. It will be ensured that quarry contractor is following environment management system to take care of the working conditions of workers in the existing quarry areas se lected for the project.

Sl. No. Chainage Location of quarry Ownership 2 277+125 Handri River Government Mitigation Existing approved quarries which are already in operation with the required environmental clearances have been recommended for this project, hence no new quarries have been proposed. It needs however, to be noted that recommendation on use of quarries is a guideline only and has been done to establis h the feasibility of construction. The issue of dust generation etc. along the haul roads needs to be addr essed through proper enforcement of dust suppression measures. Sand required for the construction will mostly be procured from the approved operating river quarrie s. As an alternative to borrowing of sand from river-bed the possibility of using stone crusher dust and fly ash shall be explored. Stone dust from crusher can be used for the construction works provided the quantity and the quality produced is certified by Monitoring consultant to be satisfactory for all construc tion works, else river sand shall be used from the identified quarry. The long leads mean that care would have to be taken to prevent spillage of material and damage to the haul roads during transportation. No additional adverse environmental impact except those resulting from spillage during transportation is expected to occ ur. Hence proper care for transportation should be taken into accou nt. Guidelines for Existing Quarry Management & Guidelines for New Quarry Management have be en presented in Annexure 5.1 & Annexure 5.2 respectively. 5.2.2.4 Borrow Area Impact Borrow areas may become potential breeding ground for mosquitoes and other bacterial infection disea se if not reclaimed properly in a scientific manner. The transportation of borrow materials may also cause dust nuisance. Top-soil as removed from the borrow area may lose its fertility if not handled properly. Mitigation The borrow areas are selected in a scientific manner with due care of loca l environment and social sensitivity. The excavation of soil shall be conducted as per the EMP and will be fully rehabilitated with pr oper NOC from the respective land owner / authority. The top soil from the borrow area shall be preserved separately and will be re-used for rehabilitation. MoEF&CC norms & guidelines shall be followed for borrow area opening and management. The detailed plan for borrow area management has been attached as Annexure 5.3. 5.2.2.5 Soil Erosion Pre-Construction Stage Impact The removal of vegetation will cause erosion. and increased run-off due to paved sur face would in turn lead to erosion of productive soil from nearby areas. The direct impact of erosion is the loss of embankment soil and danger of stability loss for the road itself. This impact is generally restricted to the RoW. No vegetation clearance or tree felling is proposed beyond the construction zone. Mitigation The project has taken care of this issue at the engineering design stage itself, as at desig n gradients of 1:2, the slopes of the embankments are perceived to be stable. Tree felling shall be limited for the corr idor of impact Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 51 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. only. High embankment section of the road shall be suitably turfed by stone pitching or any other suitable turfing materials. Construction Stage Impact Elevated sections of the highway, high embankments along the bridges and the bridge approaches woul d be vulnerable to erosion and need to be provided proper slope protection measures to prevent eros ion. Construction of new bridges involves excavation of riverbed and banks for the construction o f the foundations and piers. If the residual spoil is not properly disposed off, increased s edimentation downstream of the bridge is likely. Mitigation Adequate slope protection measures are proposed as part of engineering design. Silt fencing shall be provided to prevent eroded material from entering watercourses. Though during construction period, drainage alteration and downstream erosion / siltation is anticipated, however, cross drainage structure bas ed on hydrology study shall compensate the drainage alteration in the surrounding area. Operation Stage No soil erosion is envisaged when the road is in operation as all the slopes and embankments of the project road shall be stabilized through sound engineering techniques. The regular cleaning of the drains by the Contractor will ensure that these structures are not overloaded or rendered ineffective due to overload. 5.2.2.6 Compaction of Soil Impact Compaction of soil may take place due to movement of heavy machinery and vehicles on nearby agricultural land. Similarly, compaction will take place during setting up of construction camps and stockyards. Mitigation The movement of construction vehicles shall be limited to designated road. So that compaction of nearby productive land can be saved. Provision of reclaiming of nearby land has also been suggested to cure the soil compaction in nearby productive lands. 5.2.2.7 Contamination of Soil Impact Soil contamination may take place due to waste disposal from the labour camp set up during pr e-construction stage. The sites where construction vehicles shall be parked and serviced are likely to be contaminated because of leakage or spillage of fuel and lubricants. Fuel storage areas are als o susceptible to the soil contamination by accidental spillage and run-off. Unwarranted disposal of construction spoil and debris will add to soil contamination. During the operation stage, soil pollution due to accidental vehicle spills or leaks is also having a low probability. Mitigation Following mitigation strategies are proposed to control soil contamination. Fuel oil shall be stored in separately designated covered area with RCC surface to pre vent any soil contamination due to spillage Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 52 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Overflow of service and washing areas shall be passed through the oil interceptors Septic tank with soak pit facility will be provide in labour camps to prevent any soil contaminati on due to sewage discharge Waste management system was per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 will be adopted in construction camps Scarified bitumen (if any) waste shall be disposed-off at designated landfill site only The quality of the soil shall be monitored on regular basis to find out the effectivene ss of the mitigation measures and further improvement in measures (if required). The monitoring plan shall be functio nal in construction as well as in operation stages. The frequency, duration and responsibility will be a s per the Environmental Management Plan. Guidelines for Identification of Debris Disposal Sites & Precautions and Guidelines for Re habilitation of Dumpsites & Quarries have been attached as Annexure- 5.4 & Annexure- 5.5 respectively. 5.2.3 Air Quality Air quality along the project corridor will be impacted both during the construction and operation stages of the project. Construction stage impacts will be of short term and have adverse impacts on the c onstruction workers as well as the habitation located near to the proposed highway, especially those in the down wind direction. Operation stage impacts will not be as severe as the construction stage impacts and will generally be confined to a strip of up to 100m from the edge of the lane on either side of the corridor. 5.2.3.1 Generation of Dust Pre-Construction Sta ge Impact Generation of dust is the most likely impact during this stage due to: Site clearance and use of heavy vehicles and machinery etc. Transport of raw materials from quarries to construction sites Mitigation Adequate measures such as regular sprinkling of water, covering of dumpers carrying c onstruction & excavated materials, use of PUC certified vehicles, etc. are proposed for abatement of dust emission. Construction Stage Impact Construction activities to be carried out during the dry season when the moisture content would be less , dust generation, particularly due to earthworks will be significant. Dust is likely to be generated due to the various construction activities including: Movement of construction vehicles and machineries on unpaved surface; Transportation of construction materials; Mixing of construction materials; Construction and allied activities. Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 53 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Mitigation Generation of dust is a critical issue and is likely to have adverse impact on health of workers working in dust prone areas. The Environmental Action Plan to be prepared by Contractor / Concessionaire must lay emphasis on enforcement of measures such as provision of pollution masks, regular spri nkling of water to suppress dust, transportation of construction material in covered trucks, etc. to mitigate the impact. Operation Stage No dust generation is envisaged during the operation stage as shoulders shall be compacted & pav ed and all slopes & embankments shall be turfed as per best engineering practices. The air quality s hall further also be improved due to the plantation activity to be carried out in the available RoW at the end of construction phase. 5.2.3.2 Generation of Exhaust Gases Impact Generation of exhaust gases is likely during the pre-construction stage due to movement of heavy vehicles & machinery, oil tankers, etc. SO2, NO2 and HC are likely to be emitted from hot mix plant operations. Volatile toxic gases may also be released due to heating process during bitumen production. Although the impact is much localized however, it can spread downwind depending on the wind speeds. Construction vehicles shall also be releasing exhaust gases. The major impact on air quality during operation stage will be due to plying of vehicles. The impac ts on air quality will at any given time depend upon traffic volume / rate of vehicular emission within a given str etch and prevailing meteorological conditions. Air pollution impacts arise from two sources: (i) inadequate vehic le maintenance; and (ii) use of adulterated fuel in vehicles. Mitigation Regular maintenance and pollution check is proposed for construction vehicles and machineries No bad quality fuel shall be used in construction vehicles and machinery Hot mix Plant to be installed in downwind direction from nearby settlement at minimum 1000m distance. Broad-leaved pollution resistant species, which can grow in high pollutant concentrations or even absorb pollutants, shall be planted as they help settle particulates with their higher surface areas along with thick foliage. Cassia fistula (Amaltas), Ficus and Azadirachta indica (Neem) are recommended. However, plantation shall be carried out in close communication with the forest dept. with the help of native species. Other measures such as the reduction of vehicular emissions, ensuring vehicular maintenance and upkeep, educating drivers about driving behaviour. However, these methods are beyond the scope of the project but will be far more effective in reducing the pollutant levels. NHAI together with the Motor vehicles Department and SPCB can arrange for provision for inspection for PUC certificates at the toll plazas. 5.2.3.3 AAQ Impact Prediction Modelling of CO Using CALINE 4 Dispersion Model CALINE 4 (Caltrans, 1989) is a simple line source Gaussian plume dispersion model that predicts air impacts near roadways. The model is broadly divided into five screens such as Job Parameters, Ru n Conditions, Link Geometry, Link Activity and Receptor Positions. Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 54 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Job Parameters Run Type: determine averaging times and how the hourly average wind angle(s) will be determined. In the present case modelling exercise were made to predict the impact on worst case scenario. Multi- Run / Worst Case Hybrid type was used for CO impact modelling. Aerodynamic Roughness Coefficient: determine the amount of local air turbulence that affects plume spreading. CALINE 4 offers the 4 choices for aerodynamic roughness coefficie nt namely; Rural, Suburban, Central Business District and Other. For the present modelling rural r oughness options have been considered. Altitude above Sea Level: Define the altitude above mean sea level. This input is used to determine the rate of plume spreading. Run conditions Wind Speed: Expressed in meters per second. USEPA recommends a value of 1 m/s as the worst- case wind speed. Wind Direction: The direction the wind is blowing from, measured clockwise in degrees from the north. As the model study is on \"Worst Case scenario\", therefore CALINE 4 will consider this input by default. Link Geometry Link Type: 5 choices available such as At Grade, Fill, Depressed, Bridge and Parking lot. In this particular model study At Grade link type is used. Link Height: For the project link height is being considered as zero. Mixing Zone Width: Mixing zone is defined as the width of the roadway, plus 3m on either side. Link Activity Traffic Volume: The hourly traffic volume anticipated to travel on each link, in units of vehicles per hour. Emission Factor: The weighted average emission rate of the local vehicle fleet, expressed in terms of grams / mile per vehicle. Receptor Positions Receptors positions expressed in Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system. Z value can also be provided to assess the proposed impacts at various heights. For the present case incremental GLCs were assessed at every 10m interval from the edge of the project highway. Approach and Methodology Emission Factors were arrived using standard values prescribed by The Automotive Rese arch Association of India, Pune under Air Quality Monitoring Project-Indian Clean Air Programme (ICAP). Project Stretch is the part of two(2) traffic sections separated by interchanges. Traffic load and emission factors w ere estimated for all the traffic sec tions for the projection year 2051- 52 to assess the worst-case scenario analysis. Table 5-3 presents the Traffic and emission factor considered for the modeling. Table 5-3: Traffic and Emission Factors for Traffic Sections Year Traffic volume per day Emission Factor (gm/mile) for CO Section 1 (km 202.900 to km 271.900, Total Length- 69.000 km) 2051-52 10305 KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 55 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd.

The output results at various distances along the project expressway for projected year 2051- 52 are presented in Table 5-4. Table 5-4: Predicted Pollutant Concentration Location Resultant CO Concentration (mg/m3) at various distance from RoW Edge 0.05 Section 2 1.09 0.75 0.48 0.37 0.30 0.26 Conclusion Considering that maximum 98th percentile CO concentration in study area was 0.8 mg/m3 and predicted maximum incremental concentration outside PRoW (nearest possible receptor) of 1.09 mg/m3, the maximum resultant CO concentration shall be in the tune of 1.89 mg/m3 in respect to 2 mg/m3 of A mbient Air Quality Standards. Hence, predicted CO concentration including ambient level shall remain within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for the projected years 2051-52. The predicted concentration is based on Emission Level of the vehicle as present scenario. However, there is enough possibility of the advancement towards cleaner fuel and technology. 5.2.4 Water Resources 5.2.4.1 Physical Loss of Surface Water Bodies Impact Alteration of the surface water regime is expected due to proposed expressway construction Surface water bodies along the project road might be subject to adverse impacts due to the various construction activities Project section is crossing 3 rivers and 53 nala/canal as detailed location provided in Table 4.9. Mitigation Total 3 major bridges, 31 minor bridges and 1 55 culverts are proposed to avoid any impact on local hydrology. Cross drainage structures are designed to avoid any compromise on the flow part. Cross-drainage structure is proposed at pond locations to limit the affected area an d to maintain the catchment unaffected. Compensatory digging is proposed to maintain the storing capacity of the ponds. Continuous both side drain has been proposed along the proposed highway. Surface runoff shal l be drained to the nearest cross drainage structure. The engineering design includes desig n of cross drainage structures, which should take care of the extra flow. Structure on the Irrigation Canals and Minors shall be designed in concurrence of Irrigation dept. Silt fencing during construction period will be provided between road and water bodies to avoid any siltation due to run-off from construction area Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 56 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. 5.2.4.2 Water Required for the Project Impact The construction works requires a considerable quantity of potable water for the various ac tivities including construction of the pavement, dust suppression, curing etc. The total demand of water to be use d during the construction phase will be around 60,50,560 KL. The demand though is only indicative in nature and shall differ during the period of construction. The demand shall be met through availability of supply both f rom surface and ground sources. However, mostly surface water shall be used for the construction work. Mitigation Prior approval for taking adequate quantities of water from surface and ground water source s shall be taken from respective authority before start of construction. The road operation does not make a dema nd on the available water resources apart from time to time requirement during works such as maintenanc e of roadside tree plantations. Rainwater harvesting structures all along the proposed alignment as per as per MoEF&CC guidelines and are a cost effective method for recharging of ground water le vel in the project area . The rainwater-harvesting chamber shall be placed at every 1000m interval c/c (500m interval in a stagge red way)with dimensions of 2 x 2 x 0.75m3 all throughout the project corridor. A perforated RCC Slab covers the chamber. There is a 20cm filling, which also acts as sediment trap. There is another sediment trap in the bottom from where debris can be removed manually after certain period. A vertic al drain (PVC pipe) is then sunk from the bottom of the chamber to a depth which varies as per the water table. Drains interconnect these chambers. Figure 5-1 : Rainwater Harvesting Structure 5.2.4.3 Loss of Drinking/Household Water Resources Impact The impact on the local water supply sources like hand pumps, wells and tanks is likely due to proposed development. About 23 nos. of hand-pump shall be relocated due to proposed development. Relocations of all these water supply sources have been recommended and the cost of the relocation shall be paid as per LARR, 2013 provisions. Mitigation The losses have been covered under the utility relocation process. Compensatory wa ter supply sources will be set up before the start of construction and shall be as close as possible to the original location. Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 57 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. 5.2.4.4 Water Quality Impact Due to site clearing activities, soils around the surface water regime will be exposed, due to which, the suspended sediments and the associated pollutants can be transported into these water sourc es. The impacts due to the increased sediment load will be significant to some extent. Contamination of groundwate r is another likely impact of road construction and allied activities. The contamination of the water res ources due to the project is likely from following reasons: Concentration of suspended solids in receiving water bodies due to soil erosion from site clearing area Run-off from the construction site near the water bodies and sources of water supply Disposal of solid and liquid wastes by labour, spills or leaks can affect the water quality Run-off from fuel storage and work-shop area as Oil and grease form a film on the water surface and hinder the transfer of oxygen into water Contamination by fuel and oil containing discharge or accidental spillage from construction vehicles or bitumen from hot-mix plants Sewage discharge from the labour camp Increased sediment load, lesser sunlight, difficulty to settle, etc. will make the surface water more turbid. If the concentrations are higher, smaller fish may be harmed. Large, heavy sediment, particularly w ith slow moving water may smother algae and eventually alter the nature of the sub-stratum. Excessive sediment loads may also mean disruption to areas where fish lay their eggs. The water quality of surfa ce drainage channels is likely to be impaired as long as the construction period continues. Mitigation The engineering design shall ensure protection of embankment slopes. Loose soil and constr uction material heaps around the construction sites are prone to erosion and contribute to the increas ed sediment load in the near-by water bodies. The major parameter of concern would be the sediment load from the spoils. The major pollutants of concern are suspended solids, oil and grease, lead and other heavy metals. Silt fencing shall be provided along the river and ponds. Silt fencing shall be provided on either side of the crossing water body to the affected length plus 5 m on either side to control the sediment load. Locations of silt fencing as identified along the water body are presented in Table 5-6 . Silt fencing of about 910m will be provided to prevent sediments during construction period near the water bodies. In addition to the above measures on Beas and Kali Bein river shall be provide d as per recommendation of wildlife dept. The silt fencing consists of geo textile with extremely small siz e supported by a wire mesh mounted on a panel made up of angle / wooden frame and post. It is expected a single person will be able to drive the angles by pressing from the top. The frame will be installed at the edge of the water body along which construction is in progress. The number of such units to be installed shall be decided depending upon the length of the water body along the side of the road construction. Guidelines for Sediment Control has been attached as Annexure 5.6.

Figure 5-2: Schematic diagram of Silt Fencing Oil interceptor: Oil and grease from road run-off is another major concern during construction a s well as operation. During construction, discharge of oil and grease is most likely from workshops, oil and was te oil storage locations, and vehicle parking areas of construction camps. Waste having hazardous pr operties will be stored in designated area only. 14 nos. (2 nos. for each construction package site ) of oil interceptors shall be provided at camp sites to arrest oil and grease, as per Figure 5-2. The arrested pr oducts shall be disposed as per MoEF&CC and SPCB guidelines. The location of fuel storage and vehicle cleaning area will be at least 500 m from the nearest drain / water body. Figure 5-3: Schematic diagram of Oil Interceptor No contamination of any water source is envisaged during the operation period. However, water quality may be impacted due to washing of the vehicles near the water bodies, run-off from the oil spillage a rea due to Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 59 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. wear and tear of vehicles, etc. Road run-off can contain oil, which may end up reac hing into local water bodies. 5.2.5 Noise levels 5.2.5.1 Pre-construction and Construction Stage Site clearing activities, movement of man and machineries, crusher & mixing plants operation, etc. a re likely to increase the noise level of project region. Noise pollution is matter of concern, where alignment is passing near to settlement areas. About 90 dB (A) of noise shall be generated from construction activity which shall attenuate to less than 55 dB(A) i.e. day time prescribed noise level at about 100m and less than 45 dB (A) i.e. night time prescribed noise level at about 300 m. Comparison of distance vs Noise level (considering two Noise s ource of Intensity 90 dB(A) are working in parallel) for day and night time are shown in figures below.

Prior mitigation measures shall be required for neutralizing the affects near settlement areas. Mitigation Measures Construction camp shall be established at least 1000m away from nearest habitation and forest a rea. Temporary noise barriers should be provided surrounding the high noise generating construction equipme nt during work near to settlement area. Stationary noise source like generator sets shall be pr ovided with an acoustic shield around them. The plants, equipment and vehicle used for construction should strictly conform to CPCB standards. Vehicles and equipment should be fitted with silencer and maintained accordingly. Noise generating activities should be scheduled based on community welfare. Noise level should regularly be monitored as per monitoring plan and if the noise level at any time found to be higher, then immediate measure to reduce noise in that area should be ensured. The following mitigation measures as given in table below need to be worked out for the noise impacts associated with the various construction activities. Table 5-5: Summary of Mitigation Measures for Construction Stage Source of Noise Pollution Impacts Generic Mitigation Measures Uilisation of heavy construction machinery; Construction of structures and facilities; Crushing plants, asphalt production plants; and Loading, transportation and unloading of construction materials Increased Noise Levels causing discomfort to local residents and workers All construction equipment, plants, machinery and vehicles will follow prescribed noise standards. All construction equipment used for an 8 hour shift shall conform to a standard of less than 90 dB (A). If required, machinery producing high noise as concrete mixers, generators etc. must be provided with noise shields; At construction sites within 1000 m of human settlements, noisy construction activities shall be stopped between 9.00 PM and 6.00 AM; Vehicles and construction machinery shall be 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Resultant Noise Level in dB(A) CPCB night-time Standards Development from KN/TS boarder Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 61 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Source of Noise Pollution Impacts Generic Mitigation Measures monitored regularly with particular attention to silencers and mufflers to maintain noise levels to minimum; Workers in the vicinity of high noise levels must wear ear plugs, helmets and should be engaged in diversified activities to prevent prolonged exposure to noise levels of more than 90 dB (A) per 8 hour shift; Hot mix plant, batching or aggregate plants shall not be located within 1000 m of sensitive land use and settlements; Project is an expressway project and shall facilitate free flow of the traffic. Therefore, proposed development is likely to reduce the noise associated with Traffic Jam on existing roads. 5.2.5.2 Operation Stage Impact Road noise depends on factors such as traffic intensity, the type and condition of the vehicles plying on the road, acceleration / deceleration / gear changes by the vehicles depending on the level of conge stion and smoothness of road surface. Noise is a major area of concern, especially since sensitive receptors (school, hospital, etc.) have been identified in proximity of the road. CoRTN (Calculation of Road Traffic Noise) model developed by UK Department of Transport is u sed for assessment of Noise Impact Intensity at various distances from the proposed highwa y. Traffic Noise has been estimated for uninterrupted traffic flow condition. Limitations: Metrological conditions and background noise level are not considered by the model. Classification of Vehicles: In CoRTN model vehicles are classified onto two categories: Light vehicles Heavy vehicles Approach, Methodology & Validation: The model has been validated for Indian Conditions by CSIR Central Road Research Institute and published the validation in 20 08 vide paper titled \"Validation of Noise Prediction Model for an Urban Area\". The present model used for the project is derived from the CSIR CRRI validated and modified model. Input Traffic: CoRTN model software was run by using traffic forecast data of year 2051 -52, which has the maximum generated traffic for assessment of worst case scenario. The assessme nt of traffic along the corridor is based on the interchanges proposed along the road, as they are going to act as points where traffic will join or leave the highway. The sections based on interchanges is provided in Table 5-7.

Section 2 Mitigation Measures Though the level of discomfort caused by noise is subjective, however, there is a def inite increase in discomfort with an increase in noise levels. No sensitive receptor like educational, he alth facilities, etc. in the immediate vicinity of project highway. Therefore, no significant impact on is expected due to propos ed development. Further, Contractor will undertake the consultation in nearby residential for scheduling of the construction activities. 5.3 Biological Environment 5.3.1 Protected Areas The proposed alignment is neither passing through nor falling within 10.0 km radius of any National Park or Wildlife Sanctuary. Therefore, Wildlife Clearance is not required under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Hence, no significant impact on biodiversity of these area is expected due to proposed development. Forest Areas The proposed alignment is not passing through any forest area in the State. Need for diversion of forest land has not been envisaged for this project. Hence Forest Clearance under the purview of Fore st (Conservation) Act, 1980 is not applicable. 5.3.2 Impacts on Biological Environment Development activities of a road project implies direct impacts on the biological environment in its vicinity. Road projects are linear in nature and it traverses several types of landscape s depending on the length of the project stretch. The degree of impact on biological environment thus depends on the type of the landscape s i.e. forest/wooded area, agricultural, urbanised, rural, wastelands & barren areas. The proposed road project is a greenfield project that will pass mainly through the agriculture fields. In this scenario and based on the observations following impacts on the terrestrial flora, fauna and aquatic life have been envisage d in the construction and operation phases of the project. 62.360.158.557.1 55.9 54.9 54.0 53.1 52.4 51.7 51.1 50.5 49.9 49.4 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70Noise Level in dB(A) Distance from CW edge Noise Level in dB(A) Standard for Residential Area in dB(A)Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 64 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. 5.3.2.1 Construction Phase In construction phases various impacts take place on flora and fauna due to the anthropological a ctivities like movement of machines, storing of material, living camp formation, movement of staff/workers and other group of people during project construction phase. Felling of Trees and Habitat Destruction At the first place, trees and vegetations area on the RoW shall be cleared for the road. About 695 nos. of trees are likely to be felled. The tree enumeration list is presented in Annexure 5.12. The felling of trees shall have manifold impact. Most visible impact is the loss of shade. Also, there is a possibility of the local people being deprived of tree products, such as wood, fruits, leaves, etc. The removal of trees also increases the degree of soil erosion. Trees act as micro-ec osystems and habitat/shelter for birds, small mammals and insects which depend on these trees, removal of which will also affect these fa unal species. Habitat Destruction and loss of trees also takes place under the demand of fir ewood and timber for cooking by workers. Moreover, there are chances for bush fire-accidents that may spre ad due to uneducated/unaware workers. Impact on Fauna The removal of trees will result in loss of micro-ecosystems i.e. habitat/shelter for birds, small mammals and insects which depend on these trees. Therefore, removal of vegetation, ultimately affects the terrestrial fauna, avifauna and insects etc. which are dependent on these habitats. The movements of the worker and sounds of the machines also scares the fauna that interfere with their routine habits. As the study area is mainly agricultural land and devoid of any natural forest, wild animals / larger a nimals are not commonly seen while domesticated animals were most commonly seen. No Schedule- I Avifauna species was found in the project affected area . The construction of the highway may have negligible/minimum impacts on the domesticated habitat. Impact on Aquatic Life Road development activity is likely to disturb the aquatic habitat depending on the extant and design of the project. A large quantity of construction material like stones, pebbles, gravel and sand are stored & used in construction phase. There are possibilities of contamination of the waterbodies like ponds, c anals etc. due to spillage of the construction material. This sediment loading & increased turbidity shall result in de cline in the number and diversity of aquatic flora and fauna. 5.3.2.2 Operation Phase Roads are considered as the major cause of the pollution due to the vehicular movement. This affects the biotic components in the surrounding. The noise caused by the vehicular movements shall disturb and frighten the fauna & their habitats. Moreover, road kills & accidents are also a common phenomenon where the domesticated and wild fauna get injured or killed while crossing the roads. Roads also isolate the habitats, and act as barrier in the corridors/migratory routes. 5.3.3 Mitigation Measures 5.3.3.1 Construction Phase Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 65 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. State Forest and Wildlife Department has been contacted and informed about the proposed project. The proposed project is neither passing through nor falling within 10.0 km radius of the any eco - sensitive/protected areas notified under Wildlife Protection Act. 1972. Following Measures will also be taken carefully during the construction phase; Clearing of the RoW and propagation of the road structure will be carried carefully to cause least possible disturbance to the soil, water and air environment. Disposal of construction wastes shall be done in approved wastelands besides recycling & reuse of certain materials as per the a pproval obtained from SPCB. Labour camps shall be setup only after obtaining proper permissions from the Engineer and a lternate fuel shall be provided to the labourers in the labour camps to ensure that no firewood will be us ed for cooking etc. The camps shall have proper toilets with sanitary disposal of wastes. Smoking, hunting & fishing i n the wild are prohibited and the contractor shall conduct regular awareness trainings related to non-use of firewood, prohibition on smoking in natural areas, bush fires accidents, safe handling of animals (if encountered), prohibition of fishing etc. No labour camps shall be permitted in the vicinity of any water body in order to avoid the deterio ration of water quality and any human induced impact on aquatic life nor shall workers be permitted to use waterbodies for bathing and washing. Silt fencing has also been proposed to ensure that siltation and hence turbidity doesn't increase. The Contractor shall regularly service the construction vehicles & machinery and ma intain these in good condition to avoid high level noise. The construction activities shall not be permitted after 8 PM in normal circumstances. In case of exigencies permissions for the same shall be a ccorded by the PD & the TL of the Engineer. Moreover, all EMP provisions made for the air, water, noise pollution control w ill be implemented, and thus will be also helpful to control the negative impacts on the flora and fauna. The loss of trees and ecosystem shall have to be compensated through compensatory plantation s in accordance with the principles of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Indian Forest Polic y. Compensatory plantation/afforestation shall be undertaken for each tree to be felled as per forest department's directive. Such compen sation shall be done with native species and proper care of the saplings will be taken to ensure survival. Plantation along the proposed highway shall act as a new habitat for avifauna, lesser mammals & insects. The avenue and median plantation shall also be undertaken as per SP- 21:2009. Adequate provisions for the maintenance & monitoring of the same must be worked out. Co-operation of locals to ensure that local cattle does not damage the saplings during the early stages of growth will be required. Tree Plantation strategy has been attached as Annexure 5.7. List of local native floral species ar e recommended for taking up afforestation has been presented in table below.

Considering the access-controlled status, ribbon development near the proposed highway is having ver y less possibility. However, interchanges locations are likely to induce ribbon development. The availability of labour and easy access to markets in the city will make roadside areas quite an incentive for the industrialist and investors of their sectoral development. Reduced transportation costs and availability of high -class transportation facilities for raw materials and products will be the most important advantage of the proposed expressway. 5.4.6 Exploitation of Resources Improvement in the connectivity will have an impact on the natural resources. Easy accessibility of the area will increase the migration and population of the region. This means more and more use of the natural resources like ground water and energy needs like fuel, etc. While the medium-term impacts may not be large enough to be noticed, the long-term implications are potentially noticeable. Separate labour camp away from habitation shall be constructed. All day to day need shall be procured from nearby city markets. No fuelwood shall be permitted for the cooking and other purpose. 5.4.7 Traffic congestion during construction Traffic congestion due to construction activities is common phenomena for any developmental activities.

People suggested for service road along the side of proposed expressway Affected people demanded for vehicular underpass for day to day activities People requested for acquisition of complete khasra rather than partial acquisition People requested for provision for quality drinking and irrigation facilities Air & Noise pollution was not a big concern. However, dust pollution in dry season and noise due to traffic movement sometime disturbs immediate roadside dwellers. The potential PAPs in general were very much concerned about the mode and amount o f compensation People suggested that adequate safety measures should be provided. In brief, it was felt during consultation that regular meeting with the local population / community could easily resolve any dispute between the community people and implementing agency settlements. Green Belt development along the highway Site specific EMP has been designed to address environmental and social related issues 7.3 Public Hearing 7.3.1 Purpose of Public Hearing Public consultation is an integral part of the project and required to conduct prior to Environmental Clearance. Public consultation is the process by which the concerns of local affected per sons and others who have reasonable stake in the environmental impacts of the project or activity are ascertai ned. The proposed project falls under Category 'A' and Public Hearing was organized as pe r the provisions of EIA Notification 14th September, 2006 & its subsequent amendments. The project proponen t shall be submitted the draft EIA report along with executive summary in local & national language to State Pollution Control Board for its wide circulation. Public hearing shall be conducted in project districts as per provisions of EIA Notification, 2006 (amended thereof). 7.4 Disaster Management and Risk Assessment& Mitigation Procedures Risk assessment is a process that seeks to estimate the likelihood of occurrence of adverse effects as a result of major road mishaps, gas tanker explosions, fire hazards, floods, cyclones, earthquakes etc. at Highway projects. Fatality rate on Indian highways is very high mainly due to road accidents. The other a dverse impacts due to gas tanker explosions, fire hazards, floods, cyclones, earthquakes etc. are nominal. Elimination of the risk (avoidance of accidents) is given prime importance. Contractor shall conduct Risk Assessment for all works to decide on priorities and to set objectives for eliminating hazards and reducing risks.

It is important that unsafe conditions are not confused with hazards, during hazard identification. Figure 7-1 : Risk Assessment Process 7.4.2 Person(s) at Risk On a construction area, the persons at risk could be site operatives, supervisors, transp ort drivers, other visitors and the general public. The risk assessment must include any additional controls required due to vulnerability of any of these groups, perhaps caused by inexperience or disability. 7.4.3 Risk Control Measures and Hierarchy of Risk Control The next stage in the risk assessment is the control of the risk. When assessing the adequacy of existing controls or introducing new controls, a hierarchy of risk controls should be considered. The principles ar e: Avoiding risks. Evaluating the risks which cannot be avoided. Combating the risks at source. Adapting the work to the individual, especially as regards the design of the workplace, the choice of work equipment and the choice of working and production methods, with a view, in particular, to allevia ting monotonous work and work at a predetermined work rate and to reducing their effects on health. 7.4.4 Emergency Response Plan Concessionaire / Contractor will prepare Emergency Response Plans for all work s ites as a part of the Safety procedures.

The standard distance shall be maintained at 60 - 100 m but can be altered depending upon the approach speed and site conditions. In urban areas this distance shall be taken as 20 m to 50 m. 7.4.9 Traffic Management Practices Definitions : Road traffic control involves directing vehicular and pedestrian traffic around a cons truction zone, accident or other road disruption, thus ensuring the safety of emergency respons e teams, construction workers and the general public. Working zone: The Plant Site, construction zone of road etc. at which workmen will be working. Working space: The space around the works area that will require storing tools, excavated material an d other equipment. It is also the space to allow workmen, movement and operation of plant, (e.g. swing of jibs, excavator arms) to move around to do the job. Materials and equipment must not be placed in the zone either. Workmen will only need to enter the zone to maintain cones and other road sign. Safety zone : The zone that is provided to protect workmen from the traffic and to protect from them. Approach Transition zone : This will vary with the speed limit and the width of the works as given in (diag: Traffic Control zone) Longitudinal buffer zone : This is the length between the end of the lead-in taper of cones (T) and the working space. It will vary with the speed limit as given in table (Traffic Control zone). Lateral buffer zone : This is the width between the working space and moving traffic. It will vary w ith the speed as given in table (Traffic Control zone). The lateral buffer zone safety clearan ce is measured from the outside edge of the working space to the bottom of conical sections of the cones on the side near est to the traffic. 7.4.10 Road and Construction Safety To achieve these objectives, Indian Road Congress (IRC) codes will be followed in proposing and designing road safety features. Pavement markings will be done for traffic lane line, edge lines and hatc hing. The marking will be with hot applied thermoplastic materials. The pavement markings will be reinforced with raised RR pavement markers and will be provided for median and shoulders edge longitudinal line s and hatch markings. During the construction stage, the general safety rules and regulations to be followed are as below: No drugs, alcohol or alcoholic beverages are permitted on work site. All connection for electricity, water supply and other temporary facilities made by authoriz ed persons only and shall be in accordance with legal and contractual requirements. Work shall only be carried out if an authorized person has ordered it. General Safety Hints to the Workers Wear protective clothing or apparel where required to do so.

Details of Public Hearing if Applicable 8.3 Disaster Management Manual Primarily disasters are triggered by natural hazards or human-induced or result from a combination of both. In particular, human-induced factors can greatly aggravate the adverse impacts of a natural disaster. Even at a larger scale, globally, the UN Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has shown that human- induced climate change has significantly increased both the frequency and intensity of extre me weather events. While heavy rains, cyclones, or earthquakes are all natural, the impacts may, and are usually, worsened by many factors related to human activity. The extensive industrialization and urbanization incre ase both the probability of human-induced disasters, and the extent of potential damage to life and property from both natural and hum an-induced disasters. The human society is also vulnerable to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) disasters. 8.3.1 Natural Hazards The widely accepted classification system used by the Disaster Information Management System of DesInventar classified disasters arising from natural hazards into five major categories (DesInventar, 2016). Geophysical: Geological process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. Hydro-meteorological factors are important contributors to some of these processes. Tsunamis are difficult to categorize; although they are triggered by under sea earthquakes, and other geological events, they are essentially an oceanic process that is manifested a s a coastal water-related hazard. Hydrological: Events caused by deviations in the normal water cycle and/or overflow of bodies of water caused by wind set- up Meteorological: Events caused by sho rt-lived/small to meso-scale atmospheric processes (in the spectrum from minutes to days) Climatological: Events caused by long-lived meso- to macro-scale processes (in spectr um from intra-seasonal to multi-decadal climate variability) Biological: Process or phenomenon of organic origin or conveyed by biological vectors, including exposure to pathogenic micro-organisms, toxins and bioactive other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. A brief description of these five major categories of the disasters arising f rom natural factors with the sub- categories is given in Table 7-2. The below classification is not a water tight one. In r eal life situations, many disasters are a combination of different types of disasters. In addition, secondary disa sters may occur after a disaster has occurred. Table 7-2: Categories of Natural Hazards Sl. No. Family Main Event Short Description/ Secondary Disaster 1 Geophysical Earthquake/Mass movement of earth Landslide following earthquake; Urban fires triggered by earthquakes; Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 79 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Sl. No. Family Main Event Short Description/ Secondary Disaster materials Liquefaction - the transformation of (partially) water- saturated soil from a solid state to a liquid state caused by an earthquake; Mass movement of earth materials, usually down slopes; Surface displacement of earthen materials due to ground shaking triggered by earthquakes. Tsunami A series of waves (with long wavelengths when traveling across the deep ocean) that are generated by a displacement of massive amounts of water through underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or landslides. Tsunami waves travel at very high speed across the ocean but as they begin to reach shallow water, they slow down and the wave grows steeper. 2 Hydrological Flood, Landslides and Wave Action Coastal Erosion- The temporary or permanent loss of sediments or landmass in coastal margins due to the action of waves, winds, tides, or anthropogenic activities Coastal flood- Higher-than-normal water levels along the coast caused by tidal changes or thunderstorms that result in flooding, which can last from days to weeks Flash Flood Hydrological - Heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time that produce immediate runoff, creating flooding conditions within minutes or a few hours during or after the rainfall Flood Hydrological- A general term for the overflow of water from a stream channel onto normally dry land in the floodplain (riverine flooding), higher-than normal levels along the coast and in lakes or reservoirs (coastal flooding) as well as ponding of water at or near the point where the rain fell (flash floods) Wave Action- Wind-generated surface waves that can occur on the surface of any open body of water such as oceans, rivers and lakes, etc. The size of the wave depends on the strength of the wind and the travelled distance (fetch). 3 Meteorological Hazard caused by short- lived, micro- to meso- scale extreme weather and atmospheric conditions that may last for minutes to days Cyclone, Storm Surge, Tornado, Convective Storm, Extratropical Storm, Wind Lightning, Heavy Rain 4 Climatological Unusual, extreme Extreme hot/cold conditions Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 80 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Sl. No. Family Main Event Short Description/ Secondary Disaster weather conditions related to long-lived, meso- to macro-scale atmospheric processes ranging from intra-seasonal to multi-decadal (long-term) climate variability Subsidence 5 Biological Exposure to germs and toxic substances Epidemics: viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, Human-Induced Disasters NPDM (2009) notes that rise in population, rapid urbanization and industrialization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation, and climate change aggravates the vulnerabilities to va rious kinds of disasters. Due to inadequate disaster preparedness, communities, and animals are at increased risk from many kinds of human-induced hazards arising from accidents (industrial, road, air, ra il, on river or sea, building collapse, fires, mine flooding, oil spills, etc.). Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) hazards rank very high in among the human-induced risks. Terrorist activities and se condary incidents add to these risks and call for adequate preparedness and planning. 8.3.3 Levels of Disasters The disaster management and its planning at various tiers must take into account the vulnerability of disa ster- affected area, and the capacity of the authorities to deal with the situation. Using this app roach, the High- Power Committee on Disaster Management, in its report of 2001, categorized disaster situa tions into three 'levels': L1, L2, and L3. The period of normalcy, L0, should be utilized for disaster risk reduction. Level- L1: The level of disaster that can be managed within the capabilities and resources at the District level. However, the state authorities will remain in readiness to provide assistance if needed. Level-L2: This signifies the disaster situations that require assistance and active mobilization of resources at the state level and deployment of state level agencies for disas ter management. The central agencies must remain vigilant for immediate deployment if required by the state. Level-L3: This corresponds to a nearly catastrophic situation or a very large-scale disaster that overwhelms the State and District authorities. The categorization of disaster situations into levels L0 to L3 finds no mention in DM Act 2005. Further, the DM Act does not have any provision for notifying any disaster as a national calamity or a national disaster. 8.3.4 Project Specific Provisions for Disaster Management Plan/provisions 8.3.4.1 Nodal Operation Control Rooms Nodal Control Canters should be equipped with the latest Communication facilities and will be manned 24 x 7 during the Construction and Operations Phase. During the Construction Phase, these rooms will be manned by the Contractor's personnel along with the Supervisory staff of the Disaster Management Cell. These Nodal Operation Control Rooms will maintain effective communication at all times with the various agencies listed in Disaster Management Plan viz.

In general Project will have following benefits at national and regional level: High-speed connectivity and access: The proposed project is a greenfield access controlled highway. This will avoid traffic congestion and speed-up the freight movement. It is expected that overall, the proposed Surat to Chennai will reduce the travel time between these places by half. Aiding economic growth: The seamless connectivity will provide better access to vehicles. The Project will reduce travel time and provide boost to trade, tourism and commerce linked to the regions. Decongestion of existing National and State Highways: The proposed corridor will take away traffic pressures from existing SH and NH passing through various cities. Also, long- distance traffic will shift to the proposed highway, thereby reducing traffic and congestion on the existing NH and SH for regional and local usage. Usage shift: Long-distance traffic will shift from existing National Highways to the proposed highway, resulting in lesser congestion leading to higher fuel savings and reduced travel time. Improved safety: Due to access control, the road & travel safety of the traffic connecting the region will be enhanced as there will be minimum distractions & conflict zones. Support to industry: Different types of industries like Tourism, Manufacturing, warehouse facilities, etc. along the proposed corridor will be facilitated in their business operation and reachability. Detailed environmental and social benefits associated with the proposed highway development are descr ibed in sections below. 8.2 Socio-Economic Benefits The socio-economic benefits from the proposed project have been detailed as below: The proposed development project will provide better connectivity, which in turn will benefit all sections of the society like general population, farmers, businessman etc. The proposed project would act as the prime artery for the economic flow to this reason. Improved access to higher education facilities and modern heath care facilities. Strengthening of rural economy which in turn will improve economic scenario of the State a nd country. Faster transportation will strengthen tourist development in the area.

The proposed upgradation requires large number of people from nearby areas during construction stage of the project. T hus there will be increase in employment opportunity for the project area. During the construction phase, the employment opportunities will be created for skilled (engineers, transport, mechanical), semi-skilled (technician, road Inspectors, plant operator, office s upport etc.) and unskilled (general labour) labourers. Most of the skilled labourers may come from other parts of the country; the opportunities for semi-skilled and unskilled sections of the work-for ce will primarily be available from the local communities. Apart from these temporary employment opportunities, there would be permanent employment opportunities for the local community. There will be more commercial establishments such as shops, dhaba/restaurants/, small workshop serving the vehicles moving along the Highway. These activities will provide additional socio-economic development and increased wages in the project area. 8.4 Reduction in Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) will be reduced when a road is improved. Fuel consumption, wear and tear of tyres, suspension will be benefited when geometry of the road is improved. VOC consist of the following components: Fuel consumption Lubricating oil consumption Spare part consumption Tyre consumption Vehicle depreciation 8.5 Indirect Benefits In addition to the direct benefits, there are number of indirect benefit attributed to Highway project. Lowering transportation cost for users and improving access to goods and services enables new and increased economic and social activity. After the development of state highway, the land prices may increase and there would be changes in development of business in order to take advantage of improved speed and reliability in the tr ansportation system. Hence these benefits will lead to increase property values, increased pr oductivity, employment and economic growth. The indirect benefit of the proposed expressway would work through the dynamic developmental externalities generated through the forward and backward linkages. A better connectivity will increase the business, which will reflect in the changes in the pattern of economic activities, income gener ation, price evolution, and employment condition. There will be also increase in greater accessibility to market, health and educational facilities. 8.6 Environmental Benefits The environmental benefits from the proposed project have been described as below: Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 90 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Faster transportation will ultimately lead to savings in the form of reduced wear and tear of vehicles, reduced vehicle operating cost (VOCs) and total reduction in transportation costs etc. Better level of service in terms of improved riding quality and smooth traffic inflow; With the improvement of road surface, the traffic congestion due to obstructed movement of ve hicles will be minimized and wastage due to increased fuel emission from vehicles will be reduced thereby reducing air pollution and improving air quality and health of locals. Plantation in the project area will improve the tree density and which will improve aesthetics as well as tree act as pollution absorber. Increased road landscaping and safety features. The compensatory plantation and plants in the vicinity of camps and facilities including projects for affected families shall further improve the air quality of the region. Overall environment improvement of the region. 8.7 Road Safety The widening of the proposed road project will ensure smooth flow of traffic. I nstallation of proper road safety through the road signages, barricades, and crash barrier will add safe ty to the road users. Bus bays and rest areas are proposed in the project which shall enhance the road safety.

Approval of Monitoring Consultant / Supervision Consultant / Authority Engineer for the Emergency Action Plan for accidents responding to involving fuel & lubricants before the construction starts 11.7 Baseline Environmental Profile 11.7.1 Physical Environment Climatology The climate of the project area is generally hot. As per climatic conditions, the year may be divided into four seasons. The hot season is from March to May. From March onwards it i s a period of continuous rise in the temperature and May is generally the hottest month of the year. The South-west monsoon s extend from June to September and the North-east monsoon follows up to the end of December. The cold season is from December to February. Topography The proposed alignment follows the 'plain' and 'rolling' terrain. The elevation varies from ~ 283 m to ~ 440 m above MSL at different locations. Average elevation of the project stretch is ~ 300 m above MSL. Geology The geology of the area in general comprises of granites and gneisses of Peninsular gneissic complex of Archean age. The project area entirely covers mainly of grey and pink granites of Archea n, with plains and small mounds of Pre-Cambrian granitoides with small dolerite dykes, pegmatite and quartz intrusions of basic enclaves. Soil Soil is the thin layer of organic and inorganic materials that covers the earth rocky surface. T he organic portion is derived from the decayed remains of plants and animals, is concentrated in the dar k uppermost topsoil. The inorganic portion made up of rock fragments, was formed over thousands of years by physical and chemical weathering of bedrock. Soil samples were collected from 3 representative locations for assessment of soil characteristics for the proposed expressway. pH of soil in the study area were found in the range of 7.15 to 7.65, the soil is, therefore, alkaline. The texture of soil is found to be Sandy& Silty Clay in nature. Conductivity of soil in the proposed study area is found to be in the range of 258 \u00b5mhos/cm to 285 \u00b5mhos/cm. Available phosphorous in soil samples along the study area ranges from 18 kg/ha to 22 kg/ ha. Potassium cont ent as K in soil samples in the study area is found in the range of 214 kg/ha to 268 kg /ha. Total organic matter in soil samples in the Study area is found in the range of 0.30 to 0.46 %. Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) Ambient air quality monitoring has been done at evenly distributed 4 locations along the proposed alignment. The results indicate that all air quality parameters are within the standards specified in the NAAQS in absence of any major pollution generation activities near study area. Ambient Noise Level (ANL) Noise monitoring has been carried out once during the entire study period at 4 locations along the propose d alignment for a period of 24 hours. Day & Night-time Leq has been computed from the hourly Leq va lues as Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 102 Date & Version: March 2021, Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. per standards. The Noise quality result shows that Leq Day time varies from 51.0 to 54.0 dB(A) and Leq Nighttime varies from 36.0 to 42.0 dB(A). Noise level was found within the standards. Surface Water Surface water quality along the project stretch was monitored at 3 representative loca tions along the proposed alignment as per the parameters laid down by Central Pollution Control Board for surface water quality criteria. The surface water in the project was found alkaline with pH varying from 7. 4 to 8.6. The reason for alkalinity may be the excessive use of fertilizer in agricultural fields. Ground Water Keeping in view the importance of ground water to the local population, 3 representative ground wate r sampling locations along the proposed alignment were identified and samples were analysed for assessment of ground water quality. The results show that pH was found ranging from 7.28 to 8. 19 in ground water samples taken along the proposed alignment. The chloride content varied between 38.0 to 58.5 mg/l. The Fluoride content was found higher at Bibgidoddi in respect tothe maximum permissible limit (1.0 mg/l) in drinking water as presc ribed by BIS. The concentration of iron in ground water was found 0.28 mg/l to 0.65 mg/l. 11.7.2 Biological Environment Protected Areas The proposed alignment is neither passing through nor falling within 10.0km radius of any National Park or Wildlife Sanctuary. Therefore , Wildlife clearance is not required under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Forest As per the India State of Forest Report, 2019, The Andhra Pradesh has reported extent of recorded forest area (RFA) 37,258 sq km which is 22.86 % of its geographical area. The reserve d, protected and unclassed forests are 85.78 % and 13.60 % and 0.62 % of the recorded forest area in the state respectively. Telangana has reported extent of recorded forest area (RFA) 26,904 sq km which is 24.00% of its geographical area. The reserved, protected and unclassed forests are 75.65%, 22.07% a nd 2.28% of the recorded forest area in the State respectively. The proposed alignment is not passing through nay forest area . Hence, the diversion of forest land is not required under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Flora and Fauna The project area consists of majorly agriculture fields, fallow lands, and scrub f orests. Agriculture fields observed were pea ( Canjanas caj an) and apart from those commercial crops like Allium sp., Gossipium , Tobacco and also vegetables like Red chilies, Brinjal, Bhendi etc., are grown in the buffer zone. Mango i s the most common and widely grown fruit tree in the buffer zone. There are many non-cultivable wastelands sparsely covered with thorny species like Prosopis juliflora , Acacia nilotica etc., and other tree Ficus benghalensis, Ficus religiosa, Eucalyptus hybrid, Leucaena leucocephala and Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 103 Date & Version: March 2021, Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. 11.7.3 Social Environment Census Profile The demographic features of the state of Telangana for the district of Gadwal and that of AP for the district of Kurnool forming an immediate influence area are presented below. As per the population census 2011 the total population of Telangana is 35,193,978 with the density as 307 per sq.km and that of Andhra Pradesh is 49634314 with a density of 304.5/km2. Table 10-1: Demographics of Project District S. No. State/ District Population 2011 Persons Male Female in Project area The people in the villages are mostly engaged in the agricultural work and economy is largely based on agricultural activities. Some people are also working in nearby industries and brick kilns. 11.8 Public Interactions & Consultation Public Interactions & consultations were conducted during the project preparations. The main purpose of these consultations was to know the community's reaction to the perce ived impact of proposed project on the people at individual and settlement level. 11.9 Potential Environmental Impacts The environmental components are mainly impacted during the construction and operational stages of the project and must be mitigated for and incorporated in the engineering design. Environmental mitigation measures represent the project's endeavour t o reduce its environmental footprint to the minimum possible. These are conscious efforts from the project to reduce undesirable environmental impacts of the proposed activities and offset these to the degree practicable. Enhance ment measures are project's efforts to gain acceptability in its area of influence. They reflect the pro-active approach of the project towards environmental management. Slight change in the micro-climate of the area is expected due to heat islan d effect as unpaved area will be converted into the paved road. However, Impact on the climate conditions from the proposed road project will not be significant in long run as removal of vegetation will be compensated by compensatory plantation. 11.9.1 Impact on Air Quality There will be rise in PM levels during the construction activities, which shall again be within pre scribed limit after the construction activities are over. The level of CO is likely to be increased, however, level shall remain within prescribed standards. 11.9.2 Impact on Noise Levels The area is likely to experience an increment in noise level due to increase in v ehicle density after road strengthening. Construction camp shall be established at least 1000m away from neare st habitation and forest area. Temporary noise barriers should be provided surrounding the high noise generating cons truction equipment during work near to settlement area. Avenue plantation have been proposed on either side of the highway to control the associated air and noise pollution.

Design made to avoid physical loss to the water bodies to the extent possible. Contamination to water bodies may result due to spilling of construction materials, oil, grease, fuel and paint in the construction camp. This will be more prominent in case of loc ations where the project road crosses drains, ponds, etc. Silt fencing shall be provided along the major canals a nd pond. Oil interceptors are proposed near fuel handling areas. 11.9.4 Impact on Ecological Resources Trees within ROW are likely to be affected due to the proposed development leading tempora lly loss of micro ecosystem. However, on the long run the impacts will be compensated in terms of compensa tory and avenue plantation. 11.9.5 Impact on Land During the construction of the proposed project, the topography will change due to cuts & fills for p roject road and construction of project related structures etc. Provision of construction yard for material handling will also alter the existing topography. The change in topography will also be due to the probable induced developments of the project. 11.9.6 Social Impacts About 484.77 of land required for proposed highway is distributed across 494 Titleholders. 11.10 Analysis of Alternatives Detailed analyses of the alternatives have been conducted taking into account both with and without pr oject. The proposed development of greenfield highway is likely to have a positive impact on the economic value of the region. However, there are certain environment and social issue, these needs to be mitigated for sustainable development. 11.11 Mitigation Avoidance & Enhancement Measures Mitigation and enhancement measures have been planned for identified adverse environmen tal impacts. The construction workers camp will be located at least 1000 m away from nearby habitations . Hot mix plants, batching plants, etc. will also be located more than 1000 m away from habitations and in downwind directions. Existing cross drainage structures have been planned to maintain for proper cr oss drainage. In order to compensate negative impacts on flora due to cutting of trees the project plans compensator y plantation in the ratio of 1:10 i.e. for every tree to be cut, ten trees will be planted. T he project shall also witness the plantation of trees for providing aesthetic beauty and shade. As the space for compens atory plantation might not be adequate along the project road, this plantation shall be taken up by the fo rest department, after payment of the cost for raising and maintaining the saplings for five years . The project will take an opportunity to provide environmental enhancement measures to improve aesthetics in the project area. The planned environmental enhancement measures include plantation in available clear space in ROW, enhancement of water bodies etc. In order to avoid contamination of water bodies during con struction Silt fencing, oil interceptors at storage areas and at construction yard have been proposed. T he affected households shall be compensated as per the entitlement matrix based on Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act 2013.

The Project road under consideration is a part of the Surat-Chennai Economic Corridor, starting from KN/TS Raipur, A. Nagalapuram, Dupadu in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The existing Raichur-Kurnool road is mostly two lane configuration with paved shoulder in plain terrain and is used mainly by local traffic. Th e condition of the road is poor and there are many deficiencies found along the corridor, like bad geometry, over topping, encroachment etc. NHAI is planning to construct a new Greenfield access controlled alignment which will improve the freight movement along the Surat-Chennai corrido r and as a part of it the KN/TS Border to Kurnool stretch starting from KN/TS border near Singnodi and ending on NH 44 near Dupadu is under consideration for new construction. In compliance with NH Act 1956, the present Social Impact Assessment (SIA) of the project wa s undertaken. The SIA was carried out with the objectives of identifying the potential socio-economic positive and negative impacts of land acquisition and developing attainable mitigation measures to enhance positive impacts and reduce or avoid negative impact, thereby ensuring a participative, informed and transparent process of land acquisition for the construction of 6- lane road at KN/TS Border to Kurnool. Acquisition of land for public purposes as defined by the NH Act 1956 is undertaken by invoking the provisions of the act with an objective to ensure a participative, informed and transparent process of speedy land acquisition of the land for the public purpose. Accordingly, the provisions of the Act authorize the government to invoke the provision s of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the concerned purpose by adhering to due compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement measures as provided in the Act of 2013. This social impact assessment is in accordance with the Act provision to assess the social im pact prior to the acquisition. The project serves the public as well as economic purpose. 0.1 Project Background The order to commence with the work was issued by office of the National Highway Authority of India, Government of India on 14.03.2018 vide letter no.: NHAI/Bharatmala/DPR/Lot- 5/Package-I/2017/114370.

This enhances the importance of this social impact assessment for the proposed site to provide a benchmark for its sustainable operation. However, there are extended arms of the act which could be looked into. The major legislation that governs the land acquisition for the present project is discussed briefly here: NH Act 1956 Land required by MORTH for National Highway projects is acquired under the provisions contained in Section 3 of the National Highways (NH) Act 1956. The Right to Fair Compen sation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, became applicable to the other related acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule, including the NH Act, 1956 w.e.f. 01.01.2015 in terms of Section 105(3) of the RFCTLARR Act of 2013. The process of land acquisition Competent authority (CALA) is defined under Section 3(a) . Under Section 3A , the Central Government may declare its intention to acquire land (defined under Section 3(b)). This notification will give a brief description of the land and shall caus e the substance of the notification to be published in two local newspapers, one of which is in vernacular language. Section 3B gives the person authorized by the Central Government, authority to conduct inspection, survey, measurement etc. Any person who is interested in the land may within 21 days from the date of publication of the notification under Section 3A, submit his objections under Section 3C . These objections have to be made to the competent authority in writing and shall state the grounds thereof. After givi ng a proper opportunity of being heard, competent authority may either allow or disallow the objections. SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freig ht movement India under Bharatmala Pariyojana CON SULTANT S Under Section 3D , if no objections have been made, or the objections have been disallowed; the competent authority may submit a report to the Central Government and on receipt of such report the government shall declare by notification in the official gazette that the land should be acquired under Section 3A. Where in respect of a land, a notification has been published under Section 3A but no declaration has been published within 1 year from the date of publication, the notification shall cease to have any effect. Section 3E has vested the power in the competent authority to issue a notice in writing, d irecting the owner as well as any other person who may be in possession of the land to surrender or deliver possession of the land to the competent authority or any other authorized person within 60 days. It also lays down the steps to be followed if the same is refused. Section 3F gives the lawful person authorized by the Central Government, authority to enter and perform other necessary acts upon the land for carrying out the building, maintenance, management or operation of the national highway or a part thereof, or any other work connected with it. Section 3G and 3H lay down the procedure for the determination and the deposit of the amount of compensation payable. Section 3I gives the competent authority certain powers of a civil court and Section 3J states that Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall not apply to the acquisition under this Act. Date of determination of market value of land With reference to the first, second and third schedule of the RFCTLARR Act, 2013, the following is clarified: All cases which have not been announced under Section 3G of the NH Act till 31.12.2014 or where such awards had been announced but compensation had not been paid in respect of the majority of the land holdings under acquisition as on 31.12.2014, the compensation would be payable in accordance with first schedule of the RFTCLARR Act, 2013. In cases where the land acquisition process was initiated and the award for compensation under Section 3G had been announced before 01.01.2015, but the full amount was not deposited with the CALA, the compensation amount would be determined in accordance with the first schedule of the RFTCLARR Act, 2013. Where the process stood complete as on or before 31.12.2014, the process would be deemed to be completed and settled. 12% on market value The proviso of Section 26 of the RFCTLARR Act stipulates that the date for the determination of the market value shall be the date of notification issued under Section 11 of the Act, which is corresponding to Section 3A of the NH Act. Similarly, Section 69(2) of the RFCTLARR Act also SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freig ht movement India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page7 SM CON SULTANT S stipulates that an additional amount has to be calculated @12% on such market value for the period commencing on and from the date of publication of the preliminary notification under Section 11 in respect of such land to the date of the award of the collector or the date of taking possession of the land, whichever is earlier. As the NH Act is exempt from the Social Impac t Assessment, it is by harmonious reading of all related provisions that the calculation of such amount shall be made w.e.f the date of publication of the notification under Section 3A of the NH Act. Furthermore, the pronouncements of the courts on payment of compensation under Section 23(1A), 23(2) and 28 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, in respect of land acquired under the NH Act r/w Section 105(3) of the RFCTLARR, show that payment of amount of 12% of the market value of land from the date of publication under Section 3A till the announcement of the award under Section 3G or taking possession of land (whichever is earlier) is payable. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 This Central Act is to ensure a humane, participative, informed and transparent process for land acquisition for development of essential infrastructural facilities, industrializat ion and urbanization with least disturbance to the owners of the land and other affected families and provide just and fair compensation to the affected families whose land has been acquired or proposed to be acquired or are affected by such acquisitions and make adequate provision for such affected persons for their rehabilitation and resettlement and for ensuring that the cumulative outcome of compulsory acquisition should be that affected persons becom e partners in development leading to an improvement in their post-acquisition social and ec onomic status and for matters connected there with. Chap ter IV, Section 11 states that \" whenever it appears to the appropriate government that land in any area is required or likely to be required for any public purpose, a notification to that effect along with details of land to be acquired shall be published in the official Gazette, two daily newspapers, uploaded on the website of appropriate government and in the affected areas to all the persons affected \" (RFCTLARR Act, Sec.11). Prior to the acquisition section 4 of the Act mandates conduct of a Social Impact Assessment study of the affected area to study the impact the project is likely to have on various components such as livelihood of affected families, public and community properties, assets and infrastructure particularly roads, public transport. Similarly, where land is acquired, fair compensation shall be paid promptly to all persons affe cted in accordance with sections 28, 29 and 30 of the Act, along the following parameters: Area of land acquired Market value of the property decided by the Collector SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freig ht movement India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page8 SM CON SULTANT S Value of things attached to land or building Damages sustained from the severance of the land parcel from the land Damages to other property in the process of acquiring the said land Consequences of changing residence or place of business by the land owners Damages from diminution of profits of the land acquired Interest paid at the rate of minimum 12% per annum on such market value for the period Commencing on and from the date of the publication of the notification of the social impact assessment study The SIA project team has undertaken Social Impact Assessment study and developed miti gation measures for those who will be affected by the proposed project. The team has adhered to the requirements of the act in the implementation of land acquisition.

While at the macroeconomic level, mobility that it confers is linked to a level of output, employment and income within a national economy, at the microeconomic level it is linked to producer, consumer and production costs. India has the 2nd largest road network in the world after the USA with a length of 58.98 lakh km. The National Highways are the economic strength of India. Their length was 1, 32,500 km in the country, besides State Highways of 1, 56,694 km (GoI, MoRTH, and Annual Report 2019 - 20). India's road network carries about 40 per cent of the total road traffic. The Government of India sanctioned 'Bhartmala Pariyojana Phase I' program on 24 Oc tober 2017 for theconstruction of 34,800 km highways at an estimated cost of Rs.5, 35,000 Crore during 2017-22 under the categories of Economic Corridor, Inter Corridor, National Corridor Efficiency Improvement, Border Road and International Connectivity, Port Connectivity and Coastal Road, Greenfield Expressway, and Balance Works of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). The target of the program is to raise National Highways connection from 300 districts to 550 districts out of the total 716 districts of the country. Greenfield expressways are being constructed on fresh undeveloped land without demolishing any structure in the certain sections of National and Economic Corridors, where traffic is exceeding 50,000 Passenger Carrying Units (PCUs).Aroun d 800 km area are being taken up under Greenfield Expressways. National Highway's Authority of India has decided to develop variou s National Hig hway corridors where the intensity of traffic has increased significantly and there is r equirement for augmentation of capacity for safe and efficient movement of traffic. The development and maintenance of NHs is a continuous process. The works on NHs are accordingly taken up depending upon priority, traffic density and availability of funds. The Ministry has taken up development of NHs/ roads under various phases of National Highways Development Project (NHDP), Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for the North East Region (SARDP- NE), Special Programme for Development of Roads in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas, National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project (NHIIP), etc. The Government of India has taken up development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors, Feeder Corridors and National Corridors to improve the efficiency of Freight Movements in India under Bharatmala Pariyojana. The corridors have been awarded to consultants for preparation of detailed project reports. SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freig ht movement India under Bharatmala Pariyojana SULTANT S KN/TS Border to Kurnool Expressway (NH 150C): The Government of India has planned to construct Greenfield 'KN /TS Border to Kurnool' Expressway under 'Bhartmala Pariyojana Phase I' program. The task has been assigned to NHAI. The Expressway will provide direct and very short-term connectivity to Chennai. It is pr oposed to start from KN/TS Border near village Nandinne in Jogulamba Gadwal district of Telangana stat e and ends at Dinnedevarapadu village in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh . It will cover length of 52.987 km in Telangana State, 24.513 km in Andhra Pradesh State. It will split into two Packages at Julakal village in Waddepally Mandal of Jogulamba Gadwal district. Package-1 from Nandinne village to Julakal village would cover the distance of around 39.3 State . Package-2 from Julakal village to Dinnedevarapadu village would cover the distance of around 38.2 km Mandal of Andhra Pradesh. This expressway will reduce the current Akkalkot - kurnool distance from 350 km to 270 km, allowing commuters to cover this distance within 3 hours.. Hence it will cut down cost with good quality infrastructure. The project will be completed by October 2023. The proposed ' KN/TS Border to Kurnool ' Expressway crosses through Jogulamba Gadwal & kurnool district, covering 31 villages and length of 77.5 km. The Project is planned as 6 lanes highway expandable to 8 lanes. The proposed Right of Way is 60 meters throughout this section. However, construction will be limited to 30 meters with exception to intersection locations, toll booth, etc. The proposed expressway is designed to serves as the main artery to transport agricultural produce from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In addition, the expressway will also reduce the physical distance and travel time. The expressway is likely to provide following benefits to the hinterland of agriculturally developed, but otherwise not very developed area that lagged behind because of lack of proper connectivity.

Sarpanch, Deputy Sarpanch, Panchayat Members, NHAI, PD along with site Engineers Research Team from S.M. Consultants were present. During the interaction, Mr. Manoj Majhi , SMC, sensitized them about the project and details of land acquisition. He also informed the families on the provisions of RFCTLARR and L A NH Act 1956 . During the interaction, it was found that most of the PAFs shown consent to the project. They were w illing for the development of the road . As the alignment is a greenfield alignment, only 2 nos. of permanent residential is being affected and rest structure is . The PAFs also discussed the poten tial positive and negative impacts of the construction of 6 lane road. 6.2 Opinion of PAPs More than 85% of the PAFs are happy with the planned road agree with this proposal for giving away their property. Whereas few of the affected families are against the proposal. A few of PAFs said th at since it is their ancestral property they don't want to give away their land. Out of the total PAFs interviewed, three PAFs said that they can't say anything regarding the project. 01020304050607080 Percentage Opinion of the PAPs Good Bad Both Can't SaySOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freight movement in India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page126 SM CON SULTANT S Figure 5: PICTURES OF PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND SITE VERIFICATIONS Consultation with DC, Gadwal, Stakeholders and Site Visit with Concerned RDO and other Stake Holders SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freight movement in India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page127 SM CON SULTANT S 6.3 Public Hearing This will be written after public hearing i.e., during 3G notification.

The SIMP consists of a set of mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures to be taken during the design, construction and operational phases of the project to eliminate adverse social impacts or to reduce them to acceptable levels. The mai n aim of the SIMP is to ensure that the various adverse impacts are mitigated and the positive impacts are enhanced. T he SIMP shall be implemented during the various stages of the project viz. pre-construction s tage, construction stage and operational stage. In compliance with NH Act 1956 and RFCTLARR Act, 2013 , the present social impact assessment was carried out with the prime objective to identify the potential socio-economic positive and negative impacts of land acquisition and to develop attainable mitigation measures to enhance positive impacts and reduce or avoid negative impacts and thereby ensure a participative, informed and transparent process of land acquisition for the construction of four lane road. 7.2 Approach to mitigation The SIA team made use of a combination of two research approaches i.e., quantitativ e and qualitative, for the identification of various social impact and the mitigation measures. Adoption of a comb ination of both qualitative and quantitative methodology was intended to obtain a more comprehensive data and more holistic result without excluding any important area of assessment. The mitigation measures proposed were arrived at through a series of interactions and discussions with different categories of stakeholders, viz., the project affected population, panchayat member, government officials of department of Reven ue. The collected information on social impact was studied and discussed internally and externally with experts in order to frame the mitigation plan. The process of such interactions culminated at framin g various measures to mitigate and avoid or reduce the impact. This chapter summarizes and presents the major social impacts both negative and positi ve and the mitigation measures to be adhered to at various stages of the project with a vision to mitigate the n egative social impact and enhance the positive ones. 7.3 Social impact The area of the SIA study which was limited to an extent of 461.681 Ha was possessed by 533 land holders. Information elicited through a multipronged strategy highlighted that most land holders were not happy with the construction of four lane road in the area identified. At the same time they expressed certain SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freight movement in India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page129 SM CON SULTANT S concerns that could affect/impact their social and economic life in the society due to the acquisition of their land. The following provides the major anticipated impacts (both positive and negative) of the propose d project which were discussed by the PAFs with the project team: 7.3.1. Positive Impact Responses highlight that with the construction of 6- lane road from KN/TS Border to Kurnool (202/900 km - 280/400 km) the people and the area will have positive impacts considering future requirements in mind. A few of the major ones cited are: (i) Increase in land price With the construction, the value of the land holdings in the entire area of villages in the Gadwal and Ku rnool district is likely to go higher. However, the PAFs were quite apprehensive whether it should be considered as positive or negative. Among the directly affected households, except two, all the others will be deprived of any land at the vicinity of the project location after acquisition. (ii) Increased road safety A few of the PAFs mentioned that it is good project for the development of people and the village. Also they shared that since the road does not pass through the village, risk of road casualities will be less. (iii) Improved Infrastructure The construction of 6 lane road will lead to the overall development of area in terms of improved infrastructure for travelling. The road will provide solution to the traffic congestions that might affect the area in longer run. (iv) Reduction in pollution The construction of 6 lane road will lead to reduction of pollution in the area. Proper road will lead to free flow of traffic, thereby decreasing fuel consumption . (v) Increase in road access and connectivity The road after this project will enhance connectivity of the village to other nearby areas. 7.3.2. Negative Impact The acquisition of land which is agriculture and non-agricultural in nature, the land holders who are affected stated the following impacts which will negatively affect their lives. The negativ e impacts indicated are mentioned below: (i) Impact on livelihood (Loss of source of income) Among the land holders in the project area few households reported that they had commercial structure on land and that is the only source of income for the family. Accordingly, acquisition of their land total ROW of 45 m will permanently take away a source of their income. In consonance with the above, few of them stated that they would be deprived of a source of earning resulting in a decrease in their income. SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freight movement in India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page130 SM CON SULTANT S (ii) Impact on Land The road construction will make the land infertile forever. (iii) Impact on Physical resources (Loss of assets) The respondents during conducting survey questionnaire and personal interviews reported los s of trees, bore wells, compound wall, part of the industrial premise, commercial shops, drainage system etc in their land at the project site. Details of complete infrastructure is provided in land assessment chapter. (iv) Impact on common public resources Table 12: Overall Summary of Impacts Impact Negative/ positive Direct/ Indirect Temporary /permanent Major/Minor Increased road safety for vehiles Positive Direct Permanent Major Increase in land price Positive Direct Permanent Major Reduction in pollution Positive Direct Permanent Major Increase in road access and connectivity Positive Direct Permanent Major Impact on ancestral property, Houses, Shops and others Negative Direct Permanent Minor Loss of a source of income for PAF Negative Direct Permanent Major Depletion of water source Negative Direct Permanent Major Loss of trees present in the project site Negative Direct Permanent Major Water flooding Negative Direct Temporary Major All the impacts will have permanent/temporary effect on the lives of people. 7.4 Impact Mitigation/Mitigation Plan Based on the desk review, field investigations and consultations undertaken during the social impact assessment study towards the construction of the 6 lane road, the following Social Impact Mi tigation Plan (SIMP) has been developed to mitigate negative social impact that may arise from the same at Gadwal and Kurnool district. Environment degradation, social impact, and economic loss were found to be the neg ative impacts of the project. In this regards, the following mitigation measures an be adopted: 7.4.1 Economic measure a) The most significant social impact through the construction of the project at the present location i s the loss of land for 533 households and their dependents spread over given survey number. Loss of property and the assets due to acquisition of land for the construction of 6-lane road from KN/TS-Ku rnool (202/900 km - 280/400 km) should be compensated as mandated by the NH Act 1956. b) The residential settlements can be rehabilitated at preferred location of PAF. 7.4.2 Environmental Measures a) To minimize the impact on the environment due to the loss of trees it is suggested that the proponent should ensure that more number of trees are planted at the project area. SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT Consultancy Services for Preparation of DPR for development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes to improve the efficiency of freight movement in India under Bharatmala Pariyojana (LOT-5)\" Page131 SM CON SULTANT S b) The proponent can and should ensure that the water resources available at the project site are maintained and preserved so that these resources can be used to meet the water needs of the area. c) Check on vehicular emission and CFCs should be done d) Sprinkling of Water Shall be carried out regularly at site to reduce the air pollution during the construction phase 7.4.3 Rehabilitation Measures There are very few nearly 2 residential households and construction establishments at the project si te. Some of the PAFs were willing to provide land in lieu of another land in the village. However, they were also of the view that no such land is available in the village. Hence, if possible s uch measure should be undertaken. Table 13: Mitigation Measures Impact Impact Proposed Mitigation Loss of Property (Land) NH Act 1956 Loss of Property (Residential and commercial) Compensation as per NH Act 1956 & RTFCTLARR Act, 2013 Loss of Assets (borewell, etc.) Compensation as per NH Act 1956 & RTFCTLARR Act, 2013 Loss of source of income Compensation as per NH Act 1956 & RTFCTLARR Act, 2013 Impact on water source Incorporate water sources in order to meet and 7.5 Measures to Avoid, Mitigate and compensate The Proponent should ensure that preventive measures are taken to address the issues. A redressal sys tem may be set up with representatives from Revenue department, Panchayat and the proponent for the speedy settlement of the unanticipated issues that may crop up during various stages of the project. Comparing/weighing the positive against the negative impacts, it can be easi ly concluded that the former outweigh the latter reaffirming the identified site as the most suitable and apt one for the construction of 6-lane road from KN/TS-Kurnool (202/900 km - 280/400 km). It is observed that although the landholders for sure lose the land, their quality of life is less likely to get affected as they mainly depended on employment/business as the major means of livelihood. The loss of asset which is ancestral for most will have its negative impact physically and psychologically. Yet, analyzing the impacts it is in ferred that there is few displacement of households at Kurnool and on the other the negative impact on land, livelihood, physical resources, public facilities or culture are comparatively lesser or minimum. It is also observed by the SIA team that many of the negative impacts highlighted above can be minimized or red uced further with appropriate and effective mitigation measures/strategies mentioned above.

In the following section, a detailed analysis of benefits and respective costs are presented. 8.2 Assessment of Public Purpose The construction of six lane road will help in reducing the traffic congestion on the existing road accommodating the growing business establishment in the coming years. Howev er, the project will also prove fruitful for the PAFs and people of nearby villages in terms of job opportunity/ employment or even new businesses. 8.3 Benefits from the project The construction of road shall provide various benefits to the society in the vicinity. It will enhance economic development, provide employment opportunities to locals, strengthen tourist development, ensure road safety, and provide better transportation facilities and other facilities such as way side amenities. Vehicle operating cost will also be reduced due to improved road quality. The propos ed road- greenfield project will ensure the smooth flow of traffic, which will reduce the emissions and noise level. The compensatory plantation and roadside plantation done will further improve the air quality of the region. 8.4 Impacts on structures and its magnitude People of the village have sentiments attached to their land a nd property ,don't want the same to be affected in land acquisition process. The total land to be acquired by the land acquisition department is 461.681 Ha and will have very low impact on the structures. 8.5 Determinants of Compensation As per NH Act 1956, the CALA shall adopt following criteria to assess and determine the market value of land and amount of compensation. Market value specified in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, for the registrat ion of sale deeds or agreement to sell where land is situated, the average sale price of similar type of land situated in the nearest village or nearest vicinity can be considered but when asked by the SIA team, three transaction / sales of property document were not made available, therefore circle rates as available and compensation as per LA NH Act 1956 shall apply.

Market value specified in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, for the registration of sale deeds or agreement to sell where land is situated, The average sale price of similar type of land situated in the nearest village or nearest vicinity, Consented amount of compensation as agreed upon under 3G in case of acquisition of lands, R& R package as per RFCTLARR-2013 The basic principles governing compensation structure are shown in the table:- Table 14: Basic Principles Governing Compensation Structure S. No Category of Impact Eligibility for Entitlement Relevant NH ACT 1956 & RTFCTLARR Act 2013 1 Loss of Land Title holder Market value of land. This will be determined as per Sections of NH Act 1956 by CALA. Amount equivalent to current stamp duty and registration charges on Compensation amount for replacement of lost assets As per NH Act 1956 Affected family/person Land 2 Loss of other immovable Assets Title Holder Value of Assets attached to land or building This will be provided to affected families as per the RTFCTLARR Act 2013 (provision under First Schedule Sl.No.2 (ref. Section 29 of the said Act). 8.7 Criteria for compensation based on Quality of Soil/ Land As the land trade/ transactions have been happening among every community in the area, PAPs have thei r own view about the amount they have to get as compensation. As per PAPs the market rate of the land he should be compensated minimum four times the market rate of the land plus property value of houses if the same is being acquired. However, when CALA was approached, they have shared that the rate of lands are fixed as per the classification of the land /soil. 7.8 Cost estimation of Land On the basis of discussion with the public, the cost estimation for the compensation will be based on circ le rates and will greatly vary once the actual loss of physical assets is evaluated. Therefore, the concerned CALA has to assess the actual. The final compensation should be decided with NOC wit h the PAFs and as per the NH Act 1956.

MITIGATIONS & REHABILITATION OF BORROW AREAS The soils to be used, as sub-grade, select sub-grade and shoulder materials need to be hauled from designated borrow areas. Similar to the identification of suitable quarries, suitable borrow areas for supply of soil to the new road formation were also identified. Based on the total requirement and availa bility of each soil type, estimates of soil quantity to be obtained from each of the borrow areas were worked out in accordance with IRC: 10-1961: Recommended Practice for Borrow Pits for Road Embankments construc ted by Manual Operation. In the selection of the borrow areas, care was taken to ensure that: Sufficient quantity of suitable soil is available from the borrow areas; The borrow areas are as close to the project road as possible; The loss of productive and fertile agricultural soil is minimum; and There is minimum loss of vegetation. For opening new borrow areas other than those identified the consultant shall follow above section. The borrowing shall not be carried out in cultivable lands, unless and until, it shall be agreed upon by the Consultant that there is no suitable uncultivable land in the vicinity for borrowing, or there are p rivate land owners willing to allow borrowing on their fields. REHABILITATION Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 4 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. The objective of the rehabilitation programme is to return the borrow pit sites to a s afe and secure area, which the general public should be able to safely enter and enjoy. Securing borrow pits sites in a stable condition should be a fundamental requirement of the rehabilitation process. This could be achieved by filling the borrow pit floor to approximately the access road level. It is important to plan restoration from the outset and coordinate restoration activities. In addition to the bio- diversity issues, land planning considerations are also taken into account when defining a rehabilita tion project in order both to preserve the environment and to generate income for the local communities. In this framework rehabilitation often leads to the creation of wetlands and or recreation areas. Special borrow pit rehabilitation plan shall be specified according to the location and shaping of the mining slopes after exploitation and overburdened dump, with different subsequent uses e.g. forest, mea dow, water body etc., the re-greening and replanting methods.. Other criteria which shall be followed for rehabilitation of quarry/ borrow pits are as given below: Borrow pits can be backfilled with rejected construction wastes except bitumen and will be given a vegetative cover. If this is not possible, then slopes will be smoothed and depressio n will be filled in such a way that it looks more or less like the original ground surface. During works execution, the Contractor/Concessionaire shall ensure preservation of trees du ring piling of materials; spreading of stripping material to facilitate water percolation and allow natural vegetation growth; re-establishment of previous natural drainage flows; improvement of site appearance; digging of ditches to collect runoff; and maintenance of roadways where a pit or quarry is declared useable water source for livestock or people nearby. Once the wor ks are completed, and at own expense the Contractor/Concessionaire shall restore the environment around the work s ite to its original splits. Appropriate plant species for the planting programme have to be selected in consultation with ecological consultant and local state forest department. Depending on the limitations on the availability of appropriate plant material, harsh growing conditions (lack of irrigation and hot summer) and ongoing quarry rehabilitation operations there may be substantial loss of plantation and the planting programme may have to be continued for over 3 -5 years. As plantings are progressively established they should be monitored before undertaking the next stage to ensure maximum plant survival rates. The borrow pit immediate surroundings shall be developed as a low maintenance reserve, with significant areas of native trees and shrubs and areas of longer grass and tussoc ks forming the open spaces. Walkways around the borrow site may be constructed. Provision for a f uture drive-in picnic area and car parking area may be developed.

Annexure 5.4: Guidelines for Identification of Debris Disposal Sites & Precautions Guidelines for identification The locations of dumping sites have to be selected such that: No residential areas are located downwind side of these locations, Dumping sites are located at least 1000 m away from forest areas and water bodies Dumping sites do not contaminate any water sources, rivers etc. Dumping sites have adequate capacity equal to the amount of debris generated. Public perception about the location of debris disposal site has to be obtained before finalizing the location. Precautions to be adopted during Dumping of Debris / Waste Material The Contractor/Concessionaire shall take the following precautions while disposing off the waste material During the site clearance and disposal of debris, the Contractor/Concessionaire will take full c are to ensure that public or private properties are not damaged / affected and that the traffic is not interrupted. The Contractor/Concessionaire will dispose of debris only to the identified places only with prior permission of the Environmental Specialist and the Consultant. Contractor can also dispose of the debris for the improvements in public utilities after the proper consent of villagers and approval of Environmental Specialist and the Consultant. In the event of any spoil or debris from the sites being deposited on any adjacent land, the Contractor/Concessionaire will immediately remove all such spoil debris and restore the affec ted area to its original state to the satisfaction of the Environmental Specialist and the Consultant. The Contractor/Concessionaire will at all times ensure that the entire existing strea m courses and drains within and adjacent to the site are kept safe and free from any debris. The Contractor/Concessionaire will utilise effective water sprays during the delivery and handling of materials when dust is likely to be created and to dampen stored materials during dry and windy weather. Materials having the potential to produce dust will not the loaded to a level higher than the side and tail boards and will be covered with a tarpaulin in good condition. During disposal of debris, proper warning signs to be installed to the satisfaction of Environ mental Specialist and the Consultant. Any diversion required for traffic during disposal of debris shall be provided w ith traffic control signals and barriers after the discussion with local people and with the permission of Environmen tal Specialist and the Consultant. During the debris disposal, contractor will take care of surrounding features and avoid any damage to it. While disposing debris / waste material, the Contractor/Concessionaire will take into account the wind direction and location of settlements to ensure against any dust problems. Adequate arrangements will be made to ensure that the debris / waste material is disposed off ne arest to the designated dumping site. The report on this activity shall be prepared regularly by Environmenta l Specialist and the Consultant.

In cases where a dumpsite is near to the local village community settlements, it could be converted into a play field by spreading the dump material evenly on the ground. Such playground could be made coherent with the landscape by planting trees all along the periphery of the playground. Some of the dumpsites could be used either for plantation or for growing agricultural produce. Care should always be taken to maintain the hydrological flow in the area. Quarries The Contactor/Concessionaire shall use materials from the existing and licensed quarry ar eas only. In case any new quarries are opened by the Contactor/Concessionaire, he shall secure permissions for the same and shall follow the rehabilitation plan. The objective of the rehabilitation programme is to return the quarry sites to a saf e and secure area, which the general public should be able to safely enter and enjoy. Securing quarry sites in a stable condition should be a fundamental requirement of the rehabilitation process. This could be achieved by filling the quarry / quarry floor to approximately the access road level. It is important to plan restoration from the outset and coordinate restoration with quarrying activities. In addition to the bio-diversity issues, land planning considerations are also taken into account w hen defining a rehabilitation project in order both to preserve the environment and to generate income for the local communities. In this framework quarry rehabilitation often leads to the creation of wetlands and natural reserves or recreation areas. Special quarry / quarry rehabilitation plan should be specified according to the location and shaping of the mining slopes after exploitation and overburdened dump, with different subsequent uses e.g. fore st, meadow, water body etc., and the re-greening and replanting methods. Other criteria which should be followed for rehabilitation of quarry sites are as given below: Quarries will be backfilled with rejected construction wastes and will be given a vegetative c over. If this is not possible, then slopes will be smoothed and depression will be filled in such a w ay that it looks more or less like the original ground surface. During works execution, the Contactor/Concessionaire shall ensure preservation of trees during piling of materials; spreading of stripping material to facilitate water percolation and allow natural vegetation growth; reestablishment of previous natural drainage flows; improvement of site appearance; digging of ditches to collect runoff; and maintenance of roadways where a pit or quarry is de clared useable water source for livestock or people nearby. Once the works are completed, and at own expens e the Contactor/Concessionaire shall restore the environment around the work site to its original splits. To create a safe environment under the terms of The Mines and Quarries Act the f aces have to be reduced to a naturally stable slope or be adequately fenced to prevent access to the top and botto m of the faces. Such a fence must be of a height as prescribed under The Mines A ct with a barbed wire top strand designed to exclude the public from the quarry area. Depending on the location of the site presence of a permanent lake is considered to be a satisfactory alternative to a fence.

Annexure 5.6: Guidelines for Sediment Control All materials shall meet commercial grade standards and shall be approved by the Engineer before being used in the work. CONSTRUCTION STAGE Prior to the start of the relevant construction, the Contractor/Concessionaire shall s ubmit to the Consultant for approval, his schedules for carrying out temporary and permanent erosion / se dimentation control works as are applicable for the items of clearing and grubbing, roadway and drainage excavation, e mbankment / sub-grade construction, bridges and other structures across water courses, pav ement courses and shoulders. The Contractor/Concessionaire shall also submit for approval his proposed method of er osion / sedimentation control on service road and quarries and his plan for disposal of waste materials. Work shall not be started until the erosion / sedimentation control schedules and methods of operations for the applicable' construction have been approved by the Consultant. The surface area of erodible earth material exposed by clearing and grubbing, excavation, quarry and fill operations shall be limited to the extent practicable. The Contractor/Concessionaire may be dir ected to provide immediate control measures to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation that will adversely aff ect construction operations, damage adjacent properties, or cause contamination of nearby streams or other watercourses. Such work may involve the construction of temporary berms, dikes, sediment basins, slope drains and use of temporary mulches, fabrics, mats, seeding, or other control devices or me thods as necessary to control erosion and sedimentation. The Contractor/Concessionaire shall be required to incorporate all permanent erosion a nd sedimentation control features into the project at the earliest practicable time as outlined in his ac cepted schedule to minimize the need for temporary erosion and sedimentation control measures. Temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures will be used to control the phenomenon of erosion, sedimentation and pollution that may develop during normal construction practices, but may neither be foreseen daring design stage nor associated with permanent control features on the Project. Where erosion or sedimentation is likely to be a problem, clearing and grubbing operations should be so scheduled and performed that grading operations and permanent erosion or sedimentation control fea tures can follow immediately thereafter if the project conditions permit; otherwise temporary eros ion or sedimentation control measures may be required between successive construction stages. U nder no conditions shall a large surface area of credible earth material be exposed at one time by clearing and grubbing or excavation without prior approval of the Environmental Specialist. The Consultant may limit the area of excavation, quarry and embankment operations in progress, commensurate with the Contractor's/Concessionaire's capability a nd progress in keeping the finish grading, mulching, seeding and other such permanent erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures, in accordance with the accepted schedule.

Temporary erosion is sometimes caused due to the Contractor's/Conce ssionaire's negligence, carelessness or failure to install permanent controls. Sedimentation and pollution control measures then become ne cessary as a part of the work as scheduled or ordered by the monitoring consultant, and these shall be carr ied out at the Contractor's/Concessionaire's own expense. Temporary erosion, sedime ntation and pollution control work required, whi ch is not attributed to the Contractor's/Concessionaire's neglige nce, carelessness or failure to install permanent control, will be performed as per the need. Temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control may include construction work outside the right of way where such work is necessary as a result of road construction such as quarry operations, service roads and equipment storage sites. The temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control features installed by the Contractor's/Concessionaire's shall be maintained by him till these are needed, unl ess otherwise agreed by the Consultant.

Annexure 5.7: Tree Plantation strategy 1. INTRODUCTION Due to the proposed development, some of the existing trees are to be felled. To o ffset this impact, compensatory afforestation programme through tree plantation, median plantation, horticulture and landscaping strategy has been prepared, based upon the experiences of successful implemen tation of a number of ongoing and completed projects. 2. OBJECTIVE The main objectives are as follows: Reducing the impacts of air pollution Natural noise barrier Arrest of land erosion Providing much needed shade during the day time Prevention of vehicle glare from vehicles coming from opposite direction Enhancement of aesthetic view of the corridors Climatic amelioration Defining of ROW especially at sharp curves during night 3. SPECIES SELECTION Grasses, shrubs and trees are the main species that are readily available in India. Where possible, the use of non-native species should be avoided since they can out compete and displace native plants leading to loss of native biodiversity. To maximise the chances of success, one should try to select species w hose growing conditions roughly match the environmental conditions of the project site. Care should also be taken to sele ct species with root systems that match the nature of the soil movement at the project site. Homogenous avenues of trees should be selected for long stretches as it provides aesthetic qualities in the lands caping. One should also take into account the economic and other social benefits while selecting the species for plantation. During the selection of species preference should be given towards rapid growing an d pest and disease resistant species. Shrub species, which are dwarf and pollution hardy, are to be planted in the median to prevent the glare of traffic moving in opposite direction. Flowering, ornamentals plants and climber s can also be planted in urban areas to provide beauty. For this purpose the species may be decide d by interaction with local authority and local populace. Few species has also been recommended in the report under sec tion 7.2.2. 4. TASKS OF THE CONTRACTOR/CONCESSIONAIRE As part of this project implementation, the contractor/concessionaire shall plant and maintain flowering, shade, medicinal, ornamental & fruit bearing trees in suitable area for which cost has been budge ted besides planting and maintenance of ornamental, medicinal & flowering plants and shrubs in the median fo r which cost has also been budgeted. The specific roles and responsibilities of the Contractor/Concessionaire include: Identification of the plantation stretches with NHAI and or Consultant. Identification of nursery area and preparation of nurseries Planting of saplings in the nurseries during the construction period so that the saplings are a minimum 24 months old Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 3 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd.

If the side of the below, it shall be replaced with the soil mixture as specified further her ein. If the soil is normal it shall be mixed with manure; river sand shall be added to the soil if it is heavy. The bottom of the pit shall be forked to break up the subsoil. 5.3.3. Back Filling The soil back filled watered through end gently pressed down, a day previous to planting, to make su re that it may not further settle down after planting. The soil shall be pressed down firmly by tr eading it down, leaving a shallow depression all-round for watering. 5.3.4. Planting No tree pits shall be dug until final tree position has been pegged out for approval. Car e shall be taken that the plant sapling when planted is not be buried deeper than in the nursery, or in the pot. Planting should not be carried out in waterlogged soil. Plant trees at the original soil depth; soil marks on the stem is an indication of this and should be maintained on the finished level, allowing for setting of the soil after planting. All plastic and other imperishable containers should be removed before planting. Any broken or damage roots should be cut back to sound growth. The bottom of the planting pit should be covered with 50mm to 75mm of soil. Bare roots should be s pread evenly in the planting pit; and small mound in the centre of the pits on which the roots are placed will aid on even spread. Soil should be placed around the roots, gently shaking the tree to allow the soil particles to shift into the root system to ensure close contact with all roots and prevent air pockets Back fill soil should be firmed as filling proceeds, layer by layer, care being taken to avoid damaging the roots. The balance earth shall be filled in a mixture of 1:3 (1 part sludge to 3 part earth by volume) and 50gms potash, (Mop) 50gms of Super Phosphate and 1 Kg. Neem oil cake. Aldrin or equivalent shall be applied every 15 days in a mixture of 5ml in 5 litres of water. 5.3.5. Staking Newly planted trees must be held firmly although not rigidly by staking to prevent a pocket forming around the stem and newly formed fibrous roots being broken by mechanical pulling as the tree rocks. The main methods of staking shall be: A single vertical shake, 900mm longer than the clear stem of the tree, driven 600mm to 900mm into the soil. Two stakes as above driven firmly on either side of the tree with a cross ba r to which the stem is attached. Suitable for bare- rooted or Ball material. A single stake driven in at an angle at 45 degrees and leaning towards the prevailing wind, the stem just below the lowest branch being attached to the stake. Suitable for small bare- rooted or Ball material For plant material 3m to 4.5m high with a single stem a three- wire adjustable guy system may be used in exposed situations. The end of stake should be pointed and the lower 1 m to 1.2m should be coated with a non-injurious woo d preservative allowing at least 150mm above ground level. 5.3.6. Tying Each tree should be firmly secured to the stake so as to prevent excessive moveme nt. Abrasion must be avoided by using a buffer, rubber or Hessian, between the tree and stake. The tree should be secured at a point just below its lowest branch, and also just above ground level: normally two ties should be used for tree. These should be adjusted or replaced to allow for growth. 5.3.7. Watering Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 6 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. The Contractor/Concessionaire through the Landscape Contractor should allow for the adequa te watering in of all newly planted trees and shrubs immediately after planting and he shall during the following growing season, keep the plant material well-watered 5.3.8. Fertilising Fertilising shall be carried out by application in rotation of the following fertilisers, every 15 day s from the beginning of the monsoon till the end of winter: Sludge or organic well-rotted dry farm yard manure: 0.05 cum or tussle. Urea 25gm. Ammonium sulphate 25gm. Potassium sulphate 25gm. All shrubs, which are supplied pot grown, shall be well soaked prior to planting. Watering in and subsequent frequent watering of summer planted container- grown plants is essential. 5.4. Shrub Planting In Planter Beds All areas to be planted with shrubs shall be excavated, trenched to a depth of 750mm, refilling the excavated earth after breaking clods and mixing with sludge in ratio 8:1 (8 parts of stacked volume of ear th after reduction by 20%: 1 part of stacked volume of sludge after reduction by 8%.) Tall shrubs may need staking, which shall be provided if approved by the Contracting-consulting engineer, depending upon the conditions of individual plant specimen. For planting shrubs and ground cover shrubs in planters, good earth shall be mixed with sludge in the proportion as above and filled in planters. Positions of planters shall be planted should be marked out in accordance with the Design drawings. W hen shrubs are set out, precautions should be taken to prevent roots drying. Planting holes 40cm diameter and 40cm deep should be excavated for longer shrubs. Polythene and other non-perishable containers should be removed and any badly damaged roots carefully pruned. The shrubs should then be se t in holes so that the soil level after settlement will be original soil mark on the stem of the shrub. The holes should be back filled to half of its depth and firmed by treading. The remainder of the soil can then be returne d and again firmed by treading. 5.5. Grassing 5.5.1. Preparation During period prior to planting, the ground shall be maintained free from weeds. Grading and preparation o f the area shall be completed at least three weeks prior to the actual sowing. Regular w atering shall be continued until sowing by dividing the area into portions of approximately 5m squares by construc ting small bunds to retain water. These 'bunds' shall be levelled just prior to sowing of grass pla nts; it shall be ensured that the soil has completely settled. 5.5.2. Soil The soil itself shall be ensured to the satisfaction of Environmental Specialist Consultant to be a good fibrous loam, rich in humus. 5.5.3. Sowing the grass roots Grass lines will be used to provide a strong surface cover and will be planted over a well prepared surface. Slope treatments using grasses will be allowed to establish properly such that the slopes are no t subject to undue stress from erosion and mass movement in its initial stages. The sowing of grasses will create a strengthened surface that will reduce the vulnerability to erosion. Median with a width of 1.5 m will have only grasses to strengthen the surface. The Contractor/Concessionaire will ensure that th e condition of the site is Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 7 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. good enough for the successful establishment of grasses. Grass roots shall be obtained from a grass patch, seen and approved beforehand. The grass root s stock received at site shall be manually cleared of all weeds and water sprayed over the same after keeping the stock in place protected from sun and dry winds. Grass stock received at site may be s tored for a maximum of three days. In case grassing for some areas is scheduled for a later date fresh stock of grass roots shall be ordered and obtained. 5.5.4. Execution Small roots shall be dibbled about 5cms apart into the prepared grounds. Grass will only be acce pted as reaching practical completion when germination has proved satisfactory and all weeds have been re moved.

Annexure 5.8: Conceptual Drawing for Roadside Signage - Wildlife Annexure 5.9: Traffic Control and Safety during Construction Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 2 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. Annexure 5.9: Traffic Control and Safety during Construction A. TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The traffic on roads has increased manifold and most of the roads are expec ted to operate at their maximum capacity in the near future. Under the circumstances, the existing methods of maintenance and c onstruction which compromise safety and cause delay are no longer acceptable and a change in wor k procedures and method has become inevitable. Under the existing method of maintenance and reconstruction, the traffic is invariably diverted over unprepared shoulders or forced to use part of the existing roads under ma intenance. This results in the increase in vehicle operating cost and reduction in safety besides causing enviro nmental pollution. Therefore, the existing work procedure and contract conditions are required to be changed to provide for proper management of traffic during the execution of work. The traffic management strategies to be used at traffic control zones must include the following fundamental principles: (i) Make traffic safety an integral and high priority element of every project (ii) Avoid inhibiting traffic as much as possible (iii) Guide drivers in a clear and positive way (iv) Perform routine inspection of traffic control elements and traffic operations (v) Give care and attention to roadside safety B. TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES The primary traffic control devices used in work zones are signs, delineators, barricades, cones, pylons, pavement markings and flashing lights. The following general rules should apply to all traffic cont rol devices within the traffic control zone. (i) Comprehension: All traffic control devices should be capable of being easily understood. A par ticular device must convey one and only one meaning. Good and clean condition of the device aids comprehension. (ii) Visibility and Stability: Devices should be within the cone of vision of the driver and be placed s uch that it allows adequate time at the average approach speed or the desired speed through the traffic control zone. All traffic control devices should be clearly visible by day and night, at these speeds and under the usually prevailing climatic conditions. They should be kept properly aligned and legible at all times. Foliage or any other obstruction should not be allowed to impede the view of these devices, nor should wind, road dirt or the like be allowed to obscure their face. The traffic control devices must be able to resist the local wind pressure, rain and the vibrations etc. of the passing traffi c but these should not act as rigid obstacles in the event of a collision; (iii) Installation and Removal: All traffic control devices should be installed for the minimum re quired time. Traffic control devices by their nature are a hindrance to the normal traffic flow and should be removed immediately after the need, being met by these is fulfilled. Existing devices like signs or lane markings should be removed during the temporary works and reinstated thereafter or covered whil e the temporary devices are in operation. The installation and removal of the temporary traff ic control devices and the reinstatement of the pre-existing or new (where the scheme improves the road) traf fic control devices must, therefore, be meticulously supervised to ensure the minimum period whe n there are no signs or markings C. SIGNS Development Greenfield Highway from KN/TS boarder near Nandinne village (Ch: 202+900) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report Proponent: National Highways Authority of India 3 Date & Version: June 2021 , Version 1 EIA Consultant: Mantras Green Resources Ltd. The road construction and maintenance signs fall into the same three major categories as do other traffic signs, that is Regulatory Signs, Warning Signs and Direction (or Guidance) Signs. The IRC: 67 (Code of Practice for Road Signs) provides a list of traffic signs. Where possible, the size, colours and placement of sign shall conform to IRC: 67. This also covers signs that are not included in IRC : 67 but are considered desirabl e to aid drivers' comprehension of the route through the road works. Each sign should be well located so that its message is seen and is clear, which will be assisted if the surroundings are devoid of \"unnecessary\" signs and other clutter. These signs shou ld be of retroreflective sheets of high intensity grade or engineering grade depending upon the importance of the road as directed by the Engineer.
